<P>
   Like all parents, European politicians were this week proudly
showing off their new baby. The birth of the euro, Europe's single
currency, was superbly smooth. How strong the new currency was,
they boasted, as it crept up against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the world's focus on the euro makes it easy to miss an even
bigger currency development.
</P>
<P>
   The slide in the dollar against the yen could, if it persists,
have serious consequences for the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the dollar's fall is bizarre. Japan's economy is
depressed; America's is booming. But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell below YEN 110 this week, after Eisuke
Sakakibara, a top Japanese official, suggested that the American
economy looked ``bubble-like.'' Who better to judge than the
Japanese? They experienced a bubble themselves in the late 1980s _
with severe economic costs ever since.
</P>
<P>
   America's record-breaking expansion has been overly dependent on
unsustainable forces, leaving the economy with an overvalued stock
market, a negative personal-savings rate, and a big current-account
deficit that will entail almost $300 billion-worth of foreign
borrowing this year.
</P>
<P>
   The three are linked: cheap money and surging shares have
encouraged consumers to save less and to spend more; rampant
spending has sucked in imports, swelling the current-account
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar has shrugged off the deficit over the past few years
as foreign savings have flooded into America.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the dollar's strength has not only made American assets
appear more attractive to foreign investors; it has also helped to
hold down inflation and has lent support to the theory that America
was undergoing an economic miracle that justified ever rising share
prices. The snag is that virtuous circles can easily turn vicious.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, foreign investors will no longer be prepared to
finance America's current-account hole. That leaves the economy
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in corporate investment or sagging consumer spending
could make shares collapse, in turn hitting consumer and business
spending even harder; a simultaneously tumbling dollar might prompt
the Fed to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The world would suffer too: an American recession would not only
dent global growth, it would also encourage protectionist pressures
at home.
</P>
<P>
   While America is saving too little and spending too much, Japan
has the opposite problem: it is saving too much and spending too
little.
</P>
<P>
   The way to correct these imbalances is not through massive
exchange-rate movements of the sort that might be under way, but by
policy changes in both Japan and the United States. Indeed, recent
exchange-rate swings are a signal that current policies are flawed.
</P>
<P>
   To reflate its sick economy, the Bank of Japan needs to print
massive quantities of money. By fostering the expectation of future
inflation, that might get consumers to start spending again.
</P>
<P>
   In America, by contrast, monetary policy has been too loose over
the past couple of years. If interest rates had been raised earlier
to check the stock market and to curb the growth in consumer
spending, America's economy might now be in better balance.
</P>
<P>
   True, the fragile state of the world economy argues against a
rise in American rates right now; but in retrospect the Fed was
probably wrong to cut rates so eagerly last year. The bubble will
eventually burst anyway, but it would have been better to prick it
sooner at the cost of a mild recession than to risk a deeper
recession later.
</P>
<P>
   In the medium term, the beneficiary of dollar weakness may be
the euro, not the yen.
</P>
<P>
   This is already generating fears that it might make European
exports uncompetitive. So many European (and even some Japanese)
politicians have been floating the notion of target zones to
stabilize the world's three big currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Such zones would oblige central banks to set interest rates to
keep their currencies within fixed bands.
</P>
<P>
   All central banks, including the European Central Bank, take
account of the exchange rate when setting interest rates. An
appreciation is equivalent to a tightening of monetary conditions _
it reduces growth and pushes down prices _ and may justify lower
interest rates, and vice versa. But going further and setting
precise targets for exchange rates would be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   If the target zones were too narrow they would quickly break
down; or, worse, they might undermine the overriding goal of price
stability. If they were too broad, they would be irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and central bankers should focus on getting their
policies right _ leaving currencies, even new ones, to crawl, sink
or swim. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THEY saved the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to save the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Not from the labor mess, from owners vs. players, from talk of
salary caps, percentage of basketball-related income or
middle-class exceptions. Fans have long grown accustomed to the
bickering between whining millionaires and greedy billionaires.
It's just an ugly fact of life these days in all sports, like
personal seat licenses, the $6 cup of beer and the $7 shriveled hot
dog.
</P>
<P>
   The more troubling problems facing the self-proclaimed world
game of the new millennium have to do with the game and the players
in it, both of which have become increasingly easy to dislike.
</P>
<P>
   In short, much of the hard work of the past two decades, when
commissioner David Stern's marketing genius enabled the NBA's
popularity to soar like a rocket, is in danger of crashing and
burning from the weight of its success.
</P>
<P>
   What used to be a street game, dictated by deep rhythms of the
soul, free and flowing like a jazz riff, has become sanitized,
homogenized and anesthetized from a combination of corporate
packaging and blatant overcoaching by a group of runway models in
designer suits trying to justify their large salaries and clothing
endorsement deals.
</P>
<P>
   What at one time captured our imaginations with its fast pace,
free form and expressions of individuality on the court has become
too often an exercise in brute strength and mind-numbing sameness.
It is like going to the circus for all of its different sights,
sounds and colors and getting a gray tug of war between elephants.
</P>
<P>
   With the rarest exceptions from the transcendent moves of
Michael Jordan and the still-dazzling footwork of Hakeem Olajuwon,
the games _ when you strip away the wiggling dancers, furry mascots
and indoor fireworks _ are too often unwatchable.
</P>
<P>
   There are not nearly enough fast breaks and improvisations from
the world's greatest athletes. There are far too many
thrust-and-parry mind games in a two- and three-man offense, where
half a team stands off to one side, away from the ball, pointing
and arguing over who is playing an illegal zone defense. Who cares
if it will do anything at all to loosen up an NBA that looks like
it's being played in a corset?
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are exerting too much control on the game, calling
every play on every possession, keeping offenses on a choking
leash, stifling the artistry that used to separate the NBA from
other sports. What's next? Point guards wearing helmets and getting
instructions radioed from the bench?
</P>
<P>
   The game needs the players. The players need freedom. But the
players are also a large part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people don't like them.
</P>
<P>
   They don't like reading or hearing about Allen Iverson's posse,
his latest legal scuffle or that he doesn't respect anybody or
anything that came before him in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   They don't like listening to Kenny Anderson cry over having to
give up one of his eight cars during the lockout. They don't like
punks named Isaiah Rider missing practices, Robert Horry throwing
towels at his coach or Latrell Sprewell choking his coach. They
don't like crotch-grabbing, trash-talking Dennis Rodman kicking
cameramen or Shawn Kemp leaving illegitimate children like bread
crumbs from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   They definitely don't like Kevin Garnett, just two years out of
high school, telling his team to stuff a $100 million contract
offer, threatening to jump to another city and then claiming it
never was about money.
</P>
<P>
   Fans like Jordan, but he'll be gone soon. If not immediately in
this truncated season, then in the near future, and the NBA has not
identified a new torch-bearer to carry the flame. Olajuwon, Karl
Malone, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley are
graybeard short-timers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA would like to sell Grant Hill as the next best thing,
but his team doesn't seem to get better. Shaq mumbles. Penny
Hardaway always seems to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Magic Johnson, no Larry Bird, no Isiah Thomas, no
Jordan, none of the standard-bearers from the magical '80s who
built the modern NBA by being individually brilliant and yet
committed to their teams. They played their whole careers with the
same franchises. They didn't complain about salaries. They played
hard, loved the game and nurtured it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the league is filled with takers, users, spoiled young
pseudo-stars who are sucking the marrow from a withering game.
</P>
<P>
   Saving the season was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Saving the soul of the NBA will be much, much harder.

   The two aging Khmer Rouge leaders had a message for their
countrymen. ``Let bygones be bygones,'' said Khieu Samphan, head of
state between 1975 and 1979, when the savage rule of the Khmers
Rouges over Cambodia resulted in nearly 2 million deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Nuon Chea, ``Brother Number 2'' to the late Khmer Rouge leader
Pol Pot, offered similar advice: ``This is an old story. Please
leave it to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men were speaking in Phnom Penh at the end of December
after surrendering to Cambodia's current leader, Hun Sen, who
welcomed them with bouquets of flowers and said that Cambodians
``should dig a hole and bury the past.''

   This ill-phrased plea for reconciliation was such a brazen
political fix that it sparked outrage both inside and outside
Cambodia. Hun Sen quickly backtracked, denying that he had ruled
out some sort of trial for the two leaders. But his intentions had
been clear.
</P>
<P>
   Burying the past might suit him, and other politicians tainted
by old associations with the Khmers Rouges. They are more intent on
clinging to power than seeing justice done. But an ignominious
burial of this kind would be yet another disaster for the
Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmers Rouges were among the 20th century's more relentless
mass murderers. Letting them off scot-free would be a blow to
recent international efforts to bring to justice those who have
committed systematic murder and torture.
</P>
<P>
   More damaging for Cambodians, however, it would also reinforce a
culture of impunity that has crippled efforts to bring some
semblance of normality to their country.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia remains haunted by its blood-drenched history. Every
family lost someone in the killings. People have accepted the need
to forgive Khmer Rouge foot-soldiers in order to end a chronic
civil war. But asking Cambodians to embrace the architects of mass
slaughter with bouquets of flowers turns the idea of reconciliation
into a sick joke.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 20 years after the Khmers Rouges were ousted from
power, Cambodia still struggles on the brink of chaos, ruled by the
gun, not by law.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's own government stands accused of murdering political
opponents. He booted his coalition partners out of government in a
bloody coup in 1997 and only reluctantly accepted them back last
year under foreign pressure and an election marred by intimidation
and violence. Much of the aid given to Cambodia has been siphoned
off by Hun Sen and his cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Unless some start is made on introducing the rule of law,
Cambodia seems doomed to another generation of violence and
corruption. Putting Khmer Rouge leaders on trial is the first
essential step towards creating any credible legal system, and
restraining the country's current leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the Khmers Rouges illustrates the need for a
permanent international criminal court, though the court now being
planned will not be able to deal with crimes committed before its
creation. There are, however, other ways a trial could be held,
none of them perfect, but all better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council could set up an ad hoc tribunal
similar to the Yugoslav and Rwandan ones. The United States
suggested something along these lines last year, confining the
tribunal's scope to acts committed from 1975 to 1979, the years the
Khmers Rouges held power.
</P>
<P>
   This would also conveniently avoid any investigations of the
earlier American bombing campaign or later American and Chinese
backing of the Khmers Rouges against the Vietnamese in the civil
war that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these restrictions, though, China might not agree to
Security Council support for such a tribunal. An alternative would
be a tribunal set up by the U.N. General Assembly, or by a group of
nations, following the precedent of the Nuremberg trials, to be
held either in Cambodia or abroad, staffed by international judges.
</P>
<P>
   A third option would be for some country with the appropriate
domestic legislation in place _ Canada or Australia have been
suggested _ to ask Cambodia to extradite Khmer Rouge leaders for
trial in its courts for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish magistrate has paved the way for this kind of
proceeding with his pursuit of Chile's former dictator, General
Augusto Pinochet, who is still detained in Britain fighting his
extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N.-appointed team of jurists is due to recommend a way
forward at the end of this month. Whatever it suggests, a means
should be found to stage trials that are indisputably fair, before
a panel of independent judges, administering international law.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles in the way of such trials have been removed.
Though most Khmer Rouge leaders are living in Pailin, a border town
where the government's grip is tenuous, they no longer have an
army. A determined effort to catch them is likely to succeed
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hun Sen, he is desperate for recognition and the
resumption of aid, most of which was suspended after his 1997 coup.
Concerted pressure from aid donors would win his cooperation,
however reluctant, in bringing Khmer Rouge leaders to trial.
</P>
<P>
   This might really help Cambodians to put their terrible past to
rest. &QL;

   The two aging Khmer Rouge leaders had a message for their
countrymen. ``Let bygones be bygones,'' said Khieu Samphan, head of
state between 1975 and 1979, when the savage rule of the Khmers
Rouges over Cambodia resulted in nearly 2 million deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Nuon Chea, ``Brother Number 2'' to the late Khmer Rouge leader
Pol Pot, offered similar advice: ``This is an old story. Please
leave it to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men were speaking in Phnom Penh at the end of December
after surrendering to Cambodia's current leader, Hun Sen, who
welcomed them with bouquets of flowers and said that Cambodians
``should dig a hole and bury the past.''

BAYLOR: COACHING SEARCH NEARLY OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During his 13-year career as the Clippers vice
president of basketball operations, Elgin Baylor has been known to
deflect a reporter's relatively harmless question with the
following rejoinder:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're wanting an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the NBA untied its lockout post-mortem gag order. Not
coincidentally, reporters were wanting answers to obvious inquiries
regarding Planet Clipper. The Hall of Fame forward, surrounded by
what resembled an illegal zone of pens and microphones at the
Sports Arena, did what he could to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that has basketball watchdogs talking is the team's
coaching vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a coach,'' said Baylor, not bothering to throw a
single head fake, ``at the beginning of next week.''
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that former Clippers assistant Jim Brewer is on a
list of three finalists, joined by Chris Ford and Eddie Jordan, who
were relieved of duty in Milwaukee and Sacramento, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   This list has been trotted out for months, so what's with the
delay?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are details,'' Baylor said, ``that have to be worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to validate public opinion that defines Brewer
as the favorite, a status the one-time Laker has been granted in
speculative stories over the last several weeks. Brewer's knowledge
of Clippers personnel doesn't exactly hurt his chances, but his
prospective boss refused to admit this familiarity clinches
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any advantage you have might help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Any chronological disadvantage the winner of this derby might
have is not an issue, according to Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the other teams have new coaches, too. And those we're
considering already have their stuff (coaching styles and
strategies) together.''
</P>
<P>
   To become physically fit for their new coach, Clippers players
will begin working out Monday at the team's training facility in
Carson. When the new labor deal is finalized and the NBA gives the
all-clear, training camp will be held at College of the Desert in
Palm Desert.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Baylor fielded questions on the following Clippers
issues:
</P>
<P>
   _The European evacuation of Michael Olowokandi, the 7-foot-1
center chosen by the Clippers with the first pick in the 1998 NBA
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Olowokandi played the first game for Kinder Bologna in
his expected five-week tour of the Euro League. Had Olowokandi
waited two days, he could open training camp with the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael said he wishes it (the NBA's new deal) had happened a
couple of days earlier,'' Baylor said. ``He's committed until the
15th (of February). But he's looking forward to joining us at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   _Point guard. Baylor wouldn't mention any names to fill this
vacancy, but it is believed the team would prefer a
defensive-and-playmaking upgrade from last year's starter Darrick
Martin, who's a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Available suspects who fit that description include Eric Murdock
from Miami, Sherman Douglas (a New Jersey Net last season) and
Travis Best, who's expected to re-sign with Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   How about a trade?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at everything,'' Baylor said. ``Everybody's
looking for a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a deal cookin'? For that, we retreat to what the vice
prez said when the press conference began:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things I cannot talk about.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the 1950s, William Rehnquist packed up his life in
Washington, where he had been a clerk at the Supreme Court, and
headed southwest to Arizona to start out in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   As he passed through Arkansas he made an intriguing stopover.
There, rummaging through old court records and news clippings, he
began to research the life of Isaac Parker, a 19th-century judge
notorious for handing out 164 death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when Rehnquist had risen to eminence as a Supreme
Court justice, he reflected on his youthful fascination with that
stern figure. ``Judge Parker's trials were swift, and there was no
appeal,'' he said by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rehnquist is America's chief justice, and therefore the man
who presides over the Senate as it embarks on the impeachment trial
of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's taste for swiftness and finality, though not
necessarily for the ultimate sanction, seems to suit him to this
job perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, and more especially the senators who must stand in
judgment over the president, long for a quick end to the Lewinsky
scandal: in the days of hectic pre-trial negotiation, the Senate
leaders scrambled to come up with a formula that would get the
whole business over with, and prevent the impeachment proceedings
from jamming up government.
</P>
<P>
   But senators are slow to agree on things, except their own right
to pontificate. And so the country is left hoping that Rehnquist
will be the provider of dispatch and order once the trial gets
going.
</P>
<P>
   That is what he has already provided to the deliberations of the
Supreme Court. Before Rehnquist's elevation to the chief
justiceship in 1986, the court's denizens sometimes succumbed to a
professorial disdain for deadlines. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist is brisk and businesslike, and he demands as much from
his colleagues. He keeps the same hours at work each day; he sticks
to a fixed swimming schedule; his clerks appear before him at
regular times, to brief him or play tennis. No meeting is allowed
to drag on; lawyers who exhaust their allotted time in court get
cut off in mid-sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist is more than just brisk. In another way too he seems
to answer his countrymen's yearnings as the Senate trial opens: he
has tried throughout his career to keep politics distinct from the
judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   As a young clerk on the Supreme Court, he argued against rulings
that would force racial desegregation, not because he is a racist
but because he opposed the making of political decisions through
the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Once elevated to the bench, Rehnquist continued to make this
argument. Courts, he believes, should stick to their basic function
of applying laws, even unpleasant ones; they should not stray into
politics or policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these views, it is tempting to hope that Rehnquist
will insist on a straightforward impeachment trial, uncontaminated
by partisanship. And this tempting thought is redoubled by
Rehnquist's writings on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his efficient scheduling, the chief justice has time
for hobbies: he is fond of painting and of writing books.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, one of these books (now swiftly reprinted)
describes two 19th-century impeachment trials, including that of
President Andrew Johnson in 1868. Rehnquist's account is mostly
sympathetic to Johnson, and attacks the pro-impeachment side as
irresponsibly partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The most important lesson of the Johnson episode, the chief
justice argues, is that impeachment trials should be ``a judicial
type of inquiry,'' in which senators ``decide whether or not the
charges were proven.'' They should not resemble the political votes
of no-confidence held in parliamentary systems.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Rehnquist will have the power to deliver
such a dignified, properly judicial, trial of Clinton. He will not
be able to control it as a judge usually controls his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   He may wish to impose strict discipline on the impeachment
proceedings; but the Constitution allows the senators to overrule
him at any time, and on any matter, by a simple majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   He may wish to exclude irrelevant arguments; but the Federal
Rules of Evidence, which judges use to rule bits of testimony
admissible or otherwise, do not necessarily apply in an impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the usual legal guidelines that judges enforce do not
exist: the chief justice is about to take on a role in which he
will be neither chief nor particularly judicial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rehnquist may prove surprisingly important all the same. In
their eagerness to conduct an orderly trial, the senators may
choose to defer to him rather than squabble over procedural rules;
knowing this, Rehnquist may press his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If he really wants to get his way, the chief justice can
threaten to walk out, and so rob the trial of the legitimacy
conferred by his presence. During Johnson's trial, Salmon Chase,
the chief justice of the time, resorted to such threats on more
than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Rehnquist's influence has been dismissed before, almost
always wrongly. Richard Nixon, who appointed him to the Supreme
Court, could not remember his name: ``Renchburg,'' he once called
him.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years on the court, Rehnquist seemed so marginal
that his clerks gave him a Lone Ranger doll; even now, most
Americans could not name him. A quarter of a century on, however,
he has deserted the court's margins to become its respected leader.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the impeachment trial gets under way, the anonymous
Rehnquist will become the focus of American hopes for a dignified
process. That in itself should give him the authority he needs to
quell senatorial squabbles. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the 1950s, William Rehnquist packed up his life in
Washington, where he had been a clerk at the Supreme Court, and
headed southwest to Arizona to start out in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   As he passed through Arkansas he made an intriguing stopover.
There, rummaging through old court records and news clippings, he
began to research the life of Isaac Parker, a 19th-century judge
notorious for handing out 164 death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when Rehnquist had risen to eminence as a Supreme
Court justice, he reflected on his youthful fascination with that
stern figure. ``Judge Parker's trials were swift, and there was no
appeal,'' he said by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rehnquist is America's chief justice, and therefore the man
who presides over the Senate as it embarks on the impeachment trial
of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's taste for swiftness and finality, though not
necessarily for the ultimate sanction, seems to suit him to this
job perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, and more especially the senators who must stand in
judgment over the president, long for a quick end to the Lewinsky
scandal: in the days of hectic pre-trial negotiation, the Senate
leaders scrambled to come up with a formula that would get the
whole business over with, and prevent the impeachment proceedings
from jamming up government.
</P>
<P>
   But senators are slow to agree on things, except their own right
to pontificate. And so the country is left hoping that Rehnquist
will be the provider of dispatch and order once the trial gets
going.
</P>
<P>
   That is what he has already provided to the deliberations of the
Supreme Court. Before Rehnquist's elevation to the chief
justiceship in 1986, the court's denizens sometimes succumbed to a

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is America ready for its first woman president,
Elizabeth Dole, wife of a man who publicly endorses Viagra? Or for
George W. Bush, who admits to a misspent youth of women and booze?
Or for John McCain, a brave prisoner of war in Vietnam who
celebrated freedom by betraying his faithful wife?
</P>
<P>
   ``My movements to the chair of government,'' wrote George
Washington some 210 years ago, ``will be accompanied by feelings
not unlike those of a culprit who is going to his place of
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age of televisual inquisition, perhaps such feelings
explain why Senator Bob Kerrey _ another Vietnam war hero,
handsome, divorced, and with serious ideas for social policy _ last
month said that he would not, after all, try to be the Democrats'
presidential candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They may also partly explain this week's decision by Senator
John Ashcroft, darling of the religious right, not to seek the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is scarcely a senator or a state governor in America
who does not look in the mirror and see a worthy denizen of the
White House. Just as Washington overcame his qualms, so clearly
will many others.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Vice-President Al Gore has already declared
himself on the starting-line, filing papers with the Federal
Election Commission on New Year's Eve to create a money-raising
``Gore 2000'' committee.
</P>
<P>
   So too with Bill Bradley, a former senator for New Jersey who is
still buoyed by his reputation as a 1970s basketball star with the
New York Knicks, and Paul Wellstone, a liberal senator from
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Both have formed the ``exploratory committees'' that, under FEC
regulations, are a first step in a bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats musing on their chances include Dick Gephardt,
minority leader in the House of Representatives, Senator John Kerry
of Massachusetts and the Reverend Jesse Jackson, perennial
standard-bearer for America's minorities.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Republicans, it is conventional wisdom that the
nomination is there for the asking of George W. Bush, son of a
president and newly reelected as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty ready to challenge this wisdom. At the end
of December McCain, now a third-term senator for Arizona (with a
Vietnam record to match Kerrey's), formed his exploratory committee
and so became the first Republican to take a place on the official
starting-line.
</P>
<P>
   This week Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire followed suit. And
Mrs. Dole, wife of Clinton's 1996 opponent, has told Americans to
watch this space (``Soon, I will be considering new paths, and
there are exciting possibilities'') by resigning as head of the
American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the wealthy publisher Steve Forbes, former
Vice-President Dan Quayle and a former Tennessee governor, Lamar
Alexander, are pressing on with national campaigns that, officially
undeclared, have already taken them through months of bad meals and
repetitive speeches to the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless others, such as Gary Bauer, who champions Christian
beliefs and family values, and Pat Buchanan, a right-wing
television host, will soon throw their hats in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Although Newt Gingrich, now-resigned speaker of the House, has
ruled himself out, other long shots _ say, Mayor Rudy Giuliani of
New York _ could yet rule themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   Why the early start for an election almost two years hence? The
simple answer is money.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the cost of television advertising that by most
calculations a candidate needs at least $20 million to mount a
primary campaign. More to the point, he (or she) needs it soon.
</P>
<P>
   Because California and New York, with big populations and votes
to match, have brought their primaries forward to March 2000, the
party nominations could be virtually decided by the end of that
month _ which would mean no candidate could emulate Presidents
Carter and Clinton, who used surprise early successes in the
primary season to raise money for their later victories.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, unless a candidate is wealthy enough to rely
entirely on his own money (Ross Perot spent $60 million from his
own pocket in his 1992 bid for the presidency), he must spend the
whole of this year raising money at the rate of about $60,000 a
day.
</P>
<P>
   That is quite a task given that campaign-finance rules brought
in to stop past abuses (Robert Vesco in 1972 allegedly gave Richard
Nixon a suitcase with $200,000 in cash), limit donations to $1,000
an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial logic will surely doom some candidates,
Republican and Democrat alike, to early exits from the race. Smith,
for example, is a favorite son of New Hampshire, but scarcely known
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone will have difficulty converting liberal ideals into
money (particularly since the campaign regulations that he favors
outlaw large donations). Even Bradley may fall short of what is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democratic candidates more or less certain to have the
money are Gore, Kerry (after all, he has a very rich wife, Teresa
Heinz), and Gephardt, who may decide, given that the House could
turn Democratic in 2000, that being the prospective speaker is a
better bet than being a rival to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The good financial bets for the Republicans are Bush, Forbes
and, probably, McCain and Mrs. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Assume the money is found, what then? A successful candidate
must also project a message and appear electable. On those counts
only the most unexpected stumble could deprive Gore, with his
careful preparation and ideas for the environment, education and so
on, of the Democratic nomination (after all, in post-1945 America
it has been the reward for almost every vice-president who wanted
it).
</P>
<P>
   But what of the Republicans? Bush is clearly electable (and
outscores Gore in most polls), but he is yet to reveal his message,
let alone his candidacy. Perhaps he has none, or perhaps he is
biding his time.
</P>
<P>
   Many think that the Republican Party, through its narrow-minded
pursuit of Clinton, may have hurt itself electorally.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans reckon not just that the Democrats will win
back the House and Senate in 2000, but that Gore will win the White
House as a virtual ``third-term Clinton'' (rather as George Bush
senior became president as a ``third-term Reagan'').
</P>
<P>
   Their advice to Bush junior is to wait until 2004, when the
country will again want to swing right.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the Democrats to fear McCain in 2000, to pray
that the Republicans will snub him for his cross-party advocacy of
campaign-finance reform and tobacco legislation _ and perhaps to
worry most of all about a Republican ticket that links, in
whichever order, McCain with Mrs. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ticket may seem a long shot, not least because there
could be a surfeit of vote-delivering running-mates (for example,
George Pataki, governor of New York, or Pete Wilson, former
governor of California, or Pennsylvania's governor, Tom Ridge).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, winning the presidency is all about playing
the odds _ and, if possible, fixing them early. &QL;

entirely on his own money (Ross Perot spent $60 million from his
own pocket in his 1992 bid for the presidency), he must spend the
whole of this year raising money at the rate of about $60,000 a
day.
</P>
<P>
   That is quite a task given that campaign-finance rules brought
in to stop past abuses (Robert Vesco in 1972 allegedly gave Richard
Nixon a suitcase with $200,000 in cash), limit donations to $1,000
an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial logic will surely doom some candidates,
Republican and Democrat alike, to early exits from the race. Smith,
for example, is a favorite son of New Hampshire, but scarcely known
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone will have difficulty converting liberal ideals into
money (particularly since the campaign regulations that he favors
outlaw large donations). Even Bradley may fall short of what is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democratic candidates more or less certain to have the
money are Gore, Kerry (after all, he has a very rich wife, Teresa
Heinz), and Gephardt, who may decide, given that the House could
turn Democratic in 2000, that being the prospective speaker is a
better bet than being a rival to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The good financial bets for the Republicans are Bush, Forbes
and, probably, McCain and Mrs. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Assume the money is found, what then? A successful candidate
must also project a message and appear electable. On those counts
only the most unexpected stumble could deprive Gore, with his
careful preparation and ideas for the environment, education and so
on, of the Democratic nomination (after all, in post-1945 America
it has been the reward for almost every vice-president who wanted
it).
</P>
<P>
   But what of the Republicans? Bush is clearly electable (and
outscores Gore in most polls), but he is yet to reveal his message,
let alone his candidacy. Perhaps he has none, or perhaps he is
biding his time.
</P>
<P>
   Many think that the Republican Party, through its narrow-minded
pursuit of Clinton, may have hurt itself electorally.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans reckon not just that the Democrats will win
back the House and Senate in 2000, but that Gore will win the White
House as a virtual ``third-term Clinton'' (rather as George Bush
senior became president as a ``third-term Reagan'').
</P>
<P>
   Their advice to Bush junior is to wait until 2004, when the
country will again want to swing right.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the Democrats to fear McCain in 2000, to pray
that the Republicans will snub him for his cross-party advocacy of
campaign-finance reform and tobacco legislation _ and perhaps to
worry most of all about a Republican ticket that links, in
whichever order, McCain with Mrs. Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ticket may seem a long shot, not least because there
could be a surfeit of vote-delivering running-mates (for example,
George Pataki, governor of New York, or Pete Wilson, former
governor of California, or Pennsylvania's governor, Tom Ridge).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, winning the presidency is all about playing
the odds _ and, if possible, fixing them early. &QL;

   One can belong to the European Union without adopting the euro:
Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Britain have done just that. But adopt
the euro without belonging to the Union? Some countries would like
to try _ and some already have.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of a clutch of states and principalities, none of them
members of the EU, may end up making as much use of the euro, which
was traded for the first time on Jan. 4, as any German or Italian.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, when euro notes and coins will replace national ones,
wise men in Brussels have recommended that Monaco, San Marino and
the Vatican make it their own, and only, national currency too.
</P>
<P>
   Monaco, an enclave in southern France independent since the 15th
century, currently prints its own Monegasque francs. The other two,
in Italy, mint their own lira coins (though not notes) which have
parity with Italian lire.
</P>
<P>
   They have each asked if they can use the euro. Practically,
there will be pressure to change anyway: they will swamped by euros
from tourists and traders, insisting on their use.
</P>
<P>
   Some small European countries have long abandoned their own
currencies. Andorra, a principality wedged in the Pyrenees, now
uses the currencies of both its neighbors, the French franc and the
Spanish peseta, and so has automatically adopted the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Liechtenstein, where Swiss francs now line citizens'
pockets, the new currency may prove hard to resist for those who
trade with neighboring Austria and other parts of Euroland.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Brussels decided last month that far-flung corners
of ``Europe,'' such as the French territories of Mayotte in the
Indian Ocean, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, just off Canada's
Newfoundland, should also be allowed to adopt the euro.
</P>
<P>
   As for Martinique and Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, and Reunion
in the Indian Ocean, they will each _ as they are part of France _
also take on the euro.
</P>
<P>
   And if Denmark joins the single currency, then its overseas
territories, the Faroe Isles and Greenland, both of which use the
Danish krone, would automatically adopt the euro too.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest source of euro-dependency beyond the EU's
borders is in Africa: the nearly 100 million people in West and
Central Africa's own single-currency zone, which reaches across 14
countries from Senegal to Congo-Brazzaville, who use the CFA franc.
</P>
<P>
   This shared currency has always been pegged to the French franc.
After an EU agreement last year, the CFA franc remains a separate
currency but is now tied to the euro anchor instead.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland Africans are not the only ones to keep their franc,
while tying it to the euro. The Comoro Islands will do the same
with their franc, which was also fixed against the French franc,
and now is against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Farther still from Europe, some islands in the South Pacific,
such as Wallis &AMP; Futuna (not Gromit) and New Caledonia, whose
francs were also pegged to the French one, are now tied to the euro
_ but they also keep their francs.
</P>
<P>
   For those nostalgic French who regard the loss of their franc
with regret, there may be some comfort in the thought that francs
of some kind will still survive in Africa and the Pacific Ocean. &QL;

NBA TAKES STEPS TO WIN BACK FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jack Nicholson and Spike Lee presumably won't need
any arm-twisting to take their courtside seats Feb. 5, when the NBA
returns. As for everyone else? They've just become the league's No.
1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some winning back of fans to do, and we're going to do
it,'' commissioner David Stern said Thursday, after owners
unanimously approved a new labor deal that ended a bitter six-month
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Apathy reigned during the league's first two months of canceled
games. Stern hopes to rekindle fans' interest by offering free
admission to exhibition games later this month and blocks of $10
seats to regular-season games next season.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it won't really take much effort. Phones have been
ringing for two straight days at the Forum, where season tickets
are going fast, and no less an authority than Jerry West says the
game will thrive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really prejudiced, but I happen to think the NBA is the
best game of all,'' said West, the Lakers' top executive and a
league institution since his playing days 30 years ago. ``I think
for young kids, who admire some of our players, hopefully they'll
know this is kind of a blip on the screen, and we'll get back to
doing what everyone would like to do, and that's play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   But bet on this: the Lakers and every other team will be ordered
to make nice with the fans. That means more community service and
more time signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt our players have been very good about those
things,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Union director Billy Hunter, sitting next to Stern at a New York
press conference, pledged players' cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are anxious to play, and we're anxious to join
hands with David, Russ (Granik, deputy commissioner) and the owners
of the 29 teams to really create a strong and familial relationship
_ one that will take the NBA to another level and to bring back the
fans,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no understating the damage created by forcing
cancellation of games due to labor conflict for the first time in
league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the league doesn't fine me, but I am embarrassed,''
West said. ``I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would see
this happen to basketball, because I felt we had a wonderful
working relationship with our players and enormous growth of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do feel . . . both sides understand that for everyone to
prosper in this league, you need a healthy league. You don't need
one or two players making every dollar that teams can provide under
the cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days ago, the NBA appeared on the verge of ruin. Stern was
recommending owners cancel the season, and high-powered agents were
possibly planning a rival league.
</P>
<P>
   Now the NBA is not only back in business, but arguably much
better off for the experience. It is the first pro league in North
America to place absolute limits on salaries _ $14 million per
season for 10-year veterans _ and the labor deal contains numerous
new controls to keep salaries from spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a time when Major League Baseball is reportedly
losing $300 million a year and $100-million player contracts are
suddenly the norm. New Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown's $15
million-a-year deal is more than the entire payroll of the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at baseball and I look at (the NHL), and I would be
concerned for other sports if (they) don't get some control over
it,'' West said. ``And still the (NBA) salaries are enormous, but
hopefully this will give everyone a better idea of maybe how we can
make a league that will be healthy and allow every team to compete
equally.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the threat of a canceled season to force the NBA's 400
players to agree to the unprecedented limits. It was a threat the
union and player agents claimed all along was a bluff, but which
nevertheless rattled rank-and-file players.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's gambit worked, and only he knows if he would have
followed through.
</P>
<P>
   West, asked if he thought the season would be canceled,
responded with a terse, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Stern wore a sly grin when asked if he was bluffing
and said, ``You didn't pay to find out.''

ARTISTS CELEBRATE NONPROFIT GALLERY'S OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Dennis McCarthy is a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily
News.) 
BY DENNIS MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For most of the past 30 years, their artwork has
been relegated to the walls of banks, restaurants, libraries, hair
salons -- any place in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles
where someone would give them a little space to hang for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But that all changes Saturday. The stepchild of the arts is
finally getting its own gallery in the valley. It isn't fancy or
uptown like the Getty.
</P>
<P>
   It's behind a Burger King in Northridge. But who cares? It's a
home.
</P>
<P>
   No more competing with waitresses, hairstylists, librarians and
bank tellers for attention. No more insults to their
professionalism when some kid in a restaurant highchair flings his
spaghetti and hits one of their paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been degrading,'' says Connie Larson, president of the
Valley Institute of Visual Art. ``You feel like you're a decorator
for bank or restaurant walls, instead of an artist displaying your
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   VIVA is an outgrowth of four local arts groups -- the Valley
Watercolor Society, the Collage Artists of America, Valley Artists
Guild and Women Painters West -- all of them sick and tired of
having to go, hat in hand, to local businesses and libraries to get
their work displayed for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Art Space in Warner Center in nearby Woodland
Hills, which was closed after five years when the building was sold
a few years ago, and the Lankershim Art Center across town in North
Hollywood, which houses performing arts and print-making societies,
there has been no permanent gallery space in the valley for these
VIVA artists to show their wares.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the only permanent home in the valley for paint
artists like this,'' said Earl Sherburn, community arts director
for the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which is helping the
nonprofit VIVA open its doors.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big event for these visual artists, who are tired of
taking a back seat to the performing arts, and people who think of
the valley as a cultural wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that all art in this city is located on the
Westside -- baloney,'' says Betty Beam of the Collage Artists of
America. ``We have over 600 fine artists in our four groups. The
valley isn't a desert.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but it's been a long, tough fight convincing the right
people of that.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I met Beam she was out knocking on doors to find
space in the valley for her group after Art Space lost its
building. She was not alone out there.
</P>
<P>
   Artists in the other groups that would later come together to
form VIVA were out doing the same thing. Looking for a place to
hang. None of them was having any luck.
</P>
<P>
   They all knew each other from the local schools where they
volunteered their time and expertise to bring art to kids in the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   When push came to shove at budget time, art never seemed to make
the cut in the schools. So, it was up to these local artists to
bring art to our kids.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, that alone should have given these talented
people dibs on the biggest, best building we could find for them to
hang their art. They certainly deserved their own gallery for
bailing out the school district and parents in opening the eyes of
kids to art.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how things like this work. Good deeds don't
necessarily translate into good things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mind boggling to us that there was no real voice out
there for the visual artists, but plenty for the performance arts
people,'' Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like the stepchild. We were doing all this for the
community, and had no home base. We had to make some noise, and
that's what we finally did.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Breuer of the Valley Watercolor Society kicked it off by
enlisting the help of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs.
Art patron Elisabeth Waldo-Detzel, who owns the Northridge strip
mall where the VIVA gallery is located, stepped in as a major
benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Donegan of Valley Artists Guild spent months turning an
empty store into a beautiful art gallery. A year of fund-raisers,
scrimping and saving later, VIVA officially opens its doors to the
public for a reception at 2 p.m. Sunday at its new home.
</P>
<P>
   As Larson says, it isn't a museum or a traditional gallery for
profit. It's a municipal gallery and educational center offering a
``comprehensive look at the vibrant and vital visual art scene in
the San Fernando Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the Getty, but it's still pretty darn good.
</P>
<P>
   And if you get hungry, you can walk across the parking lot to
the Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   Try that at the Getty.

STUDY FINDS EXERCISE DOWN, OBESITY UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Get off that couch!
</P>
<P>
   A new survey finds that significantly more state residents are
leading sedentary lifestyles and are much fatter on average than
Californians used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity rates have increased 50 percent in the past 13 years,
according to a report released Thursday by the University of
California, San Francisco, and the California Department of Health
Services on a study of 36,004 Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Rates of physical inactivity are high, something that was little
surprise to 23-year-old Darlene Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are more lazy people now,'' said the mother and
student from suburban Granada Hills in the San Fernando Valley area
of Los Angeles. ``It's more convenient. There are cell phones and
valet parking. Everyone is so pampered and spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey examined five cardiovascular risk factors in 10
regions throughout the state, including Los Angeles County:
cigarette smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, weight and
physical inactivity. The survey covers a 12-year period from 1984
to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, more than one in four Californians had
an overweight problem in 1996 -- 50 percent more than in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Californians also are less physically active off the job,
according to the study in which participants were asked whether
they did any running, walking, biking or other vigorous physical
activity in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed the prevalence of inactivity among men
increased significantly, from 45 percent in 1984 to 54.3 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   About 55 percent of women led inactive lives in 1996, virtually
unchanged since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study shows us we (have) a lot of room for improvement,''
said Jeannie Gazzaniga, an epidemiologist at the Institute for
Health and Aging, UCSF School of Nursing, and lead author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``California as a whole, like the rest of the nation, could
stand to lose some weight and become more physically active.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Noorparvar, 20, of Reseda in the San Fernando Valley said
he knows firsthand how much lazier society is. He sells cell phones
and pagers for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you'd go over to a friend's house to see if he
was home. Now you just give him a call or you can page him,''
Noorparvar said.
</P>
<P>
   As for himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lazy. I'm not motivated, I'm much less active,'' he said.
``I used to be involved in basketball and the swim team. I haven't
done that in months -- I mean months and months.''
</P>
<P>
   The report findings surprised others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people are lazier. I think they're more active.
Everything's more fitness-oriented,'' said Randi Piedrahita, 29, a
mother from West Hills in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Viola Sarkozy, 25, a resident of North Hills in the San Fernando
Valley and recent college graduate, said Californians should be
healthier and trimmer than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's January, and we're still wearing shorts. You can go bike
riding and go outdoors, whereas back East right now there's a foot
of snow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Californians' take-home pay increases, they tend to eat
out more and cook fewer low-fat, nutritious meals at home, said Dr.
Raed Fahmy, a board-certified cardiologist at Kaiser Permanente
Woodland Hills Medical Center in suburban Woodland Hills in the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're eating out more and becoming more sedentary,'' Fahmy
said. ``Fewer people are learning how to cook properly. That skill
of cooking at home is vanishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the study found Latino women were the most likely to
be overweight (42.7 percent). Among women, whites were the least
likely to be (24.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, African-American women were the most
likely to be overweight (44.6 percent), while white men were the
least likely (18.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   About half of the African-Americans and whites in the study were
sedentary in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos -- 70.4 percent of the men and 66.2 percent of the women
-- were most likely to be sedentary statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos also were the least physically active off the job in Los
Angeles County, followed by African-American women,
African-American men, white women and white men.
</P>
<P>
   Gazzaniga said the findings could paint a misleading portrait of
Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep in mind that we're talking about physical
activity outside work,'' she said. ``A lot of times, Hispanic men
and women are very busy, and their jobs are very labor intensive.
They may be very active, but we may not be picking that up as
leisure activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gazzaniga also said that Latinos surveyed in the study could
live in high-crime areas where they fear going outside to run, walk
or bike. And she said that immigrant Latino women may not see
walking as a form of exercise and mention it in a survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're used to walking to get someplace, rather than seeing
it as exercise,'' Gazzaniga said. ``We're dealing with some
cultural factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers identified no significant differences in activity
across age groups in the study, but found leisure inactivity among
fewer Californians with college education, 44.2 percent, than among
those with only a high school diploma or less education, 62.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find out where we have the highest prevalence of
the major contributors to heart disease,'' Gazzaniga said. ``The
report tells us where we should better target our prevention
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted in the state's Cardiovascular Disease
Outreach, Resources and Epidemiology Program.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Ask him whether Mexico might not help its poor
citizens by taxing its rich ones more, and Jose Angel Gurria, the
finance minister, looks mildly irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not practicing the Robin Hood theory here.'' Indeed not.
</P>
<P>
   Gurria had to cut spending three times in 1998. For 1999 he
presented the most austere budget in nearly two decades. Then he
told Congress it would need slicing even further, as oil prices, a
mainstay of government revenue, continued to plummet; and the
opposition refused to let him ease the pain with a higher telephone
tax.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of it all, he did not take from the rich. The budget
that bleary-eyed legislators waved through in the last hours of
1998 even included a lower profits tax for businesses. Yet the
government claims proudly that it is spending more _ in real terms
_ on fighting poverty than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Someone should tell the poor. Social spending has indeed
increased fairly steadily over the past ten years, but the Robin
Hood effect has been conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the 1980s Mexico's Gini coefficient, a measure of
income inequality (going from nil, egalitarian paradise, to 1,
feudal hell), rose significantly.
</P>
<P>
   It has changed little during the 1990s, but the poorest continue
to do badly: 36 percent of workers were paid less than the minimum
wage in 1997, compared with 30 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage itself has been falling for over two decades _
it is now just under 35 pesos ($3.55) a day _ while basic supplies
have gone up in price as one subsidy after another has been
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   The last and most basic one of all vanished on Jan. 1: on
tortillas, the maize pancakes that keep most Mexican bellies full.
</P>
<P>
   Their price, which the government had nudged up to what it
thought the market level during 1998, promptly jumped again, until
public rage this week compelled the suppliers to accept a ceiling
of 3.50 pesos per kilo _ which (even if it holds) is still nearly
double the 1.90 of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So what, apart from throwing more money at the problem, is the
government intending to do? Answer: throw money more accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Generalized subsidies are being replaced with carefully directed
ones: for instance, some 1.5 million of the poorest families can
get a free tortilla ration by swiping cards through an electronic
reader at their local tortilleria, where previously the height of
technology was the gas-powered tortilla-squashing machine.
</P>
<P>
   But the highlight of the 57 assorted anti-poverty schemes is
rather more ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   This is a scheme called Progresa. Started in mid-1997, it aims
to help the rural poor escape the vicious circle of low income, bad
nutrition, poor health and lack of education.
</P>
<P>
   It offers the neediest rural families a package of benefits _
with strings. Thus pregnant women and toddlers can get extra food,
so long as they go or are taken for regular free health checks.
</P>
<P>
   Families get paid to send their children to school, instead of
to work in the fields, but only so long as the children actually
attend.
</P>
<P>
   And to make sure the money is spent properly, Progresa's
payments go, in defiance of traditional Mexican values, to the
women of the family rather than the men.
</P>
<P>
   So far, independent analysts are cautiously impressed. There are
some criticisms: for instance, that the poorest communities of all,
ones that have no school or clinic nearby, cannot take part.
</P>
<P>
   But some 2 million families, about a tenth of the population,
are now under Progresa's umbrella, and their ranks are growing.
Where Progresa operates, more children have registered for school,
more people are visiting their medics, and malnutrition is down.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme, however, will have to support many children for many
years before anyone can be sure that it really improves their lives
rather than just maintaining them.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Progresa cannot create the jobs that all these
well-nourished, well-educated young people will need. &QL;

QVC TO OFFER PIECES OF HOLLYWOOD SIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Call it a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Candlestick Park became 3Com Park for a price. Los Angeles'
newest sports venue is the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   And now Los Angeles' most recognizable landmark -- the
H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D sign -- is the latest piece of history to get a
price tag, the Hollywood Sign Trust announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this 76-year-old monument to moviemaking will be
hawked exclusively on QVC, the TV channel that sells most
everything, from Elvis memorabilia to slicing and dicing kitchen
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The first caller to put up $100,000 on QVC's glitzy ``Extreme
Shopping: Hollywood'' selling segment Jan. 22 will get a year of
bragging rights as the ``angel'' of the nine 50-foot-tall letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not selling the Hollywood sign,'' insisted Chris
Baumgart, chairman of the trust, a nonprofit organization that
maintains the landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to sell trademark or licensing rights. There
is no planned alteration of the sign,'' said Baumgart, audibly
irritated with the barrage of questions following the trust's
announcement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go toward upkeep and preservation of the
landmark. The sign was initially erected as a real estate promotion
for a long-gone development called ``Hollywoodland.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone willing to pay the $100,000 will become official sponsor
of the Hollywood landmark for a full year. That honor comes with a
commemorative plaque, but no lucrative licensing rights to use its
likeness in promotions or advertising, Baumgart said.
</P>
<P>
   And if $100,000 is too much to pay for a piece of Hollywood,
then bargain hunters might consider Hollywood's Walk of Fame stars,
which also will be up for sponsorship on QVC the same day. Elvis,
Bruce Lee and 50 other favorites are promoted as a steal at $250.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Debbie Reynolds, who is spearheading the promotion for
QVC, said the irresistible power of Hollywood will lure a faithful
``angel'' to help preserve the 450-foot sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to get some corporate people who might care. It's
worth it because it's history,'' Reynolds said, smiling for TV
cameras during a news conference Thursday at the Hollywood
Reservoir, in the shadow of the sign. ``It's what people come here
to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of spending lots of money without at least getting a
corporate logo hung on Southern California's most-watched piece of
real estate caused only consternation with folks running their dogs
in a park below the sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would they get out of it?'' wondered Michael Wilson of
Hollywood. ``I don't understand why anyone would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Put me down for the $100,000,'' said Hollywood Hills resident
Judith Secler, rolling her eyes as her dogs, Sydney and Henry,
frolicked in the nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine anyone interested in that. Why don't the
studios do it? I'd be more interested in creating a dog park for
our dogs than paying to take care of the H and the O,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So who would pay that kind of cash for mere bragging rights?

<P>
   It's a bit pricey considering Paramount Studios shelled out only
$54,000 for the right to put a 75-foot cartoon likeness of actress
Kim Basigner on the sign for a week back in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And pranksters have changed the sign from HOLLYWOOD to
``HOLLYWEED'' and even ``GO NAVY'' for free many times over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the price, QVC likely will have some takers, predicted
David Stewart, chairman of the marketing department at the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hollywood sign uniquely symbolizes Los Angeles,'' Stewart
said. ``To the extent that a firm could identify itself with Los
Angeles, that could be very valuable. Sponsorships have become a
major form of brand awareness. A lot of companies that don't want
to spend tremendous amounts of money on TV advertising can generate
a lot of brand awareness by sponsoring a stadium. Take 3Com. Who
knew who they were before they sponsored?''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, best remembered for her leading role in ``Singin' in
the Rain,'' will host the QVC ``Extreme Shopping: Hollywood''
special, which its promoters promise will offer ``viewers the once
in a lifetime opportunity to experience the glitz and glamour that
is Hollywood.'' The money raised will go to the respective trusts
that care for the sign and the sidewalk stars.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few firms would consider supplying their own electricity and
water. So why do they struggle with computer equipment and
software?
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the outsourcing of computer services has been a
huge and fast-growing business. At a price, the likes of IBM and
EDS will provide an ``end-to-end'' package of solutions for big
companies who want to wish their technology worries away.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the Internet and improvements in communications
technology, another type of outsourcing is now afoot. It is more
like a utility that rents out data storage, processing capacity and
applications.
</P>
<P>
   If end-to-end outsourcing is the computing equivalent of
limousines with chauffeurs, the new version is a fleet of taxis _
less luxurious, but much cheaper and for hire to businesses
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is being led by some of the software firms that
provide ``enterprise resource planning'' (ERP), which big companies
increasingly rely on for their main business processes.
</P>
<P>
   Working with hardware makers and Internet service providers
(ISPs), they want to make the latest business software available on
monthly subscription. Initially, their aim is to extend ERP to
firms with revenues of less than $500 million a year, including
legal partnerships and even doctors' surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts are convinced that even large firms will
eventually follow. Forrester Research, a consultancy, thinks that
by 2002 the applications-rental market, currently almost
nonexistent, will be worth about $6 billion, and will be doubling
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Established ERP suppliers are in the vanguard. J.D. Edwards is
working with IBM Global Services; PeopleSoft is leasing its
human-resource and financial packages to a start-up, called
Usinternetworking.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also new firms, such as Employease which is using
the Internet to help companies to outsource their payroll and
benefits processing.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft is dipping a fairly fat toe in the water. It has
just linked with Qwest, a new telecoms firm that is building a
high-capacity long-distance network along old railway lines.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has invested $200 million in Qwest, in exchange for a
1.3 percent stake plus a share of revenues from Qwest's Internet
services. This will provide upgrades and maintenance of Microsoft's
software for a regular fee.
</P>
<P>
   These will also compete with large ISPs such as UUNET, ANS and
Exodus, which already run firms' Internet sites for them.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Tom Gormley argues that such service providers could
become the utilities of the next century, providing an essential
service with all the reliability and security of the electricity or
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   The most determined firm is Oracle, which leads the market for
corporate databases and is the number two ERP firm (after Germany's
SAP). Oracle Business OnLine has been running as a pilot since
October, and early this year it will be launched commercially,
first in America and some months later in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   All of its latest ``Release 11'' suite of applications _
finance, distribution, manufacturing, front office and human
resources _ will be for rent. In time, Oracle will also include
other firms' software, providing what it calls ``best of breed''
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle reckons this could become a $2 billion-a-year
money-spinner, accounting for as much as 50 percent of its
packaged-applications revenue in five years' time.
</P>
<P>
   By teaming up with its Silicon Valley neighbors, Sun
Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, two of the biggest makers of
powerful Unix servers, Oracle's new data centers are able to supply
the gamut of hardware and services.
</P>
<P>
   Rented applications fit beautifully with Oracle's vision of a
simpler and more reliable form of computing based on the open
standards of the Internet and the Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its rivals' products, Oracle's Release 11 is not designed
to run on conventional PC clients linked to lots of servers on a
local-area network. Instead, Oracle favors three tiers, with a huge
database server (possibly a mainframe) at the center.
</P>
<P>
   This links smaller servers working for thousands of different
users. Users need only a Java-compatible web browser and a network
connection.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, elderly PCs can be given a new lease of life. Cheap
and simple Internet appliances will be able to perform most tasks.
Larger companies may prefer to operate their own network, but, with
encryption, smaller companies can safely make use of the public
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure how to charge for renting computing power. One
idea is a monthly subscription, related to the number of named
users. Another, strongly supported at a recent Oracle users'
conference, is to ``meter'' the units of computing that a customer
uses.
</P>
<P>
   USi is charging monthly fees of $10,000-75,000 for its
PeopleSoft rented applications, depending on client numbers and the
software chosen.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Edwards, using IBM's costly network (recently sold to
AT&AMP;T), is charging $550-850 a month for each user.
</P>
<P>
   A one-off fee of up to $50,000 should cover the cost of setting
up the system for each new customer. Contracts are for a minimum of
three years _ somewhat longer than Oracle is planning.
</P>
<P>
   That is a bargain. One drawback of ERP is the cost of getting it
up and running. Even though the software is ``off the shelf,'' it
works only if businesses adopt the ``best practices'' prescribed by
armies of expensive consultants.
</P>
<P>
   As one joke has it: how many SAP consultants does it take to
screw in a light bulb? None; they just declare darkness a best
practice.
</P>
<P>
   With prices pared to the bone, the emphasis in the rental market
will be on contracts based on implementation in six months or less.
That should actually suit small and medium-sized companies who need
ERP to make them more efficient, rather than to gain unique
competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   According to Katherine Jones, an analyst with the Aberdeen
Group, an IT consultancy, another attraction is that renting is
much less risky: ``It's not a win-or-lose-all decision for
businesses in the gut-wrenching way that most ERP decisions are.''
If you are renting the wrong package, you can probably change it,
or pull out.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that rental is all bad news for the
consultants who have made so much money from customizing ERP. Even
rapid implementation will call for their experience. Indeed, some
are likely to go into the utility business themselves, establishing
their own data centers.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies will feel uneasy about giving their most valuable
data to hired guns half a continent away. But for others, leaving
the management of the network, systems, data and applications to
contracted professionals is an idea whose time has come. &QL;

   CUPERTINO, CALIF. _ Ask the Silicon Valley elite what they think
of Steve Jobs and the company he helped to found 22 years ago, and
they exude admiration.
</P>
<P>
   As Netscape's Marc Andreessen (no stranger to lionization
himself) puts it: ``Right now, there's no question that Steve is
the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs has certainly achieved remarkable things in the 16 months
since being installed as ``interim'' chief executive at Apple, the
company he was squeezed out of in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Apple will declare a profit for the fifth quarter in a row next
week, after racking up losses of more than $1 billion; its share
price has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning-looking iMac, launched in August, was the
best-selling home computer in the run-up to Christmas, almost
tripling Apple's share of the desktop retail market in November, to
5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his hero's welcome at this week's MacWorld trade
show in San Francisco, a cautious assessment of Jobs's prospects is
in order.
</P>
<P>
   That he has given the Apple faithful back their hope, and
restored glamour to a once-great brand, is not in doubt. The
question is whether the Cupertino-based company is seeing a new
dawn or a false one.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Jobs seems not to have put a foot wrong. Hard decisions
came first. He concluded a peace pact with the old enemy,
Microsoft, to ensure that the latest version of Microsoft's Office
software would run on Apple's Macintosh operating system. He
terminated the licensing agreements that had allowed other
manufacturers to make Apple ``clones.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Apple licensed its brilliant operating system in the 1980s,
it might have been Apple and not Microsoft that became the colossus
of the personal-computer industry. But doing so a decade too late
merely let clone-makers undercut Apple's own products, while doing
little to expand the Apple universe.
</P>
<P>
   Even harder was the decision to kill projects such as the
hand-held Newton. Apple just did not have the money to dabble in
risky new technologies. Survival meant reviving the brand and
ensuring that manufacturing and distribution did not let Apple down
as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the effort has been geared towards the iMac. Although
the machine is not a technical tour de force, its compactness,
glowing green transparent shell, absence of conventional cables and
simplicity appeal to both traditional Macophiles and computer
virgins.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Jobs announced five tangy new colors (strawberry,
blueberry, tangerine, grape and lime) and a slightly upgraded
design. Substance, as well as style, is promised by new versions of
the Power Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Encased in ice-blue plastic, they come with processors as fast
as any made by Intel, and they include excellent 3D graphics.
</P>
<P>
   With his slogan ``chic, not geek,'' Jobs may well be on to
something. If Apple can provide customers with the same ``delight''
that came from the original Mac operating system's graphical user
interface, the firm has a good future.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs will have succeeded if the sort of people who pay more for
an Audi than for a Ford also prefer an Apple to a Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, his chances would have been slim, because of
the dominance of Windows. But that is to reckon without the shift
towards Internet-based computing, and the growing success of the
Java programming language, which allows applications to run on a
variety of platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is both good and bad for Apple. Good, because it offers
an escape from the charming but decaying Mac ghetto. Bad, because
owning its operating system is what differentiates Apple from the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   There are other uncertainties as well. Jobs dismisses the threat
of imitators: ``if they could do all these things, why aren't they
doing them now?''
</P>
<P>
   Apple may eventually find itself stunted by the move towards
simple Internet computing devices and information appliances, such
as smart mobile phones and television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   These will appeal to technophobes and will bring
consumer-electronics firms, such as Sony and Philips, into
competition with the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an abortive bid to buy Palm from 3Com last year, Jobs
affects a lack of concern. His message is that the PC will remain
king of the hill and Apple's task is to make its computers nicer to
use and more beautiful than anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   A company that lost its way as badly as Apple needs that kind of
unrelenting focus. But at what point does focus become blinkered? &QL;

SENATE OPENS HISTORIC IMPEACHMENT TRIAL AMID PARTISAN FIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate opened the first presidential
impeachment trial in 131 years by solemnly pledging to render
``impartial justice,'' but the body soon was struggling to overcome
partisan divisions it had hoped to avoid on such a historic day.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, unable to agree with their Democratic colleagues on
procedures to govern the trial of President Clinton, were prepared
in the afternoon to use their Senate majority to pass their own
rules. Those rules would allow witness testimony and could extend
the trial well into February.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, however, GOP party leaders had pledged to
meet again today in the hope of adopting a trial format that both
Democrats and Republicans could endorse.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point was whether to summon witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``We
are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead the
United States Senate not to remove the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president's lawyers are ``ready to go'' and
ready to stipulate to evidence in the case in exchange for a ban on
witnesses. But, he added, if the House insists on calling
witnesses, it will cause a delay ``because bringing witnesses in
and not stipulating to a record opens up a whole area of motions,
discovery and depositions. And that takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday evening, White House aides said they had not
received a response from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that new testimony was unnecessary because the
record was well established; Republicans argued that members of the
House of Representatives required witnesses to make their case that
Clinton is guilty of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution offered little procedural help. Although the
Senate has tried 14 federal officials _ most of them judges _ the
only presidential trial was of Andrew Johnson in 1868. It ended in
narrow acquittal after a little more than a month of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in uncharted waters,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP plan, the trial witnesses could include former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan
or anyone else the Senate voted to summon. Because Republicans hold
55 of the 100 Senate seats, the GOP could control the agenda if the
votes were cast along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong to say at the beginning, `Absolutely no
witnesses,' '' Lott said. ``I also think it's wrong to say at the
beginning that there are going to be `X number' of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any witness request that gets 51 votes, that witness will
come. That's fair. We'll have to vote on every witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he had not been presented a list of specific witnesses
by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and
other Republicans have prepared a list of potential witnesses,
including Lewinsky, Jordan and White House secretary Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   New reports quoted Republican sources as saying that GOP
lawmakers may also want to have several current and former White
House officials subpoenaed, including John Podesta, the chief of
staff; Harold Ickes, a former aide; and adviser Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would give first the House and then the
White House up to 24 hours each _ three eight-hour days, for
example _ to present evidence, after which senators would have 16
hours for questions to lawyers. After that, the Democrats would be
permitted to seek adjournment of the trial, and the House or White
House free to seek permission to call witnesses. A final vote would
occur by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, frustrated Democrats skipped an afternoon meeting in
which they had been scheduled to caucus with Republicans about the
trial blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Senate Minority Leader) Tom Daschle pulled the plug,'' said
Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ``He said there would be no more discussions
with this (bipartisan) group.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl insisted that ``Republicans understand that we need to make
this bipartisan for it to be credible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have used that leverage to extract concession after
concession after concession,'' Kyl said. ``This is an attempt to
use partisanship to gain advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said witnesses weren't needed because the White
House was already prepared to concede, or stipulate to, the facts
in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Starr accused Clinton of covering up a sexual affair with
Lewinsky. The House forwarded two articles of impeachment to the
Senate last month on perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House debate was rancorous, it was expected that
events in the Senate would unfold more calmly. The founding fathers
believed the Senate, because of members' six-year terms of office
and deliberative nature, would be more collegial and detached than
the House. It remained to be seen whether that would be the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, many Democrats continued to back a plan, rejected
by GOP conservatives, in which each side would present its case,
followed by a ``test vote'' that could end the trial if a majority
believed Clinton's offenses weren't clearly impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, unbeknownst to me, the Republican caucus
rejected that,'' said a frustrated Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., as
he ducked into an elevator. ``And why any other proposed solution
is better _ that would have to be answered, I think, to a lot of
folks on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ceremony that signaled the formal opening of the
impeachment trial, the federal government's legislative and
judicial branches, at least for a moment, merged into one.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hush as Chief Justice William Rehnquist, wearing a
black robe embellished with gold stripes, was led into the Senate
chamber to be sworn in as the presiding officer. His dark-suited
Senate escorts marched silently ahead of him, like pallbearers at a
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!'' shouted the sergeant at arms.
``All persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of
imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to
the Senate articles of impeachment against William Jefferson
Clinton.''

DAFOE, BRUINS SHAKE OFF LEAFS 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAFS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He didn't have his full team. Six regulars were
missing. There was no Tim Taylor, no Grant Led-yard, no Dave
Ellett, no Anson Carter, no Chris Taylor, no Peter Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   And two of his players were making their National Hockey League
debuts _ Andre Savage and Eric Nickulas.
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly the ideal situation for Bruins coach Pat Burns,
which was why he approached this home-and-home series against
Toronto with some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. After a very strong effort by goalie Byron Dafoe
in the last seven-plus minutes of the second period, the Bruins
came out firing in the third, earning a 2-1 victory over the Maple
Leafs Thursday night at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was at his best while the Bruins were being outshot, 9-0,
late in the second, helping them keep Toronto winless in Boston
since Oct. 24, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The game wasn't without some exasperating moments for Burns. His
top line of Jason Allison, Dmitri Khristich, and Sergei Samsonov
produced a roller-coaster ride of giveaways and recoveries,
prompting the coach to take them aside after the second period and
beg them not to make him old before his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were giving them the puck too much,'' said Burns of the
trio that wound up scoring both Boston goals. ``You can't skate 164
feet and give them the puck. Then your defense gets the puck and
gives it back to the forwards and they go another 160-odd-feet and
give up the puck and come back ... Sooner or later, the puck's
going to end up behind you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our top line has to be at their best. If they don't play (at
top form), we don't stand much of a chance to win. I told them we
can play this type of hockey all night but it's wearing on the
defense, it's wearing on the goaltender, and it's wearing on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he tries to allow his skilled players to make their
own decisions out on the ice, but he admits that when they're doing
so, he's afraid to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably kill me,'' said Burns. ``They're like that,
though. They try to make a play at the right time. Sometimes you're
all happy when they do make it. When they don't make it, you get
frustrated. You have to bite your tongue sometimes. Other times you
say, `Maybe you shouldn't pass up that shot.' If you go out there
and say, `Shoot the puck,' maybe that's not them. Maybe they'd have
less points.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took a 1-0 lead at 18:31 of the first period on a
backhander by Todd Warriner from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Boston pulled even at 3:26 of the second when Allison set up
Samsonov for his 15th goal of the year. Allison, at the blue line,
carried the puck from the right point down the slot and found
Samsonov near the crease. Samsonov skated right to left, curling
arond the edge of the crease and beating Glenn Healy with a
backhander from near the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to carry it across the blue line when there are
three guys there,'' said Allison. ``I kind of ran out of room. I
wanted to cycle it back down to somebody, and no one was there.
(Defenseman Hal Gill) was up a bit, so I had a little room to go
behind him and it ended up working well. You get that high, it
confuses people, and Sergei was wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bruins weathered the Maple Leafs' storm in the second
half of the period, Khristich potted the winner at 7:13 of the
third with his 17th of the year. After Allison took a chip shot
from the right circle, Healy made the stop and Sylvain Cote tried
to clear the puck out from in front of his goalie. But he couldn't
control the puck, and Khristich came charging in, banging in the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear early in the third that the line had taken to heart
Burns's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned something to our line about playing safer; we
have to keep things a little simpler than we do,'' said Allison.
``Sometimes we're trying to score a goal right away or force a pass
in the slot or hanging on to it too long or trying to beat a guy at
the blue line instead of getting it into the corners and getting it
wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison had a goal disallowed at 16:13 because the rolling puck
didn't completely cross the goal line. But it all worked out for
the depleted Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give this team credit tonight,'' said Burns. ``The
guys we called up worked hard. The five defense worked hard. You've
got to give them credit.''

FOR NOW, FISET CONTENT AS NO. 2 GOALIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Stephane Fiset, waiting to return to the lineup from
a groin injury he says was healed two weeks ago, said he is very
comfortable serving as the backup for as long as Jamie Storr
remains hot in goal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before Thursday night's game against Buffalo what he would
do if coach Larry Robinson told him he'd be playing, Fiset said,
``I'm going to tell him, `Play Jamie, he's winning.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he is considering playing Fiset against Edmonton
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Fizz is our main guy,'' Robinson said. ``This is
just an opportunity for Jamie to get in there and get some
much-needed games and a good opportunity for us to see him in more
than two or three games in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr started his career-high 10th consecutive game against
Buffalo. He entered play Thursday with a 6-1 record in his previous
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Of Fiset, Storr said: ``He wants to play, but he's not one to
sit there and whine. He pushes you, but he supports you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange feeling: Winger Donald Audette played his first game
against Buffalo since the Sabres traded him to the Kings last month
for a second-round selection in this year's draft. Audette sat out
the first two-plus months of the season in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking to break market value,'' said Audette, who
signed a two-year, $3.6-million contract with the Kings. ``Buffalo
is a small town. They have their budget. They didn't think I was
worth what (we were) asking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'm sorry about is it took three months to make the
trade. I'm not 22 anymore. At my age (29), this contract was very
important for my future. I lost money and I lost three months of
hockey. The trade could have been done by October.''
</P>
<P>
   Audette's salary this season is prorated for the time he missed
while in his dispute with the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   House of pain: On the injury front, Glen Murray is as optimistic
as he can be under the circumstances, Doug Bodger seems to be
headed in the right direction, and Russ Courtnall is coming along
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the Kings' best all-around forward, tore the medial
collateral ligament in his right knee Saturday against Colorado,
but already is walking without crutches and said his pain is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt like hell,'' Murray said when asked about the moment
of injury, which resulted from a clean check by Colorado's Aaron
Miller. ``It was pain I've never felt before. I wouldn't wish it on
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was being carried off the ice on a stretcher, his kneecap
popped back into place, Murray said. He started flexing the knee
soon after he was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to let this beat me,'' Murray said. ``I want to
beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bodger said he finally is starting to feel better
more than a week after a blind-side check by Phoenix's Dallas Drake
left him with a cervical strain and a bruised shoulder. Drake was
suspended for four games by the NHL for the hit. Bodger said
there's a possibility he will play Saturday against Edmonton. He's
missed four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sort of day by day,'' Bodger said. ``Some days, it's
fine. Some days, it's not as great.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall has been sidelined with a broken ankle since Nov. 18,
but he is hoping to play in about two weeks. He skated Thursday
morning, at times slowly working his way across the ice on one
foot, then skating the other direction across the ice on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to strengthen my legs,'' Courtnall said of the
drill. ``My legs are getting weak. Once I get going, I'm fine.
Starting and stopping is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another injury victim, winger Eric Lacroix, played for the first
time after missing nearly a month with a fractured sternum. Center
Ian Laperriere rejoined the lineup after missing one game with
swelling in his left knee. Had Laperriere been unable to play, Dan
Bylsma would have filled in as the fourth-line center.

CAPITOLS DEFEAT RANGERS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the New York Rangers arrived at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport at 1:30 a.m. on
Thursday, they were hoping to leave with a .500 record and feeling
a little more secure about their playoff hopes. Their hopes went
unfulfilled in a 5-1 defeat on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rangers stuck with the Washington Capitals in the 1-1
first period, they came out lost and lackluster in the second
period. The Capitals scored four consecutive goals and outshot the
Rangers by 15-3 in the period. The four goals in the period matched
their season high.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, we didn't have any emotion,'' said Rangers
Coach John Muckler. ``This team has to be an emotional team to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals (13-20-3), playing before a crowd of 17,832,
entered the game knowing they have to win consistently. They are
ranked 13th in the 14-team Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win all the games as far as I am concerned,''
Capitals Coach Ron Wilson said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals scored 1 minute 14 seconds into the first period.
Michal Pivonka dumped the puck to Peter Bondra, who found Steve
Konowalchuk about 20 feet in front of the net. Konowalchuk beat
goalie Mike Richter to his glove side, putting the Capitals ahead
by 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers (15-17-7) tied the score after Sean Pronger, with
defenders all over him, made an outstanding pass to a wide-open
Manny Malhotra, who slid the puck past goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was generally fast-paced, even though the
Rangers had played four games in the last six nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first period I thought we did a pretty nice job,'' said
Rangers forward Wayne Gretzky. But he said there wasn't much he
could say about the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Brian Leetch, quiet and downcast, said, ``There are
no excuses at this point in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers fell apart in the second period. With just 33
seconds elapsed, Jan Bulis skated around to the right of Richter.
Richter sprawled onto the ice a bit early, and a patient Bulis
found the right corner of the net for a 2-1 Capitals lead. It was
just the fourth goal of the season for Bulis, who had been out most
of the season with an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals kept up the pressure, and just 2:20 later, Craig
Berube, known primarily for his penalty minutes, scored from the
top of the left circle, beating Richter on the far post for a 3-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Klee scored his fifth goal of the season at 6:30, taking a
pass after Andrei Nikolishin got a rebound, putting the Rangers
down by three goals.
</P>
<P>
   The period was not over for the Rangers, who looked listless and
worn. Bondra slid a quick pass to Sergei Gonchar, and while Richter
was trying to slide over, Gonchar found the open part of the net at
18:13 to end the second period outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson did not bask in his team's victory. ``I think our
confidence will grow a little bit,'' he said, ``but I can look on
the other hand and say we were able to take advantage of a very
tired team.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig also commented on how listless the Rangers seemed. ``They
were a tired hockey team,'' he said. ``It was their third game in
four nights and they looked tired out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will have two days to regroup before they face the
Tampa Bay Lightning, which has the worst record in the National
Hockey League.

BOEING RECEIVED ORDERS FOR 656 PLANES IN '96
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co., the world's leading commercial aircraft maker,
announced on Thursday night that it had received orders for 656
planes in 1998, 15 percent more than the 568 ordered a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of the 1998 orders totaled $42.1 billion, compared
with $42.8 billion in 1997, because the company sold more
narrow-body jets last year, which are less expensive than its
wide-body models.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear whether Boeing's orders for 1998 surpassed
those of Airbus Industrie, its only rival in the commercial
aircraft business.
</P>
<P>
   The European consortium, which is to release 1998 production and
delivery figures on Monday, had more than 500 orders as of the end
of November.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt by the economic slump in Asia and a litany of production
and delivery problems, Boeing sought to put the best face on its
annual production and delivery data. In a news release hours after
the stock market had closed, Boeing said the figures showed it
``continued to increase its presence in the worldwide fleet in
1998, delivering more than two of every three commercial airlines
of 100 seats or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing releases airplane orders monthly, the figures
released on Thursday night are the most comprehensive for the year
and include some previously unannounced orders.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures also illustrate that while the company's order
backlog remains healthy, fewer customers are purchasing its most
expensive and profitable airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company said it expected to deliver a record
620 aircraft in 1999, surpassing the record of 563 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also said it has delivered nearly 12,500 commercial jets,
accounting for about three of every four jets in service.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was hampered by production problems throughout 1998. Late
last year it said it expected to trim 48,000 of its 233,000
employees worldwide through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Its share price, which hit a 1998 high of $50 in July, has
traded as low as $30.875. It closed on Thursday at $35.8125 cents,
down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

OLD SENATE CHAMBER: A SETTING FOR DEBATES AND ORATORY OF LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ceremonial Old Senate Chamber where 100
senators plan to discuss impeachment on Friday in a rare bipartisan
caucus has been the site of legendary events and debates in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The semicircular two-story chamber, designed after ancient
amphitheaters, was home to the Senate for 40 years, beginning in
1819. Within its gold-and-crimson adorned rooms, impassioned
debates about slavery and states' rights ensued, the Missouri
Compromise of 1820 was brokered and the Webster-Clay-Calhoun
orations echoed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's membership grew along with the country's expansion
in the 19th century, first requiring renovations of the old chamber
and then relocation of the Senate to its current wing of the
Capitol. By 1860, the Supreme Court had claimed the grand
surroundings as its own and the chamber remained the justices'
quarters for 75 years, until 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Until its restoration for the Bicentennial in 1976, the chamber
was used for meetings. Following its refurbishing, with
reproductions of 64 mahogany desks and chairs from an 1819 design,
the chamber has been open to the public as a museum. On occasion,
Congress has used it for special ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   According to the curator's office of the Architect of the
Capitol, the east wall's gallery has eight columns of marble
quarried along the Potomac River. A portrait of George Washington
by Rembrandt Peale hangs above the east gallery. The desk for the
vice president, as president of the Senate, has a canopy with
crimson fabric hanging from a mahogany valance. A semi-circular
skylight bordered by five smaller skylights is at the center of the
half-domed ceiling. Many of the chamber's modern day furnishings
are based on period illustrations, particularly an 1842 engraving
by Thomas Doney.

TRESPASSER ARRESTED AT BRAD PITT'S HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Fixes lede to clarify day and time of incident.) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After crawling into an open window at actor Brad
Pitt's Hollywood estate early Thursday morning, 19-year-old Athena
Rolando got comfy by slipping into his sweats, sneakers and beanie
cap before falling fast asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando was abruptly awakened by Pitt's regular caretaker at 10
a.m., who found the star-struck intruder in an upstairs bedroom
wearing Pitt's blue hat, green sweat shirt, black sweat pants and
tennis shoes, said Sgt. Willie Guerrero of the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt, who just completed filming ``The Fight Club,'' was not
home at the time. Rolando knew she had entered Pitt's home, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that she put on his clothes because she was cold,''
Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   The caretaker swiftly called police, who arrested her for
trespassing under a private person's arrest, Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Rolando used a chair to crawl in through the open
window. Because she did not force entry and police found she did
not intend to steal his property, they declined to seek burglary
charges. Rolando was arrested on suspicion of trespassing and held
at the LAPD's Hollywood jail in lieu of $500 bail for the
misdemeanor, police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Pitt was at a meeting in Los Angeles and aware of
the intruder, but did not wish to comment on the incident,
according to his agent at Century City, Calif.-based BWR.

ROBITAILLE REACHES 500-GOAL MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Luc Robitaille has reached 500, and the Kings
continue to creep closer to .500.
</P>
<P>
   It figured Robitaille would get there first.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old left wing scored the 499th and 500th goals of
his 13-year career, becoming the 27th player in NHL history to
reach the milestone as the Kings defeated the Buffalo Sabres 4-2
Thursday night before a crowd of 10,821 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille became the sixth left wing in NHL history to score
500 goals, scoring on a 3-on-2 rush by redirecting a feed from
rookie right wing Pavel Rosa past Buffalo goalie Dwayne Roloson
with 1:46 to play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He had scored his 499th goal 2:48 into the game, when he
one-timed a cross-ice feed from Rob Blake past Roloson with the
Kings enjoying a two-man advantage. Robitaille leads the Kings with
22 goals and has scored 12 in his last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille reached the 500-goal mark in 928 games, 12th fastest
among those to reach the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kings (15-21-3), the victory was their seventh in the
last eight games, and their season-high fifth in a row. Rosa and
Sandy Moger also scored for the Kings, who are as close to the .500
mark as they've been since they were 6-12-3 on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings caught a break when coach Lindy Ruff of the Sabres
(21-10-5) opted to start Dwayne Roloson in goal rather than
two-time Most Valuable Player Dominik Hasek, who was given a rare
night off 24 hours after recording an overtime victory over the
Mighty Ducks at the Pond. It was just the fifth appearance for
Roloson this season.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing Roloson could have done to prevent
Robitaille's first goal, and with 1:37 to play in the first period,
Rosa padded the Kings' lead, tapping a weak shot by Jozef Stumpel
into the net after Roloson was unable to control the puck. With the
goal, Rosa drew to within 497 of Robitaille, and he has 10 points
in 10 games since the Kings recalled him last month from the Long
Beach Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But 11 seconds later, Kings goalie Jamie Storr got caught
wandering out of his net, and Vaclav Varada cut Buffalo's deficit
to one goal, scoring on a wraparound.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings regained the two-goal lead 5:52 into the second period
when Moger scored from the slot off a centering feed from Ian
Laperriere. Referee Dennis LaRue was signaling a delayed penalty on
Buffalo when Moger scored his second goal this season and his first
since Oct. 25 at Carolina. It was Moger's second game back in the
lineup after missing 17 games with a strained lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, though, the Sabres rallied, getting a power-play
goal from Michael Peca, who scored the game-winner Wednesday over
the Mighty Ducks. Peca scored 8:01 into the second period when he
picked a centering feed from ex-King Dixon Ward out of the air and
bunted it past Storr from point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres got an excellent opportunity to even the score less
than a minute later when Rosa received a double-minor penalty for
high-sticking Buffalo defenseman Jay McKee. But the Sabres were
unable to generate much offense during the four-minute advantage,
and shortly after Rosa's penalty expired, Storr made a sprawling
save on a wraparound attempt by Miroslav Satan, enabling the Kings
to carry their tenuous 3-2 lead into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   With eight minutes remaining in the game, Storr again stopped
Satan on a wraparound, and with less than six minutes to play, a
Matt Johnson deflection came within a goal post of giving the Kings
a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, however, didn't miss when given his opportunity, and
his 500th goal sealed the victory for the Kings. &UR; !end! &QL;

QUAYLE MUM ON FUTURE, OUTCOME OF CLINTON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Quayle says he has ``a campaign or two left in me.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a dinner in Tempe on Thursday night honoring the founders
of Kids Voting Arizona, the former vice president remained coy,
saying, ``That's a subject for another time.''
</P>
<P>
   That other time likely would be mid-April, Quayle said. If he
finds the political waters favorable, he would announce his
presidential candidacy for 2000 then and in his home state of
Indiana, despite recently reclaiming his Arizona roots.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spent his school years in the Valley. He and wife Marilyn
now live in Paradise Valley with their three children. He also is a
member of the board of directors of Central Newspapers Inc., which
publishes ``The Arizona Republic'' and two daily newspapers in
Indianapolis, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony honored Max Jennings, R.R. ``Bob'' Evans and
Charles Wahlheim for their creation 10 years ago of the pilot
program that brings schoolchildren into the voting booth at each
national election. It has since spread to nearly every other state
as Kids Voting USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' this year joined the Kids Voting coalition and
co-sponsored Thursday's event with the East Valley Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Other individuals honored were business volunteer Carolyn
Parrish; Susan Harrison, principal of Islands Elementary School in
Gilbert; and former Gov. Rose Mofford.
</P>
<P>
   In his keynote speech, Quayle emphasized the importance of
enthusiastic voters within a democracy and said that programs such
as Kids Voting promote such values.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need that spirit today more than ever in the history of our
republic,'' Quayle said, looking boyish, rested and ready to run
again for national office _ with Marilyn's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad politicians are sent to Washington by good people who
don't vote,'' he said, noting that through Kids Voting children are
inspiring their parents to return to the polling booth.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he has learned from his students at Thunderbird _
The American Graduate School of International Management in
Glendale that ``people want to believe in the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reclaim the value and virtue of integrity,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   On the day when the U.S. Senate opened the impeachment trial of
President Clinton, Quayle _ once mocked for his unabashed stand on
family values _ predicted ``honesty and integrity are poised for a
big comeback in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   After his remarks, he told reporters that he does not miss the
Senate, even during such historic times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's beyond me,'' he said. ``I've moved on in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle did say he never would have believed that only the second
impeachment of a U.S. president would occur in his lifetime. He had
no prediction for the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Banking that the electorate will vote for change in the White
House in 2000, looking for someone with more traditional moral
values, Quayle said he just might be that candidate. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE LOSES IN 2 OTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fall behind with a disinterested opening to the
second half, stage an energetic comeback in the final minutes and
then lose in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Or double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a familiar ring to it. Eerily familiar in that it may
symbolize what Cal State Northridge is all about.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in three games it happened, and early in the
Big Sky season it's put the Matadors two games behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
   After rallying from a 12-point deficit late in the second half,
the Matadors were beaten by Portland State 93-90 in double overtime
Thursday in front of a boisterous 1,067 at home.
</P>
<P>
   It dropped CSUN (9-6) to 1-2 in the Big Sky while the Vikings
(9-3) moved to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's overtime or quadruple overtime, it's
1-2,'' CSUN forward Jeff Parris said. ``You have to win at home. To
win the Big Sky, you have to win at home.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was led in scoring by Derrick Higgins' 18 points, though it
came on 5-of-14 shooting. Forward Taplar Mvogo led Portland State
with 21 points on 9-of-10 shooting. He also grabbed 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our post guys were not good,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said.
``I think their big guys got big rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland State, which missed its last four free throws of
regulation, took an 83-79 lead with 22.2 seconds to play in the
first overtime. Jason Crowe hit a 3-pointers to pull the Matadors
within 83-82.
</P>
<P>
   After a Jamie Snook free throw, CSUN's Carl Holmes pushed it
into a second overtime when he put back the rebound of Crowe's miss
with 0.9 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The second overtime was much of the same. Portland State getting
out to a lead and the Matadors trying to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vikings, who were 3-13 in Big Sky road games the last
two years, again built a 91-88 lead on Mvogo's tip-in with 49.5
seconds left before a mental breakdown cost the Matadors a precious
possession. Crowe, who was splendid down the stretch, was nabbed on
a five-second call while setting the offense to give the Vikings
back the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe had two more opportunities to atone for the meltdown, but
his runner from six feet clanked off the side of the backboard with
seven seconds left and Portland State leading 92-90.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it again, I probably would have gone more
inside (on the first miss,'' said Crowe, who scored 15 points and
had six assists. ``It's a shot I feel I can hit, but I took a bad
angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Ball's free throw with four seconds left gave the Vikings
a 93-90 lead. Following a timeout, Crowe's last attempt from 30
feet was swiped away by Ball as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes pulled the Matadors within 91-90 on a pair of free
throws. In fact, the Matadors' last lead was 70-68 with 1:55 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors trailed 66-54 with 5:36 to play in regulation
before the energy and enthusiasm returned to their defense. Not
coincidentally, it happened when Parris began asserting himself on
the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, which lacked the patience to work for an open shot after
blowing a 10-point halftime lead, began pounding the ball inside.
It helped Parris get to the free-throw line, which ignited a 15-0
run.
</P>
<P>
   But CSUN needed a lay-in by Brian Heinle with 16.5 remaining in
regulation to knot it at 72-72, and the Matadors forced overtime
when Higgins blocked Hasan Artharee's 4-footer at the buzzer.

UCLA TRIPPED BY OREGON STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ This was supposed to be the easy game, the
easiest road game of the Pac-10 season. Instead, bad shooting, bad
defense, freshman jitters and sophomore sloppiness turned it into
one of UCLA's worst losses in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than Princeton? Without a doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than the Massacre in Maples? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   This was Oregon State, after all, the Pac-10's perennial cellar
dwellar with a November loss to Athletes in Action on its resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined losing to Oregon State,'' UCLA senior guard
Brandon Loyd said after a 65-63 loss to the Beavers on Thursday,
before 7,232 at Gill Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the thing: Oregon State didn't muster a performance
for the ages or stun UCLA with good breaks and lucky shots. Time
and again, the bumbling Beavers (22 turnovers) tried to hand UCLA
the game. The Bruins were so bad, they couldn't take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our first real test in terms of going on the road in
conference, and obviously, we failed,'' said UCLA coach Steve
Lavin. ``We showed lack of discipline on defense and lack of
discipline on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   In losing to Oregon State for the first time since 1993, the
Bruins (10-3, 2-1) wasted the competitive advantage gained when
they defeated Arizona last weekend. In the roughest Pac-10 ever,
their margin for error is microscopic. This was a game they had to
win to keep pace with Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Now, stunned and staggered, they have two days to regroup before
facing Oregon in McArthur Court, the Pac-10's rowdiest arena.
</P>
<P>
   By then, perhaps, freshmen JaRon Rush, Dan Gadzuric and Jerome
Moiso will have found their composure and their shooting strokes.
Combined, they made 4 of 28 shots. Moiso and Gadzuric were so
ineffective the Bruins played long stretches without either,
leaving 6-6 Travis Reed to play center.
</P>
<P>
   But the freshmen were not totally at fault. Far from it.
Sophomore guards Baron Davis and Earl Watson played like rookies as
well, making 11 of 36 shots and committing 10 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite shooting 28.4 percent (a season low) and committing 29
fouls, UCLA had a chance to win until Davis committed two turnovers
in the final 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were giving us the game,'' Davis said. ``But, in the
clutch, I had two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the road, you have to be at the top of your game, and we
played terrible. I lost the game. I take complete responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Flustered and frustrated throughout the first half, UCLA
appeared to regain its poise early in the second, when Ryan Bailey
buried a jumper and found Rush for a layup that narrowed Oregon
State's lead to 41-40. A timeout calmed the Beavers, and they
ambushed the Bruins out of the break. Josh Steinthal hit two
3-pointers _ the second coming with 8:30 left and giving Oregon
State a 49-41 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey temporarily quieted the crowd with a 3-pointer, then Rush
converted an offensive rebound. But the Beavers did not wilt.
Deaundra Tanner found Clifton Jones for a layup, then scored from
the right baseline with five minutes left to give Oregon State a
56-46 lead, its biggest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins had time for a final lunge. Watson stroked a
3-pointer from the right wing, and, two possessions later, Davis
made a hanging jumper from the lane, slicing the deficit to 57-51.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of attacking, the Beavers backed out and worked the shot
clock to single digits. Five seconds remained when Tanner made a
3-pointer from the top of the key, in Watson's face, with 2:40
left.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Young hit two free throws, then Rush kept the Bruins alive
with an offensive rebound. As he stumbled out of bounds, he somehow
passed to Davis underneath for a basket. He was fouled, and the
three-point play pulled UCLA within 61-56.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:27 left, Young struck again, driving hard through the
right side of Oregon State's defense for a layup. Over the next
minute, the Beavers would make just two free throws, and when Loyd
hit a 3-pointer from the left corner, UCLA trailed 64-61.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Jones missed two free throws with 36 seconds left, but
Davis, hurried and out of control, lost the ball twice. At the
buzzer, UCLA watched helplessly as Oregon State fans stormed the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to flush this out,'' Reed said. ``Because we're going
to face a far better team in Oregon.''

USC'S DAVIS FACES SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive tackle Ennis Davis suffered knee
ligament damage in the Sun Bowl and may not be fully recovered in
time for the Trojans' season-opener against Hawaii in September.
</P>
<P>
   Davis injured his left knee during USC's 28-19 loss to Texas
Christian University. Originally, Davis' injury was diagnosed as a
sprained knee but ligament damage was detected upon USC's return to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who will have surgery either late this week or next week,
is expected to need at least nine months to rehabilitate. He was a
key performer for USC's defense this season and perhaps its
most-improved lineman.
</P>
<P>
   The Reseda High School graduate was an All-Pacific-10 Conference
first-team performer, with 47 tackles, including 13 for loss, and
three sacks. He also broke up four passes.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: USC has received an oral commitment from
offensive lineman Lenny Vandermade of Mater Dei. Vandermade (6-3,
265 pounds) is the second offensive lineman from Orange County to
commit to the Trojans, joining Nate Steinbacher of Esperanza High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Big weekend: USC's recruiting resumes this weekend, with some of
the players scheduled to visit including offensive lineman Bryce
Bohlander of Salem (Ore.) McNary, defensive back Ricky Manning of
Fresno Edison, linebacker Omar Nazel of Oakland Skyline and
linebacker Lance Briggs of Sacramento Elk Grove.

SEAHAWKS SHOULD HIRE HOLMGREN, AND END DECADE OF DECAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Much has been made of the rare playoff appearances
this year of the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons and New York
Jets, franchises that have broken out this century with the
frequency of bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL pity party has not been entirely forsaken.
</P>
<P>
   There remains the Seattle Seahawks. They do not lead the NFL
futility race, but trail only by the flare of a nostril.
</P>
<P>
   Excepting recent expansion teams Carolina and Jacksonville, only
Tampa Bay and New Orleans have played fewer postseason games than
the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy hadn't even met Ricky the last time the Cardinals won a
playoff game. But after beating the Dallas Cowboys, the most
prolific postseason team in history last weekend, the Cardinals
have surrendered the lead in consecutive seasons without playoffs
to the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The decade of decay needs to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Hire Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Now.
</P>
<P>
   The Head Cheese spent Thursday in the company of Seahawks
president Bob Whitsitt, who squired him around Seattle and Kirkland
before dining with owner Paul Allen. But the swarming media horde
at the team's headquarters went away storyless Thursday night,
because no deal had been concluded, fueling skepticism that the
Seahawks would again let one slip off the fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   If Whitsitt blows this one, he should make history _ the first
pro sports executive to be fired by two teams in the same city.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows Holmgren took the Green Bay Packers to the last
two Super Bowls, winning one. Consider also that he and John Madden
are the only coaches in NFL history to win at least one playoff
game in five straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the man has not been connected with a losing record
since coaching in high school more than 20 years ago. He has been a
winner in his pro jobs in Green Bay and San Francisco, and in his
college career at BYU and San Francisco State.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody around the Seahawks can say that kind of thing. Mostly
because they've been around the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Losing is the Seahawks' legacy. It has become part of the
franchise fabric. The last two years are good examples. A decent
coach, good talent and a high payroll could do no better than break
even.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a man of Holmgren's resume and accomplishments to
end decisively the culture of mediocrity that makes the Seahawks
such a non-entity in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Bill Russell, a champion as player and coach and
another San Franciscan, was hired by the Sonics in the early 1970s
has Seattle sports seen such a luminous national figure check out a
local sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens' second tenure as Sonics coach brought Seattle its
only major pro sports championship in 1979, but his appointment
early in the 1977-78 season was an unheralded patch job after he
was already in the Sonic front office.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' 1993 hiring of Lou Piniella had cachet after his
Cincinnati Reds won the 1990 World Series, which followed modest
success as one of dozens of managers under George Steinbrenner in
New York. But Piniella has never been held in the same regard among
his peers as Holmgren is in football.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other time have the Seahawks hired a head coach in his
prime. Chuck Knox had playoff teams in Los Angeles and Buffalo, and
he took the Seahawks to all the postseason wins in their history
(three). But he never reached the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Flores won the 1984 Super Bowl with the Oakland Raiders, but
that was also when Al Davis had his wits about him and called most
of the shots. By the time Flores was hired by the Seahawks in 1992,
he was well past his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a buff resume merely gets a coach through the door.
Immediate job performance gets them out the door, as Russell,
Wilkens, Knox and Flores all found out.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren represents about as sure a bet on immediate job success
as can be made in the freakish world of big-time coaching. The only
issue is whether he can co-exist with Whitsitt, a man of massive
ego himself who has about the same control issues as Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of pro football in an era of genuine free agency
mitigates against success in what Holmgren wants _ the dual role of
coach and general manager. But the fact that Denver's Mike
Shanahan, Miami's Jimmy Johnson and New York's Bill Parcells have
pulled off the two-headed beast suggests the task is less than
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' vice president of football operations, Randy
Mueller, is willing and able to take a lesser role in deference to
Holmgren. Allen will be happy to make him the game's highest-paid
coach.
</P>
<P>
   The largest remaining issue is whether Whitsitt can give up some
ground as Allen's sports general. It's a risk, because Holmgren's
obsessive need to run it his way can chase the franchise into yet
another blind alley.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitsitt doesn't know football, and doesn't have a better
option. The risk is well worth the reward.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, the worst that can happen is that the Seahawks flop, he
gets fired and takes over the Mariners, which is as close to
permanent sports employment as it gets around here.

HOLMGREN CHEWING ON SEAHAWKS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ After meeting with Seahawks president Bob Whitsitt
for most of the day, Green Bay Packers coach Mike Holmgren left the
team's headquarters Thursday night to have dinner with owner Paul
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Was it just food for thought? Or a meal to make a deal?
</P>
<P>
   Neither side was tipping its hand _ Whitsitt, or Holmgren and
his agent, Bob LaMonte.
</P>
<P>
   But when Dennis Erickson was fired last week, Whitsitt was asked
about Allen's involvement in the process of hiring a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect when we get down to the final meeting of our
choice, that Paul will be in the meeting,'' Whitsitt said. ``It is
important for the head coach to know who the owner is and for the
owner to know who the coach is, and to have that chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul won't be involved in the process until we get to that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who had been out of town, became involved Thursday night,
prompting speculation that if the team's owner agreed to the length
and financial terms of a contract and the parameters of Holmgren's
power as general manager and coach, a deal could be completed as
early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting his whirlwind tour, which is supposed to include
weekend visits to the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles,
LaMonte said Holmgren's priorities in selecting a new team would be
strong ownership, complete control of the football operation and a
state-of-the-art stadium and practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem was expected to be determining just how much
power Holmgren would have in his dual role of GM and coach. But a
league source said Thursday night that a major sticking point with
Holmgren is accessibility to Allen, who attends most home games but
is rarely at the team's headquarters and has minimal contact with
management or players other than Whitsitt.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Thursday night's dinner with Allen was so vital to
Holmgren, who pushed for meetings with the owners in each of the
three cities he is scheduled to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports earlier in the day that Holmgren might delay his
trip to Baltimore, the Ravens are expecting Holmgren to keep his
appointment. The club has chartered a jet that is scheduled to fly
Holmgren, his wife, Kathy, and their youngest daughter, Gretchen,
to Baltimore at noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What Whitsitt said last week, and what happened Thursday night
when Allen hosted Holmgren for dinner at his Mercer Island estate,
were more revealing than anything that was said when Whitsitt and
Holmgren left the team's headquarters Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a good day. It's been productive,'' Whitsitt
said, facing a row of six TV cameras and three print photographers
and surrounded by a dozen newspaper reporters. ``Obviously, we
still have more conversations to continue with, which we will do
into the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren declined to talk with reporters, but offered in a
statement: ``We have had a good day getting to know Bob, Randy
(Mueller, vice president of football operations) and the
organization and we will continue to talk. I've been impressed with
a number of things, including the design of the new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have been aggressively interested in Holmgren all
along. When the Packers were eliminated from the playoffs with
Sunday's loss to the 49ers, the Seahawks were the first team to
call to ask permission to speak with Holmgren _ at 7 a.m. Monday.
It was then, a league source said Thursday night, that the club
said it could offer a five-year, $21 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren has one year left on his contract with the Packers but
was given a clause last February that provided a 21-day window that
allows him to accept a GM/coach position with another club.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was flown to Seattle from Green Bay on Allen's private
jet Wednesday and taken to a downtown hotel in a stretch limousine.
He meet with Whitsitt for more than two hours at the hotel Thursday
morning, before they met for five more hours at the team's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to the team's complex, Holmgren talked with
Mueller, toured the facility and saw models of the new stadium that
is scheduled to open for the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   While Holmgren was busy with that, his wife and daughter toured
the campus at Seattle Pacific University. A senior in high school,
Gretchen reportedly called the school last week to inquire about
enrolling next fall.

SONICS DROP PLANS TO PURSE JAYSON WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day to absorb the finer points of the NBA's new
collective bargaining agreement brought about a sharp dose of
reality for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   The retooling plan team president Wally Walker and his staff
spent sixth months formulating is as good as a $3 bill. Because of
unexpected limitations with the new salary cap system, the prospect
of the Sonics signing an impact front line player, let alone New
Jersey's Jayson Williams, is about as real as a pro wrestler's
elbow smash.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Sonics must change their strategy for free-agent
shopping. Their priority now is retaining most of their own free
agents and filling in gaps at guard and small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our front line is in good shape both depth wise and skill
wise,'' said Walker, regretfully acknowledging that certain players
are off his most-wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the right player appears to fill our (rebounding) needs, of
course, we're going to look at them. But we have some other needs,
too. We definitely need some ballhandling. We've got only two
guards under contract. We need another player who can backup
(Detlef Schrempf).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have six players under contract _ Schrempf, Jim
McIlvaine, Vin Baker, Hersey Hawkins, Gary Payton and Aaron
Williams. The team drafted 7-footer Vladimir Stepania, 6-11 Rashard
Lewis and 6-11 Jelani McCoy _ each of whom Walker says is skilled
enough to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, though, clearly anticipated having enough cap room
to go after an established front-line player.
</P>
<P>
   The team was counting on a salary cap of $32 million. The
league's new labor agreement calls for a $30 million cap, and the
Sonics already have a payroll that exceeds $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is likely to go up considering the league's newest
cap rule: For each roster spot open, $300,000 is applied to a
team's cap figure. With six players signed and one first-round
draft pick, the Sonics will see an additional $1.5 million
($300,000 multiplied by five) added to their cap before they spend
$1.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics could be less than $3 million under the cap _ nearly
$5 million less than they anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is a fair deal for everyone. There are some
changes that don't give us as much flexibility that we thought we
had a couple of days ago,'' Walker said. ``But long-term, it will
all come out in the wash. What won't help us near-term will help us
in a couple of years. We'll just make the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics would have to consider a trade in order to clear
enough cap room to lure a top-notch free agent such as Williams.
According to sources, Hawkins' name is again at the center of
several trade scenarios involving the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said nothing is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have absolutely nothing working on a trade front,'' Walker
said. ``(Coach) Paul (Westphal) has looked at a lot of tape and
likes what he's heard and seen of guys coming back. I would
anticipate going to camp with that group, figuring we'll add around
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said his wish is to secure veteran players, who are
versatile and can handle the ball. A main priority will be finding
a guard who can dribble and distribute well enough to allow Payton
to play without the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manipulation of the cap is going to be huge,'' Westphal said.
`` ... It's fun to read about, but realistically a lot of these
people we can't pursue. It's fun to talk about, but it doesn't mean
anything. The salary cap has tied our hands in some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics would like to retain small forwards Dale Ellis and
James Cotton, and backup point guard Greg Anthony. They also are
interested in keeping power forward Jerome Kersey.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Cotton, each of those players falls under the Larry
Bird Exception _ a clause that allows teams to sign its own players
without regard to the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement also includes a ``middle class'' exception,
which can be used by teams each year that exceed the salary cap.
There is a $1 million exception that can be used every other year
by teams over the cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics cannot benefit from the $1 million exception because
they used it last year to sign Williams and Kersey. The team will
have the $1.75 million available should it go over the cap.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics want to keep their own free agents, they will
likely compete with the clock and offers from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee, Portland and New York are said to be interested in
Cotton. San Antonio is prepared to give Ellis its $1.75 million
exception _ something Ellis may jump at considering the Sonics did
not pick up his $1.9 million option after last season.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, who had a solid year as Payton's backup, might be
looking for a starting position and the pay that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Sonics go over the cap, they can sign any number of
players at the league minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The way the new agreement is configured will force some tough
decisions for Walker. The Sonics can still fill their rebounding
void in free agency, although it will have to be with a second- or
third-tier player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more realistic about what free agents fit where
we are cap-wise,'' Walker said. ``I think we'll be able to narrow
it down rather quickly. We'll definitely be aggressive. But we want
to be realistic about who we can sign with the amount of cap room
we have. We're not going to have a lot of time to waste.''

NORTHRIDGE DIGS HOLE WITH LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was scintillating and dramatic and full of
emotional rushes and last-second shots.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means diddly-squat to Cal State Northridge, which
is already in a precarious situation a week into the Big Sky
season.
</P>
<P>
   After boasting about having the most talented team in school
history and making a run at the league crown, the Matadors are
already two games behind Northern Arizona thanks to exciting but
erratic play.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example came Thursday, after two overtimes and a
pair of CSUN comebacks. But Portland State still left CSUN gym with
a 93-90 double-overtime win Thursday in front of a season-high
1,067, and with it chopped away a piece of the Matadors' strut.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (9-6, 1-2 Big Sky) had its five-game home winning streak
snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's overtime or quadruple overtime, it's
1-2,'' CSUN forward Jeff Parris said. ``You have to win at home. To
win the Big Sky, you have to win at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors' penchant for dramatic finishes masks what is a
rapidly growing trend, not to mention a concern.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in three games, CSUN played uninspired the
first 10 minutes of the second half, which drastically changed the
complexion of a game.
</P>
<P>
   To go inside that, look no further than the evening CSUN guard
Jason Crowe experienced. Most of the time he was splendid, rallying
CSUN in regulation and in the first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the last minute of the second overtime he was nabbed
on a five-second call while setting the offense. It gave the
Vikings the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He had two more opportunities to atone for the meltdown, but his
runner from six feet clanked off the side of the backboard with
seven seconds left and Portland State leading 92-90.
</P>
<P>
   And Crowe's and CSUN's night ended when he was stripped by
Portland State's Reggie Ball 30 feet from the basket as he went up
for a game-tying 3-pointer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it again, I probably would have gone more
inside (on the first miss),'' said Crowe who scored 15 points and
had six assists. ``It's a shot I feel I can hit, but I took a bad
angle.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was led in scoring by Derrick Higgins' 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Taplar Mvogo led Portland State with 21 points on 9-of-10
shooting. He also grabbed 13 rebounds while forward Jason Hartman,
a Thousand Oaks High product, added 18 points before fouling out in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our post guys were not good,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said.
``I think their big guys got big rebounds, especially (Mvogo's)
tip-in in the second overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago CSUN fell behind to Northern Arizona by 20 points
early in the second half before forcing overtime and then blew a
double-digit second-half lead against Idaho State before winning at
the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   And after taking a 43-33 lead at the half against a Portland
State squad that was 3-13 on the road in its Big Sky life, CSUN
allowed the Vikings (9-3, 2-0) to start the second half with a 26-6
run.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Matadors did fight back. Again and again because
they at least do that.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with a 15-0 run in regulation to take a 69-66 lead.
Then they battled to force overtime when Brian Heinle scored on a
layup with 16.5 seconds left to make it 72-72 before Higgins
blocked Hasan Artharee's 6-footer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   And CSUN rallied again in the first overtime, overcoming a
four-point deficit on a 3-pointer by Crowe and a Carl Holmes'
putback with 0.9 seconds left to tie it 84-84.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phew, it's frustrating,'' Parris said. ``Really frustrating.''
</P>

ROBITAILLE REACHES MILESTONE
</HEADLINE>
 - LBPT (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It was exactly the type of goal it was supposed to
be, a late-game pressure situation, the Kings clinging to a lead,
and Luc Robitaille driving to the net.
</P>
<P>
   The pass came from rookie Pavel Rosa, and the 32-year-old
Robitaille made little more than a subtle deflection, but that was
all that was needed for his second goal Thursday night, his 22nd of
the season, and the 500th of his 13-year National Hockey League
career.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille was mobbed by his teammates, and the goal, with 1:46
to play, secured the Kings' 4-2 victory over goalie Dwayne Roloson
and the Buffalo Sabres before a Forum crowd of 10,821.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to get it out of the way,'' Robitaille said
after becoming the 27th player and sixth left wing in NHL history
to score 500 goals. ``But most important is the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille then showed he was human after all when asked if he
felt he had proven wrong those who had discounted his talents
throughout a career that began when he was selected by the Kings
with the 171st choice in the 1984 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever didn't believe in me,'' Robitaille said, ``well, screw
them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson added, ``In Luc's case, a lot of
people don't give him enough credit for how hard he's worked on his
skating. You don't get 500 goals by being lucky, no pun intended.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, 21, counted himself among the fortunate. In his 10th NHL
game, Rosa came close to saying that assisting on the historic goal
was on a par with scoring two goals in his first game last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my hero growing up,'' said Rosa, a native of the Czech
Republic. ``Sure, I was following Wayne Gretzky and Jaromir Jagr,
but I had Luc's picture on the wall. The only thing I can say is I
wish I could go as far as him. He has a lot of passion for the
sport, and he's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Kings (15-21-3), the victory was their seventh in the
last eight games, and their season-high fifth in a row. Rosa and
Sandy Moger scored the Kings' other goals.
</P>
<P>
   Vaclav Varada and Michael Peca scored for the Sabres (21-10-5),
who used Roloson in goal rather than two-time Most Valuable Player
Dominik Hasek, who was given a rare night off 24 hours after
recording an overtime victory over the Mighty Ducks at the Pond. It
was just the fifth appearance for Roloson this season.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing Roloson could have done to prevent
Robitaille's first goal, a one-timer from the right faceoff circle
off a cross-ice feed from Rob Blake with the Kings enjoying a
two-man advantage 2:48 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the first one, you know some nights, you're on,''
said Robitaille, who has scored 12 goals in the last 15 games and
has scored 430 of his goals during two stints with the Kings. ``I
felt good the whole night.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt even better later, and was asked if he planned to send
the puck with which he scored No. 500 to the Hockey Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille held the puck aloft and said, ``I'll keep it. They'll
have to come get it. I've got kids. I have to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robitaille was not ready to attempt to put the historic goal
into any sort of perspective. His resurgence this season - he
already has scored six more goals than all of last season - has him
thinking loftier thoughts, of more goals and maybe even a Stanley
Cup before he retires.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Kings re-acquired Robitaille after he spent three
difficult years away, with Pittsburgh and the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the team that started me and this is the team that
wanted me back,'' Robitaille said. ``It's been great. The whole
comeback here has been great. I feel I'm lucky to be in the NHL.
I'll never take it for granted.''

 &HT;    CLINTON TRIAL IMPERILS REST OF CONGRESSIONAL AGENDA
 &HT;    With CONGRESS-LIST.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton
will slow efforts by leaders of the new Congress to pass major
legislation, members and outside analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   The delay won't necessarily kill chances of passing proposals to
save Social Security and Medicare, or reaching compromises on
issues such as defense and education spending, but it certainly
won't help, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a presidential election coming up in 2000, and that
usually freezes parties into positions that showcase their
stands,'' said political scientist Joseph Cooper at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the window for getting things done is probably nine or 10
months at most,'' Cooper said. ``The most likely result is that
nothing important will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress-watcher Sarah Binder at the Brookings Institution, a
nonpartisan research center in Washington, was slightly more
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangely enough, (incumbents in) both parties might have
incentives to reach agreement on Social Security in 2000, so they
won't have to face the voters without anything to brag about,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she agreed that ``productivity is unlikely'' for other
reasons, such as the ``terribly slim majority margin'' that
Republicans have in the House and sincere differences between
Republicans and Democrats over the best way to handle such
challenges as education, managed health care, tobacco, trade and
banking.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said the effect of impeachment-related delays will be
minimized by the fact that the trial is coming just as a new
Congress convenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing much of substance comes to the Senate floor in January
or February anyway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Committees must get organized, fill out their staffs, hold
hearings and draft bills before the Senate or House even considers
a bill. The process, which involves both chambers and the White
House, is so complex and time-consuming that only eight of the 394
laws enacted in the last Congress were completed during the first
three months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody disputes that action on matters other than impeachment
will be slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said that until the
impeachment trial is over, the 45 Democrats will block Senate
action on ``important legislative work on matters like education,
health care, Medicare and Social Security.'' That should encourage
senators who want to tackle those issues to concentrate on
finishing the trial as soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Democrats block floor votes on legislation, the 55
Republicans can push for progress at the committee level, replied
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we may not be having debate and votes on the floor of the
Senate on bills or on changes in the budget procedures around
here,'' Lott conceded. But he predicted that committee hearings and
meetings held before or after the trial sessions will let senators
``do our very best to get prepared for the regular legislative
process while we're doing our duty with regard to impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it would be hard for senators to concentrate on other
things while they are deciding whether to oust a president,
predicted Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. For example, Senate and House
committees won't even consider Medicare until Congress receives a
report from the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 17-member commission includes five senators, it will
probably miss its March 1 deadline for finding a bipartisan
compromise, McDermott said. ``For anybody to think that senators
are going to be able to spend much time thinking about this issue
... is overly optimistic to say the least,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With 13 senior House Republicans preoccupied with their role as
managers prosecuting Clinton in the Senate trial, action in the
House also could be slowed.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's effects will persist after it ends, political
scientist Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Watergate, where there was a public consensus,''
Cooper said. ``No matter what happens, one-third or more of the
country is going to be mad.''
</P>
<P>
   That will make it harder to unify public sentiment around big
changes in either Social Security or Medicare, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton stays in office, Republicans in Congress still won't
trust him, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, If Clinton is ousted, any honeymoon
period for Vice President Al Gore, who would succeed Clinton, is
likely to be short. ``You're going to be coming into an election,
and Republicans won't want Gore to look too good,'' he explained.

PRO FOOTBALL COULD USE MORE RAZZMATAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the country gets increasingly football crazy with the
approach of Super Bowl MCIV.V _ if that's the number _ it seems to
me the game at the professional level is overrated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say its reputation for being violent, full of wild,
hulking men willing to whip their opponents to a pulp because it
feels good and entertains slack-jawed Americans isn't enough
anymore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know you can see lots of National Football League games in
which people get hurt and get carted off in wheelbarrows and placed
in institutions until they remember what their name is. But, on the
whole, pro football could be much more extreme. In fact, unless it
gets that way it will begin to lose fans and fall on hard times. My
thinking here is influenced by the new-found popularity of
so-called extreme games seen now and then on TV. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe YOU see them on TV. I don't. I've only heard about
them. So I'll have to make up what some of them might be. If you
know anything about these extreme games on TV and find that my
description of them isn't accurate, I'd be grateful if you'd keep
quiet. Many folks out in newspaperland think I know what I'm
talking about. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, in these extreme TV games, you have half-naked people
skiing down icy cliffs while wearing blindfolds. Or billiards
players who, for a cue ball, use a hand-grenade. Or horseback
riders who are Scotch-taped to bucking broncos and given points for
how many arrows they can shoot into a target's bull's-eye while
hanging on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what about pro football? Well, the hulking men are all
dressed up in pads, for heaven's sake. It's hard to imagine how any
part of them ever gets injured, as wrapped up as they are in wads
of plastic and Nerf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I say it's time to force players in this year's Super Bowl to
dress as ruggedly as your average rugby player, which is to say in
nothing but shorts and a rugby shirt. No helmets. No padding. Strap
it on, boys. Be men. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd change the field, too. What, these days, is 100 yards? Why,
it's hardly anything. I'd stretch the field out to at least 300
yards and make it 100 yards wide, too. If touchdowns and field
goals are to be admired for the skill required to score them, let's
raise the level of difficulty. Touchdowns have become way too cheap
in today's NFL games. A 300-yard field would give the offense a
real sense of accomplishment when scoring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd also do away with the level playing field. How difficult is
it to run 300 yards on a flat surface? Heck, even I can do that,
although it might take me the better part of an afternoon. No, I'd
redesign the field to give it a rather large hill near the 150-yard
line and several moguls, creeks and valleys elsewhere. Think of the
fun of breaking tackles to rush up a steep embankment and being
able, eventually, to speed pell-mell down the other side toward the
goal line way off in the distance. Now we're talking some skill,
some endurance and some serious fan interest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'd add other difficulties, too, like making part of the field
an ice rink and another part a sand dune. I'd bring in your
occasional bomber to drop water balloons on the field while the
game is on. Or pumpkins. Or anything else that would liven up the
competition. Jell-O, maybe. And I'd allow the cheerleaders on the
sidelines to leap around on trampolines nude. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, if you put the future of the NFL in my hands,
I'll rescue it from the predictability that now plagues both it and
the stupid pre-game shows. In fact, I'd make it a rule that
pre-game shows cannot run until after the game. Between 2 and 4
a.m. On ESPN-6. &QL;

STARS STAY ON TRACK WHEN ON ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars' franchise-record 15-game winning streak is
expected to face its toughest test since it began with a victory
against the Edmonton Oilers on Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged opponent isn't Phoenix, New Jersey, Detroit or one of
the other elite NHL teams. It's the schedule-maker.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars departed yesterday for a five-game journey to Calgary,
Vancouver, Edmonton, San Jose and Anaheim, their longest road trip
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``This is
the toughest road trip we're going to have all year. I don't think
there's one that's even close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a glance it doesn't appear that difficult. None of the five
teams has a winning record overall, although the Mighty Ducks,
Canucks and Sharks are at .500 or better at home. However, it's the
logistics more than the teams that make it a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1,500-mile flight across one time zone, the Stars are in
Calgary, Alberta, today for a game against the Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, they'll leave the cold climate of Calgary (forecast
high: 10 degrees) and head to the west coast of Canada across
another time zone for a Sunday night game in Vancouver, the last
place they lost.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll say goodbye to a moderate climate (highs in the
40s) and go back to Alberta for a Tuesday night game in frigid
Edmonton, where the forecast high yesterday was minus-2 with a low
of minus-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars leave immediately after the game for the warm climes
of San Jose. After a 1,200-mile flight across another time zone,
going through customs and arriving at about 3:30 a.m., they have a
game that night against the Sharks, who have no trouble getting up
to play the team that knocked them out of the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's down the coast to Anaheim for a Friday night game
against the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the zig-zagging, it's the back-to-back over the border,
it's cold-warm-cold-warm,'' Hitchcock said. ``There's a lot of
built in excuses if we want to use them. They're legit. But I think
our group won't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars rarely need an excuse when it comes to road games.
It's supposed to be tough to play in an opponents' arena, but
Hitchcock's players have won 72 percent of their contests away from
home, best in the league. They lead the NHL with 26 road points.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-game unbeaten streak includes seven victories and two
ties away from Reunion Arena. They've lost once in their past 15
road games. That includes victories in Detroit, Toronto, Colorado
and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our team has a lot of fun in winning in other team's
buildings,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, talent is a factor. But there's more to success away
from home than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the leadership and the experience we have,'' veteran
center Guy Carbonneau said. ``The core of this team has been
together for a long time, and everybody, when they step on the ice,
they know what they have to do. We're a patient team. We don't take
chances, but when we have chances, we're able to put some goals on
the board. Some other teams push too hard and make mistakes and get
out of their game too early. We're not that way. We have a lot of
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano is more productive away from home.
Eight of his 13 goals and 14 of his 26 assists have come in road
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the road you're not trying to put on a show,
you're not trying to be entertaining,'' Modano said. ``At home you
can get caught up in being a little too flashy to get the home
crowd into it. You're not there to be fancy or cute, you just want
to get the job done. That's what sets us apart. We play real
patient, real smart, and we try to grind out those 2-1, 3-2
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of this journey could make it difficult to return
home with the unbeaten streak intact. However, the road warriors
won't give it up without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams that are mature recognize that you're usually gauged by
your ability to win on the road,'' Hitchcock said. ``We want to be
gauged as a good team.''

DID BAYLOR LOSE PLAYER, GAIN A TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Maybe it was Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Baylor played at the level it did in losing a
four-point game to the 18th-ranked team in the land Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the all-out effort had nothing to do with the fact that,
according to several accounts, this beleaguered team has bonded in
the aftermath of the loss of leading scorer Tevis Stukes, who
decided that life was sweeter without coach Harry Miller in it,
even though it meant giving up the game he loves for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I can't imagine anyone not being able to get along
with Miller. Therein lies another story, which we may never know
and maybe isn't really any of our business.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions may be answered as the season progresses.
Maybe even tomorrow when another ranked team _ No. 23 Oklahoma
State _ comes into the Ferrell Center. But for the time being, we
know at least one thing _ even if he has lost Stukes, Harry Miller
doesn't appear to have lost the rest of his team.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Miller the other night where the team that was on
the floor against the Jayhawks had been all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``I just think this team is very, very
focused right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked again if he believed Stukes' exit was part of the cause,
Miller honestly replied, ``I don't know. All I know is I like what
I saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some guys come into my office and tell me they were
rededicating themselves to what we were doing. That the commitment
was going to go to another level and that, from what I was told,
they were speaking for the entire team. And that's what they did _
to a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the man who most exemplified the commitment was
Stukes' roommate _ center Kish Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis conceded the Kansas' presence may have provided extra
juice and then gave strong testament to the rededication factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go out to play a game, we all hold hands and pray,''
Lewis said. ``If you're not in that circle, there's not a whole lot
you can do for us when we go out that door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guys who are in \Rthe circle\S need to keep
working hard. Close is not good enough for me. I'm not going to
accept not working hard and trying to win games. Whatever the
situation may be _ whether we drew a positive from a negative or
whether we just put together a good basketball game, I'm not sure.
But I know we're going to stick together and keep fighting. We're
going to give teams a game every night we play if I have anything
to do with it _ and I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this team can save this coach after the player who
appeared to give him the best chance of saving himself deserted is
conjecture. Miller has a year after this one left on his contract,
which the odds are against his completing. Though Miller refuses to
say, I suspect his dispute with his star player was based on an
issue of character. I'm convinced Miller's remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry's in a tough deal right now,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams
said. ``He needs some help. But we're both lucky. We could have to
work for a living.''
DON'T LOOK NOW So. Rick Barnes' Texas Longhorns (6-8) have won
three consecutive games, four of their past five and have opened
2-0 for the first time in the Big 12. But Barnes, who takes his
team to Nebraska on Sunday, would just as soon not talk about the
rebound from an 0-4 start. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid to talk about it,'' he confessed. ``I just want to
sit back and hope it keeps on going, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   If not for a 56-46 loss to Princeton in Hawaii on Dec. 29, Texas
would be on a five-game winning streak. But Barnes said that loss,
coupled with some two-a-day work on the offense before leaving for
the Outrigger Rainbow Classic, was instrumental in the three
victories hence (Hawaii, Colorado, Iowa State).
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team after the Princeton game that that game proved
one thing that I'd told them all along _ the mental part of this
game is equal to or more important than the physical part,'' Barnes
said. ``Physically, Princeton shouldn't match up. But they knew
what they were doing, what they wanted to do, and they never
deviated.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes cautiously believes the message has gotten through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not by any means a great offensive team yet,'' Barnes
said. ``But even our turnovers are coming within our offense. We've
gotten away from a lot of our circus shots and those type things.
Guys are looking one, two passes ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers are down more than five a game. Chris Mihm and Gabe
Muoneke have been dominant inside in conference wins over Colorado
and Iowa State. In the past six games, Kris Clack is averaging 18
points and eight rebounds and _ get this _ shooting 55 percent from
the floor, 10 percentage points higher than his career average.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what's going on in the Burnt Orange room these days?
HILL CLIMBER FOR CONRADT Texas' women have a big game tomorrow when
No. 20 Nebraska (13-2, 2-0) visits. And surprisingly, one of the
Cornhuskers' major concerns will be stopping Jody Conradt's new
off-the-bench, instant-offense machine _ Del Valle freshman Asha
Hill. In the past four game, the 5-foot-9 guard has averaged 17.4
points and netted 11 of 18 3-pointers. Previously, she carried a
1.3-point average. But it was defense _ not her offense _ that has
gotten her into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the lights turn on, Asha is pretty amazing,'' Conradt
said. ``It's taken her a while to learn that you have to play both
ends. But she's talented and has a great understanding of the game.
She'll be a big part of what we do from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Better guard depth from her still-young club has enabled Conradt
to shift emphasis to the pressing defensive style she loves, which
has triggered a much-improved transition game that in turn has led
to offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to establish our personality, to become the
transition team that will get in your face defensively,'' Conradt
said. ``Our intensity has picked up and, hopefully, that will be
the Texas team people see from now on. We're taking giant steps now
instead of baby ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns (7-5, 1-1) won their Big 12 opener over Colorado
(83-65), then lost Tuesday night at No. 16 Iowa State (71-68), when
Megan Taylor hit a last-second, 3-point prayer off an inbounds
play. Some good news, though. When Conradt received her courtesy
game tape, Taylor's shot wasn't on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't get,'' Conradt said. ``But it's just as well. I
don't think I wanted to see it again anyway.''
POINTS AFTER Lady Raiders player Rene Hanebutt set a team mark with
seven 3-point shots in the victory over Oklahoma on Wednesday,
breaking a tie between herself and two others at six.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably one of the only records I could hold at
Tech,'' Hanebutt said. ``It's a nice one to have. But records are
made to be broken. I can't wait to see who breaks it.''
</P>
<P>
   She leads the Big 12 in 3-pointers made (42), attempted (91) and
percentage made (.461). And is closing on another Tech record. Her
career 3-point totals (217 of 521) trail only former guard Noel
Johnson (256 of 603). Hanebutt needs an average of only three per
game to pass Johnson in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   No one has started conference play hotter than Kansas' Lynn
Pride, who has scored 57 points and pulled down 19 rebounds in
games against Texas A&AMP;M and Baylor _ the top two consecutive games
of her career. Lady Bears coach Sonja Hogg compared her to
Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw, a similarity not undeserved, says
coach Marian Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynn is truly one of the top players in the country,''
Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad performance by Texas A&AMP;M guard Clifton Cook (25
points, five 3-pointers, eight rebounds) against a guard-oriented
team like Oklahoma State, as the Aggies reversed dismal efforts in
losses to Southern and Kansas. The killer in four consecutive
losses _ 70 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important we play hard and beat Missouri \Rtomorrow at
home\S to regain some confidence,'' Cook said. ``To do that, we
have to eliminate turnovers and execute.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M got only 18 combined minutes vs. Oklahoma State from injured
inside players Paul Jacobs and Aaron Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Less pressure, lower expectations for Kansas' men?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two different words,'' Roy Williams said. ``There are not as
many expectations, but there's still a lot of pressure on this
team.''

CHAN'S VOICE NEEDS TO CHANGE PERSONNEL TONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A medical update on honored colleague Gil
LeBreton _ Gil is out of intensive care and recovering nicely after
flinging himself against a Valley Ranch windmill earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a 911 column on the current state of the Cowboys, LeBreton
strongly urged Jerry Jones to cease immediately with the general
manager charade and hire a proven football guy to lead the way in
personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Structural damage to the windmill was nil.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this particular common sense battle with Jones is not
winnable, no matter how many Arizona disasters are presented as
evidence. Many of us, like LeBreton, carry multiple windmill scars
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   But in this first week of Valley Ranch off-season hibernation,
the prime topic of concentration has immediately shifted to
on-the-field personnel. Between now and the April draft, the
Cowboys will be deciding what's right and wrong about current
players, what free agents to pursue, and what help will be
available through the college pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Based on existing trends in all these areas, failure has been
rampant for, oh, what's it been now ... five years, right? Or ever
since The Jimster scooted out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing haunts the Cowboys of today like the past five years of
personnel decisions, starting with the college draft but certainly
including the evaluation of their own players.
</P>
<P>
   Give this much to Jones. He is not making these personnel
decisions on his own. Jones is mostly listening. And behind closed
doors, when Jones' pride and ego is not on public display, the
constant claim of respected coaches and scouts is that Jerry
qualifies as a good listener.
</P>
<P>
   But what he's been hearing has not been valid. An Arizona thing
happens partly because outside of the free-agent signing of Deion
and the drafting of Larry Allen, there hasn't been an impact
upgrade to the roster in five long years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, compare the college draft with the five years Jimmy
Johnson was in charge, as opposed to the past five years. And to
even the odds, throw out Johnson's first-round picks, while
comparing all rounds without Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   NFL starters drafted under Johnson _ Daryl Johnston, Mark
Stepnoski, Tony Tolbert, Dixon Edwards, Erik Williams, Leon Lett,
Larry Brown, Jimmy Smith, Darren Woodson, Kevin Williams, Darrin
Smith, Ron Stone and Brock Marion. Remember, that's minus the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   And the five years since Johnson, including the first round _
Larry Allen, Kavika Pittman, Clay Shiver, Randall Godfrey, David
LaFleur, Dexter Coakley, Greg Ellis and Flozell Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Another downer about the past five years _ basically the same
people have been Jones advisers. Earlier, it was the coaching staff
that had the most say. Lately, it's been Larry Lacewell and the
scouting staff. Improved drafts have come under the scouting
department, but it's still not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for four years, there was also an unwrapped mummy of a
head coach, meaning what should have been the loudest voice in the
draft had no vocal cords. Last year, Chan Gailey took over as head
coach, but with barely two months on the job, Gailey's opinion was
not given top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the potential sunshine-and-daffodils portion
of this column.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey now represents a new lead voice in the Cowboys'
decision-making choir. There is no question Jones respects his
coach, and maybe just as important to Jerry, is also comfortable
working alongside Gailey. There will be no tug-of-egos over who is
in charge. All personnel decisions in this off-season will be based
on football-minded decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Is Gailey a good personnel man?
</P>
<P>
   Don't know yet. And neither does Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   But in Gailey's 10 years of previous NFL experience, he worked
under Dan Reeves in Denver and Bill Cowher in Pittsburgh. Reeves is
as good as it gets in personnel, and has proved that again in
Atlanta. Year in and year out, the Steelers are recognized as one
of the NFL's strongest organizations in personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Gailey has certainly been schooled by the right
people.
</P>
<P>
   For like five straight years, it's been popular and accurate to
say a critical off-season on personnel awaits the Cowboys. That now
goes double. But the difference this time is the Gailey influence.
</P>
<P>
   Will Chan make a difference? He'd better.

 &HT;    Citing Hopwood ruling, UT ends faculty minority-hiring program
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas officials quietly dismantled
a $300,000 a year minority-hiring program that helped lure record
numbers of black and Hispanic professors to the Austin campus
between 1988 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first school year in a decade in which UT hired
faculty without the benefit of its Target of Opportunity program,
which officials said fell victim to an anti-affirmative action
climate, including the 1996 federal court ruling known as Hopwood.
</P>
<P>
   Several UT System regents, meeting this week to discuss progress
in hiring women and minorities, said they were surprised to hear
Hopwood was having an effect on hiring minorities. The ruling
effectively ended affirmative action in all student programs,
admissions, scholarships, recruitment and retention, or tutoring,
across Texas. Officials at Texas A&AMP;M, the University of Houston and
Texas Tech said they did not interpret Hopwood as applying to
faculty, an opinion also expressed by former Attorney General Dan
Morales.
</P>
<P>
   UT System General Counsel Ray Farabee disagreed. He said
Hopwood, along with several other court rulings, led him to advise
UT System Chancellor William Cunningham and the campus presidents
that ``the same broad principles are going to apply, and you should
avoid quotas or set-asides.''
</P>
<P>
   Regents Tony Sanchez of Laredo, Patrick Oxford of Houston and
Lowell Lebermann of Austin said they were unaware of that view
until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How broad is this decision?'' Sanchez said in an interview.
``I see us at every meeting imposing Hopwood on ourselves in a more
and more sweeping fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   That also has been a rallying cry of students protesting UT's
interpretation of Hopwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are more worried about lawsuits,'' said Carl Villarreal,
a senior majoring in sociology and a member of the Anti-Racist
Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He and others said a diverse faculty makes a university more
vibrant, more varied in its research and more able to provide role
models to minority students. UT officials said they remain
committed to diversifying the faculty but must use legal means.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Monti, who was UT's acting provost last year and made
the decision to end the minority recruitment program, said Hopwood
raised sensitivities about the program and prompted a review. He
was persuaded to end the program by a December 1997 decision by the
5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the same court that ruled in
Hopwood.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, a white state employee, Karen Hanson Messer,
successfully challenged an affirmative action program at the Texas
Education Agency, led by former Education Commissioner Lionel Meno.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling doesn't stop UT from recruiting minority faculty; the
university just can't use special programs or give such candidates
any preferences, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The money that was used for recruiting minorities, including
supplementing salaries and creating positions for black and
Hispanic stars, has been put into a larger fund for hiring all
faculty, Vice Provost Ricardo Romo said.
</P>
<P>
   The program was created by Cunningham, then UT-Austin's
president, in 1987, when blacks made up 1.3 percent of the faculty
and Hispanics were just 2.5 percent. During the program's first
five years, the campus attracted four times as many new black and
Hispanic faculty members as it did the previous five year period:
76 compared with 18.
</P>
<P>
   So far this school year, UT has hired eight blacks and Hispanics
out of 60 tenured and tenure-track faculty, compared with 18 of 109
in all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of 2,509 faculty members, 76, or 3 percent, are black;
111, or 4.4 percent, are Hispanic; 2,177, or 86.8 percent, are
white, 134, or 5.3 percent, are Asian; and 11, or less than 1
percent, are American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Justiz, dean of UT's College of Education, said he never
used the program because he did not have problems luring minority
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just rely on the minority hiring program and you use
that as the only way of hiring minority faculty, you don't make the
concerted effort to hire them,'' he said. ``It can be a cop-out.''
</P>
<P>
   Romo said he was hopeful UT would succeed without the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have enough of an international reputation that
people will look at this as a place they want to be,'' he said.

 &HT;    Cutting a tension easier than a mortise
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since we discussed the cutting of mortises last week,
we may as well look at ways of making the second half of the joint,
the tenon.
</P>
<P>
   Tenons, generally, are easier and quicker to make than mortises
because they are cut and not dug out. They are nearly always done
with a saw _ hand saw, table saw or band saw.
</P>
<P>
   I have never cut a tenon with a hand saw, and I don't suppose I
ever will. It requires more skill than I possess, and cutting them
by hand when every kind of power saw is available falls into the
category of mere exercise.
</P>
<P>
   I've cut them on the table saw and on the band saw, and even
used a router table. Sometimes you will want to use a combination
of tools, depending on their dimensions and the available
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The quick way of cutting fairly short tenons is using a tenoning
jig on the table saw. A tenoning jig holds the workpiece upright,
end grain on the table, as it is passsed over the blade. A good jig
can be set so that the first pass cuts one side of the tenon, and
after the tighterning screw is used and the jig moved to a preset
stop, the other side is cut. Depending on the size of your blade,
you can cut tenons about three inches long this way, and if you
have your fence properly adjusted, they'll be very accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Usually you'll have to cut the shoulders of the tenons
separately, because there'll still be some waste adhering to the
work piece after the initial cuts.
</P>
<P>
   To get a good sharp shoulder, it's best to finish all the cuts
with the tenoning jig, then set it aside and set up for a repeated
cross cut operation. This involves both the miter square and the
rip fence. Put one of the workpieces on the miter square and adjust
it so that the cut will take off the waste exactly where the
shoulder ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Drop the blade so that it will cut off only the waste. Now clamp
a small piece of scrap to the rip fence at a point well ahead of
the blade. Bring the fence up so that the scrap just touches the
workpiece when it is positioned properly on the miter square. Dog
the fence down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, assuming that the tenon cuts left the tenon exactly in the
center of the workpiece, all you need to do is slap the workpiece
down at the miter square, run it over until it meets the scrap
piece on the fence, and then run it through the saw. Lift off the
workpiece, bring the miter square back, flip the workpiece over and
repeat the operation. This gives you a complete tenon with
absolutely square shoulders, assuming you checked the squareness of
the blade to the table and to the miter square.
</P>
<P>
   Novices will ask why they should use a small piece of scrap on
the fence, rather than just moving the fence up to touch the
workpiece.
</P>
<P>
   This is a safety matter. You never want to create a setup in
which a cut-off piece of wood can be jammed between the blade and
the fence. Really nasty things can result when that happens.
</P>
<P>
   If your tenon needs to be longer than the full height of your
table saw blade, you have two options. The quicker will be to set
up the band saw carefully and cut the tenons there, returning to
the table saw to cut the shoulders. Lacking a bandsaw, you can
waste the wood off the tenons with repeated cuts on the table saw,
using a dado set to speed things up. The drawback here is that
you'll have relatively rough sides on the tenons, since I've yet to
see a dado set that will make a perfectly smooth cut, but if the
roughness is minimal it won't be a problem.

<P>
   MIAMI _ A taste of the tropics, nearly everyone loves
potassium-rich bananas. But this delicate fruit has split the
United States and Europe in a nasty trans-Atlantic tug-of-war that
could soon spell trouble for American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Clinton administration is expected to announce
that it will go ahead with plans to slap 100 percent tariffs on
$590 million worth of European goods as soon as Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The move is designed to force the European Union -- which gives
preferences to banana growers in former colonies, particularly
those in the Caribbean -- to open its markets to bananas produced
in Latin America by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. consumers, the retaliatory measure could double prices
on everything from cheese to linens to candles to cashmere
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   European wines have been excluded at the request of American
wine producers, who are negotiating their own access to European
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But even more is at stake than higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Experts fear that one retaliation could spark another, igniting
a real trade war between the United States and the European Union
that could threaten two-way trade estimated at more than $400
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also raises serious questions about whether two
economic powerhouses can ever resolve major disagreements through
the World Trade Organization, the Geneva, Switzerland-based arbiter
of international trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   And it raises concerns over the future of U.S. relations with
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that region, leaders have blasted Washington as the
enemy in their fight to preserve the economic lifeblood of their
tiny, banana-dependent societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is pulling the rug right out from under these
fragile economies,'' said Hazel Ross-Robinson, a Washington
attorney who lobbies for Caribbean nations. ``It is sending a
message that the Caribbean's no longer on its radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing as much as 90 percent of all export income, bananas
are to tiny islands such as St. Lucia and St. Vincent what cars are
to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders charge that without preferential treatment
they could lose the European market because their bananas cost more
to export.
</P>
<P>
   And if they do lose the market, they warn it could spark a
massive wave of immigration by residents seeking work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It also could boost the drug trade, as many would turn to
producing marijuana or even to helping drug smugglers to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a question of bananas, it is a question of
the entire economic existence of a group of English-speaking
Caribbean nations,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Council on
Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington, D.C.-based research group.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such dire predictions, the United States and Europe
have been slipping toward a trade war over bananas for more than
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the European system, which dates back to July 1993, banana
growers in former colonies such as Jamaica and Martinique get
greater access to the European market than growers in Latin
American countries, even though Latin-grown bananas are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Caribbean grows about 4 perent of the world's
bananas and about 10 percent of bananas sold in the European
market.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's system has incensed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based Chiquita
Co., which grows bananas in Central and South America and charges
that quotas are strangling its access to Europe's lucrative $5
billion banana market.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita's controlling shareholder is Carl Lindner, a political
heavyweight and major contributor to both Republicans and Democrats
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Lindner's urging that the United States joined
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico in petitioning the WTO in
1996 to review objections to Europe's import system and to settle
the trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiquita connection has given Europeans and others the
license to level accusations that U.S. moves to open European
markets are strictly motivated by money and politics --
particularly since bananas aren't grown commercially in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. policy on bananas is clearly driven by political
donations, and little else,'' Birns said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials deny the charge, saying this issue centers
squarely on Europe's failure to comply with the world's rules of
fair trade.
</P>
<P>
   And if compliance isn't forced, then other WTO members that lose
cases to the United States in the future may feel free to take no
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe's system directly protects the interests of growers in
Europe and in former colonies to the detriment of all other
international interests,'' said Jay Ziegler, spokesman for the
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler said U.S. intentions to impose new tariffs will likely
be announced Thursday(Jan. 14).
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the WTO supported U.S. charges by ruling that
Europe's laws unfairly discriminate against Latin American bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was upheld by a WTO appeals body.
</P>
<P>
   Europe then revised its import rules, but the United States
contends the changes are ``cosmetic,'' and still run afoul of trade
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return to the WTO for a resolution -- the route
favored by Europe -- the United States raised the stakes in the
battle with the threat of new tariffs, first announced last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Europe doesn't contest the retaliatory measure later
this month, new tariffs could be implemented as early as February.
If Europe does contest, the new tariffs could be implemented by
March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Europe could itself also choose to retaliate, meaning American
exports to the European Union may be hit with higher tariffs or
tighter quotas.
</P>
<P>
   European officials have accused the United States of subverting
the dispute-settlement mechanism that's at the core of the WTO with
threats of sanctions they dub ``unilateralism at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   But many economic experts believe the United States has made a
solid case against Europe, and agree that the credibility of the
world's trade rules is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union feels like the United States is putting a
gun to its head,'' said Jeffrey Schott, of the Institute for
International Economics in Washington. ``But if the big guys don't
have to comply with WTO rules, what is their value?''

 &HT;    Lottery officials push press for winners
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State lottery officials eager to enlist their
most satisfied customers in the war on declining ticket sales are
pitching this message:
</P>
<P>
   Talking to reporters is good, clean fun.
</P>
<P>
   It's conveyed in a new, four-minute video aimed at enticing
winners to hold news conferences that garner the kind of positive
PR the lottery covets.
</P>
<P>
   Winners, said Lottery Director Linda Cloud, have become
increasingly camera shy. And she said lawyers are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attorneys are getting more educated, so when they come
in to file their claim for their jackpot they are very reluctant to
be interviewed by any of our staff or, especially, do a press
conference,'' Cloud told the Texas Lottery Commission on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For jackpot winners, news conferences _ complete with a
ceremonial, oversized check _ are strictly optional. State law
requires the lottery to release minimal information about winners _
just name, hometown, prize amount and where the winning ticket was
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   But for the lottery, no news conference means no TV stories
featuring shiny, happy, suddenly-rich people talking about new
houses, new pickup trucks and what their soon-to-be-former-bosses
can do with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to the lottery that we have the exposure
that we do have winners out there,'' said Cloud, complaining that
the number of winners willing to do news conferences has dwindled
in the past year or so.
</P>
<P>
   The video to be shown to winners addresses stagefright in a
direct, if low-key, manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although most winners feel comfortable during the news
conference, they're still apprehensive early on about working with
the media due to images of persistent reporters and
photographers,'' the narrator says. ``However, winners who have
taken part in a news conference find that the experience is quite
painless and a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer Walker Arensen, who has represented three lotto
winners, said he advises them against a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply because of privacy,'' he said. ``A lottery winner
becomes a very popular person, and the news conference just
advertises that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Arensen said all three of his clients ignored his advice and had
news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are proud of what they did. It is the thrill of the
moment,'' he said, ``Most of them probably look back and wish they
might not have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Goodfleisch, the lottery's public information director,
said most winners have the normal fear of press.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who don't deal with the media on a regular basis have
fears that I find unfounded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The tape includes happy winners who survived news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``After doing it, it's fun to look at the video,'' said John
McGee of Corpus Christi, a $4.8 million winner.
</P>
<P>
   McGee also discovered another upside _ perhaps not too
surprising _ of suddenly showing up on TV with a few million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that you haven't seen in a long time, friends you just
lose touch with over time, will call you on the phone and say, `We
just saw you on TV last night,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   The new effort to persuade winners to meet the press was
previewed as lottery officials reported that the ticket sales slump
that coincided with the September 1997 cut in prize payouts is
continuing. Since the Sept. 1 start of the current fiscal year,
sales are down 18 percent compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials will ask the Texas Legislature, which convenes
Tuesday, to undo the prize cut.
</P>
<P>
   The airwaves attack on the sales slump now includes new ads
telling Texans that they shouldn't wait for lotto fever, induced by
high jackpots, to set in before they buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, $4 million is a lot of money,'' say the ads, referring to
the starting point for lotto prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants $4 million,'' Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning a large prize are the same as winning a
smaller one, a mathematical fact that argues in favor of saving up
for big jackpot weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The sales decrease also is reflected in a demographic study
presented to state officials this week. The latest version of the
biannual report says about 68 percent of adult Texans bought at
least one ticket in the past year, down from 70 percent in the 1997
study.
</P>
<P>
   The new report also says lottery spending was down 28 percent
since the previous report. The ``typical player'' spent $457 on
lottery tickets in 1998, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface, Cloud said the new report continues to show that
people ``with the lowest levels of education and income were the
least likely to play the games of the Texas Lottery,'' a result she
said disproves ``myths'' about who buys tickets.

 &HT;    High demand has builders scrambling for materials
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Custom home builder Brian Bailey is rushing to
finish the roof on the spacious house he is building.
</P>
<P>
   He needs the roof to provide shelter for the drywall he bought
ahead of schedule _ while he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be available in three to four weeks,'' Bailey said.
``We take it when we can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   With new home construction at a record high, builders such as
Bailey are having trouble getting the materials they need to build
houses. The nationwide demand for drywall, insulation, concrete and
man-made stone have outstripped the supply.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, builders and others say, anyone building a home may
want to brace themselves for delays _ and higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the basic building elements of most walls and
ceilings in residential and commercial projects,'' said Craig
Weisbruch, senior vice president of sales and marketing for
National Gypsum Co., a Charlotte, N.C.-based company that is the
nation's second-largest drywall manufacturer. ``When they are
difficult to get, jobs stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who builds houses ranging from 6,000 square feet to more
than 20,000 square feet, said these material shortages and the
resulting price increases, can add more than $10,000 to the price
of a large home _ costs that have been passed on the homebuyer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that shows few signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   In a June survey by the National Association of Homebuilders,
respondents ranked a shortage of materials as one of the biggest
problems. The materials shortage probably is even worse now, given
a particularly strong housing market in the final months of last
year, said Michael Carliner, an economist with the Washington,
D.C.-based association. As a result, builders are being forced to
place orders weeks and sometimes months in advance to ensure
they'll have what they need. In the past, they need two to three
days' notice.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he snatches up building materials as soon as he can
get them. He is even considering renting warehouse space to store
drywall and other materials for future houses.
</P>
<P>
   Other builders and suppliers are taking other steps.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sullivan, general manager of Williams Insulation in
Austin, said his company and others have been forced to buy
insulation from home improvement retailers such as The Home Depot
when they can't get it from their own suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't count on what you're going to receive,'' Sullivan
said. ``You're living day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   Cycles of shortages
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been shortages of one building
material or another, especially during times of economic prosperity
when commercial and residential construction deplete resources.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1970s, there was a shortage of insulation.
During the mid-1990s, lumber prices shot skyward because of
cutbacks in national forest logging in the Pacific Northwest, home
to the endangered northern spotted owl. And over the past year,
railroad delays and a warm winter for building create a severe
statewide cement shortage. But ``never has there been a situation
when so many key ingredients of a house are in such short supply.''
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   For only the second time in its 40-year history, Williams
Insulation has been forced to import insulation from Mexico and
Europe because of the limited U.S. supply. The shortage has pushed
up the price of insulation 30 percent to 40 percent over the past
year, Sullivan said. Insulation accounts for 1 percent to 2 percent
of the construction cost of a home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as housing starts stay strong, the material will
remain in short supply,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually drywall and insulation companies build up inventories
during winter when construction projects traditionally slow down.
But last year, it never slowed down because of an unusually warm,
dry winter, low interest rates and the healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers say they are producing as much as they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running every single plant, three shifts a day, seven
days a week,'' said Weisbruch of National Gypsum.
</P>
<P>
   He said every gypsum manufacturer, including his, is building
new plants. But most won't be open until next year, providing
little immediate relief. Drywall, used to make walls and ceilings,
is made from crushed gypsum sandwiched between paper.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, builders are left on their own to find supply
where they can. ``Our supply problems have been minimal so far, but
we're definitely concerned,'' said Nedda Brown, vice president of
operations for Clark Wilson Homes. ``When they say they'll only
make so much, there's limited places you can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cement hard to find
</P>
<P>
   Although the supply of drywall and insulation has reached a
crisis level during the past eight months, cement has been in short
supply for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Since early 1997, the cement industry has been operating at
capacity. While the demand for cement last year was 96.5 million
tons, U.S. capacity was 81 million tons, according to the Portland
Cement Association.
</P>
<P>
   Cement consumption in Texas reached its highest level in 13
years last year, driven by a strong housing market and big public
works projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still very tight,'' said Bill Toal, chief economist at
the cement association.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary solution for companies has been to import cement. In
the long term, cement companies have over 30 expansion projects
across the United States. Texas companies, including Capital
Aggregate, Holnam Inc. and Texas Industries, are increasing
capacity by expanding or adding new plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just takes time,'' Toal said.

 &HT;    Legislator considers merging utility, railroad commissions
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Another legislator will take another run at
merging the Public Utility Commission into the Texas Railroad
Commission, creating one agency to regulate the state's electric,
natural gas and local telephone utilities, as well as the oil
production industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Siebert (R-San Antonio) hopes he'll have more luck
than did state Sen. David Cain (D-Dallas), who didn't get far in
the last legislative session with the same proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking anything away from the commissioners at the
PUC,'' said Siebert, who plans to file a bill that could merge the
commissions soon. ``They're very intelligent, they're very
motivated people. But we are at that time when deregulation is upon
us and we need to be considering down-sizing that agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Siebert will have a tough time.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush ``does not support the idea of merging the
Public Utility Commission into the Railroad Commission,'' said
spokeswoman Karen Hughes. She said he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert said an elected agency like the railroad commission is
more responsive to the people. And a merged agency would be more
administratively efficient and could better deal with changes
within the electric and natural gas industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert, whose hometown is the corporate headquarters for one of
the nation's largest telephone companies, also said that he had
been disappointed that the PUC has been slow to deregulate
telecommunications in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., whose political action
committee has given Siebert at least $3,000 in campaign
contributions since the last legislative session, has been
frustrated by the PUC's refusal so far to let it into the
long-distance business. The commission has said that the company
has not yet done enough to open its own network to local
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert said any suggestion that he was acting on behalf of
Southwestern Bell was ``totally untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Smith, a spokesman for Southwestern Bell, said the company
had no position on the bill and had not asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   Merging the agencies has gotten some support previously from
others. Cain plans to introduce similar legislation again, said his
legislative aide, Kristie Flippo Niemeyer. Cain's bill in 1997
cleared the Senate State Affairs Committee, but the senator never
brought up it up for a Senate vote because he appeared to lack
support, Niemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Matthews, a member of the Railroad Commission who first
suggested a merger in 1996, said he still supports the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The state's two biggest electric utility holding companies,
Texas Utilities Inc. of Dallas and Houston Industries Inc., also
own the state's two biggest natural gas utilities, Matthews noted.
And Texas Utilities also has bought a local phone provider, the
Lufkin Conroe Communications Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the electric utility industry thinks it ``can probably
function best with the (regulatory) situation as it is,'' said John
Fainter, president of the Association of Electric Companies of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state constitution, the three members of the Railroad
Commission are elected to six-year terms. Although its principal
function when it was founded more than a century ago was to
regulate the state's railroad industry, it evolved in the 20th
century into the state's primary agency for regulating the
production of oil and natural gas. The agency has a budget of about
$58 million and 850 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller PUC, created by the Legislature in 1975, regulates
the state's electric and telephone utilities. It too is run by
three commissioners, but they are appointed by the governor,
subject to confirmation by the Texas Senate. (Currently, however,
only two commission seats are occupied.) The agency has a budget of
$12.3 million and about 240 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chairman Pat Wood or Commissioner Judy Walsh of the PUC
were available for comment Thursday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who's afraid of big brother
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The quote struck fear in the hearts of humanity
when George Orwell introduced it in 1949 in his ground-quaking tome
``1984.'' It meant we were being watched, our every move
scrutinized by a large, sinister, omniscient entity. Big Brother, a
judge-and-jury-like government institution, was monitoring,
charting and tracking. It was a frightening thought that made us
all look around more than once in our lives and ask, Why me? Why is
Big Brother watching me?
</P>
<P>
   Then came the actual 1984. The year was introduced to us with a
commercial. In 60 seconds, Apple Computer's ``1984,'' which ran
during the year's Super Bowl, showed us our greatest fears and, at
the same time, gave us hope. The future was to be a gray world
where clean-shaven heads prevailed and an anonymous, raspy-voiced,
Big Brother filled us with totalitarian ideals from a big, glowing,
screen. But then, out of the dusty halls, came a blond woman in red
running shorts, hurling a sledgehammer and launching a subsequent
rebellion. ``You'll see why 1984 won't be like `1984,' '' a
reassuring voice said at the end of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The year sparked our rebellion. We looked around and saw we were
being watched everywhere we went, from every angle, and it
disgusted us. We were outraged to see the tiny cameras as we
banked, or the swiveling lens as we bought our Slurpees at 7-11.
This would not do, we told ourselves, so we shook our fists to the
heavens and cried, ``Just who does this Big Brother think he is?''
</P>
<P>
   But then we got used to it, complacent. Those still whining
about the loss of privacy and the omnipresence of surveillance
cameras were written off as the lunatic fringe. Being watched made
us feel more secure. Big Brother no longer was perceived as being
there to hurt; he was there to help.
</P>
<P>
   Technology got smaller, and cameras got as convenient to carry
as an oversized wallet. The cameras, now our friends, became our
obsession. They saw everything. Our lives were no longer private,
no intimate moments. We plugged our trips, trials and tribulations
into our televisions and made our friends watch them over Martha
Stewart-inspired dinners and home-brewed beers.
</P>
<P>
   We soon found ourselves happy to live inside the camera and,
when necessary, to play the part of Big Brother when it came to
recording others. To be on tape validated us; to tape others gave
us power. We watched as this new, innocuous, voyeurism leaked into
the mainstream. Bob Saget and his benchmark ``America's Funniest
Home Videos'' made us chortle as kids fell into toilets, and grooms
passed out at altars.
</P>
<P>
   Now we've turned it up a notch. It's not enough to see people's
foibles; we are demanding more. We want to see people's
inadequacies. We want to see others' mistakes. People in terror,
people on the run, people in trouble. Now we plan our evenings
around ``reality shows.'' We tune into ``Cops'' to see police
embarrass drunkards and rough up wife beaters. We watch the Fox
network to see real people attacked by real animals or to view a
``wild and woolly'' car chase that we watch while ``this crackhead
criminal crushes cars!''
</P>
<P>
   We even began utilizing other means of communications to show
ourselves to the world. The Internet, with its tiny CUCMe cameras,
provided a way for us to turn the camera on ourselves and let
anyone interested see us sleep, eat and love: 24-seven of
self-imposed surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, there are few things we can't see or find out
about our neighbor, very little information we can't acquire. From
the Internet to the television set and the home video camera, there
is nowhere to hide. Which leads us to reassess exactly whom Big
Brother is and whom, exactly, he is watching anymore.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in an Orwellian irony, you realize it. The very entity
you're afraid of, the one you've fought so long against _ Big
Brother _ is someone you know and live with. He is as familiar as
family but as distant as the talking face on the glowing screen.
Because we all have seen Big Brother, and, ironically, it is us.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: How to build a $120 chair for $400
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I spent my Christmas vacation trying not to
cut off my fingers, taking a late-night trip to the emergency room
to get a mote out of my eye, and inhaling massive amounts of
sawdust. It was great.
</P>
<P>
   Santa brought several power tools with which I can risk my
precious digits. I have built nothing of note to date, just some
shelves in the workshop and the World's Most Expensive Cassette
Tape Cabinet, discussed in an earlier column. It now sits proudly
in my study. Total cost, including lumber, tools purchased, and the
aforementioned trip to the emergency room: about $300. That comes
out to about $3.15 per tape. Oh, well. It's cheaper than therapy.
</P>
<P>
   I've discovered since embarking on this new hobby that
woodworking is a common avocation among newspaper editors. One
colleague's theory is that it
</P>
<P>
   allows editors _ who by nature of their job spend much of their
time getting
</P>
<P>
   yelled at by people _ to take out their frustrations on
inanimate objects. The same theory explains why so many of us
green-visored wretches play golf, I suppose. I have the same level
of mediocrity at both pastimes, and the fact that I've
enthusiastically if ineptly taken to both says something about me,
I guess. Mainly that I get yelled at a lot. Lucky I have a thick
skin.
</P>
<P>
   It's too wet and cold to play much golf, and besides it gets
dark early these days, so here I am several nights a week, out in
my shop still trying to unlock the mysteries of the router,
checking out woodworking books by the armload from the library,
flipping through catalogs of power tools and woodworking supplies.
I am slowly learning enough to realize how little I know about all
this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The most valuable lesson I've learned so far: wear goggles.
While putzing around with the router one night a few weeks ago, I
managed to lodge a piece of wood in my eye that refused to come
out. Since I wear glasses, I haven't worried about goggles. Dumb. I
used a whole bottle of eyedrops, took a shower, stuck my head under
a faucet and muttered many imprecations before breaking down and
driving myself to the emergency room, one hand on the steering
wheel and the other clasped over the injured eye.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse clucked, and the doctor shook his head. Everybody was
very friendly and helpful. A gallon of eyewash, some deadening
solution and a Q-tip later, I was good as new, save for a few minor
scratches on my cornea and a blurry eye that didn't clear up for a
few days. I got a bill for $140, which I richly deserved for being
so dumb. I bought goggles the next day. They cost $3.99.
</P>
<P>
   Building furniture is a major step beyond restoring existing
pieces, which I've done for years. Unless one has to replace parts
that have been damaged beyond repair, restoring furniture mainly
involves lots of elbow grease and a willingness to sniff solvents
and sawdust for hours on end. Learning how to build something, even
from a plan, is a whole new ballgame to someone with as little
aptitude as I have. My major project now is an Adirondack chair,
which is a high-backed, wide-planked outside chair. I saw a nice
one in a local building supply store on sale for $119.95. I figure
I can build one for, oh, maybe $400, by the time I tally up wasted
lumber and purchase of tools I need. This doesn't count labor and
future possible emergency medical care, which could send the price
into the Chippendale strata.
</P>
<P>
   I spend hours staring dumbly at the chair's plans and
instructions, trying to figure out what all these exotic terms
mean: dado, mortise and tenon, dovetail and Roman ogee. First time
I saw the latter, which is a type of router bit, I thought it said
Roman orgy. That seemed like a strange name for a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know differently, but it's a slow process. It took an
entire day to build five back slats for the chair, and part of
another day to stand back and contemplate my handiwork and figure
out what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack chair made it necessary to buy a bandsaw, which
is a very cool tool that allows you to cut out curved patterns. I
could make those charmingly goofy Christmas cutouts of Santa and
his elves if I had a mind to with a bandsaw, but we already own a
set so there's no need. The bandsaw is disarmingly quiet, unlike my
table saw which screams out at you to be careful less you leave a
finger lying on the concrete. The bandsaw whispers its warning, in
a seductive hiss like a snake. Have no doubt. It will whack off an
errant protuberance in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   In between building, I sit in my blue recliner and flip through
tool catalogs. This is getting expensive. But at least I'm not
spending time on a couch talking about my childhood traumas. As if
I could remember them.

<P>
   MIAMI _ A taste of the tropics, nearly everyone loves
potassium-rich bananas. But this delicate fruit has split the
United States and Europe in a nasty trans-Atlantic tug-of-war that
could soon spell trouble for American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Clinton administration is expected to announce
that it will go ahead with plans to slap 100 percent tariffs on
$590 million worth of European goods as soon as Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The move is designed to force the European Union -- which gives
preferences to banana growers in former colonies, particularly
those in the Caribbean -- to open its markets to bananas produced
in Latin America by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. consumers, the retaliatory measure could double prices
on everything from cheese to linens to candles to cashmere
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   European wines have been excluded at the request of American
wine producers, who are negotiating their own access to European
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But even more is at stake than higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Experts fear that one retaliation could spark another, igniting
a real trade war between the United States and the European Union
that could threaten two-way trade estimated at more than $400
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also raises serious questions about whether two
economic powerhouses can ever resolve major disagreements through
the World Trade Organization, the Geneva, Switzerland-based arbiter
of international trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   And it raises concerns over the future of U.S. relations with
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that region, leaders have blasted Washington as the
enemy in their fight to preserve the economic lifeblood of their
tiny, banana-dependent societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is pulling the rug right out from under these
fragile economies,'' said Hazel Ross-Robinson, a Washington
attorney who lobbies for Caribbean nations. ``It is sending a
message that the Caribbean's no longer on its radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing as much as 90 percent of all export income, bananas
are to tiny islands such as St. Lucia and St. Vincent what cars are
to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders charge that without preferential treatment
they could lose the European market because their bananas cost more
to export.
</P>
<P>
   And if they do lose the market, they warn it could spark a
massive wave of immigration by residents seeking work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It also could boost the drug trade, as many would turn to
producing marijuana or even to helping drug smugglers to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a question of bananas, it is a question of
the entire economic existence of a group of English-speaking
Caribbean nations,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Council on
Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington, D.C.-based research group.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such dire predictions, the United States and Europe
have been slipping toward a trade war over bananas for more than
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the European system, which dates back to July 1993, banana
growers in former colonies such as Jamaica and Martinique get
greater access to the European market than growers in Latin
American countries, even though Latin-grown bananas are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Caribbean grows about 4 perent of the world's
bananas and about 10 percent of bananas sold in the European
market.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's system has incensed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based Chiquita
Co., which grows bananas in Central and South America and charges
that quotas are strangling its access to Europe's lucrative $5
billion banana market.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita's controlling shareholder is Carl Lindner, a political
heavyweight and major contributor to both Republicans and Democrats
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Lindner's urging that the United States joined
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico in petitioning the WTO in
1996 to review objections to Europe's import system and to settle
the trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiquita connection has given Europeans and others the
license to level accusations that U.S. moves to open European
markets are strictly motivated by money and politics --
particularly since bananas aren't grown commercially in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. policy on bananas is clearly driven by political
donations, and little else,'' Birns said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials deny the charge, saying this issue centers
squarely on Europe's failure to comply with the world's rules of
fair trade.
</P>
<P>
   And if compliance isn't forced, then other WTO members that lose
cases to the United States in the future may feel free to take no
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe's system directly protects the interests of growers in
Europe and in former colonies to the detriment of all other
international interests,'' said Jay Ziegler, spokesman for the
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler said U.S. intentions to impose new tariffs will likely
be announced Thursday(Jan. 14).
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the WTO supported U.S. charges by ruling that
Europe's laws unfairly discriminate against Latin American bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was upheld by a WTO appeals body.
</P>
<P>
   Europe then revised its import rules, but the United States
contends the changes are ``cosmetic,'' and still run afoul of trade
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return to the WTO for a resolution -- the route
favored by Europe -- the United States raised the stakes in the
battle with the threat of new tariffs, first announced last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Europe doesn't contest the retaliatory measure later
this month, new tariffs could be implemented as early as February.
If Europe does contest, the new tariffs could be implemented by
March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Europe could itself also choose to retaliate, meaning American
exports to the European Union may be hit with higher tariffs or
tighter quotas.
</P>
<P>
   European officials have accused the United States of subverting
the dispute-settlement mechanism that's at the core of the WTO with
threats of sanctions they dub ``unilateralism at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   But many economic experts believe the United States has made a
solid case against Europe, and agree that the credibility of the
world's trade rules is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union feels like the United States is putting a
gun to its head,'' said Jeffrey Schott, of the Institute for
International Economics in Washington. ``But if the big guys don't
have to comply with WTO rules, what is their value?''

 &HT;    It's time to outlaw the practice of beating our kids in school
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ It probably will surprise no one to hear that
I got whacked a lot in school.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '60s, sound educational policy included teachers
whacking students. Every male teacher I was assigned had a paddle
hanging on his wall and some had more, allowing them to choose the
instrument of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the teachers were from the old school and had paddles
made of oak or some other hard _ very hard _ wood. Those who were
with the times had switched to the high-tech models, sleek
fiberglass babies that allowed for a faster swing with less effort.
</P>
<P>
   The fiberglass models were especially popular with coaches _
they would have been the same guys who first tried out graphite
golf clubs _ who found it necessary to administer multiple
paddlings in one day. More pain, less effort.
</P>
<P>
   I deserved every single last one of those paddlings and I
probably deserved many more.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were to tell you the sum total of what I learned
getting hit on the butt all those times from seventh grade forward
it would be this: Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Not one thing. Well, that isn't exactly true. I learned that
paddling is a useless form of school punishment.
</P>
<P>
   I believed that as a student getting whacked and I believe it
now as a parent of four children whom I had occasion to spank in
their younger years. But that was me paddling them, not a
near-stranger. There is a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   In my experience as a student, whacking did no good because the
student never had a way of knowing what would get you whacked. One
day it might be arriving after the tardy bell. The next day the
same teacher would say nothing. One day it might be because you
were caught holding hands in the hallway. The next day the same
teacher would say nothing. One day you might be able to tell a joke
in one class where the teacher laughed and get whacked for telling
exactly the same joke in the very next class.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those things happened to me.
</P>
<P>
   So it became clear as a student that you got whacked just
whenever someone
</P>
<P>
   felt like whacking you. You learned to just get through it
because, if a teacher wanted to paddle you they had to get it out
of their system. Unfortunately, I gave my teachers plenty of
reasons to cleanse their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a while, my bottom pretty well got accustomed to
the hitting, I was probably near having calluses. Wood hurt less
than fiberglass, but I could endure any of it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost any of it.
</P>
<P>
   One day I ran cross-wise with a coach. I don't remember what I
did, though I'm sure it was something pretty terrible. I know it
was bad enough to make him angry. I could hear it in his voice and
see it in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He told me to assume the position and get ready for three
``pops,'' as he called them.
</P>
<P>
   The first whack was almost always the worst. No matter how well
you prepared, your butt just never was quite ready for the sting.
The second whack, as usual, was much easier to bear. The nerves in
the butt weren't feeling all the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the third whack was the easiest of all to take.
Typically.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the third swing of that fiberglass paddle
landed squarely on my legs. I was 17 years old and not a weakling,
but it almost took my breath away.
</P>
<P>
   As I turned around to look at him the pain must have been
obvious on my face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oops,'' he said. ``I missed.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next week I was in excruciating pain as my legs turned,
blue, then purple, then yellow. I have no doubt he hit me on
purpose. It wasn't exactly a lasting injury, but it didn't change
my attitude, either. If anything, I was a worse student for that
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I never told my parents for fear they would punish me
even more.
</P>
<P>
   When you go to parenting classes, they'll tell you that the best
way to avoid physical child abuse, even the accidental kind, is to
never hit your child in anger. Punish them properly when you are in
a rational state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, if you do hit you child in anger and leave bruises
across his legs, you can expect your child's teacher to make a call
to Child Protective Services. They are, in fact, required by law to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas hasn't outlawed angry school administrators from
putting bruises on children in the name of education and it is high
time we did so.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about discipline at all. It is about hitting children
on a whim and it just isn't right.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As long as Mona Lisa smiled, serene, undisturbed,
Bill Daniels took heart. It was a symbol: Doing business in the
city could work, despite the hassles. Artist Rick Van Horn
airbrushed the Mona Lisa in a four-hour burst of inspiration, and
there she reposes, on the storefront side of the Pizza Factory on
Salem Avenue, a beacon of neighborhood pride and stability. Much
like Daniels himself, come to think of it, who has tirelessly
supported neighborhood events during the 12 years he has been in
business.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, more mustaches have popped up on the Mona
Lisa, more vandalism disturbed her serene surface. That seemed a
bad sign to Daniels, because for years, ``nobody vandalized it,
nobody painted over it, and we thought, `Maybe we're getting a
little bit of respect.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The problems have been a lot worse than mustaches on the Mona
Lisa. Drivers have been held up. ``Last year a guy pointed gun at
the driver and said, `Give me the pizza,' '' Daniels said,
incredulous. ``He pulled a gun on the guy just for the pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, a teen-ager who had previously robbed a driver
called from the same phone number. When a police officer arrived,
garbed in a pizza delivery outfit, the 15-year-old pointed a weapon
at the officer that turned out to be a BB gun.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions, a stolen car has smashed through the wooden
fence surrounding the parking lot, quashing plans for another mural
_ an outfielder on one side of the fence, a kid peeping through a
knothole on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels and a former partner opened the Salem Avenue store 12
years ago, the first in the chain that has locations on Wayne
Avenue and Patterson Road. ``We encountered crime problems from the
beginning,'' he acknowledges. ``It was one of those situations
where you either get out or dig in and try to effect positive
change.''
</P>
<P>
   But times change; priorities change. ``I'm married now, with two
babies in diapers, and my focus is shifting toward taking care of
my family,'' said Daniels, 35. ``That's not leaving me time to do
the community things I used to do. I feel I should be home with my
boys, because the absence of family is the root of the problems I
see in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   And it has gotten harder to recruit qualified, insured drivers;
they didn't feel safe. With two more stores, Daniels couldn't fill
in as a driver, as he did in the past.
</P>
<P>
   So, as of last weekend, the Salem Avenue Pizza Factory _ which
previously delivered throughout a wide area in Dayton _ will no
longer be making deliveries. Daniels is optimistic the store can
succeed as a carry-out business only.
</P>
<P>
   We learned the bad news Wednesday night, when we decided to
treat ourselves after a week of near-hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pizza Factory, no deliveries,'' a man answered the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Roads are bad, I figured. No, he said. Too many drivers being
robbed.
</P>
<P>
   I got off

 &HT;    Combining Barbie anniversary, Women's History Month makes for
debated exhibit
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Call it a not-so-harmonic convergence.
</P>
<P>
   Button-nosed pop icon and feminist whipping girl Barbie turns 40
in March, a.k.a. Women's History Month.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate both, a local museum will festoon itself in pink
fabric and display Barbie dolls under glass amid life-size Barbie
furniture _ ``a greater Barbie experience,'' exhibit organizer Lori
J. Durante says.
</P>
<P>
   ``40 Years of the Barbie Doll'' will feature more than 80
Barbies shipped from dollmaker Mattel, including Engineer and
Veterinarian Barbie; Designer Clothes Barbie; the first
African-American Barbie, from 1980 and a large batch of
international Barbies, including Thai Barbie, Nigerian Barbie and
Arctic Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, to run from March 18 through June 6 at Old School
Square's Cornell Museum, has won praise from local politicos. In
letters of support, Mayor Jay Alperin called Barbie a positive
career role model for young girls, and Palm Beach County
Commissioner Mary McCarty said the exhibit demonstrates women's
advancement and contributions to society.
</P>
<P>
   Alperin, a dentist, even gave ``Dentist Barbie'' to his dental
associate as a holiday gift, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody is ready to transform the Cornell into
Barbie's Dream House: National Association for Women member and
Delray Beach resident Rosalind Murray says Barbie is not the first
figure that comes to mind when she thinks of exceptional women in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Betsy Ross's flag is more historical and more important
to me,'' she said. ``Or an exhibit on women astronauts, or of black
women in the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the museum usually displays a poster-board exhibit on
black women's achievements through the ages in February or March to
celebrate Black History Month or Women's History Month, museum
director Gloria Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which the museum bought from the Smithsonian
Institution, features photos of prominent black women in history,
from suffragette Sojourner Truth to opera diva Marian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, because of Barbie and previously planned
photography exhibits, there probably won't be room for the
poster-board display, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's detractors say the problem isn't just that Barbie's a
doll, not a real-life heroine. It's her size-0 waist and legs up to
here that insidiously reinforce an unrealistic standard of female
beauty and even contribute to eating disorders like anorexia nd
bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   Durante, 27, a fashion consultant and stylist, says Barbie's
just not that complicated.

   ``People develop insecurities about themselves long before and
after Barbie,'' she said. ``Yes, maybe she does have a body that's
incredible, but to me, it was clay, and I could mold Barbie into my
dreams and into whatever I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Durante is still looking for vintage Barbies from
1959 to 1981. Old School Square is ``Calling All Barbies,'' asking
private collectors to loan their Barbies to the show. In exchange,
donors' names will be included in the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has come forward.
</P>
<P>
   But there's likely plenty of Barbies stuck in closets and under
beds: Since Barbie's 1959 debut, Mattel has sold more than 1
billion of the dolls and her pals.
</P>
<P>
   And Barbie has climbed several career ladders, seamlessly
switching from nurse to doctor to astronaut, gymnast,
paleontologist, NASCAR driver and boutique owner, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   It's that level of career success, combined with her beauty and
glamour that make Barbie particularly appealing to girls from
lower-income families, said Professor Mary Rogers of the University
of West Florida, whose book, ``Barbie Culture,'' is due out this
month.
</P>
<P>
   For those girls, Barbie has everything, Rogers said _ the dream
house, sports cars, campers and more. She's traveled everywhere and
done everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not an oppressed woman, lugging three kids and two
diaper bags around,'' Rogers said. ``Barbie says, `Hey look, I'm
having fun _ I can be an astronaut or a school teacher','' Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barbie is the ultimate consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wanted to blame Barbie for anything, it's that she's ...
an icon of `Shop til you drop, get as much as you can.' ''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A poignant open letter about my thrills-a -minute
year
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Friends:
</P>
<P>
   It has come to my attention that those of us too lazy and/or too
cheap to address Christmas cards can make amends by sending a
newsletter to those of you who are breathlessly awaiting to hear
all the interesting things that happened to the Minter family in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole it was a pretty good year, if you don't count the
fungus that hit the tomatoes and English peas that rolled over and
died before they filled out.
</P>
<P>
   Once again all of our children are doing wonderfully and will
soon get fantastic raises and promotions if they don't decide to
enroll in Harvard and Yale for their Ph.D.s or some other
prestigious degrees that will keep them ahead of any of your
children.
</P>
<P>
   We continue to be amazed by our granddaughter. She gets
prettier, smarter and more adorable every year. She feels really
bad about having so little time for her grandfather now that she's
captain of the cheerleaders, singing in the church choir, doing a
lot of stuff at school and hiring out to baby-sit. Her dad and I
are so happy that although she'll be 14 next month she has no
interest in silly boys who call on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime around the Fourth of July another cat took up with us.
This one is yellow with mean eyes and fights with the one that took
up with us several years ago. They fight all the time. So far
neither one has been able to make the other leave the premises so
we have asked our neighbor, Stan Thain, not to shoot any more of
the coyotes who live behind our house and prey on household pets.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, in what was not a unanimous decision, we enrolled
in a line-dancing class. For those of you not familiar with line
dancing, it is an offshoot of the old daily dozen routine used by
the Army to condition recruits in World War II. There is very
little bodily contact but there is a lot of sweat. After several
pulled muscles and a knee injury that may require major surgery, I
got myself excused from line-dancing class a few days before I
would have been forced to file for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my reservations about venturing beyond Woolsey and Harps
Crossing, Mrs. Marco Polo again conducted an extensive tour of
foreign lands, visiting Rome (Italy) in the spring and Paris
(France) and environs in the fall, which generated enough frequent
flier points for both of us to visit Australia, New Zealand, Fiji
and perhaps Tibet and Sri Lanka in 1999, unless I can come down
with some sort of disease she can't get past immigration
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   We also toured the Northwestern United States and great chunks
of Canada with Alex and Judy Moye in their Nimitz-class motor home.
I can't say for sure, but I think Alex may be planning to enter the
1999 Daytona 500 if he can get the motor coach past NASCAR
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The big event in our neck of the woods was the second annual
Inman Farm Heritage Days celebration put on by our semi-farmer son
and his semi-farmer wife with help from a cast of hundreds. The
good news is the weekend drew an estimated 10,000 visitors, up from
6,000 a year ago. The bad news is the semi-farmer son was
discovered to have in his possession upward of 40 old tractors,
including some that actually have a motor and all their wheels and
actually run. Although we hate to brag, we are proud to report he
is in discussions with Time Warner and several other television
studios about a remake of ''Sanford and Son'' to be shot on
location.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly because of an attack of temporary insanity, I ignored
God's admonition about squandering paper made from pine trees and
wrote a book, the title of which cannot be mentioned here because
if I put it in, the newspaper's editors would take it out and tell
me to buy an ad.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you may have heard that my Christmas gift was a set of
super-duper computerized hearing aids, one for each ear. The
audiologist assured me my slight hearing loss was from being in the
Army and hearing a lot of guns being shot, and not from old age.
Hearing aids are wonderful. Although I still have trouble carrying
on a conversation with people in the same room with me, I can hear
the first raindrops falling in Carrollton whenever a front moves in
from Alabama.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Remember the Alamo, factually
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The winners get to write the history. That's
natural.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine how history books today would read if
Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito had conquered the world.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly wouldn't be a Holocaust museum or stories about
Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   It must be galling, however, to be on the losing side of both a
war and history.
</P>
<P>
   Americans wouldn't know since we have never lost an armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was close. But there's a difference between losing and
not winning.
</P>
<P>
   The sons and daughters of the Confederacy know something about
the experience the vanquished endure at the hands of their
history-writing conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   It's equally difficult to picture how history books would read
today had the Confederacy prevailed in the War of Northern
Aggression. Frankly, I have no quarrel with the outcome of that war
even though my relatives fought on the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   As a native Texan, I've been distressed by the way some people
are attempting to rewrite the history of the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   For Texans, the Alamo is more than a historical building. For
Texans, the Alamo is sacred symbol of freedom, independence and
courage. It is a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be quiet and take off your hat, son,'' my grandfather
instructed me on my first visit to the Alamo. ``A lot of brave men
died here.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the 187 Texans who defended the Alamo against Gen.
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's 5,000 Mexican troops were not the
winners. The flag they flew over the Alamo now is under lock and
key in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   But the bravery of these men in the face of overwhelming odds,
and their willingness to sacrifice themselves for freedom, made
them more than winners of a single battle. It made them legends.
</P>
<P>
   By fighting off Santa Anna's assault for 13 days, they bought
time for Gen. Sam Houston to gather his forces. ``Remember the
Alamo'' became a battle cry used by Houston's forces as they
vanquished Santa Anna's army at San Jacinto, thereby giving birth
to a new nation _ the Republic of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican historians have a slightly different view of the events
at the Alamo. They question whether Santa Anna, Mexico's dictator,
really had 5,000 men under arms during the 13-day siege and whether
all Alamo defenders died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   An eyewitness account written by Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la
Pena defies the popular legend that frontier hero Davy Crockett
died with his ``Tennessee boys'' while wielding his long-rifle,
Betsy, before he was finally felled near the doors of the Alamo's
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The diary of the Mexican officer, recently donated to the
University of Texas, reports that Crockett was captured when the
Mexicans finally overwhelmed the mission and executed later that
day, March 6, 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the defenders of the Alamo were not fighting for
Texas independence. They were fighting as part of a struggle to
re-establish Mexico's 1824 Constitution that had been repudiated by
Santa Anna. They flew a red-white-and-green Mexican flag over the
Alamo with ``1824'' on it.
</P>
<P>
   After the Alamo battle, the struggle shifted to one of Texas
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics fought and died alongside Anglo defenders of the Alamo
and later in the struggle for Texas independence.
</P>
<P>
   The keepers of the Alamo, the Daughters of the Republic of
Texas, have the right attitude. Whatever is factual is fine. The
Alamo will always be an inspiration for Texans and freedom-loving
people worldwide.

 &HT;    I will not make fun, I will not be rude. Busy or not, this year
I will be civil
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As we enter this, the final year of the
20th century, let us vow to take the higher road, to grasp the
greater good ...
</P>
<P>
   To not be such jerks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that people today mean to be less considerate than
they were decades ago,'' says Peggy Post,
great-granddaughter-in-law of manners maven Emily Post and author
of the most recent edition of ``Etiquette.'' ``We're just busier
and more crowded and less likely to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from us to cram decorum down your throat (that would
be rude). But please, may we at least offer some reminders to
gently steer you on the path to civility?
</P>
<P>
   Thank you so much.
</P>
<P>
   I WILL NOT ... 1. Check my voice mail on speaker phone. 2. Swipe
newspapers from my condo lobby. 3. Secretly alter the thermostat
after my spouse and I agree on a setting. 4. Act like a famine's
approaching while at all-you-can-eat buffets. 5. Discuss my most
recent surgery at cocktail parties. 6. Make fun of Barry Manilow
fans. (Ditto John Denver.) 7. Leave fast-food debris in my
co-worker's car after he drives to lunch. 8. Leap to the front of
the line when another cash register opens. 9. Jangle the change in
my pocket. 10. Razz fans of the losing team (OK, maybe not much).
</P>
<P>
   I WILL ... 1. Say thank you even when I can't see the
drive-through teller. 2. Let folks with a handful of items go ahead
of me when I have a tractor-trailer of groceries. 3. Leave a decent
amount of milk in the carton. 4. Ignore call-waiting unless I have
a sick mother or a kid who needs to be picked up. 5. Listen to a
colleague's idea without rolling my eyes. 6. Wear less perfume. 7.
Turn off my cell phone during movies, church services, PTA meetings
and so forth unless I'm a doctor awaiting news on an organ for
transplant. 8. Mail birthday cards on time. 9. Retain my sense of
compassion (and humor), especially when elderly drivers meander in
the fast lane. 10. Do unto others as I'd have them do unto me
(cynicism not included).

 &HT;    Longest we've gone without sex? None of your business, Dr. Gray
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's take a quick look around John
Gray's solar system.
</P>
<P>
   You've got your ``Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'' book
that started it all, spawning such sequels as Mars and Venus on a
date ... in the bedroom ... starting over ... together forever ...
and of course, the runaway bestseller, Mars and Venus Fixing a Flat
Tire.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, that was a joke. About the flat tire. The other ones are
real, though. And there seems to be no end to pop psychologist
Gray's ability to repackage his relationship shtick. You've got
your six-pack video series based on his books, the interactive
Mars-Venus workshops and even places called Mars &AMP; Venus Counseling
Centers.
</P>
<P>
   So, I guess it was just a matter of time before we'd get the
board game version of his Mars-Venus meal ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is an entertaining, illuminating way to find out
what you know about the differences between men and women _ or what
you thought you knew,'' the game instructions say.
</P>
<P>
   Before I go any further, I think it's fair to disclose that
while I started reading Gray's seminal tome several years ago, I
never got all the way through it _ although it did remain on top of
the toilet tank for a solid year.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, back to the game, which I decided to play because (a)
I've been married for 18 years and (b) The Palm Beach Post agreed
to pay for a babysitter and truth serum (beer) if I could round up
some other married couples to play the game with my wife and me.
</P>
<P>
   So, on a recent Saturday night, after a requisite dose of truth
serum, we sat down with four friends to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Men play from the red cards. Women get the green. Both teams
start on their respective planets and try to make it to planet
Earth first.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to guess how the players who take turns reading
multiple-choice questions from a deck of cards would honestly
answer the questions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The women sat on one side of the table, facing the men. Women go
first, pulling one of the green cards from the deck.
</P>
<P>
   There are some questions in the deck that require more truth
serum than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest time I've gone without sex is (a) several weeks
(b) several months (c) more than several months,'' one question
reads.
</P>
<P>
   If you're too embarrassed to answer questions, you can go into
your ``well'' if you're a woman, or your ``cave'' if you're a man.
(If you want to know why women don't go in caves and men don't go
in wells, it's explained in the directions.)
</P>
<P>
   But what often happens with the game is that somebody picks up a
card, goes to read the question on it, shakes his or her head and
mutters, ``No,'' then reaches for another card.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the choices on many cards are either too
obvious, too irrelevant. Or, they require more honesty than seems
necessary among friends, who don't really need to know or probably
don't want to know your preferences on cuddling after lovemaking.
Or what body part you prefer to have rubbed.
</P>
<P>
   As we played the game, I couldn't help thinking that this game
would be more valuable among people who just began dating, rather
than married couples together for years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a man would be better off hearing a woman answer
the question ``I am most likely to make love (a) in a car, (b) on a
train, (c) at the park'' in the beginning of their relationship,
rather than later on, say, after squandering dozens of uneventful
train trips.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about this one:
</P>
<P>
   ``My partner earns the most points for being (a) practical (b)
punctual (c) sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice knowing that up front, to judge whether you
want to keep dating somebody who's unduly fixated with you being on
time.
</P>
<P>
   The questions fall in different categories: communication,
family, dating, ``gender benders,'' ones that ask how the opposite
sex can score more points with you, and ``island fantasy''
questions, as in ``I would love it most if I could change my (a)
wardrobe (b) body (c) job.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another problem with the game. There you are
sitting across the table from a woman friend _ not your wife, mind
you _ just a friend. And you have to decide whether she's most
unhappy with her body, her job, or her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a question you really want to answer? If you chose a
response that agrees with her evaluation, she will think that her
deficiency must be obvious to others. If you pick something else,
she'll wonder why you would find fault with some aspect of her life
that doesn't bother her.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you slice it, you're a loser.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened, as we played the game, is that everyone would
wait and see how the spouse of the question-reader voted. The safe
thing would be to just say what the spouse said.
</P>
<P>
   But then the game wasn't as fun. So we instituted a
spouse-votes-last rule, which brought on another round of truth
serum.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, we just suspended moving the little tokens. Instead,
we just pulled cards until we found one that was intriguing, yet
not too grotesquely personal, to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Like the question that says, ``If all my fantasies were
fulfilled, I'd be (a) admired (b) despised (c) imprisoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, come to think of it, that might not be a great question.
</P>
<P>
   Let's pick another one.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. No, not that one either.
</P>
<P>
   How about another one?
</P>
<P>
   More truth serum, anyone?

 &HT;    Rather rides again
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Jan. 10
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Noted news hound Dan Rather likes nothing more
than donning a slicker, grabbing a microphone and rushing
head-first into a hurricane. He's about to perform a similar, if
drier and slightly less dangerous, feat this week.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Wednesday at 8 p.m., he'll anchor ``60 Minutes II,'' a
spinoff of the program that launched the newsmagazine genre three
decades ago and has been unsurpassed in quality and popularity ever
since. Rather, 67, will add the new anchoring duties to his already
busy job anchoring ``The CBS Evening News'' and another
newsmagazine, ``48 Hours.'' Even for the James Brown of news
anchors, it's a mighty load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an hour to fill on my work schedule and along came `60
Minutes.' Fit right in,'' Rather said with a chuckle in a phone
interview. ``Seriously, you find time for the things you love to
do, and I love the news and I love reporting. This is an
opportunity I couldn't pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   But won't this cut into his fishing time? Rather and his wife,
Jean, both native Texans, have a house on Lake Travis and enjoy
relaxing there when they can escape from New York. They just ended
a two-week respite in the Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, believe me, fishing is not at risk,'' Rather said. ``I
actually caught some bass this last time. ... Mostly I catch
suicidal fish, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather insists he's got time for everything and plans to cut
back on nothing. They don't call him Gunga Dan for nothing. And
adding a duty that could afford him the luxury of in-depth
reporting _ Rather's first love _ probably seems like a worthwhile
squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   While critics sneer at exploding pickups on ``Dateline NBC'' and
celebrity puff pieces on ``20/20,'' the landmark news show has been
treated with near-reverence. It's been a mainstay on Sunday nights
and has a sterling reputation for memorable reports from veterans
like Mike Wallace, Morley Safer, Ed Bradley and, from 1975-81,
Rather, before he inherited the ``Evening News'' anchor chair from
Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to copy the best is a noble but challenging goal. Even
Don Hewitt, executive producer of the original ``60 Minutes,'' has
lamented the proliferation of newsmagazines and initially objected
to the cloning of his program. ``60 Minutes'' is a huge success,
some say a one-of-a-kind. Why try to copy it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is the best,'' said Rather. ``We want to make this
broadcast as close to `60 Minutes' as we can. If we're going to do
another newsmagazine, we ought to do what works, and `60 Minutes'
is the best brand name among newsmagazines. It invented the form.
And I don't mean to irritate Don Hewitt, but I think we can make it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitive taunts notwithstanding, Hewitt backed off his
opposition to ``60 Minutes II'' when Jeff Fager, who worked on ``60
Minutes'' and the ``Evening News,'' was brought on to produce it.
Once Fager was aboard, Rather soon followed, and Hewitt was
convinced that CBS wasn't trying to slap his sterling title onto a
tabloid sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt even suggested one of the new show's more unusual
elements _ a full-blown weekly update of a story from the original
program, with ``60 Minutes'' reporters crossing over from the old
to the new broadcast to do them. Wallace will update one of his for
this week's premiere. The other two stories in the new show's
three-story format will be originals by anchor/reporter Rather and
correspondents Vicki Mabrey, Bob Simon and Charlie Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my mantra is you don't have to dumb it down and sleaze
it up to attract an audience,'' Rather said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which currently has two newsmagazines (``48 Hours'' and
``60 Minutes''), apparently was dead-set on having another one. ABC
has three editions of ``20/20'' and is about to have a fourth
edition of ``20/20,'' and NBC has ``Dateline'' spread over five
nights. By next month, there will be a whopping 13 hours of
newsmagazines gobbling up the 22-hour prime-time schedule. Most of
them do well in the ratings and cost a fraction of the price of
dramas and sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't there a newsmagazine saturation point? Aren't viewers
finally going to say enough is enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Rather countered adamantly. ``There's
always room for quality. If it isn't good journalism, it gets to be
clutter pretty quickly, but I don't know of anybody who argues that
TV is cluttered with too much quality journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Rather and Fager are reluctant to criticize their
competitors, but they make it clear they believe they are
practicing a higher form of journalism. No exploding pickups there.
Fager, 44, who has a reputation for producing hard-hitting news,
insists CBS has committed the time and money necessary for strong
reporting. Most stories on ``60 Minutes'' take an average of two
months to report and produce. Fager expects similar thoroughness on
``60 Minutes II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else is doing what `60 Minutes' does, and that's why I
think there's room for us with that kind of reporting,'' Fager
said. ``We won't jump on stories just because they're happening
this week. We do spend a lot of time on reporting and collecting
research. You have to be prepared for that kind of investment of
time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rather says that doesn't mean ``60 Minutes II'' won't be
timely and newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be timely, but we won't be prisoners of
timeliness,'' Rather said. ``If we can do something timely and meet
our standards of quality, we'll jump all over it ... We've spent
years looking into Russia's secret cities, the ones that were
designed to build atomic weapons, and very little of it has wound
up on the `Evening News.' We're going to do something on that on
our broadcast. I think people will be surprised to learn that some
of those activities are still going on. Now, that's pretty timely,
but it's not the latest celebrity or the Senate impeachment
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of impeachment, this bulldog reporter, who
salivates at the thought of breaking news, is sick to death of the
White House scandal that has consumed the news for more than a year
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it, I really do,'' Rather said softly. ``I think
there's a misunderstanding that reporters love this story, and
that's not my experience. I love a big story, but I hate this one.
... It has far too many farcical aspects, and they tend to get
overcovered, but it is a tragedy all the way around.''

 &HT;    The condo king
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed until Monday, Jan. 11
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Watch this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Madden is smirking like a cat about to eat a prize canary.
</P>
<P>
   He's walking toward ``The Gantlet,'' a narrow stretch of deck
between the turquoise swimming pool and the long line of lounge
chairs where residents sun bathe at the Dune Deck condominium in
South Palm Beach. Madden, the condo association's president,
usually takes the long way around the pool during the day because
disgruntled owners tend to leap to their feet and bend his ear
about any number of piddling issues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Madden sees one of his frequent critics, a tan man in his
60s, who is lying in the sun. Every building improvement Madden
suggests to the condo's governing board, this man opposes. Madden
playfully launches a cannonball over his neighbor's bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey there, how about that barbecue! It's really coming
along!'' Madden says, his booming voice echoing in the honeycomb of
balconies that overlooks the pool. He's pointing to a permanent,
concrete-and-tile barbecue pit being built next to the pool cabana.
``It's almost done! You'll be cooking steaks on it by January.''
</P>
<P>
   The man snaps at the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awww, nooooo,'' the tan retiree moans. He props himself up on
his lounge chair, as if a different position will boost the power
of his complaint. ``I don't believe it. It's never going to get
done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, it's almost done,'' Madden says, continuing his brisk
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not. Nothing around here works right, I swear.'' The
man is waving his arms now, twisting his body to face Madden as he
walks. ``Nothing works right!''
</P>
<P>
   Madden ducks into a nearby entrance that leads to the condo's
elevators.
</P>
<P>
   He's giggling now, aware of the emotional terrorism he's
launched, chortling at having pushed his adversary's buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was almost too easy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, it's good to be the king.
</P>
<P>
   Exchanges such as those, well, they're the kind that belong in a
book.
</P>
<P>
   So after almost two years of trying to refurbish and revitalize
the condominium he shares with 130 residents, after dozens of
goofball confrontations with owners and battles with board members
present and past, Madden drew on the experiences to write a
tell-all ``fictional'' novel called ``King of the Condo''
(TransMedia Publishing, $9.95).
</P>
<P>
   The plot follows the headaches and heartaches of Edward J.
Malardi, a cigar vendor from the rough side of Philadelphia who
made his money and retired to Florida, only to find himself at the
helm of an oceanfront condo. When he tries to push the residents to
renovate their decaying building, things go haywire. Threats are
made. Bullets zing through sliding glass doors. Hate notes are
slipped under his door. A turtle lover tries to run him over on the
beach with a tractor. Lawsuits sprout like weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Madden describes his book as ``thinly veiled,'' but consider
these dead-on similarities:
</P>
<P>
   _ Malardi is elected after complaining at a condo board meeting
about the sad condition of the building's lobby. The board quits en
masse one night, clearing the way for him to campaign for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Madden complained about the building's dungeon-like lobby and _
you got it _ The Dune Deck board quit en masse one night, leading
him to campaign for the job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Malardi campaigns to hire a full-time manager and overhaul the
fire alarm and sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   Madden campaigned to improve the management and fire safety of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   _ Malardi's wife, Rita, is described in the book as a curvaceous
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Madden's wife, Angela, who is from Bari in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   With these and other similarities, Madden is coy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say it's very loosely based,'' he said while
sitting on the balcony of his third-floor home and watching the
waves lap at the shore. ``If anyone sees themselves, it's not by
design.''
</P>
<P>
   But Terry Rains, Dune Deck's full-time manager, said the book is
plenty accurate. She easily recognized the traits of some
characters in the book that matched with tenants she deals with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked at a couple of facilities, and what's funny is
that the characters in Tom's book can be found at any building you
go to,'' Rains said. ``They're universal characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden has made a good living pushing people's buttons. He did
it for years as a public relations executive at the ABC and NBC
television networks, and later as head of his own PR firm in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After he sold his agency, he moved south to Boca Raton and
started another firm, TransMedia. Besides public relations, the
agency has branched into publishing. Which is where King of the
Condo comes in. His first book, Spin Man, took a look at the
promotions industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this book, though, as a form of therapy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Dune Deck about five years ago, attending a few
condo board meetings but mostly keeping a low profile. (He once
received a written reprimand for not wearing a shirt while emptying
the trash into a communal bin and was threatened with a fine, but
did not contest the letter.)
</P>
<P>
   But he realized that the building needed sprucing up. People had
pledged for years to do something, but nothing ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning on a platform that stressed the protection of the
building's assets, Madden was elected to the condo's board and made
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days in, a woman I call the Diva of the Dumpster comes to
me crying that I threw her Christmas tree away,'' Madden said. The
tree, which the woman donated for display in the lobby, looked
shabby, so he pitched it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me, `I didn't donate it, I loaned it. I want it
back,''' he said. ``So two guys helped her fish it out. It was then
that I felt there might be some material for a whodunnit.''
</P>
<P>
   To residents' dismay, he soon started streamlining. Meetings
that took hours and were held weekly were trimmed back to once a
month or less often. Public comment was limited. Residents accused
him of railroading issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the lobby, though, was the ultimate sin. The project
cost thousands and included knocking down walls, replacing
furniture and wiring, and building new quarters for the concierge.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the building, it seemed, wanted a say on the
project. Sensing chaos, Madden insisted the board select everything
with limited comment from residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to act like the king, you really do, or else it all
breaks down,'' he said. ``How can 130 people design a lobby? What
would that look like?''
</P>
<P>
   The lobby was rebuilt. And Madden made enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go out to the pool, all the conversation stops,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some days it's not good to be the king. Like the day earlier
this week when Madden returned from a long holiday trip to New
York, only to find that his brand-new black Jaguar sedan had been
vandalized. He had parked the car in another owner's spot after
getting permission from the condo manager, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he got home he found glue smeared over the windows. And on
the car, a note:
</P>
<P>
   Spin Jerk,
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that you and your wife are considered the least
liked residents of this condominium. Only a total (expletive) like
you would park his car in another owner's designated space during
an entire vacation week and leave town without leaving a car key
with the door man so your car could be moved.
</P>
<P>
   I am giving you fair warning, if you ever park your car in my
space again, you will do so at your peril.
</P>
<P>
   The funny part: The note was signed and dated. Below the
signature was the person's unit number, just so there would be no
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are humorless,'' Madden said Monday. ``Maybe he's
read my book and doesn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The king's reign is just about over. Opting not to run for
another two-year term, Madden says he's had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night I'm sitting on the couch,'' he says. ``Out of the
corner of my eye I see something slide under the door. I go over,
pick it up and read it and it's someone complaining about this or
that. I mean, what are we, in high school or something?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the residents has hired an investigator and an accountant
to make sure the condo's pool of assessment money was spent
legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot make it 30 or 40 yards sometimes without being
assaulted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it will be all over for Madden. Just like it was for
Malardi. In the book, the King of the Condo disappears into a haze
of cigar smoke, following a board vote that the whole tale had just
been a bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   The way Madden talks, there aren't enough cigars in the world to
make his bad dream go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something deep in the primordial sense of human
beings,'' he concludes. ``When you mess with their shelter, people
get upset.

 &HT;    BOTH SIDES ASSEMBLE BIG LEGAL TEAMS
 &HT;    Repeating from Thursday's file for all needing.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the impeachment of President Clinton becomes the
trial of the century in the U.S. Senate, both sides will be ready
with large teams of courtroom-tested lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, the attorney advantage goes to the president. His
defenders can draw both from a White House that's chockablock with
lawyers and from Clinton's private attorney David Kendall, whose
firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly is famous among local prosecutors for
saving clients with scorched-earth legal tactics.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesmen refused Thursday to say how many
government lawyers have been mobilized for the task of defending
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's office of counsel has about 35 lawyers, paralegals and
support staffers, working at a combined annual salary budget of
more than $2 million. Jim Kennedy, the president's legal spokesman,
said that ``relatively few members of the staff'' were working on
the impeachment case, and many of them only part time.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the public-private effort to save this presidency is a
major undertaking. A White House legal response to the impeachment
charges last Dec. 14 listed no fewer than eight attorneys' names,
led by Gregory Craig, the special counsel who was summoned from the
State Department to coordinate Clinton's defense, and by Charles
Ruff, the president's chief counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for the president's government lawyers will be paid by the
taxpayers. Republicans in the past loudly objected to Clinton's use
of his staff to defend him in the various Whitewater
investigations, but they are not complaining now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it gets to impeachment, I think the issue is joined,''
said C. Boyden Gray, who was chief counsel in the Bush White House.
``It's OK to defend impeachment with taxpayer funds.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton will also mount up more IOUs to Kendall, whose
scowling visage has been prominent throughout Clinton's legal
difficulties. Kendall's $400-an-hour rates are paid by the
president's legal defense fund, which has consistently fallen
behind as legal costs have soared.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when President Andrew Johnson was impeached 130
years ago, he paid his own team of five lawyers. The fee was $2,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Clinton impeachment, the president will
face 13 House ``managers,'' members of the House Judiciary
Committee who will conduct the case in the Senate. The
all-Republican team led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
J. Hyde of Illinois is made up of lawyers, several of whom are
experienced prosecutors who frequently speak of their own trial
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee has a backup team of 18 attorneys, including
eight hired to deal with the impeachment investigation, who will
help develop the case in the Senate. David Schippers, the blunt
Chicago Democrat brought in to lead the House investigation, is
coordinating the prosecution staff.
</P>
<P>
   The House investigation, budgeted for $1.2 million, cost an
estimated $900,000 last year. For the Senate trial, the House this
week voted to spend money ``as needed'' for legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial grows into a lengthy proceeding with witnesses to
depose and cross-examine, Senate Democrats may also seek legal
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the Washington lawyer who was the lead attorney for
the Democrats in the House investigation, said Thursday that
``Democrats could use help in learning about the evidence'' if the
trial is prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said he has been providing Democratic senators and their
staff with information about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all waiting'' to see what happens next, he said.

   BARBIE _ DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Barbie turns 40 in March, but
Delray Beach, Fla., isn't waiting until then to celebrate: As part

specially from Mattel. We talk with the exhibit's ``curator'' (a

   COFFEE _ GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Gainesville, Georgia may be most
well known for its poultry plants. But Don Wilson wants to make it
synonymous with gourmet coffee. A reformed drinker who traded in
booze for gourmet coffees, he eventually found it wasn't enough to
discover and enjoy: He wanted to import, roast and run his own
coffee company. Since 1995, his St. Ives Coffee Roasters of
Gainesville has been building business, and its name. Some diehard
Atlantans drive up weekly for freshly roasted beans, and his
mail-order business has taken off. (Guthrie, Atlanta

   OPRY _ It's the oldest running live radio show in America, and
the temple of country music. But the Grand Ole Opry is facing a
challenge. Most of the members are well into their `70s, and
management is finding it difficult to interest the young, suburban
country fan in the graying institution. Opry members (many of whom
have no other venue for their music) are incredibly protective of
their fiefdom, and reluctant to change the show in any way. This
weekend, the Opry returns to the Ryman auditorium for the first
time in 25 years, which could be test run for how to keep the
tradition alive into the 21st century. A look at the Opry, its
current status and the challenges it faces as a Southern arts
institution, through the words and insights of performers and
owners. (MLongino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS. FOR

   STREAMBOAT _ It's easy to get carried away by the natural beauty
of this relatively remote ski resort, far from the hipster crowds
of Aspen and Vail. Steamboat Springs is further out from Denver (a
three-hour drive) than most of the state's ski areas and sits on a
fascinating climactic divide. From some canyon roads you can throw
a rock and hit snow-covered spruce on the shadowed, north-facing
slope, then turn around and peg one against sun-baked boulders and
sagebrush on the southern exposure. ``Steamboat's just a country
town at heart, not a lot of fur coats but hey _ those are OK too,
anything goes,'' says Kay Sullins, 46, whose Windwalker Tours
specializes in towing people around with horses _ by sleigh in
winter, chuckwagons in summer. (DHulbert, Atlanta

   STEAMBOAT-TIPS _ Ski tips from a spouse skiing for the first

lifetime. Having already climbed my way to that summit called
Mature Adulthood, I wasn't sure that I wanted to risk it all for
the sensation of sliding down a mountain. But faster than you can

   HELOISE (San Antonio) _ It's a weekday afternoon and the
best-known name in American housekeeping isn't doing any. Instead,
Heloise is hunkered down at a computer, answering questions from
inquiring minds on the Internet. This is a day set aside for

``Tony'' Soprano. There are times you'll crack up, laughing that

MARK McGUIRE

   FILM-REVIEW-DEVINE (Undated) _ Not to scare you off, but naked
old men on motorcycles figure prominently in ``Waking Ned Devine.''
So does a days-old corpse. And dentures. And pig stench, which has
nothing to do with the corpse. But this film a puckish little
pleasure, a movie so adamantly (and, most of the time,
successfully) sweet-natured that you all but forget the twisted
amorality at its core. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-CIVIL (Undated) _ If I were in the legal racket, I
might think about suing the makers of ``A Civil Action.'' Few

movie where the morally dubious main character turns into a hero
with a worthy cause. By WALTER ADDIEGO.
</P>
<P>
   TV-WB-KELLNER (Pasadena, Calif.) _ The man running The WB, at
this moment the only network to show any viewership gains and, more
importantly, the one to watch, has no problem owning up to his

of the Supreme Court arrived in a gown with gold stripes on the
arms, a fashion statement he borrowed from the Lord Chancellor in
``Iolanthe,'' a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera. If the Senate

from ``The Mikado.'' By ROB MORSE.

 &HT;    Cutting mortises by hand requires some expertise
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question of how to cut mortises, especially by hand, has
been bandied about on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, I'll say that mortises are not something you want
to cut entirely by hand unless you are merely trying to pass time.
It is extremely tedious, and of course one never cuts only one
mortise. They generally come in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to cut them by hand, then you'll need a good chisel
of the same width as the mortise. You can generally get by with
cabinetmaker's chisels, although firmer chisels would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Lay out the mortise carefully, using a marking knife to scribe
the lines. Then use the chisel with a good wooden or rubber mallet
to deepen the scribe lines. Be careful to keep the flat side of the
chisel on the outside, and don't let it thicken the line to the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Then begin wasting the wood in the center by cutting a V shape,
gradually widening it until you are near both ends of the mortise.
Now trim it down until you're at the marks. Some woodworkers like
to undercut their mortises just a little to allow room for glue and
make for a smooth fit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, assuming you own an electric drill, you can make life much
easier by wasting most of the wood with a bit a little smaller than
the width of the mortise. A drill press is best for this, since you
have to be careful to keep the bit square to the sides, but you can
do it if you're careful.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of folks are really happy with the chisel attachments you
put on a drill press. These use a drill bit on the inside to waste
most of the wood and chisel-like knives on all four sides to smooth
and square the cut. The drawback here is that they're rather
expensive and the chisels must be kept very sharp. Relatively
recently dedicated machines using these devices have appeared on
the market. They are very expensive for what they do.
</P>
<P>
   The happiest mortising I've ever done was on my old Inca table
saw, which had a mortising table attached to it. This made a
believer of me _ the best kind of dedicated mortising machine is a
horizontal mortiser. These use standard, relatively inexpensive
cutters rotating at high speed. The cutter is fixed. The work is
attached to a table which can be adjusted very finely for height.
There is one lever for side to side movement of the table and
another for depth. Stops can be set to limit all the travel, and
the mortise is quickly cut in an ever-deeper series of passes.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback here is a round shoulder. Fussbudgets can use
a chisel, or even buy a tool, to square the shoulder. I always
round over the edges of the tenon.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are very few horizontal mortisers on the
market, but they can be shop-made.
</P>
<P>
   Since the departure of my Inca saw, I've used a homemade router
jig to cut mortises. You can find instructions for making one in
almost any book on routing or shop jigs. It works very well; it's
just not as quick for cutting a whole series of mortises as a
dedicated machine. n

<P>
   The most ambitious artificial brain yet designed is taking shape
in a laboratory in Colorado. The brain's developers aim to link it
to a robot kitten called Robokoneko, which they hope will become
one of the first superstars of artificial life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Observers won't need a Ph.D. to appreciate that there is a
brain behind it,'' says Hugo de Garis of Advanced
Telecommunications Research in Kyoto, Japan, the brain's principal
architect.
</P>
<P>
   De Garis' Cellular Automata Machine, or CAM, brain is being
built under contract by Genobyte, a company in Boulder, Colo. It
will contain nearly 40 million artificial neurons, compared with
the few hundred neurons that most other specialists in artificial
intelligence are working with. The CAM brain differs not only in
its immense scale, but also in the fact that its neurons are real
electronic devices rather than software simulations.
</P>
<P>
   The CAMbrain uses a special type of computer chip called a field
programmable gate array, or FPGA. Unlike conventional chips, the
circuits in FPGAs can be reconfigured by altering the connections
between their transistors. When de Garis conceived his project six
years ago it was greeted with skepticism. ``Many of my colleagues
thought I was nuts,'' he says. But it has now become a practical
proposition with the development of a new and exceptionally robust
FPGA made by Xilinx, a company in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The CAM brain will run on 72 linked FPGAs. At any one time,
these devices will act as a ``module'' containing 1,152
interconnected neurons. But the devices will be repeatedly
reconfigured to represent 32,768 different modules. The brain
remembers how the modules connect to each other and uses the
outputs of the modules it has already processed as inputs for
others. A cycle through these modules, representing 37.7 million
neurons, will be repeated 300 times every second.
</P>
<P>
   To model the brain, de Garis uses some 450 million autonomous
``cells'' representing components such as the neurons themselves
and the axons and dendrites that connect them. Each cell consists
of several transistors within a FPGA. The CAM brain is scheduled
for completion in March.
</P>
<P>
   Neural networks must be fine-tuned to perform particular tasks.
But no human programmer could write the software needed to refine a
network as complex as the CAM brain. Instead, this will be
generated using an approach that simulates biological evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Through random mutations and breeding of the ``genetic
material'' that describes the structure and connections of the
network, the program will be evolved over many generations to get
the optimum design. Robokoneko will not be built until this work
has been completed on a computer simulation of the robot cat.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, however, doubt whether building ever bigger neural
networks will bring any fundamental insights into the mysteries of
cognition, such as how the brain builds a representation of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that these puzzles are not puzzles because our
neural models are not large enough,'' argues Igor Aleksander, a
neural systems engineer at Imperial College in London.
</P>
<P>
   The CAM brain's developers admit that they can't predict exactly
how it will perform when it is linked to Robokoneko. But they hope
it will for the first time allow a robot to interact with stimuli
in its environment to develop the sort of intelligence seen in
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so special about this neural network is a much higher
degree of biological relevance,'' says Michael Korkin of Genobyte. &QL;

   A glass and a half of wine a day could help prevent
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have highlighted the antioxidant properties of
certain chemicals in wine. Now Alberto Bertelli and his colleagues
at the Human Anatomy Institute at the University of Milan in Italy
have found that resveratrol, a chemical produced by vines to fight
infection and found in grapes and wine, increases the activity and
effectiveness of an important neural enzyme by up to sevenfold. The
enzyme, known as Mapkinase, stimulates and regenerates neural
cells.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tested resveratrol on human neural cells in
laboratory cultures and found that it made them grow small
extensions through which they could connect with neighboring cells.
</P>
<P>
   This is a key finding since the contacts between some neural
cells are broken in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. ``By daily
reinforcing these contacts, we can prevent neurodegeneration,''
Bertelli says. The team presented its results at the first
International Congress on Health and Wine in Florence last month.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marc Orgogozo, head of neurology at the University Hospital
of Bordeaux, published a paper last year which showed that people
who drank moderate amounts of wine daily were less likely to
develop neurodegenerative diseases (American Journal of
Epidemiology, v. 148, p. 298). &QL;

   To model the brain, de Garis uses some 450 million autonomous
``cells'' representing components such as the neurons themselves
and the axons and dendrites that connect them. Each cell consists
of several transistors within a FPGA. The CAM brain is scheduled
for completion in March.
</P>
<P>
   Neural networks must be fine-tuned to perform particular tasks.
But no human programmer could write the software needed to refine a
network as complex as the CAM brain. Instead, this will be
generated using an approach that simulates biological evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Through random mutations and breeding of the ``genetic
material'' that describes the structure and connections of the
network, the program will be evolved over many generations to get
the optimum design. Robokoneko will not be built until this work
has been completed on a computer simulation of the robot cat.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, however, doubt whether building ever bigger neural
networks will bring any fundamental insights into the mysteries of
cognition, such as how the brain builds a representation of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that these puzzles are not puzzles because our
neural models are not large enough,'' argues Igor Aleksander, a
neural systems engineer at Imperial College in London.
</P>
<P>
   The CAM brain's developers admit that they can't predict exactly
how it will perform when it is linked to Robokoneko. But they hope
it will for the first time allow a robot to interact with stimuli
in its environment to develop the sort of intelligence seen in
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so special about this neural network is a much higher
degree of biological relevance,'' says Michael Korkin of Genobyte. &QL;

   A glass and a half of wine a day could help prevent
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have highlighted the antioxidant properties of
certain chemicals in wine. Now Alberto Bertelli and his colleagues
at the Human Anatomy Institute at the University of Milan in Italy
have found that resveratrol, a chemical produced by vines to fight
infection and found in grapes and wine, increases the activity and
effectiveness of an important neural enzyme by up to sevenfold. The
enzyme, known as Mapkinase, stimulates and regenerates neural
cells.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers tested resveratrol on human neural cells in
laboratory cultures and found that it made them grow small
extensions through which they could connect with neighboring cells.
</P>
<P>
   This is a key finding since the contacts between some neural
cells are broken in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. ``By daily
reinforcing these contacts, we can prevent neurodegeneration,''
Bertelli says. The team presented its results at the first
International Congress on Health and Wine in Florence last month.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marc Orgogozo, head of neurology at the University Hospital
of Bordeaux, published a paper last year which showed that people
who drank moderate amounts of wine daily were less likely to
develop neurodegenerative diseases (American Journal of
Epidemiology, v. 148, p. 298). &QL;

<P>
   NELSONVILLE, Ohio _ The snow drifts against the historic
passenger coaches of the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway, parked in
the downtown of this scenic Appalachian foothill community. The
railroad won't haul tourists again until Memorial Day. Now is the
winter of discontent and economic worry.
</P>
<P>
   True, times are not as tough as they once were. The new Taco
Bell and Burger King down the road from the train depot and the
signs advertising unlimited Internet access for $12.95 a month
suggest this is not the Appalachia that moved America three decades
ago to wage a ``war on poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the economic gains in Appalachia blaze in fluorescent
and neon lights all along U.S. 33, this town of about 5,000 also
illustrates a not-so-glaring truth: the national economic boom of
the 1990s has largely benefited the well-to-do, and has actually
widened the gap between the have and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like you're either rich or poor, and if they want to
make us the poster child _ and it gets the rest of the country
talking about the forgotten towns of America _ well, that's all
right with me,'' said Charlie Smith, whose restaurant, The Coffee
Cup, is a popular gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is talking about a political odd couple, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who led a rally in Nelsonville
last fall to focus national attention on poverty and the growing
gap between the rich and poor in America.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's family moved here from West Virginia in 1968 when he was
a year old. Smith's father had lost his job there. He later lost
his job here, and the family relied on public assistance until his
father started The Coffee Cup ``with only a can of beans and a
pound of meat,'' Smith boasted.
</P>
<P>
   The folks around here are proud of Nelsonville. ``It's a
close-knit town, and it's safe,'' said 23-year-old Deedra Dupler, a
native and mother of two little girls. She works as a waitress. Her
husband, Bryan, is a foreman at the Rocky Boot factory, one of the
few remaining manufacturing plants in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just too dependent on tourism, and that's the first
thing to feel a recession,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   To attract tourists, Nelsonville has gone to great lengths to
preserve its history. The Hocking Valley Scenic Railway gives
tourists a glimpse of the past, passing shut-down brick kilns and
mines that were once the mainstays of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   The restored Drew Hotel, which once played host to a campaigning
Teddy Roosevelt, is a popular attraction. The town's Victorian-era
public square, with its turn-of-the-century fountain, was the
backdrop for scenes in the 1985 movie ``Mischief,'' about teen life
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson, though, Nelsonville is the perfect setting to get
Americans thinking anew about poverty and income inequality. It is
overwhelmingly white, and it is surrounded by the picturesque Wayne
National Forest, not the blight of the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   His Appalachian effort is the flip side to his ``Wall Street
Project,'' which promotes increased investment in minority-owned
businesses and predominantly black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wall Street Project'' will hold its second annual
gathering starting Thursday in New York, with President Clinton and
numerous top business executives scheduled to attend. At the
conference, the president is expected to announce initiatives to
promote minority business access to capital, Jackson aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty has not been an integral part of the presidential
dialogue since 1980, except in the context of reforming welfare.
And no politician today, except Jackson, seems very concerned about
it, or the widening income inequality that economists have been
tracking for decades.
</P>
<P>
   That partly reflects an American belief that people bear primary
responsibility for supporting themselves. Opinion polls
consistently show that only about a quarter of Americans believe
that the government should guarantee each citizen a minimum
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, with the help of Falwell, has set about trying to
get the next batch of presidential candidates and the country to
see what the globalized economy has wrought, and to change the
debate on poverty from one of race to one of class.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John F. Kennedy went to Harlem and held a poor black baby
in his arms, it was dismissed as something liberals do,'' Jackson
said. ``But when Bobby Kennedy went to Appalachia and held a white
baby with a bloated stomach in his arms, America was forced to pay
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has challenged the presidential candidates in the 2000
campaign to come to Appalachia and explain what they will do to
reverse the 20-year decline in earnings for the poorest 40 percent
of American households.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years of anti-poverty spending has, for the most part,
alleviated the kind of spirit-killing poverty that Bobby Kennedy
encountered in Appalachia during his presidential campaign in 1968.
The region's problem now is the same as the rest of America:
high-paying manufacturing and mining jobs have been replaced by
lower-paying service sector jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good-paying jobs are just hard to find around here,'' said
Lauren Oliver, an admissions counselor at Hocking College, a
two-year technical school founded in 1968 and occupying 1,600 acres
in the eastern end of Nelsonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to think of Appalachian poverty in terms of old
folks sitting on the porch of a log cabin whittling away,'' she
said. ``You still have some of that. But for the most part, it is
people who are working, but not making enough to support their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, a recent graduate of Ohio University in nearby Athens,
speaks from personal experience. Her job at Hocking was ``a
godsend,'' she said. Before landing it several months ago, she was
working for $7 an hour at the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, 1.3 million new jobs have been added to the
Appalachian economy, according to a study done last fall by the
Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the agency created by
Congress in 1966 to improve living conditions in the 406 rural
counties in the 13 states that make up the Appalachian region.
</P>
<P>
   While politicians and bureaucrats hailed the new jobs as
evidence of the success of their policies, they largely ignored the
fact that more than 1 million of the new jobs were in lower-wage
service sectors rather than manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to the ARC study, the Appalachian region has
lost more than 260,000 manufacturing and mining jobs during the
past decade. And Greg Bischak, the ARC's senior economist who did
the study, warns of ``continued erosion'' of manufacturing jobs due
to global competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Appalachia, we see a reflection _ magnified _ of the crisis
affecting working Americans across our nation,'' said John Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO, who helped Jackson organize the rally in
Nelsonville last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Appalachia, it's not just Nelsonville, it's
every small town,'' said Smith. ``We've been forgot. We're
hard-working people, and we should be rewarded. But we're not a big
block of voters, so the politicians don't see us or hear us.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling Teddy Roosevelt's campaign stop, Smith mused. ``Maybe
another presidential candidate will come to and listen to us.''

   NELSONVILLE, Ohio _ The snow drifts against the historic
passenger coaches of the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway, parked in
the downtown of this scenic Appalachian foothill community. The
railroad won't haul tourists again until Memorial Day. Now is the
winter of discontent and economic worry.
</P>
<P>
   True, times are not as tough as they once were. The new Taco
Bell and Burger King down the road from the train depot and the
signs advertising unlimited Internet access for $12.95 a month
suggest this is not the Appalachia that moved America three decades
ago to wage a ``war on poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the economic gains in Appalachia blaze in fluorescent
and neon lights all along U.S. 33, this town of about 5,000 also
illustrates a not-so-glaring truth: the national economic boom of
the 1990s has largely benefited the well-to-do, and has actually
widened the gap between the have and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like you're either rich or poor, and if they want to
make us the poster child _ and it gets the rest of the country
talking about the forgotten towns of America _ well, that's all
right with me,'' said Charlie Smith, whose restaurant, The Coffee
Cup, is a popular gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is talking about a political odd couple, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who led a rally in Nelsonville
last fall to focus national attention on poverty and the growing
gap between the rich and poor in America.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's family moved here from West Virginia in 1968 when he was
a year old. Smith's father had lost his job there. He later lost
his job here, and the family relied on public assistance until his
father started The Coffee Cup ``with only a can of b

<P>
   Government scientists apparently cannot be trusted. Opinion
polls consistently suggest that the public has far greater faith in
nongovernmental pressure groups than in the ones their taxes are
paying for.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to conservation and animal rights, that faith
may sometimes be profoundly misplaced. Take the case of Patrick
Bateson, an expert on animal behavior at Cambridge University in
England. In 1997, he published a report suggesting that hunting
with hounds could lead to high levels of stress and muscle damage
in wild deer. The National Trust, which commissioned the report,
immediately banned deer-hunting on its land.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-hunting Countryside Alliance then commissioned its own
study, led by Roger Harris of the Royal Veterinary College in
Hertfordshire, which contradicted many of Bateson's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Bateson is now accusing both sides of misusing his science to
promote their own cause. He accuses the hunting lobby of
``clutching at straws by grabbing the most flimsy bits of
evidence'' to undermine his findings. But he also deplores the way
the anti-hunting lobby has interpreted his report to mean that
fox-hunting is cruel. ``I have never said any such thing,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers claim that the abuse of scientific findings by
certain pressure groups has become so entrenched that it threatens
to undermine conservation everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very serious problem,'' says Chris Huxley, an ecologist
working for Cambridge-based Fauna and Flora International, which
seeks to protect endangered species. ``Some groups have been caught
peddling misinformation so often that decision makers in the
developing world are beginning to question the validity of
conservation arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Huxley cites the case of the African elephant, whose population
was said by conservation experts to have declined from 1.3 million
to 650,000 during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of these figures, which came from the Elephant
Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union, the ivory trade
was outlawed under the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species in 1989. However, before the ban, participants
at a meeting in Botswana of the CITES Ivory Trade Review Group
heard from the IUCN scientists that the alleged decline of 650,000
elephants included 300,000 in Zaire that had never existed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it was admitted that figures for one area had been
extrapolated for the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   ``What astounded me,'' Huxley says, ``is that even though
everyone accepted that the figures had been fiddled, many
scientists and environmental groups continued to use them.'' He
accuses environmental groups of perpetuating the myth of a
catastrophic decline in elephant numbers across Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 30 organizations sprang up to save the elephant, and they
and others have a vested interest in exaggerating the crisis,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The ivory ban has since been partially lifted: Botswana, Namibia
and Zimbabwe will be allowed to start a limited trade with Japan
next spring. But arguments over the status of the elephant are
still simmering.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Zimbabwe set up the Communal Areas Management Program
for Indigenous Resources, or Campfire, which allows villagers to
manage and profit from wildlife, including elephants, outside
national parks. Over 90 percent of Campfire's income comes from
``trophy hunting,'' in which hunters pay to take away the tusks or
heads of the animals they kill.
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society of the United States claims that Campfire is
``biologically unsustainable'' and that the elephant in Zimbabwe is
``biologically threatened.'' However, a CITES panel of experts has
found that between 1980 and 1995, Zimbabwe's elephant population
grew by 2.1 percent _ or an extra 1,200 animals _ a year, even with
trophy hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The ivory ban has deprived villagers in Zimbabwe of a
much-needed source of revenue, say conservationists there. More
significantly, if the U.S. government did as the Humane Society
wished and stopped funding ``sustainable use'' programs and banned
the import of hunting trophies, Campfire would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only would that be a disaster for many communities,'' says
Jon Hutton, a zoologist with the Africa Resources Trust, which is
involved with Campfire. ``It would also be a disaster for
conservation.'' Most villagers will only tolerate crop-raiding
elephants if their communities benefit from Campfire payments.
</P>
<P>
   None of this impresses the Humane Society, however. Spokeswoman
Teresa Telecky says the organization came to its conclusion that
Campfire was bad for conservation after looking at data from the
U.S. Agency for International Development, a major donor to the
program. ``Campfire is socially, environmentally and economically
unsustainable in its present form,'' she maintains.
</P>
<P>
   The ``cherry-picking'' of science has lain at the heart of the
deer-hunting debate in Britain. Last September Bateson and Harris,
the two scientists who found themselves on opposite sides of the
fence, held a meeting to try to find some consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after this, Harris' team claimed that the meeting had
resulted in ``nine agreed points which essentially contradicted
every conclusion of the original ``Bateson'' report.'' But Bateson
claims this statement was ``actively misleading.'' He admits that
on certain matters he is now less confident, but maintains that his
central thesis _ that hunting deer with hounds causes suffering _
has been generally accepted by the National Trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the evidence was unpalatable,'' Bateson says, ``the
pro-hunting scientists have chosen to ignore or misrepresent it.''
Nigel Burke of the Countryside Alliance in turn describes Bateson's
suggestions as ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The selective use of science has also been a feature of the
whaling debate, according to Philip Hammond, former chair of the
International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee and director
of the Sea Mammals Research Unit at St. Andrew's University.
</P>
<P>
   When he was elected chair in 1991, the committee's most urgent
task was to draw up a system of managing minke whale stocks
sustainably. In 1993, his committee unanimously recommended a new
mathematical model that determines whether whales could be safely
caught.
</P>
<P>
   But the IWC initially ignored the model. Clearly the commission,
the majority of whose members represent nations opposed to whaling,
was not ready to accept anything that might lead to its resumption.
``It was a real slap in the face,'' says Hammond, who resigned in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lobbying groups have tended to emphasize those parts
of the committee's work that back their views. ``It's quite clear
that in the past the reports of the scientific committee have been
cherry-picked, and their findings taken out of context,'' Hammond
says.
</P>
<P>
   The selective use of science seems most prominent where large
mammals are involved. Bateson believes that part of the problem
stems from the public belief that science should provide
irrefutable answers to emotive issues. Pressure groups frequently
draw conclusions that go far beyond all the available evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists who promote programs such as Campfire that
``use'' wildlife have to be especially careful, Hutton says. ``Ours
is a very complex message, and if we're to convince the public that
conservation and culling can go hand in hand, we have to be
scrupulously honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Huxley believes that such programs have been generally honest in
their use of science. But the reputation of genuine
conservationists, he says, has been sullied by groups who use
science as a commodity to fit their cause. &QL;

   Egyptian mummies age surprisingly gracefully, a new report says.
Tissue from mummies can provide insight into disease and death long
ago. But that assumes the corpse hasn't changed during its
thousands of years of storage. ``The big question is whether the
way it looks now is the way it looked way back then,'' says Michael
Zimmerman of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman and his colleagues decided to find out by preparing a
mummy of their own. They dehydrated a man's body with natron, a
mixture of sodium carbonate and bicarbonate that the Egyptians used
to dry out their dead, then waited for 35 days. The modern mummy
looked similar to the ancient kind. For instance, both had
well-preserved spleens and kidneys, but badly degraded intestines.
``This gives us a lot of confidence about what we see in ancient
tissues,'' Zimmerman says. &QL;

   Egyptian mummies age surprisingly gracefully, a new report says.
Tissue from mummies can provide insight into disease and death long
ago. But that assumes the corpse hasn't changed during its
thousands of years of storage. ``The big question is whether the
way it looks now is the way it looked way back then,'' says Michael
Zimmerman of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman and his colleagues decided to find out by preparing a
mummy of their own. They dehydrated a man's body with natron, a
mixture of sodium carbonate and bicarbonate that the Egyptians used
to dry out their dead, then waited for 35 days. The modern mummy
looked similar to the ancient kind. For instance, both had
well-preserved spleens and kidneys, but badly degraded intestines.
``This gives us a lot of confidence about what we see in ancient
tissues,'' Zimmerman says. &QL;

SECOND AUTOPSY ON AMERICAN JOURNALIST SAID TO DIFFER FROM FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A medical expert has concluded that Philip True,
the San Antonio Express-News Mexico City bureau chief, was murdered
last month and that he could have died from having the equivalent
of 50 drinks of alcohol poured into him, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Emma Lew, a Miami-based pathologist who works with the FBI,
says True's death could have been caused four ways: strangulation,
a blow on the head, intoxication poisoning and a pulmonary edema _
abnormal fluid in his lungs _ from having ethanol (grain alcohol)
poured into him, says a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   True's widow, Martha, confirmed she had been told the same thing
in a mid-afternoon call from Guadalajara, where Lew met with
federal and Jalisco state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is it was a combination of those things,''
Martha True said.
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that True was murdered, Lew disputed earlier
conclusions by a veteran Jalisco coroner who ruled True had been
strangled with his bandana. She also dismissed that he'd likely
been brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   Lew also found that True's body had been dragged about 600 yards
from where he was killed to where it was dumped in a shallow grave.
</P>
<P>
   Lew was asked by the U.S. Embassy to observe the second autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo confirmed the
Guadalajara meeting, but said he did not have access to Lew's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   True disappeared halfway through a 10-day hiking trip last month
through the Sierra Madre Occidental, where he was researching the
Huichol Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Two Huichols have been charged with murder and robbery in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects originally told state prosecutors they killed
True for taking photos without permission. They later changed their
story and told a judge they killed True because he was threatening
their family and appeared drunk.
</P>
<P>
   A Zedillo spokesman said authorities were working to ensure they
had as much information as possible before making public any
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention is to make everything clear, but for judicial
reasons, some information must be reserved,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mario Rivas Souza, chief coroner for the state of Jalisco,
said earlier this week that he stands firmly by his finding that
True was strangled to death.
</P>
<P>
   He did concede that other medical examiners might reach their
own conclusions in the case. ``Medicine is not mathematics. Two and
two does not equal four,'' Rivas said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone else has another conclusion, they should have to
defend it,'' said Rivas.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas said True also had abrasions on his head and that tests
showed True's blood alcohol level was 0.26 percent. That is more
than twice the 0.1 percent drunken-driving limit in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted there was no proof True had been drinking since the
alcohol could have been produced by bacteria from the decomposing
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he was drunk, only that he had that level of
alcohol,'' Rivas said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican newspapers had speculated that True may have
slipped and fallen to his death while intoxicated. But the findings
by Lew and Rivas that the death was a homicide would dispute that
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   True had been dead for several days when his body was found on
Dec. 14 in the Chapalagana Canyon by a Huichol Indian who was
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   But when officials went to recover the body, they found it had
been moved to a shallow grave and wrapped in a sleeping bag and a
ground cloth.
</P>
<P>
   True, 50, had been employed by the Express-News since 1992 and
was the Mexico City bureau chief since 1996.

DECEMBER AND JANUARY ARE DEADLIEST MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's been a busy winter so far for Roy Bordeau.
Last month, the Schenectady funeral director got 42 calls, the
highest monthly total he can recall in more than two decades of
dealing with death.
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at the obituary pages this week promises another
hectic month. The grim reality is this: more people, particularly
the elderly, die in December and January than at any other time of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts attribute the seasonal rise in mortality to several
factors. This time of year marks the onset of the annual flu and
pneumonia season with the elderly being among the most vulnerable.
Every year, an estimated 20,000 people die nationwide from
flu-related complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tends to kill people isn't flu itself, but bacterial
pneumonia on top of that,'' said Dr. Michael Wolff, the medical
director of the Eddy Care Plus Center, an Albany clinic which
specializes in geriatric medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, some 21 flu outbreaks have been reported in
New York, about half as many as last year at this time, according
to the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory for the increased death rates is more difficult
to quantify: those who work with the elderly believe that winter,
with its short and cold days is an especially difficult time, both
physically and psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being susceptible to flu, pneumonia and a host of other
viral infections, the elderly also face an additional challenge
with the weather. ``People with cardiovascular disease often go out
and shovel which puts extra strain on their heart,'' said Dr.
Richard Gullott, the medical director at St. Clare's Hospital in
Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another issue is it's slippery. The elderly fall and break
their hips in the winter and then they come into the hospital.''
There, they face additional exposure to illness, which puts
increased strain on their already compromised immune systems. ``The
elderly have very little reserve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this talk about death and dying depresses you, that's
another problem this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that depression rates tend to increase in the
winter months and around the holidays. Bordeau believes the theory
that some elderly hang on through the holidays and then let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's some validity to that,'' he said. Yet Bordeau
also attributes his busier-than-usual winter this year to another
factor. ``I had the slowest summer in 1998 that I've ever had. July
and August were dead, no pun intended,'' he said. ``Everything
evens itself out.'' Psychologically, a mental balance this time of
year can be elusive among the elderly, especially if family doesn't
live nearby or if many friends have already died.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just give up,'' said Lois Siegel, the
community services coordinator for the Senior Resources Department
in Colonie. ``A lot of people get depressed when it's so dark.''
According to the latest state Health Department figures, 15,686 New
Yorkers died in December 1996 and 16,190 New Yorkers died in
January of that year, more than during any other time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the pattern was the same: 16,260 died in January and
15,223 died in December. Across the country, the story is similar.
In January 1996, 220,000 people died. The least deadly month was
August with 176,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those grim numbers, Bordeau believes most people,
especially the elderly, keep winter and all those newspaper obits
in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend not to relate it to themselves,'' he said.
``People never quite think it's going to happen to them.''

COACH SCORES POINTS WITH MANY EDUCATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MACKENZIE WARREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Calif. _ Many San Francisco-area school administrators
were amazed to hear that a basketball coach was willing to risk so
much on the court for so much off it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, local principals and athletic directors endorse
Richmond High School basketball coach Ken Carter's decision to
forfeit upcoming games until his players start working on their
books as hard as they work on their jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   They hail the coach of the undefeated and highly touted Oilers
for taking a stand on academics in a time when winning at all costs
has become the goal of many.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coach's actions are very appropriate, and I think
expected,'' says Paul Gaddini, commissioner of athletics for the
North Coast Section of the California Interscholastic Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But those expectations may be a bit optimistic. Even Richmond
Principal Haidee Foust-Whitmore admits Carter's timing is strange,
but backs his decision.
</P>
<P>
   All California students competing in CIF-sanctioned sports are
required to meet a minimum grade point average of 2.0, a C-average.
What observers find so unusual in the Richmond case is that all the
players on the team are above that bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was prompted by the progress reports that come
before grade cards,'' said Linda LaNere, area director of the West
Contra Costa Unified School District, of which Richmond is a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a clear message to the student-athletes before the
grade cards come out,'' said LaNere, who is in charge of athletic
administration. ``I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   LaNere, who said she is firmly behind Carter's decision, said,
``It's about time academics came before athletics. This may seem
drastic right now, but participation in sports is a privilege. The
priority certainly is in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Saunders, athletic director at George Washington High
School in the same district, said it's not uncommon for coaches to
set standards for their players that are higher than the
state-mandated minimums. But, she said she's never heard of a coach
taking steps as decisive as Carter's.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the players, they have to realize that they're part of a
team and they have to take responsibility for that,'' said
Saunders, who has coached volleyball, tennis and badminton for nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and administrators stress the importance of seeing
athletics as a co-curricular activity meant to complement the
classroom experience, not take precedence over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through sports, students learn hard work, discipline and
teamwork,'' said Leo LaRocca, athletic director at San Francisco's
St. Ignatius Prep, home of The Examiner's No. 1-ranked high school
team. ``They have to go together.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every administrator agrees with the Richmond coach's
decision. At Lowell High School, the city's elite public school,
there are no plans to raise the 2.0 standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get away with that,'' said Gloria Bogdanoff,
assistant principal for pupil personnel. ``We already ask our
students to do more than other schools. To change the rule on them
wouldn't be equitable; it would be double-jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaddini said CIF uses carrots, not just sticks like the minimum
gpa eligibility rule, to encourage students to concentrate on their
books. He said in the North Coast Section alone, an area that
includes areas north of the Bay to the Oregon line, CIF distributes
20,000 certificates a year to recognize students who either earned
a 3.0 GPA during the season, or were a part of a team with a
collective average of 3.0. He also said students can receive a
one-time probationary exemption from the 2.0 rule if local
officials deem that appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Often, it's participation in the sports themselves that
encourage better studying habits, administrators said. ``All across
the country, studies have shown that kids do better in school when
they're playing a sport,'' LaRocca said. ``They have to budget
their time, they have more responsibilities. The co-curriculars
really cross over into the classroom.''

INTERNET IS FOR US `DUMMIES,' TOO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For advance Sunday, Jan. 10) 
 
By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Refreshed after the holidays, I tore into the first parcel of
mail as if it were a leftover Christmas present.
</P>
<P>
   The book's title stared me squarely in the face: ``The Complete
Idiot's Travel Guide to Cruise Vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   I opened a second package. Another book: ``Travel Planning
Online for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, I was acquiring a complex. What's next? ``Column Writing
for Morons?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, both publications are volumes within popular series.
``Complete idiots'' also can learn about Walt Disney World, Hawaii,
Europe, New Orleans and other travel destinations. That series is
expected to include about 30 titles within two years. And the ``for
dummies'' books, which cover more than 20 topics, offer a useful
introduction to computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I did get a chuckle, though, when the back cover of ``Travel
Planning Online for Dummies'' referred to www.dummies.com for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these books aren't really aimed at ``dummies'' and
``idiots.'' A lot of smart people were _ or are _ slow to embrace
the online revolution (or at least that's what I keep telling
myself each time I become hopelessly tangled on the Web). The ``for
dummies'' series describes its target readership as ``frustrated
computer users who know they aren't really dumb but find that PC
hardware, software and indeed the entire vocabulary of computing
make them feel helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers can benefit greatly from a basic knowledge of
computers and online procedures for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internet is the fastest-growing source for information
about almost any aspect of a trip.
</P>
<P>
   _ E-mail is often the easiest and most economical form of
communication while away from home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bargains are available online that don't exist elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And none of us is too dumb to appreciate a bargain, right?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest travel-related trend I've witnessed in the
past year is the growing curiosity about online services by
individuals who previously were disinterested or _ let's be honest
_ intimidated by this new technology.
</P>
<P>
   I recall the first time I touched on Internet travel sites
during a luncheon gathering with a group of readers. Eyes glazed
over, an epidemic of coughing ensued, and I quickly changed the
subject _ not bothering to confide that I, too, barely understood
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I receive more correspondences and questions about online
travel than any other topic. Rarely does a day pass when someone
doesn't inquire about ``that site where you name your own price for
an airline ticket'' (www.priceline.com; read instructions carefully
before making any commitment).
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines are capitalizing on this increased thirst for
online knowledge as a lure. When I sailed aboard Celebrity's
Galaxy, passengers could learn on the ship's own Intranet. On the
Crystal Symphony, I joined about 150 fellow travelers who
``enrolled'' in the Computer University at Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal's program, inspired by a suggestion from a frequent
passenger, was inaugurated two years ago and is now almost as
popular as bingo and midnight buffets. Through a relationship with
Compaq, the Crystal Symphony and Crystal Harmony each offers more
than 20 computers for passenger use in a dedicated space.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers pay nothing (beyond the basic cruise fare) to take
hourlong classes that cover basics of computer usage and sending
e-mail. On my cruise, virtually every class was filled to capacity.
Depending on the itinerary, advanced classes are offered.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers also can open an e-mail account and send and receive
messages worldwide for $3. Some expand on their new knowledge after
a voyage and transmit e-mail to the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors are especially attracted to the Computer University at
Sea. ``We knew that a lot of people age 55-60 and older who cruise
with us thought at first that it (computer usage) wasn't relevant
to their lives,'' says Crystal president Joseph A. Watters. ``Then
they realized it wasn't going to go away. Now they want to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Separate computers are available for staff and crew aboard
Crystal ships. Each crew member is given an e-mail address. ``We've
got 32 nationalities represented, and they've all learned how to
send e-mail home,'' says Watters.
</P>
<P>
   For those on land, the new ``Travel Planning Online for
Dummies'' is the best resource I've seen for pointing the way to
valuable travel-related Internet sites and candidly evaluating
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Vadnai's 330-page book covers not only the standard airline and
hotel Web sites but others that focus on kosher restaurants, home
exchanges, North American road construction, ways to obtain
passports and visas and almost any other topic important to the
traveler. One chapter is devoted to ``chat rooms'' _ a good way to
share information with fellow travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Area bookstores stock or can order ``Travel Planning Online for
Dummies'' (IDG Books, $24.95), ``The Complete Idiot's Travel Guide
to Cruise Vacations'' (Alpha Books/Macmillian, $16.95) by Fran
Wenograd Golden and other books in each series.

FAST PACE OF CHANGE WON'T LET UP IN 1999 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In personal computing, change has been the only constant.
Everyone who's enjoyed setting up and running a shiny new PC knows
the feeling when the next generation of technology renders it
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   And the pace is not going to let up anytime soon. There are many
changes coming in 1999 that will affect both future PC buyers and
current owners in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them will make you glad you bought a PC recently. Others
will make you wish you'd waited. And others will make it easier to
afford your next machine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chips, chips and more chips. In late 1996 and early 1997, PC
sales slowed as buyers awaited a highly touted new version of the
Pentium chip from Intel. The processor included some instructions,
dubbed MMX, that purported to speed up multimedia applications.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's legendary marketing machine shot itself in the foot.
Although MMX was a big hit, the hype nuked sales of the non-MMX
Pentium processors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Intel is in a similar situation. In March, the company will
release a new version of the Pentium II chip, code-named Katmai,
that includes beefed-up MMX features. As with the original MMX,
software will be immediately available that takes advantage of the
Katmai code.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps a bigger draw is that the first Katmai chips will
run at speeds up to 500 megahertz. While not everyone understands
multimedia instruction sets, everyone does understand that faster
is better.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has been quiet about Katmai, so as not to deep-six current
sales. But savvy PC buyers who want the latest and greatest will
wait to buy until these new chips are available _ apparently in
affordable high-end PCs _ in March.
</P>
<P>
   _ And even more chips. &UR;  &LR; Intel also will be cutting prices on its
processors in a big way. The company will be pushing faster
versions of its low-cost Celeron chips _ new, faster ones were just
released _ and slashing prices on them.
</P>
<P>
   This is to compete with low-cost, high-powered processors aimed
at the consumer market from Advanced Micro Devices and National
Semiconductor/Cyrix. Some analysts are predicting a price war in
the chip arena, which is good news for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the introduction of the Katmai processors means
Intel will cut prices on its standard Pentium II chips. There will
be some incredible bargains.
</P>
<P>
   But tempering these plummeting prices will be the fact that
memory chip prices will bottom out, and possibly go up, as demand
matches and then exceeds supply. The same goes for portable PC and
flat-panel displays, as well as traditional monitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go faster. It's been a long time coming, but 1999 appears to
be the year when home users finally will have wide access to
Internet connections that are faster than pokey ol' phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Both cable TV modems and digital telephone lines are expected to
be deployed on a widespread basis, though not necessarily at prices
that everyone can afford. If you want big bandwidth, you'll have to
pay big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suite wars redux. &UR;  &LR; You may have thought the battle over
productivity software suites was over, with Microsoft's Office the
clear winner.
</P>
<P>
   However, expect the war to reignite this year with new entries
from both Microsoft and Corel, which owns the WordPerfect
franchise. Microsoft will introduce in the second quarter of the
year a major reworking of its suite called Office 2000. Corel's
entry, due also at the end of the second quarter, will be
WordPerfect Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's suite makes it easier to work collaboratively on a
document, with better tracking of versions and a simplified method
of turning all kinds of documents into Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews of beta copies indicate that Corel's WordPerfect
Suite also emphasizes collaboration, and that the applications in
the suite _ which have various origins _ are better integrated. It
also will come with voice recognition software as a standard
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Both suites try to save disk space with a feature that lets you
install components as you need them. For example, if you don't need
the equation editor in Word or WordPerfect, you can leave it out.
Then, if you suddenly need it and try to call it from a menu,
stand-alone PC users will be prompted to insert their installation
CD. On a network, a full installation can be placed on a server and
individual PCs can pull components via the network.

their install CDs to add features will hate it.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A mindless mind game
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's an item gleaned from the Internet, billed as a ``Jedi
mind trick.''
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit it didn't work for me. But maybe it will for
you, you being normal and average.
</P>
<P>
   These tips:
</P>
<P>
   In the first exercise, the secret number is not 6. That's what I
picked.
</P>
<P>
   In the second exercise, don't say asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   This little Jedi mind trick is kinda freaky, till you think
about it a little while. Then it's even more weird.
</P>
<P>
   Follow these instructions one at a time and as quickly as you
can. Do the math in your head as fast as you can. No peeking.
</P>
<P>
   It may help to say the answers aloud quietly.
</P>
<P>
   What is:
</P>
<P>
   2 plus 2?
</P>
<P>
   4 plus 4?
</P>
<P>
   8 plus 8?
</P>
<P>
   16 plus 16?
</P>
<P>
   Quick! Pick a number between 12 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   Got it?
</P>
<P>
   The number you picked was 7, right?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that weird???
</P>
<P>
   Free will or synaptic wiring? You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the following exercise, guaranteed to freak you out.
</P>
<P>
   There's no trick or surprise. Just follow these instructions,
and answer the questions one at a time and as quickly as you can!
</P>
<P>
   Again, as quickly as you can but don't advance until you've done
each of them ... really. Now, proceed but not too fast, you might
miss something...
</P>
<P>
   What is:
</P>
<P>
   1 plus 5
</P>
<P>
   2 plus 4
</P>
<P>
   3 plus 3
</P>
<P>
   4 plus 2
</P>
<P>
   5 plus 1
</P>
<P>
   Now repeat saying the number 6 to yourself as fast as you can
for 15 seconds. Then proceed.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK!!! THINK OF A VEGETABLE!
</P>
<P>
   You're thinking of a carrot, right?
</P>
<P>
   If not, you're among the 2 percent of the population whose minds
are warped enough to think of something else. Ninety-eight percent
of people will answer with carrot when given this exercise. Freaky,
huh?
</P>
<P>
   Here is another one.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T CHEAT BY READING AHEAD FIRST!
</P>
<P>
   It only takes 30 seconds. Work this out as you read. Don't read
the bottom until you've worked it out!
</P>
<P>
   1. First of all, pick the number of days a week that you would
like to eat out.
</P>
<P>
   2. Multiply this number by 2.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add 5.
</P>
<P>
   4. Multiply it by 50.
</P>
<P>
   5. Add 1748.
</P>
<P>
   6. Last step: Subtract the four digit year that you were born.
</P>
<P>
   You should now have a three digit number:
</P>
<P>
   The first digit of this was your original number (i.e., how many
times you want to go out each week).
</P>
<P>
   The second two digits are your age!!!
</P>
<P>
   P.S. I've since gone back and repeated the last exercise. Second
time around the math worked. But I still can't bring myself to
think of carrots.

FAULT LIES NOT WITH YOUR CARD BUT WITH FACTORY-INSTALLED SOUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I play a lot of games on my computer, a Dell Dimension. I had
great success installing a Voodoo 2 graphics card along with my
other card, and I was so happy about it that I went out and got a
Diamond Monster Sound MX300 card. Big mistake! Now I have no sound
at all! What's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. Your problem is not that you added a Monster Sound card _
they're pretty amazing, when they are working _ but that you failed
to turn off the existing sound capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   On a Dimension, the sound feature is built onto the main system
board, or the motherboard. That's why, when you put the new sound
card in, you didn't find another one to remove.
</P>
<P>
   The Dimension is not unusual. Many modern PCs have sound built
into the motherboard. But this makes it tricky if you don't know
how to turn off the existing sound feature when you upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you do it with your Dell:
</P>
<P>
   First, go into the Device Manager in Windows 95 or 98.
(Right-click on My Computer, choose Properties, then Device
Manager.) Find your sound card under ``Sound, video and game
controllers.'' Delete all the sound-related entries you find there
_ and there may be some that are not sound-related, so be careful.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shut down your system. Install the new card, and turn the
machine back on.
</P>
<P>
   As the system boots up, you'll see a message on the screen that
says ``Hit DEL to enter setup.'' Hit the Delete key _ there will be
a pause, and you'll soon see a menu screen. From here, find the
page that contains the sound settings, and turn onboard sound off.
Save the settings and exit setup.
</P>
<P>
   The system will reboot once more, and when Windows launches and
you get the desktop, you'll be prompted for any driver disks you
may have. After this, the sound should work.
</P>
<P>
   This process should work for most PCs that have onboard sound
that is controlled through the BIOS setup procedure. In some PCs,
you may have to adjust physical jumpers on the motherboard. Check
the manual for your PC or motherboard for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am thinking about adding a removable mass-storage drive to
my system. I've narrowed it down to either an LS-120 Superdisk or
an Iomega Zip drive. (I was thinking about a SyQuest Sparq drive,
until the company went away.) Can you talk about the pros and cons
of each type of drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Iomega's Zip drive, while it is not quite as omnipresent as
the traditional floppy drive, is the most common type of
big-megabyte removable device. That means you are going to be most
apt to find others who are also using it if you want to exchange
large data files.
</P>
<P>
   The Zip also is very speedy, at least in its internal EIDE and
SCSI configurations. If you choose the external parallel port
version, it's agonizingly slow.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Zip drive cannot read from or write to traditional,
1.44-megabyte floppy disks. The new, 250-megabyte version of the
Zip, which will be out shortly, will be able to read the original
100-megabyte Zip disks, however.
</P>
<P>
   The LS-120 disk can hold 120 megabytes of data, 20 percent more
than the original Zip. It also is compatible with traditional
floppies, and in fact an LS-120 drive can effectively replace your
floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the LS-120 is slow. Newer models are zippier than older
ones, but they still don't approach the speed of a Zip drive.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to go back and read a story about floppy
alternatives that ran in the Sept. 25 Houston Chronicle Technology
section: www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/09/25/main.html.

SKIING BRANCHES OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUZZ GRAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Once, when life was simple and the snow pure,
skiers were romantic daredevils. If they weren't rich and famous,
then they associated with those who were.
</P>
<P>
   It was all so clear cut. Mountains were created for the
privileged to enjoy. Chairlifts were built for the Jean-Claude
Killys to ride. St. Moritz arose with royalty in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us looked on with confused envy. Those days, even
with their $3 tickets and rope tows for the pathetic paupers, are
gone with the Twelfth of Never.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still skiing?,'' asked Brad Delano, a student at
Franklin and Marshall University and co-tenant of a high-speed,
detachable quad over the man-made, groomed terrain at Okemo in
Vermont. ``Man, aren't you bored?''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't look clever enough to intend the pun, even though a
snowboard dangled from one of his soft brown, furry boots with the
smart logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never go back (to skiing). It's too confining.'' Welcome
to the revolution. Going from top to bottom has become as
individualistic as one's goggles.
</P>
<P>
   The day isn't far off when skiers won't even be the majority. If
current trends continue, snowboarders will outnumber skiers on the
slopes within a decade. And that's not counting the freestylers
boogeying to rap on strobe-lighted half pipes at most major
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can really get whacked out on it,'' said Kavin Dupont
about the new park and pipe at Whiteface near Lake Placid.
``Carving turns on the trail doesn't do it for me. I gotta be
catching air and absorbing the good sound vibes.''
</P>
<P>
   Traversing trails is becoming less and less about skiing and
more and more about sliding. Almost every year, somebody comes up
with a new idea on how to get from the summit to base with more
grace. Check out skiboards. They're miniature snow-sliding tools
that feature elements of both traditional skis and snowboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a natural evolution of skiing, snowboarding and
skateboarding,'' said Albany's Jason Levinthal, founder of Line
Skiboards. ``There are no limits.'' One size fits all and they're
easy to adjust for boot sizes. And, unlike skiing, skiboarding can
be picked up in two days or less. They probably resemble inline
skating the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as yet another way to get people interested in
winter sports without feeling intimidated by snowboarding or
skiing,'' said Al Marino, alpine hardgoods manager at Salomon, a
major manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   What intimidation? Anyone who has been on the slopes recently
has learned to be surprised at nothing. The person next to you on
the lift or colored gondola with piped-in music is just as likely
to be wearing polyurathene wash tubs as telemark slats with a
five-day growth as moon boots and a walkman.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Michael Jordan hightops, too, because some downhill
plants are offering rubber routes to adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a huge success,'' said Cary Metivier of West
Mountain in Glens Falls about the new enlarged tubing park there.
``You don't need a lot of snow. And people don't have to buy a lot
of expensive equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Just show up. Pick your pleasure and pay your money. Think of
these mountains as winter amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gravity is free,'' said Nancy Oliver, a snowboarder at Jiminy
Peak in the Berkshires. ``I like to think of these places as
transportation centers. They get us to the top and we decide how
we're going to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Many alpine centers even rent snowshoes for those who like to
bushwhack their way through the routes less traveled. Picture a
bloak grunting his way back to sea level through the woods as some
dude with pierced eyebrows blows by on a board and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square comes to the wilderness. Anything goes, including
your sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the true skiers, those rakish originals who
spawned the entire industry half a cenutry ago? ``They'll always be
around,'' said Geoff Curtis of Volkl Sport America.
</P>
<P>
   The new shaped skis have made a powerful impact, representing
more than half of current sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been the most significant equipment development
since the introduction of the plastic ski boot,'' Curtis said.
``The reason is simple. They make skiing at any level easier and
more fun.'' Which is what the whole thing is about. Only now,
anything, including your imagination, goes.

`THE SOPRANOS' IS DEADLY FUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being a mobster is a tough job. No benefits, no pension, high
risk, a dwindling job market and those pesky Feds with telephoto
lenses. That's not to mention family problems.
</P>
<P>
   Or The Family problems.
</P>
<P>
   This is the world of Anthony ``Tony'' Soprano. The man has
issues _ wife issues, daughter issues, duck issues (too complicated
to explain) and the mother of all mother issues. Plus there are the
hassles that go with being the mob boss of North Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he suffers crushing anxiety attacks, takes Prozac and,
rest the soul of Al Capone, sees a shrink. When he is not cracking
skulls, he's cracking up.
</P>
<P>
   There are times you'll crack up, laughing that is, at the new
HBO series, ``The Sopranos'' (Sunday at 9 p.m.). Mix a little Woody
Allen in with a slab of Mario Puzo, and you get this funny/deadly
serious one-hour drama from creator David Chase (``I'll Fly
Away'').
</P>
<P>
   This season the networks went ethnic with the Irish (``To Have
and to Hold,'' ``Trinity,'' ``Costello,'' among others) to mostly
disappointing results. ``The Sopranos'' focuses on New Jersey
Italians, and despite centering on the mob does not settle for a
condescending collection of paesan cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, ``The Sopranos'' (no, there is no singing) joins
powerhouse ``Oz'' in giving HBO a dramatic one-two punch
over-the-air networks should envy.
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini (``A Civil Action'') plays the conflicted Tony
Soprano. A ``waste management consultant,'' he pangs for the good
old days of honor and values and omerta in the face of a new time
and breed that does not pay heed to traditions. Forget the foot
soldiers; that's goes for his kids, too.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano is a problem solver. He is the one everyone turns to,
whether it be his wife or his mother or every wise guy in Essex
County. He mostly tries to help _ who but a friend would burn a
buddy's restaurant down without asking? _ but in his complex world
things don't always work out.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally crumbling, he goes over the line to where no mobster
has gone before: to a psychiatrist. It's a lethal risk (bad guys
don't see head doctors; it's seen as a weakness by rivals), but it
is only in the office of Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, of
``GoodFellas'') that Soprano can let his guard down and his
feelings out.
</P>
<P>
   And he does. Cold-blooded yet sentimental, this is one
compartmentalized guy.
</P>
<P>
   And yet you root for him. He may be a Boss, but he is also a
caring father, son, and husband (despite his infidelities). He is a
lovable lug, except per chance he is bashing you with a lug wrench.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not cheering Tony on, you will be after you seeing
him deal with his mother from hell, played in terrifyingly
realistic fashion by Nancy Marchand (publisher Margaret Pynchon of
``Lou Grant''). Livia Soprano is a mean-spirited, bitter widow who
ladles out daily helpings of guilt with a backhoe. She is the
patron saint of high-maintenance moms.
</P>
<P>
   Other recognizable faces include Michael Imperioli
(``GoodFellas''), the nephew wanting to make his bones, and Edie
Falco (``Oz'') as Soprano's loyal yet defiant wife, Carmela. A
barely recognizable face is newcomer Stevie Van Zandt, who is
making his acting debut after years on stage as the guitarist in
Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.
</P>
<P>
   The show gets the North Jersey patter down (I should know; I
lived there two years), which is sort of a flatter Brooklyn accent.
And the names and places ring true as well, although in an early
episode a local college is referred to as Glassboro State, even
though it changed its name to Rowan University several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. It's not a mistake worth killing anybody over.

AS TRIAL BEGINS IN SENATE, PARTIES' INTERESTS FLIP-FLOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even to many criminal attorneys and law professors well-versed
in legal sleights-of-hand and expedient pretrial maneuvers, these
were an extraordinary pair of flip-flops:
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, who argued during the impeachment process
that it was not necessary to call witnesses to present a strong
case against President Clinton, now say it is essential. And the
White House, whose lawyers and allies thundered against the House's
lack of live testimony, now are maneuvering mightily to keep Monica
Lewinsky and company from taking the stand.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are plainly rooted in politics. Republicans knew
they could win in the House but think they need help now, while
Democrats want to avoid any surprises that might chip away at the
vote margin that could save the president in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the drama about to unfold in the Senate is a trial as well
as a political event. And legal scholars and trial attorneys warn
that the procedures created in a fusion of partisan and legal
motives could ultimately dictate the outcome for the president _
and help shape history's view of the fairness of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a criminal case or a civil case, so there are
no rules that directly apply,'' said Carol Chase, a former federal
prosecutor who teaches criminal law at Pepperdine University in
California. ``That means they're essentially creating a legal
structure as they go along . . . with obviously large implications
for the short and long terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Zalkind, a criminal defense attorney in Boston, and other
legal specialists said that any agreement to call witnesses _ as
House Republicans, acting as prosecutors, want to do _ would have
the most profound legal impact. That is because, for the first time
in this case, it would open both the president's defenders and
accusers to cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-examination throws uncertainty into a proceeding,'' said
Lawrence Walsh, the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra case.
``You can smear, you can make a witness look foolish, you can hurt
someone in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Most certainly, the presentation of witnesses will extend the
life of a proceeding that most Americans and many politicians in
both parties apparently don't want at all.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the questioning of people under oath offers the
opportunity for a surprise twist in a case that has a sustained
record of delivering the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have trials all the time in which there's a 99 percent
chance of one verdict, but you still go to trial,'' said Zalkind.
``Why? Because you know something might happen in the middle of the
trial that nobody could have foreseen,'' and that changes its
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   All those interviewed Thursday said that appears to be the
overriding hope of GOP members who favor calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists pointed out that all the material witnesses
already have been questioned and all the key evidence has been
accumulated by the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr. At the same
time, it seems clear that the Senate's 55-45 split among
Republicans and Democrats all but ensures that there won't be a
two-thirds vote for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   So politically, the House Republicans likely feel compelled to
proceed, at least partly, to underscore that their past efforts
were based on constitutional considerations. Legally, they
presumably want to call witnesses in the hope that something fresh
arises to change the political dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the House point of view, as things now stand, they're
going to lose . . . so they need to do something,'' said David
Stewart, who represented Walter Nixon when he was impeached and
removed from office as a federal judge in 1989. ``They don't want
to be dismissed as ill-mannered children who didn't know how to
behave on a major constitutional issue.''
</P>
<P>
   F. Dennis Saylor, who was chief of staff at the Justice
Department criminal division under President Bush, pointed to the
negotiations over calling witnesses as a stark example of how
different a Senate trial probably would be from any court
proceeding Americans have ever seen. The fact that the ground rules
are being created on an ongoing basis, he and others said, provides
a preview of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the Senate can do whatever the Senate chooses to do
at the time it wants to do it,'' said Saylor, now a defense
attorney in Boston. Noting that no other judicial venue exists in
which, for instance, the jury can overrule the judge, he added,
``They will want to look fair, but that's a subjective judgment and
it could be hard . . . since the Senate is going to write the
rules, conduct the trial, and deliver the verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all those interviewed agreed on one other potentially
privotal point: that Republicans would be taking a far bigger
gamble than Democrats in opting for a prolonged, witness-filled
trial. On this point, too, they said it was difficult to separate
the political reasons from the legal.
</P>
<P>
   With most Americans telling pollsters they oppose an impeachment
trial, the specialists said, the prospect of a voter backlash would
increase with every day that the trial continued. They added that
the lawyers for the president are seasoned trial attorneys, while
the House members questioning witnesses _ even any with courtroom
backgrounds _ are likely to be rusty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the lawyers and scholars said that if the Republicans
don't elicit a giant-killing surprise during witnesses' testimony
and just review widely known information, they risk appearing to
both constituents and historians as partisans willing to use the
Constitution for their own gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth . . . barring a major revelation, is that it really
can't get much worse for the president,'' said Martin Flaherty, a
professor of constitutional law at Fordham University. ``It can get
much, much worse for the Republicans.''

`NED DEVINE' IS WORTH THE PRICE OF A LOTTERY TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not to scare you off, but naked old men on motorcycles figure
prominently in ``Waking Ned Devine.'' So does a days-old corpse.
And dentures. And pig stench, which has nothing to do with the
corpse.
</P>
<P>
   But before you plunk down money for the cuddly ``Patch Adams,''
consider this: ``Waking Ned Devine'' is a puckish little pleasure,
a movie so adamantly (and, most of the time, successfully)
sweet-natured that you all but forget the twisted amorality at its
core. Even a climax of outrageous mean-spiritedness comes across as
a bit of Irish whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Kirk Jones, who made his mark with
British television commercials, ``Ned'' is reminiscent of Bill
Forysth's ``Local Hero,'' the flaky 1983 tale about a wee Scottish
town that bands against an American oil executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' is set in a wee Irish town, and the
stuffed-shirt visitor is a Dublin lottery official rather than an
arrogant Yank. But the idea's the same: a bunch of country-mice
locals put their noggins together to outwit a city-mouse outsider,
mining gentle chuckles along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens endearingly, with a mock-cosmic commentary on
lotteries and the ``lucky sods'' who win them. The camera then
turns on the twinkly Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen, later transformed
into one the naked bikers mentioned above), who clutches a lottery
ticket as numbered ping-pong balls swirl on the TV before him.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't win, but someone he knows apparently does _ the
winning ticket is tracked to the Irish village of Tullymore,
population 52.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie, his wife (a fiesty Fionnula Flanagan) and best friend
Michael (David Kelly, imperturbable and chicken-like) become
obsessed with finding the winner. They think they might wangle
their way into the good graces of a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Early suspects include a marmish shopkeeper and Finn, the
resident pig farmer (``I've brought you some expensive fruity
soaps,'' says Jackie to the odiferous young man), who spends a
minor subplot pining for the village beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they find the winner: Ned Devine, ``the sweetest
soul as ever was blessed,'' who is, unfortunately, dead. It seems
he died from the shock of winning; Jackie finds him, ticket in
hand, a smile spread wide on his rigor mortis face. Several comic
moments, some involving dentures, emerge from interaction with the
corpse.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't giving away much to say that Jackie and Michael resolve
to cash in the winning ticket, that Michael assumes Ned's identity
to fool the visiting ``Lotto Man'' (Brendan F. Dempsey, suitably
gummy), or that their ruse is fraught with delightfully funny
mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   As the Official Cute Irish Movie of the season, there's an
inevitable, aww-shucks adorability to it all, even when a cloud of
blackness _ they're stealing money from a dead guy _ threatens to
encroach on the light. ``Oh, Lord, this is gettin' awful serious,''
says Jackie, contemplating prison.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. There isn't much room for serious drama _ you
can't have that, and geriatric vehicular nudity and pigs and a
leading man (i.e., Bannen) who looks like Smokey the Bear with a
pint of Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   Even the romantic sub-plot entwining the smelly Finn (James
Nesbitt) and his dark-maned Maggie (Susan Lynch) is blissfully free
of glop; their big moments are discourses on personal hygiene
(``I've been usin' some fruity soaps, Maggie'').
</P>
<P>
   In a film about the giddy side of fraud, that's about as earnest
as it gets.

   `Cold War' Series on CNN
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, CNN will begin broadcasting the second half of
its 24-part documentary series ``Cold War.'' The first half has
already brought several angry critiques from historians and
commentators over how it interprets the Cold War and how it assigns
blame.
</P>
<P>
   The Times asked three historians with different perspectives to
assess the series:
</P>
<P>
   TV-COLDWAR-RADOSH (Undated) _ An appraisal of the CNN ``Cold
War'' series by Ronald Radosh, co-author of ``The Amerasia Spy
Case: Prelude to McCarthyism'' and ``The Rosenberg File,'' a Senior
Research Associate at the Center for Communitarian Policy Studies,
George Washington University. While he says that overall the series
does a good job of portraying the evils of the Soviet system
compared with the democratic Western allies, he argues that it too
often equates the Soviet Union's moral failings with those of the
United States. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   TV-COLDWAR-GARDNER (Undated) _ An appraisal of the CNN ``Cold
War'' series by Lloyd Gardner, who teaches history at Rutgers
University and is the author most recently of ``Pay Any Price:
Lyndon Johnson and the Wars for Vietnam'' (Ivan C. Dee, 1995). He
questions just how inevitable the Cold War was as well as the
series' European focus. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   TV-COLDWAR-GADDIS (Undated) _ An appraisal of the CNN ``Cold
War'' series by John Lewis Gaddis, who teaches history at Yale
University and is most recently the author of ``We Now Know:
Rethinking Cold War History'' (Oxford University Press, 1997). He
was a consultant to CNN on the three-year project and gives an
insider's account of putting together a documentary of this scope,
arguing that the series explores the era's moral ambiguities
without asserting any moral equivalency. (1000 words)

SUN   BELT SENATORS PLAY DANGEROUS GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those in the Northeast who are aghast at the rolling coup
unfolding in Washington, the prospect of President Clinton being
driven from power by a consortium of right-wing Sun Belt
Republicans is a nasty shock.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard for two decades the demographers' dirge, that
population, wealth, and influence were drifting south and west to
the sun. But after six years of unrelenting effort by the
Republican Party's right wing to overturn Clinton's election, the
Northeast is hunkering down in the White House bunker with Bill &AMP;
Hillary. Save for two GOP conservatives from New Hampshire, the
odd-state-out in the region, there appear to be no senators from
Maine to New Jersey who will cast their lot with the oust-Clinton
cabal. All it takes is 37 senators to say ``no,'' and Clinton
remains in office for his last two years.
</P>
<P>
   And while the 100 senators parade before the cameras in gravest
mien, vowing sober-sided examination of all the issues from all the
angles, it is difficult to imagine any Northeasterner not from New
Hampshire knuckling under to the Republican impeachment chorus
baying from south and west.
</P>
<P>
   At risk almost to the same degree as Clinton's imperiled
presidency is the future of the Republican Party in the Northeast,
where substantial gains in governorships in the past decade
(Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island) by
Republicans have not been matched in Senate elections. The GOP has
been a party of the Sun Belt since Nixon, whose choice as Supreme
Court head, William Rehnquist, presides over the Senate trial.
Nixon's infamous Southern strategy cracked the formerly Democratic
south in the 1968 election, driving most black votes to Democrats,
and most white voters into the GOP column for federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Until the little-known backbencher Dennis Hastert of Illinois
was elected speaker of the House Wednesday, nine out of 10 GOP
leaders in the two branches hailed from Southern or Western states,
where Clinton is unpopular, the religious right controls the party
machinery, and right-wing clergymen and talk-show hosts exercise
broad sway. The House right-wingers, who refused to call witnesses
themselves, now demand the Senate do what the House, for political
and tactical reasons, chose not to do.
</P>
<P>
   Only three congressmen from New England voted for impeachment,
Representatives Sununu and Bass from, you guessed it, New
Hampshire, and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut. For any or all, that
vote may be a career-ender.
</P>
<P>
   Now coming under the kind of fierce pressure that may guarantee
strong and well-financed challenges to their own political survival
are the four moderate Republican senators from New England.
Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine. Jim Jeffords of
Vermont and John Chafee of Rhode Island, are caught between a rock
(public opinion against impeachment) and a hard place (Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott). All but Collins are up next year.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Judd Gregg and Bob Smith of New Hampshire are for
impeachment. But it is very hard to see any New England Democrat,
or New York's Moynihan and Schumer, or New Jersey's Torricelli and
Lautenberg, voting to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's reputation as a weak and ineffective leader of what is
hilarously self-titled as ``the world's greatest deliberative
body'' seems to be justified. As of noon Thursday, Lott was unable
to locate the center of gravity needed to structure a deal to
censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wingers intimidated Lott. In an audacious display of
dictating terms to the once-lordly Senate, the anti-Clinton gang of
Sun Belt conservatives in the House has muscled Lott and his, to
put it too kindly, followers putting him on notice that nothing
short of a full-blown trial with lots of witnesses will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Never in this century has the once-proud Senate been horsed
around by such a collection of clucks and congressional claghorns.
Lott's unctuous protestations about proceeding with ``decency and
dignity'' do not mask his impotence. Lott was unable to muster the
gumption to face down his Sun Belt backers. By caving in to the
Clinton-killers, he sets those New England moderates up as targets.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire pair aside, not till you get to Pennsylvania,
and GOP Senators Arlen Spector and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania,
do you find Republicans ready to remove Clinton. Of 19 GOP senators
up for re-election next year, 13 are from states Clinton won.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will never be on the ballot again, but his ghost may
haunt these Northeast Republicans when next they face the voters.
Those who go under will have Trent (Thanksa) Lott to thank for
their demise. But he may not be majority leader two years from this
week. Given the GOP's poll ratings, the Republicans can lose the
Senate as well as the House next time around.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Belt senators are in the driver's seat, but they risk
taking the GOP's fragile 10-seat majority right over the cliff into
voter fury.

   BOSTON _ It's been 50 years since Mr. Wai Y. Tye arrived at
South Station, 50 years since he found himself in Boston with no
place to go, no one to see, nothing to do, 50 years since he
wandered up Huntington Avenue in search of a place to hang his hat
and came across the hulking structure that was and is the YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tye planned to stay in the small, spare room for a few days,
maybe a couple of weeks. Instead, he got comfortable. He got his
bearings. He got a well-paying job.
</P>
<P>
   And he stayed. He stayed for the Truman administration, then
Dwight Eisenhower's presidency. He stayed for the social upheaval
of the 1960s, which turned into the 1970s, and by then, why move,
so Mr. Tye stayed for the '80s, which led to the '90s. This marks
his 50th year at the Y.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an explanation, Mr. Tye, 82 years old now, flashes
that easy smile of his and says, ``It's convenient to town.''
</P>
<P>
   And for that, for his resistance to materialism, Mr. Tye is an
American anomaly. In a society obsessed with wealth and the
accoutrements that go with it, he continues to live in a drab
200-square-foot room with exposed pipes, a linoleum floor, a single
bed and a dim overhead light, even though he could afford so much
more. He has found a home in the most unlikely of places _ a YMCA,
which by its very nature, is meant for those passing through.
</P>
<P>
   But don't accuse Mr. Tye of being crazy. He is college educated,
a chemist by training. For 32 years, he worked for Raytheon, rising
steadily through the ranks. He played tennis with the company
president at exclusive clubs, then returned home to his room at the
Y. He packed an auditorium at his retirement gala in 1982, then
returned home to his room at the Y. He has traveled abroad, to
Paris, to Singapore, to Bali, then headed from Logan Airport to his
room at the Y.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, Mr. Tye doesn't need much. Sitting in his room on an
institutional-quality chair, wearing striped pants, a muted,
patterned shirt, a cardigan sweater and slippers, he is nothing if
not proud. His hair, still black, is carefully combed. His teeth
are unusually straight, his hands folded in his lap. His English is
just shy of perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're busy working and playing tennis, when you come
home, you don't have much time to take care of an apartment,'' he
says. ``There was no objection, so I just kept staying on.''
</P>
<P>
   So simple, but so complete, like his life. He pays $90 a week
for his unrenovated room. The bathrooms and showers are down the
hallway, the sinks so old they're stained by paint and time, and
all of that is just fine. The kitchen is the other way, though he
prefers to use an ancient Corning hot plate in his room. He has two
small closets, one more than he needs. His most prized possession
is an old Smith-Corona manual typewriter, which he uses each day to
compile notes from science journals.
</P>
<P>
   When you're 82, so much has inevitably come and so much has
gone, and Mr. Tye can be excused for harking back to the glory days
of the Y. It used to have an outing club in full force, with
canoeing trips to New Hampshire and hikes to Vermont. And it used
to have a drama club that sponsored plays and Mr. Tye would work
the stage lights. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Y's overnight rooms are used more by formerly
homeless men looking for a new start or by families trying to break
the bonds of state assistance. Mr. Tye, known and loved by the
staff, prefers to just close the door to his room and read the many
medical journals that come in the mail each month to keep abreast
of his field, then sit at his typewriter and catalog what he has
learned. He waits for science programs to appear on Channel 2, and
has an eager appetite for the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   He has traveled the world to make this tiny room his home. Born
in Boston of Malaysian and Chinese parents who had come to attend
MIT, his father drowned off the Cape when Mr. Tye was 2 years old,
and his mother took him back to Asia. He went to school in England,
grew tired of the postwar rationing and boarded a Dutch passenger
ship for the states in 1949. He chose Boston because it was what he
knew, even if he really didn't know it at all. He never married,
and he has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in the twilight of his life, he doesn't seem to regret
anything. He loved his work, he loved his tennis before arthritis
caused him to give it up, and he loves his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's perfect,'' he says with a smile, looking around his
room, from the stained walls to the scratched counter that is his
desk. And as his visitor leaves down the long, dank hall to the
elevator, Mr. Tye clicks his door quietly shut, returning to his
own good fortune.

MYTHS ABOUT `WHITE FLIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years it has become easy for many to demonize forced
school busing as a major catalyst of white flight from cities like
Boston. In the interest of balance, the following is presented from
the 1996 book ``Dismantling Desegregation'' by Gary Orfield and
Susan Eaton, director and former director of Harvard University's
Project on Desegregation:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a ubiquitous belief about `white flight' that
motivates school districts and courts to end desegregation. Local
leaders attribute a district's rising proportion of minority
students to an exodus of whites who left because of school
integration. School leaders and courts often believe that once
desegregation plans end, this white flight will cease and whites
may return in substantial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many dismantling cases, school districts hire experts to
offer court testimony in line with this white-flight theory. Courts
sometimes rely on this testimony. When trying to dismantle
desgregation, district officials argue that they have taken every
practical step to create desegregation, but that remedies have
failed because of white flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research refutes this theory. If white enrollment decline were
caused by busing, then cities with neighborhood schools would have
stable enrollments; but there are very big white enrollment losses
there. From the mid-1960s to the mid 1980s, for example, DeKalb
County (in suburban Atlanta) . . . lost white enrollment more
rapidly than all but three large US districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But DeKalb had neighborhood schools . . . the enrollment
shifted from 95 percent white in 1967 to 49 percent white by 1986.
In reality, DeKalb's white decline was caused by huge housing
changes resulting from massive black flight from Atlanta and a
steering of white home buyers into other parts of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black leaders in the city of Atlanta had accepted the proposal
of white business leaders to drop their busing case in 1973 in
exchange for administrative control of the school district, with
the expectation that neighborhood schools would help hold white
families. Contrary to expectations, there was a dramatic white
departure from the neighborhood schools and an exodus of
middle-class blacks to DeKalb, where resegregation continued to
spread under another neighborhood school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta eventually became more than nine-tenths black. When
compared with the other leading central cities, Atlanta experienced
the biggest increase in the proportion of black students, rising
from 41 percent in 1967 to 92 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago, with neighborhood schools and no history of mandatory
busing, fell from 41 percent white students in 1967 to 12 percent
by 1988. Houston also avoided busing and dropped from 53 percent
white in 1968 to 16 percent by 1988. Some of the central cities
with mandatory busing plans experienced less rapid transitions and
held larger white enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debates about plans should start by recognizing that the
nation's urban school districts, whether they have busing,
voluntary transfers, or neighborhood schools, have all had
declining white enrollments for decades. We are still building new
all-white suburbs and continuing to accommodate minority population
growth primarily by expanding residential segregation nearer the
metropolitan core. These housing trends, our changing birth rates,
immigration patterns, and other factors produce white enrollment
declines in cities no matter what happens in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Los Angeles dismantled its mandatory plan in 1981, its
white enrollment continued to decline. This occurred even during
the first year after dismantling _ the time one might expect whites
to return. The Los Angeles system has become overwhelmingly
nonwhite with neighborhood schools. In parts of the San Fernando
Valley, where antibusing fervor was intense, many of the white
neighborhoods that fought most fiercely for neighborhood schools
now have virtually all-minority schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the studies done for the court in Los Angeles showed
that . . . in the 1980-81 school year when busing ended, Los
Angeles had 24 percent whites; in 1990 it had 14 percent. In
contrast, St. Louis, which had a mandatory plan with suburban
transfer options, held a stable percentage of white enrollment
throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually no attention has been given to the fact that some
communities with mandatory city-suburban busing are actually
gaining white students.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the metropolitan Raleigh, N.C., district enrolled
about as many students as Washington, D.C., Cleveland or San
Francisco, but had a 38 percent gain in the number of white
students from 1976 to 1993 while the percentage of black students
fell from a 30 percent peak to 26 percent in 1993, thus indicating
white flight into this highly desegregated district in one of the
nation's most rapidly growing local economies.''

ONCE-CLOSED MURDER CASE STILL FESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SULPHUR, allLa. _ At first, there appeared to be a grim,
open-and-shut solution to the murders of Pam and Eric Ellender on
the eve of Mardi Gras 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the discovery of their bodies, lying in bed in
their home, Chris Prudhomme, an 18-year-old high school dropout,
was arrested in the victims' Toyota 4-Runner with three other young
drifters. Prudhomme quickly confessed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement videotaped by authorities, Prudhomme, wearing an
orange prison jumpsuit and stroking his wrists nervously, said: ``I
went and shot 'em. . . . I shot the guy. . . . He had a hole in his
head. . . . The lady, when she jumped, I shot her, too . . . in the
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the end of the month, authorities said they had found
Prudhomme unconscious, hanging from a noose in a jail shower stall.
A handwritten suicide note exonerated his accomplices in the stolen
vehicle. ``The main reason of my death is to hopefully insure that
they receive their freedom,'' Prudhomme wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The message closed with defiant words: ``I enjoyed very much in
the taking of those two individuals lives. . . . I don't need
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudhomme remained comatose for a week, then died. The sheriff
of Calcasieu Parish, Wayne McElveen, pronounced the case closed.
But nearly eight years later, the Ellender murder case continues to
bleed like an open wound.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are allegations that as many as a dozen people broke
into the Ellenders' home and were present when they were shot, that
a satanic cult held a party in the house after the slayings, that
the sheriff refused to pursue leads because law enforcement
officers and his own son were implicated, and that Prudhomme was
actually choked to death in jail in order to silence him.
</P>
<P>
   Huey Littleton, the father of Pam Ellender, is leading an
emotionally charged crusade to prosecute those responsible. Despite
the sheriff's contention that Prudhomme acted alone, Littleton
developed evidence that has led to several indictments and
convictions. One of Prudhomme's friends, Bobby Adkins, will be
tried some time this year on a second-degree murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton's quest grew out of a commitment he made at the
deathbed of his daughter and son-in-law. Before the coroner removed
the bodies, Littleton said, ``I held them both by a foot and
promised them, `I will find out who was responsible, and I will be
there for your daughter,' '' an 18-month-old child who was left
unharmed in her crib during the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton said he has spent $400,000 on his investigation,
tracking down witnesses across the country and filling seven filing
cabinets with documents and videotapes of testimony he has
elicited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a nightmare,'' said Littleton, a prominent Lake
Charles insurance investigator who worked with his late son-in-law.
``I used to see law enforcement as the glue that keeps a community
together. I really thought the sheriff did a wonderful job. Then,
as information came to me, I thought the sheriff overlooked some
tips. After a while, I decided he had botched the case. Now, I'm
convinced there was a coverup.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, McElveen fired back with three full-page advertisements
in local newspapers, rejecting Littleton's claims as the obsessions
of a grief-stricken father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff was going out of his way to help,'' said Lana
Brunet, public information officer for the sheriff's office. ``But
when Prudhomme hung himself, Littleton went off the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunet also contends that Littleton's case is based on the
testimony of people he paid off. ``We have records that they were
paid,'' Brunet said.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton said that the only money he gave to witnesses involved
expenses and that those payments were coordinated with state
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been a sensation in Sulphur and neighboring Lake
Charles ever since the night of the murders, which took place in a
comfortable, upper-middle-class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As events played out over the years in local newspapers and on
television, it has produced a high-powered feud and bitter
divisions among the population of Calcasieu Parish, which lies on
the edge of Cajun country near the Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton unsuccessfully ran against McElveen, the most powerful
figure in the parish, in a sheriff's election in 1995. Littleton
now is providing strong support for McElveen's prospective opponent
in the 1999 election.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Littleton, McElveen reopened the
investigation. But after Littleton lost faith in local authorities,
District Attorney Rick Bryant handed the case over to the state
attorney general's office in 1993, in an extraordinary move.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution is now being handled by Fred Duhy, an assistant
attorney general. ``I'm convinced more than one person was
involved,'' Duhy said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Bryant said he had tried, before
recusing himself from the case, to accommodate Littleton by calling
a list of witnesses supplied by Littleton and by giving him three
days to testify personally before a grand jury. The district
attorney said some of Littleton's witnesses were ``pieces of trash'
who had no credibility.
</P>
<P>
   One witness singled out as unreliable by proseuctors was Kurt
James ``Dragon'' Reese, a drifter with a long criminal record. In
videotaped testimony prepared for Littleton, Reese described a
discussion the morning after the murders by participants who were
anxious ``to keep people's names out of it.'' One of those to be
protected, Reese said, was Richard McElveen, ``because his father
was the sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese later pleaded guilty to a charge of accessory after the
fact and was released after a short stay in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people gave multiple statements, to Littleton, then to
the sheriff's office, to our office, and something different to the
grand jury,'' Bryant said. ``We never knew who was telling the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese was one of several witnesses turned up by Littleton, who,
as the head of his own insurance claims service, had years of
experience investigating arson and illegal insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   His first break, he said, came when he learned of a conversation
between a 14-year-old boy, Shawn Moody, and Adkins, who is facing
the second-degree murder trial. According to Littleton, Adkins told
Moody he suffered nightmares because he had been with Prudhomme at
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly thought we'd hit the jackpot,'' Littleton said.
But Moody's account was dismissed by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton said the sheriff's office also ignored another teenage
witness, Pearl Fruge. After a friend told her that Adkins was
involved in the crime, Fruge passed on the information at a
``Junior Deputies'' meeting the weekend following the murders.
``The sheriff's office said they lost the statement,'' Littleton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Allemond, a former investigator for the district attorney's
office who now works for Littleton, said of the sheriff's
operation: ``I knew that it didn't matter what we brought them;
they weren't going to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After he began his own investigation, Littleton wired Fruge to
record a 1993 conversation with her friend, Kim Manuel. In the tape
recording, Manuel said Prudhomme first shot Eric Ellender, then
Adkins ``did shoot Pam.'' Other witnesses placed Manuel in the
bedroom during the murders.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Littleton obtained the tape recording, a grand
jury indicted Manuel on two counts of first-degree murder. But the
sheriff's office conducted their own interrogation of Fruge and
told a judge that Fruge changed her story, saying that Littleton
set up the dialogue on the tape. Manuel was released without a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff threatened to take Pearl's baby away from her if
she didn't change her story and say I paid her,'' Littleton said.
``All along, the sheriff's office has been intimidating witnesses
and trying to get them to change their testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an account Littleton has pieced together, Prudhomme
led an expedition to the Ellenders' home after seeing ``Helter
Skelter,'' a movie concerning the Charles Manson murder spree. A
witness said Prudhomme became excited as he watched the film on TV,
chanting, ``Manson, Manson! He's our man! If he can't do it,
Prudhomme can!''
</P>
<P>
   Although Adkins was identified as the killer by at least one
witness, Littleton has videotapes of two other witnesses, Chip
Richard and Bobby Stoddard, who say they were in the room when
Prudhomme gave a sawed-off shotgun to another person, Phillip
Ledoux, who shot Eric Ellender.
</P>
<P>
   Ledoux was convicted in 1995 of two counts of being an accessory
after the fact to second-degree murder. An appellate court, which
upheld the decision, said in its opinion that ``evidence was
sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Adkins was
(also) a principal to the murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses have told of a party convened in the Ellenders'
house in the predawn hours before the bodies were discovered.
Littleton said he was told that a clique of ``devil worshippers''
was summoned, with one man performing a ritual ``to raise spirits
from the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton has compiled a list of 48 different people who were
said to have been in the house, including the sheriff's son, two
deputies, and a game warden.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Bryant, skeptical about the size of the crowd,
said the party ``should have been held in the Superdome.''
Moreover, he said, investigators found ``no physical evidence'' of
a party at the Ellenders.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Alderson, who gave a videotaped depositions to Littleton,
said she was taken to the party by a man with two badges. She later
identified her escort as Chad Manuel, a game warden. Littleton said
Manuel's sister is married to Steve Edwards, now under indictment
with his father, former Governor Edwin W. Edwards, on extortion
charges dealing with casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton said local authorities, bound by political
connections, repeatedly discounted evidence.

THE BLACK CROWES' TOUGH `SIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A snotty attitude has been a Black Crowes trademark since Day
One. You may take 'em or leave 'em, but you know that the Crowes
are going to speak their mind, crank up the decibels, and remind
people that gritty, dirty-sounding rock 'n' roll is the only way to
go. The Crowes are to the '90s what Rod Stewart's Faces were to the
'70s _ raggedly glorious, recklessly impetuous, and an absolute
must-see if you love the medium.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the Crowes are now a decade-old band, having
survived their share of mayhem, road-weary blues, and volatile
spats between Atlanta-bred brothers Chris and Rich Robinson, who
write the songs. Though their last two albums were on the
experimental side, their new one is a flat-out return to their
slashing, guitar-juiced beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a lot of bands that can do what we do,''
says singer Chris Robinson. ``That's part of our snotty attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By Your Side,'' the band's fifth record, comes out Tuesday,
followed by a tour. The tour will be another tour of survival for
the Crowes, who lost two members in the last two years because, as
Robinson says, ``They got lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The title `By Your Side' is a very sincere statement about
ourselves, about this kind of rock 'n' roll, and about our
audience,'' says Robinson. ``I'm proud of us for sticking through
this (expletive) music business. This trip does matter to us and I
know it matters to our audience. That's what is most important.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album, filled with whiplash slide guitar and
super-charged vocals reminiscent of the band's first album, ``Shake
Your Moneymaker,'' was produced by Kevin ``Caveman'' Shirley, who
produced Aerosmith's last album, ``Nine Lives.'' He was recommended
by Aerosmith's Joe Perry when Chris caught up to Perry, Steven
Tyler, and the rest of the band last year in Los Angeles. The
Crowes had once opened for Aerosmith, but hadn't seen them in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't seen Steven Tyler in nine years or something, but he
comes over to me, gives me a hug and says, `I'm so glad you shaved
your beard off. You look great!' And I said, `Gee, I didn't even
know you knew I had a beard.' Then I went to see them play in
Anaheim and Joe Perry says, `Hey, you've got to go to New York and
meet Kevin. His nickname is Caveman. He'd be perfect for you.' So I
said to myself that Joe Perry knows what he's talking about. I was
going to New York the next weekend for something else . . . but I
called to meet Kevin and we hit it off instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who describes the new Crowes album as ``my favorite
record right now,'' recalls telling Robinson: ``I don't know how
you'll get along personally, but he'll get your sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on Shirley, Perry says, ``He's called Caveman
because he looks like an Australian kickboxer, and he has hair way
past his shoulders. He's earthy in his approach. He can be sweet,
but he can also be one of the most bull-headed people that you'll
ever meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bull-headed is an apt description of the Robinson brothers, so
it was a heavyweight match all the way. Notes Chris: ``Kevin came
in and said, `I know who you are. I know what you can do. And we're
gonna have fun. Now turn the (expletive) amps up and let's kick it
out.' And that day we wrote `Go Faster' and `Kickin' My Heart
Around.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Those two songs open the new album with a high-flying blast.
That energy is maintained by the Faces-like title track, ``By Your
Side,'' the grinding ``Horsehead'' (hinting at the perils of hard
drugs), and the Stax-Volt groove of ``Only a Fool.'' The Crowes
haven't sounded this good since their early cover hit of Otis
Redding's ``Hard to Handle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For this album, I found myself listening to a lot of Otis's
music, and blues and country, and George Jones and Muddy Waters
again. I realized how direct and honest those records were _ and I
wanted that here,'' says Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   With Shirley, the Crowes actually recorded a lot of songs in the
afternoon _ a first for the nocturnal Crowes. ``I don't think I had
ever left the studio before until 7:30 a.m.,'' says Robinson. ``You
know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   The studio regimen was in marked contrast to the making of the
last album _ the inscrutable, self-produced ``Three Snakes and One
Charm'' in 1996. ``For `Three Snakes,' we buried ourselves in a
house in Georgia 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It was in the
dead of winter and there were way too many drugs and we had a
lawsuit on our hands,'' Robinson says, alluding to a suit brought
by a former road manager claiming he was owed money. It was later
thrown out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to contrast that album with the new one, Robinson says,
``This record is for a Saturday night. I think you could put it on
between (the Rolling Stones') `Exile on Main Street' and (AC/DC's)
`Back in Black,' or `Rocks' and those other great Aerosmith
records. You could put it on Saturday night when you have other
people around. Whereas, `Three Snakes' I wouldn't put on at a
party. It's definitely more of a Monday morning comedown record.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crowes haven't just been going through changes in the
studio. They've switched record labels from Def American to
Columbia. Since the last disc, they also bid farewell to two
members _ guitarist Marc Ford and bassist Johnny Holt.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson won't say that Ford had a drug problem (``You know me,
man, I can't judge people about drugs''), but reiterated that Ford
``got lost'' and his playing slipped. But he hears that Ford has
pulled himself back together and is starting a new band. As for
Holt, is now a yoga teacher, though Robinson hasn't seen or talked
to him recently.
</P>
<P>
   Their replacements are bassist (and Atlanta friend and former
housemate) Sven Pipien, an official member, and guitarist Audley
Freed, a touring player for now. ``It's great. These guys want to
be here _ and we feed off of that,'' says Robinson. ``And that will
become obvious when you see us on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crowes have also recovered from an awkward stint on the
post-Grateful Dead Furthur Festival two summers ago. The Crowes
didn't part on great terms with some of the ex-Dead members.
Referring to Bob Weir's band Ratdog, Robinson calls it ``Rat
Bait.'' Without Jerry Garcia along for the ride, he calls some of
the remaining Dead members ``a bunch of yokels.''
</P>
<P>
   Get Robinson revved up and he can fire some serious barbs in
many directions _ added proof that the snottiness is still there.
Regarding the Rolling Stones' $300 concert tickets, for instance,
he says, ``Why don't they just do corporate gigs for Pepsi or
Coke?''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's a hint of humility that can pop up suddenly.
``There's a big difference from where my head is at today at age 32
than it was at 22,'' says Robinson. ``We're happy to still be here.
You know, really, there aren't a lot of bands that get a chance to
make their fifth album in this day and age.''

MALICK DRAWS A DETACHED `THIN RED LINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE THIN RED LINE 
Written and directed by: Terrence Malick (based on James Jones'
novel) 
Starring: Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, Ben CXhaplin,
George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Elias Koteas, Nick
Nolte, John C. Reilly, Larry Romano, John Savage, John Travolta,
Arie Verveen 
Running time: 170 minutes 
Rated: R (realistic war violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has been made of the 20-year gap between Terrence Malick's
last film, ``Days of Heaven,'' and his long-gestating war epic,
``The Thin Red Line.'' Remarkably, though, it's as if Malick has
never been away. ``The Thin Red Line'' seems to take up where
``Days of Heaven'' left off. That film, which began in a Chicago
slum, then moved to a wheat field and stayed there, seemed mostly
to amount to a screenful of cinematography so gorgeous it became
idyllic as the characters became part of the scenery. ``The Thin
Red Line'' demonstrates that Malick hasn't lost his knack for
impressive visuals, although he still has trouble summoning
emotional or visceral immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not for lack of trying. The conception at work in ``The
Thin Red Line'' is grand enough. Malick, following the lead of
James Jones's novel, wants to inscribe an intimate epic, giving the
battle scenes their jolting due, but alternating them with what's
going on in the minds and hearts and memories of the soldiers.
Those thoughts are expressed in voice-overs, when the soldiers are
not killing or being killed by the dug-in Japanese troops they're
attacking on the island of Guadalcanal during World War II. Beyond
that, Malick wants to introduce an anthropological dimension,
starting with an Edenic prologue that shows the gentle Melanesian
way of life before the invaders' firepower shreds it.
</P>
<P>
   But where James's unruly novel stuck our noses into the
experience of war, Malick's film is more standoffish and
self-conscious. It's detached where Jones was down and dirty. What
saves it from declining into the first big-screen World War II art
movie is the quality of some of the performances. Sean Penn is
especially arresting as the tough but controlled first sergeant who
keeps himself and his troops alive by focusing on the task at hand
and maintaining discipline. ``In this world, a man ain't nothing by
himself,'' he says, ``and there ain't nothing but this world.''
He's talking to Jim Caviezel's hillbilly sharpshooter, a character
who can't quite support the job the film lays on him of serving as
Christ-like spiritual beacon from the moment he replies, ``I've
seen another world.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he drags Penn's character into cliche by turning
him into the other end of a sacred-vs.-profane equation. In
contrast with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which set a new standard for
invasion scenes with its D-day landing sequence, this film
deliberately begins quietly. The hell doesn't start breaking loose
until the rifle company has moved inland and happens upon a
Japanese bunker dug into a grassy hilltop. But as intense as the
sequence is, it, too, is beset by cliches, especially the one
involving a clash between a bitter, passed-over colonel (Nick
Nolte) who doubts his own manhood and tries to cover for it with
bluster and a sensitive but pragmatic captain (Elias Koteas) who
resists a frontal-attack order he sees as suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   The film gains a lot from the obvious commitment of the actors,
who throw themselves into their work and project something like
relief at being able to spend themselves on a project they believe
has stature and importance. There's more eloquence in one of Adrien
Brody's worried looks than in anything Malick's script gives him to
say, to give only one example of the way intention keeps outrunning
achievement here. It's not always apparent whose reverie we're
listening to in a given voice-over, although we quickly enough
identify Ben Chaplin as the private who stays sane with gossamer
memories of his pretty wife _ intended as contrast, one guesses,
with the way Nolte's neck veins seem ready to burst as he
apoplectically orders the troops to assault the hill no matter what
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   There certainly are things to admire about ``The Thin Red
Line,'' including Malick's ambition to transcend the usual war
movie by bravely making the combat share screen time with the
combatants' interior monologues. But their distribution among a
handful of insufficiently differentiated voices calls attention to
the film's lack of narrative coherence. While it may be argued that
the film's scattered flavor echoes the chaos and confusion of war,
it comes at a certain price in dramatic potency. So does Malick's
tendency to go overboard with close-ups of tropical birds or leaves
or fronds in the lush vegetation being shredded by the shells and
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Malick doesn't always sentimentalize nature,
although he does stay heavy-handed. When Penn's survivor says,
``War don't ennoble men, it turns them into dogs,'' sure enough, we
recall a vignette of wild dogs chewing on bullet-riddled corpses.
In short, Malick conceived a film that has lit a fire under a lot
of first-rate actors. But then he keeps getting in its way with
cliched exchanges, sophomoric philosophizing, and visuals that
appear an end in themselves, extraneous to the story. ``The Thin
Red Line'' seems, finally, to be a screenful of the ingredients of
a great film, rather than the great film into which they could have
been forged.

IN A VOLATILE YEAR, THE WB SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ For the surging WB network, these are the
best of times and potentially the most risky of times.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of ratings and sheer buzz, the WB is on an
indisputable roll. For the second year in a row, the WB ranks as
the top-rated network among teenagers, and can boast the most
talked-about (and satirized) new show, ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, during a season that has ranged from dismal to
catastrophic for the other networks, the WB has increased its
audience, largely on the strength of teen-oriented shows like
``Felicity,'' ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (which made it onto many
TV critics' list of the 10 best shows) and ``Dawson's Creek,''
along with two of the top-rated shows among African-American
viewers, ``The Steve Harvey Show'' and ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the momentum last? The programming whiz who helped
develop the WB into the force it has become, former entertainment
president Garth Ancier, is leaving the network soon and widely
expected to take his Midas touch to NBC. Can his replacement,
Susanne Daniels, fill his shoes? Teen viewers are notoriously
fickle; will they still want to slosh around in the soapy suds of
``Dawson's Creek'' at this time next year? And can the WB grow from
a larger viewer base as steadily as it did from a small one?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the answers to those questions Thursday were
yes, yes, and yes, from Jamie Kellner, the WB's founder and top
executive.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance before TV critics gathered here for their
annual midwinter meeting, Kellner wore the look of a man holding a
winning hand. The network he founded just four years ago is hot,
and he didn't mind calibrating its temperature as precisely and as
often as he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now attracting some of the brightest minds in the
creative community, who now want to work at this funky little
network,'' Kellner proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of that community's brightest minds, Ancier, is
moving on, apparently to try to work his magic at NBC, the onetime
front-runner whose fortunes have faltered this season. And WB
executives Thursday got a taste of the hotter spotlight now shining
on the network when critics, in an echo of the rap on ``Seinfeld''
and ``Friends,'' demanded to know why there are so few minority
characters in ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane,'' a new sitcom set in New
York City. Another wanted to know why so many WB shows are about
teenagers having, or at least talking about having, sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Kellner, who built the Fox network with the help of
hot-button shows like ``Married With Children'' before founding the
WB network, made clear that his network will not shy away from
controversy. Daniels, for her part, seemed to invite it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope for some boycotting,'' she said. ``It's good for a
network. We need more boycotting.'' Seated next to her, Kellner
chuckled and said approvingly, ``She's so feisty.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner made a point of championing his new entertainment
president, a Harvard graduate who formerly held the number two
position and has been called one of the most powerful women in
entertainment by The Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susanne Daniels in 10 years is going to be the most important
programmer in the business,'' he said. ``I have incredible
confidence in her.''
</P>
<P>
   If recent history is any guide, Daniels is going to need that
kind of support. It has been a volatile year for those who pick
prime-time lineups for a living. As NBC began to slump, longtime
entertainment president Warren Littlefield stepped aside. The next
to go was Fox entertainment president Peter Roth. The ground has
shifted so rapidly that ABC's Jamie Tarses, considered doomed just
two years ago, now holds seniority among network programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always hard to develop a hit show,'' said Daniels, who is
married to Greg Daniels, executive producer of Fox's ``King of the
Hill.'' ``It's about taking chances and investing in good
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier, who opted in September not to renew his WB contract
(though he will be an ``executive consultant'' till spring) is
leaving the network in good shape. The WB was up 13 percent in the
number of viewers from November 1997 to November 1998. By contrast,
NBC and CBS were each down 8 percent, ABC dropped 5 percent, Fox
dipped 4 percent, and the UPN network plummeted 39 percent. At the
beginning of 1998, the WB and UPN, the two upstart networks, were
still considered rivals; by year's end,the WB had beaten UPN in the
ratings 51 out of 52 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about pinning his hopes on teenagers,
Kellner pointed out that half of the WB's viewers are ages 18 to
49, meaning that many adults watch the teen-oriented shows on the
WB. But he insisted that the WB's identity as a young person's
network will not change, casting it as both a programming
philosophy and a business strategy in an era of fragmented
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to be a fragmented marketplace, make sure the
fragment you're hanging onto is the most valuable to advertisers,''
Kellner said. ``Our goal is to remain with a median age under 30.
That is a long-term set-in-stone goal for this network.''
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of teen lust, WB-style, Kellner maintained that
the network's shows are simply striving for realism, while being
``careful and responsible'' as well. (He noted that Dawson, of
``Dawson's Creek,'' has steadfastly remained a virgin). On the
question of diversity on ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane,'' creators and
stars of the show, which debuts Jan. 17, said that future episodes
will incorporate minority characters.
</P>
<P>
   The network overall cannot be fairly accused of overlooking
diversity. In addition to ``The Steve Harvey Show'' and ``The Jamie
Foxx Show,'' the programs rated first and second among
African-American viewers, the network has also aired other shows
aimed at black audiences such as ``The Wayans Bros.'' and ``The
Parent 'Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Felicity,'' which was hilariously lampooned recently in
a skit on Fox's ``Mad TV'' called ``Intensity,'' it is about to
acquire a lighter, less earnest tone, according to Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the WB has expanded its lineup and its number
of local affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   As for the WB's goals, Kellner said he wants the network to pull
in more male viewers and develop more family shows. One offbeat
family show the network showcased Thursday is ``Movie Stars,'' a
sitcom to premiere this spring about the home life of movie stars
played by Harry Hamlin of ``L.A. Law'' fame and Jennifer Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Grant knows a thing or two about movie-star households: She is
the daughter of Cary Grant and Dyan Cannon.

BEATING A PATH AWAY FROM THE FREEDOM TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Literary Trail, the first of several pre-millennial
``theme'' trails aimed at making Boston a more visitor-friendly
tourist destination, will open for business in the spring. The
trail is the brainchild of the Boston History Collaborative, a
year-old alliance of corporations (including Liberty Mutual,
BankBoston, the Don Law Co.), historians (Brandeis's David Hackett
Fischer, Northeastern's Richard Freeland), and city types (Pat
Moscaritolo, Tom O'Brien, et al.). ``The goal is to make Boston's
history more fun and fascinating while keeping to our
preservationist tradition,'' explains collaborative director Robert
Krim.
</P>
<P>
   The sense among the downtown types is that the 45-year-old
Freedom Trail _ even the ``new, improved'' Freedom Trail, and its
latter-day brand extensions, e.g., the Women's Heritage Trail _ is
getting old. So the collaborative is cooking up several new tours,
like the Maritime Trail, the Immigrant Trail, and the Innovation
Trail (did you know the microwave oven was invented here?) to suck
visitors into and around the city that Oliver Wendell Holmes
called, without apparent irony, ``the Hub of the solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Literary Trail sounds like plenty of fun. It will start out
near the Omni Parker House (Charles Dickens slept here), then swing
over to the Boston Athenaeum (many an Atlantic Monthly editor slept
here). Ticknor &AMP; Fields, a precursor of publisher Houghton Mifflin,
where executives still call Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ``our
author,'' was domiciled nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Trailees then board a trolley for Cambridge (World's Greatest
University, Longfellow, et al.) and on to Concord, to stare at the
Japanese tourists mobbing the Louisa May Alcott house. Emerson;
Thoreau; Hawthorne; the dotty, absurd Bronson Alcott; to say
nothing of mystery writer Kate Flora and bodybuilding scribe Miriam
Nelson. They're breathing literature out there in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   The tours will start up on Saturdays and Sundays in March. The
round trip from the Parker House will take about 4 1/2 hours, and
cost $19. More information is available at 617-574-5950, or at the
Web site that I am assured will be ready by early next week:
www.lit-trail.org.

   My new best friend, lawyer-at-large Harvey Silverglate, has been
pestering me: a) to promote his recently published book, and b) to
mention the untimely demise of one of his favorite Harvard Square
bookstores, McIntyre &AMP; Moore. Ix-nay on item a, Harvey. Maybe if
you had refrained from calling me a ``bigot'' a few weeks ago, your
request might have carried more weight. (Yes, I accept your
apology.) But I did wander down to used booksellers McIntyre &AMP;
Moore, lured in part by their press release, which said theirs was
``probably the first closing in Harvard Square that is not due to
increasing rent but because Harvard Square is getting boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-owners Dan Moore and Mike McIntyre both remember when the
square had five used bookstores, of the kind that tend to spring up
around major universities: Pangloss, Starr, Cambridge Scholarly
Books, the Bookcase, and Temple Bar Books, in addition to M&AMP;M.
Since 1983, all of them except Starr have closed down. As things
go, M&AMP;M is lucky. It was between leases with its landlord, WGU, and
found a larger, cheaper space up in Davis Square, which still
retains a modicum of the funk once associated with the Harvard
area.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who blame the Gap-ification of the square on the
WGU real-estate arm, Harvard Planning and Real Estate.
(Headquartered directly upstairs from M&AMP;M, by the way.) But Moore
and McIntyre said Harvard was an OK landlord. M&AMP;M got five-year
leases, with moderately beneath-market rates. Moore said Harvard
helped out Pangloss before it went out of business. After
considerable squawking from the likes of Seamus Heaney,
photographer Elsa Dorfman, and others, Harvard has cut several rent
breaks for the Grolier Poetry Book Shop, one of only two all-poetry
bookshops in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying that all the rents in the square are
rising, and, as McIntyre says, ``if someone pays a lot of rent they
can't afford to be interesting.''

WAYNE KRAMER: ROCK 'N ROLL SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As pedigrees go, you can't beat Wayne Kramer's:
Guitarist-songwriter with the incendiary proto-punk/metal band of
the late '60s/early '70s, the MC5. But, as Joey Ramone sang in
``Rock and Roll High School,'' ``I don't care about history/That's
not where I wanna be.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Kramer: ``The fact is: It's great to be recognized for the
work you've done and I'm proud to have been a member of the MC5. It
was one of the greatest rock bands of all time. But the legend
business don't pay all that well. It has not left me independently
wealthy. My favorite record is the one I'm gonna make.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer has seen a revitalization of his career during the '90s.
The nadir came in the late-'70s, when he spent more than two years
in prison for dealing cocaine, or, as he puts it, ``trying to make
a lot of money in the party-favors business, which I wasn't very
good at.'' The upside of jail?
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably saved my life. The road I was on, I probably
wouldn't have lived much longer. It plucked me out of a negative
situation. It was one of those wake-up calls, where I would wake
(in jail) and look out at the freeway, the same freeway we used to
travel during the MC5 days, in Detroit. And I remember then,
looking at the prison saying, `I've done stupid (stuff), but never
enough to be in there.' Yo, bro! Word to the brother. There was a
lot of self-examination. What led me to that point?''
</P>
<P>
   While jailed, Kramer was feted by the Clash (``Jail Guitar
Doors'') and the Patti Smith Group (``Free Wayne Kramer''), and
cited as a seminal influence by many a punk band. As he was leaving
prison, he got a boost from Elvis Costello's manager Jake Riviera,
who peddled a limited edition Kramer demo disc in England, netting
him $3,000 _ enough to start him on the road back. Since, then he's
recorded four albums _ the latest a live disc called ``LLAMF'' _
and he's not shy about drawing from his experience. ``Count Time''
is about that period on the inside. ``Junkie Romance'' refers to
his days with the notorious late junkie guitarist Johnny Thunders
in the band Gang War and the junkie myth. Sings Kramer: ``So you
wanna look like Johnny?/And you wanna act like Keith?/And you crave
some soft cocoon boy/For your Charlie Parker kind of grief.'' It's
a grim, gritty, powerful ballad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to deal with the dope scene/musician issue,'' Kramer
says, who's been drug-free for 11 years, ``but not to continue to
romanticize it, and the best way to do it was just hit it right on
the head. This is a myth in rock 'n' roll, that shooting dope makes
you sexy or a better guitar player. All it does it is make you
broke, annoy all your friends, get you kicked out of your
apartment, and make you sick. I'm trying to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Kramer is not a taciturn chap. In ``Bad Seed,'' he sings,
with sarcasm dripping, ``Zero tolerance?/Let the bastard bleed/No
big thing/'cause he's just a bad seed.'' In ``Something Broken in
the Promised Land,'' he crafts an anthemic rocker in the
Springsteen mode where ``the dream is sold out in the promised
land.'' Kramer likes to call the music he's making _ mostly hard
rock with speedy riffs, with an occasional foray into free jazz _
music for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideas I'm presenting are fundamental, humanist thoughts.
The things I care about are grown-up concerns. I don't appeal to
your average Korn fan or Beastie Boys fan because I'm an adult.
It's a lived life. I'm less ill at ease at 50, than I was in my
20s. I'm more relaxed being Wayne Kramer; I understand him much
better now.''
</P>
<P>
   More than most rock musicians, Kramer's music is lyric driven.
``I'm most interested in the literary value of the lyric _ telling
a good story, crafting a good lyric, something that sounds good and
hopefully has some meaning to it. I have to keep reminding myself
to work on the music end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's take on the biz: ``The industry promotes the mythology
of the rock star and the mythology of fame, success and wealth and
glamour. The reality of it is very few people get to share in that.
For most musicians, it's hard work. The entertainment industry
knows that and that's why they'll sign a band, spend a million on
them and if the record doesn't become a hit, they dump 'em and
couldn't care less. (For them) the music on the CDs is the
necessity of doing business _ all these bands and their stupid
ideas and songs!''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Plan 9, Take 50: Years ago, the gnarly Rhode Island band Plan 9
crashed the stage with four electric guitars a-blazing and one
organ a-pumping, jamming on long psychedelic/punk songs. They still
muck about in that world, but the stripped-down Plan 9 _ a quartet
with just one guitarist, singer Eric Stumpo _ is crafting hookier,
tighter songs with shades of country and jazz. All in evidence on
its latest CD, ``Pleasure Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolution from our roots of '60s psychedelic stuff,''
says Stumpo, who co-fronts the band with his wife,
signer-keyboardist Deb DeMarco. ``A lot of different styles started
to creep into what I was writing. I like to think of the music as
little more self-assured.'' Stumpo estimates Plan 9 as having about
50 lineups _ some guys have gone in and out up to five times.
Today's Plan 9 includes bassist Roger Vaughn and drummer Norman
Wrigley.
</P>
<P>
   Why so many Plan Niners? Is Stumpo a hard guy to work with?
``I'm easy to get along with,'' he says. ``But it can be just a
wrong project for someone. Basically, we've never been a real
commercial commodity. We get money to make records, we sell some,
we make a little money, we spent years on the road. Now, we just
play every so often _ I don't wanna ride around in a van. But,
beyond that, the independent scene is not very healthy. You're
being presented with major label stuff that's trash, played by kids
playing for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of success we've achieved is because we've done what
we wanted to do, and the level of failure is a result of same
thing. Let the chips fell where they may.'' As to the more sculpted
sound, he adds, ``I like to be abrasive sometimes, but I like to
run the whole gaumut in terms of emotion.''

<P>
   Anyone who ever doubted that Tupac Shakur was one of the best
artists of our time needs to sit down with his greatest hits album,
kick back, and listen.
</P>
<P>
   Notice there's no qualifier to the word artist. That's because
his artistry goes beyond the realm of rap. He was a poet, a quasi
urban sociologist _ even without a PhD.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was a self-proclaimed gangsta, the words ``Thug Life''
tattooed across his chest. And like many rappers who rose in the
early '90s, he spoke obsessively about violence and revenge. With
raw grit, he talked about keeping his finger on a trigger, but that
was his tough-man side talking.
</P>
<P>
   When Tupac opened up, he was deep _ revealing the thoughtful,
caring man who wanted desperately to change the violent world
squeezing the life of people around him.
</P>
<P>
   This two disc CD, simply titled ``Greatest Hits,'' contains his
most acclaimed work. On ``Life Goes On,'' he raps about the death
of friends, too many to count. He moans, ``Imagine life as a
convict. That's getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Dear Mama,'' a tribute to his mother, Afeni Shakur, he says
he realizes how much he hurt his mother, blaming her because his
father wasn't around. ``I finally realize it's not easy for a woman
to raise a man,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brenda's Got A Baby,'' one of his best songs, chronicles what
happens to a 12-year-old girl who is impregnated by an older man, a
``molester,'' the only person who shows her love. But as her belly
grows, he runs off and the baby is born _ on the cold bathroom
floor. Not sure what to do, she dumps the baby in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Though these are not everyday occurances in the ghetto, Tupac
wanted to say his peace, not letting newscasters on the 11 o'clock
news have the last word on these gruesome realities.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his lyrics, Tupac had a unique rap style, rolling his
vowels, emphasizing the last word in a rhyme scheme. His voice was
deep, thick like molasses.
</P>
<P>
   He was a striking figure, with imposing eyes that, in one
glance, gave away his fears, his saddness.
</P>
<P>
   Tupac died a young man, shot to death after a drive-by shooting
in September 1996. Police still haven't caught his killer. Some
people say the killer was aiming for Suge Knight, the owner of
Death Row Records, a man with reputed ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Others say it was revenge, because Tupac ranked on rappers like
the Notorious BIG, stoking flames in what people began calling the
East Coast-West Coast rap wars.
</P>
<P>
   Others swear he's still alive, that his death was a hoax
designed to sell billions of his records. The conspirists don't
want to let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   But with modern technology, even in his grave he can continute
to speak to us. Many of his recorded songs _ Afeni says she has
rights to more than 400 unreleased tracks _ will be remastered,
adding an updated sound to his poignant raps.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what kind of person Tupac would have become, but it
was clear that in the good-versus-eveil battle waging inside him,
good was winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes,'' one of the previously unreleased songs on the
album, asks drug dealers to walk away from that empty lifestyle.
Set to Bruce Hornsby's ``The Way It Is,'' he chastises a young man,
saysing, ``You gotta operate the easy way.`` The young voice
answers, ``I made a G (grand) today.'' Tupac retorts: ``But you
made it in a sleezy way, selling crack to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In another new song, ``Unconditional Love,'' Tupac asks: ``How
many caskets can we witness before we see it's hard to live this
life without God? So we must ask forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   This past June, when Shakur would have turned 27, Afeni Shakur
threw a two-day party for her son in Mayfield, Ga. If her son were
still alive, she told reporters, he would still be focusing
attention on inner-city issues that most people would rather not
think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tupac was a boat rocker,'' she said. ``And at 27, I think he
still would have been rocking the boat. I don't think there's any
reason for us to think otherwise.''

KURT MASUR HITS THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kurt Masur is bringing the New York Philharmonic to Boston for
its first appearance in 20 years with the BankBoston Celebrity
Series. Next Friday, the orchestra and its music director report to
Symphony Hall to perform Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and
Shostakovich's Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the New York Philharmonic has suffered from the
worst reputation of any of the major American orchestras. It must
have come as a relief to the players to read last month in The Wall
Street Journal that the Boston Symphony now holds that dubious
distinction. Speaking recently by phone from his office in New
York's Avery Fisher Hall, Masur was astounded to hear of this
evaluation. ``Who wrote that?'' he asked. ``And who paid him to
write something like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he leapt to the defense of his own orchestra _ and of the
Boston Symphony. Masur has won accolades for turning the
Philharmonic around since his appointment as music director in
1991. ``I must say at first that the New York Philharmonic can
fulfill any wish of a conductor. It is a brilliant orchestra;
everything is played very clear, very clean, and very polished. The
Philharmonic can enter into very different styles, always with
power, energy, and brilliance associated with American orchestras,
but in Beethoven they sound European and in Shostakovich they can
sound very much Russian. The orchestra is very flexible and it will
deliver the message of both symphonies to Boston. But, of course,
you yourself have a great orchestra, and the flexibility of the
Boston Symphony is on a very high level all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Masur spoke during a break between rehearsals for the
Philharmonic's New Year's Eve concert and preparations for the
orchestra's 10-day coast-to-coast tour. ``This is the orchestra's
first American tour since 1990, and the first since I became music
director. We are always playing in New York _ and so is every other
important orchestra in America _ but somehow it seemed we could
never play in the other important musical centers in this country
ourselves. So this idea came for the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The program reflects an idea that Masur came up with during his
26-year tenure as music director of the Gewandhausorchester in
Leipzig in the former East Germany. ``What we did was to play all
the Beethoven symphonies on programs with all the Shostakovich
symphonies, as a kind of confrontation. I met Shostakovich before
he died and discussed this with him, and he was very happy about
this idea. Both composers were very concerned with history, with
politics, with the happenings of their times. In the
confrontations, you can hear many similarities _ it is very
interesting to hear Beethoven's First Symphony and Shostakovich's
First Symphony together, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Masur feels there is a particular connection between the Fifth
symphonies of both composers. ``Both have the same kind of force
and fire; both symphonies mark a kind of breakthrough for the
composers. For Beethoven it was the idea of night giving way to
light, `Nacht zum Licht.' Shostakovich cannot end his symphony this
positively; there is desperation in his ending. Of course, he had
been criticized by Stalin; the symphony is a kind of document of
his kind of confidence in himself. Despite Stalin, he will write
only what he wants to write.''
</P>
<P>
   (Leonard Bernstein made the most famous recording of the
Shostakovich Fifth with the New York Philharmonic in 1959, after
returning from a celebrated tour to the former Soviet Union, where
Shostakovich embraced the conductor with tears running down his
cheeks. Following the triumph of the tour, Bernstein was in a
position to throw his weight around, so he did, insisting that the
recording of the Shostakovich be made by his New York orchestra in
Boston's Symphony Hall _ and it was. So next week, the Philharmonic
will be returning to the scene of one of its legendary recorded
achievements.)
</P>
<P>
   Masur, now 71, celebrated 50 years as a professional conductor
last year. He made his belated American debut in Cleveland in 1974;
before that, he had been confined to appearances in the former East
Germany and Soviet bloc. In the early '80s, he was one of the most
regular and highly regarded guests on the BSO podium. He felt
particularly attached to Symphony Hall because one of the models
for its architects and acousticians was the old Gewandhaus in
Leipzig, which was bombed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Since relinquishing his post with the Gewandhausorchester in
1996, Masur has continued to be active in Europe, conducting the
Berlin Philharmonic, the Bayerischer Rundfunk, the London
Philharmonic, and the Dresden Philharmonic, among other orchestras.
He has kept away from Leipzig. ``I've been avoiding that so that
Herbert Blomstedt can establish himself. They need time to forget
about Masur _ and then I can come back later.''
</P>
<P>
   Opera played a major role in the early part of Masur's career;
he spent four seasons as music director at Walter Felsenstein's
fabled Komische Oper in East Berlin, but few conductors of Masur's
stature have recorded less opera. ``My love for opera is still
there, but the calendar is very resistant, and after working with
Felsenstein, I am very sensitive about the stage director. I need
to find the right person with whom I could do something and the
right circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Masur's tenure in New York, like that of every music director
before him, has brought controversy, although not much of it has
been on an artistic level. Fortunately, he is an old hand at
musical politics. Not long ago, a lot of ink was spilled over the
question of whether he was being forced out of his position because
of his age. Questioned about this matter, Masur is polite. ``My
current contract runs through 2002. Things are going on
successfully now, and I don't think anyone wants to make important
changes. If the orchestra can find someone to become a successor,
we will talk about it. But, at the moment, there has been no
decision. For me, this time in New York has been very enjoyable.
Before, I was conducting all around America _ in Philadelphia and
San Francisco as well as Boston _ so I was ready for the
opportunity to build up a relationship and a repertory with a
single orchestra, and one that can play so perfectly, technically
speaking, as the New York Philharmonic does.''

USE FLAT PAINT ON PAPERED WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I plan to paint a wall that was painted over wallpaper that
is still in pretty good shape; that is, there is no paper peeling
or anything like that. What should I use to repaint?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PINZONE, Waltham, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Two coats of flat latex wall paint will do nicely, and no
priming is needed. You could use an eggshell finish instead, which
is neither flat norshiny, but I don't suggest it because even the
very low gloss of the eggshell will exaggerate small blemishes and
unevenness of the wall, while a flat paint will help disguise them.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to wipe down the walls with a dry cloth or wash with a
strong detergent and water before painting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have a plague of mildew in summer. Trim is covered with
it, and some is on the white painted shingles. I know to use Clorox
or a Clorox solution (with water) to remove the mildew, but
climbing up and down a tall ladder and moving it a hundred times is
not fun. Is there equipment around that shoots a spray of bleach
solution to the high levels?
</P>
<P>
   ANONYOUS WRITER, Hampton Roads, Va.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since you left no name or address, it behooves the handyman
to answer in the column.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are many spray attachments (for spraying fertilizer
and other materials in the garden), and adjustable, too, to fix the
ratio of bleach to water. Set it to make the solution one part
bleach and three parts water as the water from the hose gets the
bleach solution to high places on the house.
</P>
<P>
   You are facing a constant maintenance situation because there is
no sure way to keep mildew from re-forming, which it will do
because mold grows on any damp surface.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What causes mold to form under vinyl wallpaper that is
applied to Sheetrock? How can I correct the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER WRITER, Hunstsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Mold is growing under wallpaper because it was on the wall
before the paper was put up. To correct the problem, remove the
offending wallaper and all traces of paste and glue sizing left on
the wall. Wash with Spic and Span and water, TSP cleaner, or
ammonia and water until all traces of sizing and paste are gone.
Then treat the wall with a solution one part bleach and three parts
water. You could add bleach to the wash water, but don't mix bleach
and ammonia, nor add bleach to any other solution except water.
Wear skin and eye protection when working with bleach. Rinse the
bleach, because bleach will interfere with the glue sizing and
wallpaper paste that you must use when re-papering. If you plan to
paint instead, the bleach also must be rinsed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a new mattress and box spring, and kept the old
steel Harvard frame, but since the frame is 3 1/2 inches from the
floor, the extra thickness of spring and mattress made the bed too
high, and my bedspread is too short to fit properly. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   K.K., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Buy a bigger spread. You have spent a bundle on the new
bedding; another $60 to $100 (or so) for a spread is not
unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   What else you can do might be expensive. One is to cut two
inches or so from the steel legs of the frame, and make sure you
put a rubber cup or similar protection under those freshly-cut
steel legs. I don't think Harvard frames come with shorter legs.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is more costly, because you have to abandon the box
spring. Build, in its place, a thin backer board box of plywood and
1 x 3s or 1 x 4s or 2 x 4s. A good mattress on a wood backer may be
more comfortable than one on a box spring. The bed will be lower
and the spread will fit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have mentioned drilling holes in a double-glazed window
to eliminate the fogging. But how are the holes drilled in glass,
how big should they be, and where? Will the drilling of the holes
clear up the windows, or does something else need to be done?
</P>
<P>
   JUDY ATKINSON, Wrentham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. OK, how to drill: Black &AMP; Decker makes a bit specifically for
ceramic tile and glass; it would be best to use a bit designed for
the job, although a regular bit can work. The holes should be about
one-eighth inch, one in each bottom corner, about two inches away
rrom the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Drilling the holes allows air to circulate in the cavity, and
might clear up the glass, but it is possible that there will be no
clearing. In that case, stick a Water Pic in one of the holes and
spray the inside with water. This usually works. If nothing clears
up the glass, drill two more holes at each top corner.
</P>
<P>
   And a word of warning: If the window is a floor-to-ceiling
window, or a slider, or a French door, it is made of tempered
glass, required by law in situations where a window or door might
be walked into. Tampering with this glass will cause it to explode,
startling the worker, but probably not harming his body because the
pieces of glass are dull-edged and have very little cutting power.
</P>

house matters Thursdays, 1-2 p.m. To participate, point your

FIT FOR YOUR FEET
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color graphic, available by e-mail, on what to look for in
a running shoe. Call 212-499-3342. 
 By BEN STEELMAN 
 c.1999 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
 American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does every other shop in the mall these days sell athletic
shoes?
</P>
<P>
   And why do half those shoes cost almost as much as a compact
car?
</P>
<P>
   It may be impossible to say, yet it's easier to answer these
questions: Do you have to spend $150 on your feet? How much of that
cost is fashion, and how much is fitness?
</P>
<P>
   Quality does come at a price, experts advise. If you try to work
out seriously with a pair of cheap imports, you might regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of weekend athletes apparently agree. According to the
National Sports Goods Association, nearly $8 billion is spent each
year in the United States on athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you don't have to sell your soul to get the shoes you
need.
</P>
<P>
   For example, David K. Miller, co-author of ``Fitness: A Lifetime
Commitment'' (Allyn and Bacon, 1995), never pays more than $100 for
running shoes _ and he runs between 25 and 50 miles per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most expensive shoe is not always the best shoe,'' said
Miller. By watching for sales, he often finds the shoes he likes
for $50 to $60 per pair.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sprecher, head coach for cross-country and track at the
University of North Carolina at Wilmington, generally spends $40 to
$60 per pair on his athletes' shoes. ``It's the most important
piece of equipment an athlete can have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with expensive shoes, Sprecher added, is that owners
might be tempted to hold onto them too long. Like tires, shoes wear
down after time; the feet lose cushioning and support. Since a
runner's stride hits the surface with a power of 2 1/2 to 3 times
his or her body weight, those feet need a lot of cushioning.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, according to Dr. Michael D. Carter, a sports
medicine specialist in Wilmington, N.C., is that shoes still look
good long after they're effectively worn out.
</P>
<P>
   For those who exercise regularly, then, it's a good idea to buy
modestly priced shoes and replace them regularly, Sprecher said.
For his distance runners, a typical pair might last about 500
miles: ``After that, they'll start to feel a difference,'' he said
_ and that difference might be felt as aches or pains in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   If you work out in a particular sport for three or four hours or
more a week, you probably need athletic shoes, said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you need a pair designed specifically for your
event.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mistake, for instance, to use running shoes if you play a
lot of basketball or tennis.
</P>
<P>
   A runner's shoes are designed for continuous forward motion, not
the frequent side-to-side moves under a net or on the court.
Specifically, they're built with a slight incline in the sole;
dodge too fast after a ball, and you could twist an ankle, Carter
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most footwear chains have moved beyond the days
when ill-trained clerks would push you to buy the top of the line,
said Miller. At ``name-brand'' stores, at least, chances are the
staff will include at least one specialist knowledgeable enough to
help you find what you really need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't buy shoes in the morning,'' Carter said. Your feet
expand gradually during the day, especially after a run or workout,
so it's best to shop after work or after exercising.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect athletic shoes to ``break in.'' They should fit
well immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers these
suggestions for buying athletic shoes:
</P>
<P>
   When trying on a pair, wear the same type of sock you will wear
for that sport, not your dress socks or hose.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to wiggle all your toes freely. With running
shoes, there ought to be about a thumbnail's space between the big
toe and the toe of the shoe, according to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Walk or run a few steps in the new pair to make sure they're
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Always relace the shoes before trying them on, making sure you
have even pressure from the bottom to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the grip of your sole is firm. Your heel should not
slip as you walk or run.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor in shopping for a running shoe, Miller
and Sprecher agreed, is adequate support, particularly for the
mid-sole area.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will tout ``air'' soles or capsules or gel-based
cushioning, but whatever the material, what's important is whether
the cushioning works.
</P>
<P>
   Cushions generally come in two layers between the sole and foot.
The top cushion should normally be three times the thickness of the
bottom cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Canvas tops are generally not very supportive and may stretch.
Leather is strong but may not allow the feet to ``breathe''
adequately. Thus, the best top material is often nylon or a
nylon-leather combination.
</P>
<P>
   Training shoes will generally be heavier, with thicker soles and
higher heels, than shoes made for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Walking shoes should have a firm heel, good shock absorption, a
smooth tread, and a rocker sole that encourages the natural roll of
the foot.
</P>
<P>
   For longer walks on rough terrain, consider water-resistant
hiking boots. Good boots will have a firm heel, a flexible
forepart, heavily lugged soles for traction, padding around the
ankles and a high, wide toe box.
</P>
<P>
   Court sports _ tennis, basketball and volleyball _ require shoes
that are light and built to take heavy abuse. The key to these
shoes is in the sole, which should be designed specifically for the
sport you'll be playing. For example, serve-and-volley tennis
players may need extra cushioning on the balls of their feet, while
baseline players may need reinforcement on the heels and midfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hightops'' can provide extra support for the ankles but should
not restrict ankle motion.
</P>
<P>
   For court players, a coach or physician can offer advice on
which sole style will be best.
</P>
<P>
   Aerobic dancers need shoes that are a cross between the
shock-absorbent running shoe and the court shoe with lateral
support. Flexibility in the forepart is especially important.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance or marathon runners _ those who can cover 80 miles
or more in a typical week _ will likely require more specialized,
more reinforced and more expensive shoes than a typical jogger.
</P>
<P>
   Within these guidelines, Miller warned, each individual foot is
different. One runner's perfect fit might not work with another.
Consumers should pay particular attention to pronation, the natural
inward roll of the foot on each step, which can vary considerably
from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   Where one walks or runs might also affect decisions, Miller
added. The ideal surface would be a level dirt road or field, with
plenty of ``give.'' Paved sidewalks or roadways might require more
cushioning. A sandy beach, on the other hand, might have too much
``give,'' which could lead to a painful stretching of the Achilles'
tendons.

<P>
   We are 80 miles south of Fort Lauderdale, plodding through
mid-May heat down an abandoned road walled in by a green bramble of
hardwood hammock.
</P>
<P>
   Officially this is the Key Largo Hammock State Botanical Site,
but if you didn't know where to stop along Florida Interstate 905-A
you'd never find this spot. But just the day before in this very
thicket, local birders sighted a La Sagra's flycatcher, a pip of a
bird that's common in the Bahamas but extremely rare in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   We move in a hushed, collective clot, following Jan Pierson. An
affable New Englander with an easy manner, Pierson is a birder of
global experience, first on his own, then as a guide for Austin,
Texas-based Field Guides, the acclaimed bird touring company he
helped found in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson's hands are cupped around his ears and he is peering
into the dense foliage. One of us has a tape recording of the La
Sagra's call. He plays it at intervals, and Pierson listens
intently for the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is!'' Pierson's voice is low and fast. ``Down low.
Halfway up the tree. There! He's hopped to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierson sets up a tripod and scope and we each get our chance to
view the flycatcher, a swatch of brown feathers, nonchalantly
ruffling a white breast with a tiny beak.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the van, Pierson says there might be only one or two La
Sagra's sightings a year in South Florida, which is one to two more
sightings than any place else in North America. ``Could there be
others in there?' someone asks. Pierson eyes the wall of foliage
unreeling beside us at 50 mph. ``There could be 50 La Sagra's
flycatchers in there,'' he smiles. ``You just never know what bird
is going to show up where.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the fun of birding.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't know much about birders, often portrayed as
binocular-toting obsessives who wear funny hats and dash madly
about saying things like, ``What luck! A pair of mangrove
cuckoos!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, many birders do wear funny hats, but only because most of
them have been around long enough to realize the ramifications of
skin cancer. It's also true that many birders keep lists of the
birds they've seen, and some of them are ardent about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``World lists, North American lists, country lists, county
lists, backyard lists,'' said David Pomerantz, a straightforward
New Yorker who was part of our group. ``I read about a birder who
kept a list of birds who landed on his hat.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most birders lists are merely an excuse to get outside,
to travel, to share discoveries with like-minded people and simply
take a keen look at the world around them. Birders notice things
the rest of us don't. Back at the Key Largo site, Pemerantz had
pointed to the low branch of a tree and said to me, ``Look here.''
I saw nothing, then I looked harder and there it was: a tree snail
no bigger than my fingernail, its lovely ivory-white shell wound
with intricate yellow rings.
</P>
<P>
   We rumbled out of Key West harbor the following morning in
starry darkness. By burnt-orange dawn, everybody had scrambled up
to the top deck of the 63-foot Tiburon, our rolling home for the
next three days. Binoculars at the ready, they scanned the skyline.
The Dry Tortugas are 70 miles from Key West. We would be at sea for
nearly six hours. No one wanted to miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Tortugas are seven tiny islands, some barely poking above
high tide, that form a fragile circle of coral and sand in the vast
blue of the Gulf of Mexico. In the spring they are the first fleck
of land that northward migrating birds encounter after a long,
open-ocean haul.
</P>
<P>
   Some birds don't make it. Four hours out of Key West, Pierson
had the Tiburon's captain swing over to a tower marking a shoal.
Light green water languidly rose and fell from the tower's legs. A
dozen birds clustered on a guano-stained platform. Among the
seabirds -- brown boobies and frigatebirds -- was a lone cattle
egret waiting stoically to die.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon bobbed softly under the piercing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they put down, they don't usually get up,'' said Pierson
quietly. ``This is the last stop for that cattle egret. He's
migrating and he blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be plenty of dying birds on the Tortugas too,
bedraggled things perched beneath a ceiling of sky into which they
would never again lift off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some birders like birds because they give the idea of
freedom,'' observed one of our group, Everett Knapp, a Midwesterner
with 30 years of birding experience. ``Sort of an elusive idea,
though, because they're not really free.''
</P>
<P>
   A few nights before, a storm front had lashed rain across this
part of the gulf. The storm raised the possibility of a ``fallout''
of birds searching for cover on Garden Key, which lay between us
and the Tortugas. We arrived on the key in mid-afternoon and gave
the white sand beaches nary a glimpse but made a beeline for the
entrance to the ruined fort which dominates the island, crossing
its moat a dim archway to the open-air sward at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Here we found a birder's heaven: Birds were sheltering here in
droves, lighting up the crumbling brick walls like ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was pointing and sucking in their breath. Binoculars
swung this way and that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a redstart!'' said Pierson. ``Winters in the West
Indies. Look at that! That's a primo bird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a male scarlet tanager!'' exclaimed someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three male blackpoll warblers fresh from South
America,'' said Pierson. ``Look up! There comes a purple martin!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a cuckoo! Yellow-billed!'' said Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``A male Cape May warbler!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indigo bunting!''
</P>
<P>
   For over an hour everyone moved about the sward, training
binoculars and scopes into the trees in a sort of euphoric haze.
They peered resolutely into the sky, but no one seemed to notice
the massing black clouds. Thunder rolled. The palm fronds went
still. Gnats lighted on my knuckles. The air went cool, cooler,
cooler, then fat raindrops began to plock down and everyone
returned to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Tiburon, we gathered in the galley. Through the
windows sheets of rain ran in ribbons across the water toward ghost
sailboats. In the galley there was a drained hush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, birding is like gold mining,'' drawled John
Huckabee, a lifelong birder from Texas. ``You look, look, look ,
and then you hit something like this and it keeps you coming
back.''

BE A SUCCESS AND LEAVE AT 5
</HEADLINE>
  By BETTY HOLCOMB 
 c.1999 Working Mother 
 North American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a managing director at Merrill Lynch, Susan Scherbel knows
she has it good. She works full time, but no one clocks her hours;
in fact, no one even monitors where and when she gets her work
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my first child was born eight years ago, I've pretty
much worked out of my home, getting the job done as I needed to or
wanted to or could,'' she says. In that time, she's had two more
kids and been promoted. She now shows up in the office only when
it's absolutely essential.
</P>
<P>
   How did she cut such a good deal? With her background as an
attorney with a wide-ranging knowledge of both corporate taxes and
the tax aspects of employee benefit plans, she brings an expertise
to many deals that virtually no one else on Wall Street has. ``I'd
like to think that I'd have this arrangement no matter what, but I
wouldn't bet the mortgage on that. The truth is the more
indispensable you are, the more you can distinguish yourself, and
the more likely it is that you can gain some flexibility and still
move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   That's excellent advice, according to consultants and academics
who advise companies on flexible work arrangements. Though some
companies have begun to create new ways to work, most still measure
employees the old-fashioned way, by the clock. ``Many managers
still think if they can see your face, you're productive,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president at Catalyst, a New York City
think tank dedicated to advancing women in the workplace. ``That's
not true, of course. Just being there doesn't mean someone is
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kropf and other consultants have learned over the years,
it takes a big effort to move managers out of this old mind-set. So
what's a parent to do?
</P>
<P>
   As Scherbel's experience shows, even in the most demanding,
time-intensive careers, there are strategies for achieving success
when you work flexible hours or must leave promptly each day. We
surveyed readers and talked to the experts to come up with tactics
for not only surviving, but thriving if you work with
clock-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make yourself indispensable. As Scherbel found, companies will
go the extra mile for you if you have an important skill that no
one else has. Toni Thompson, an occupational therapist and mother
of two from Lutz, Fla., accomplishes the same thing in another way.
``I take on projects that no one else wants to do. I am developing
a reputation as the one you can count on,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many moms say that they volunteer for special
committees, especially those that mean working with other
departments. That initiative keeps you visible, buffering you from
the misconception that you're not pulling your weight because you
leave at 5 or work flextime. ``People look to you when new projects
come down the pike,'' says one mother who works in the marketing
department of a major corporation. ``Pretty soon, they see you as
someone they really need.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Showcase your productivity. Of course, it won't help to have a
talent or an expertise unless you make people aware of it. ``I
never really used to strut my stuff,'' says Thompson. ``Now I make
a point to talk up the committees I'm on and the projects I'm
doing.'' Not only that, but Thompson is also quick to praise her
co-workers' contributions as well. ``I highlight other people's
work, and that way, I show that I am contributing and also a team
player who appreciates other people's productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose the right priorities. Productivity only counts when
you're doing the right stuff, of course. Spending hours on tasks
that don't move the firm's main agenda forward is a waste of time.
If the company's goal is to create a top-of-the-line digital camera
or to make milk the most exciting drink in the grocery store, then
that should be your priority as well, in big ways and small.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't sure what your boss's priorities are, find out.
``It's critically important to sit down with your manager and have
clear objectives,'' says Joy Bunson, senior vice president of
organizational development at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York
City. ``Once you can focus on outcome, face time is less
important.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, having the right priorities means adapting to your
supervisor's habits and personality quirks. ``My boss is a morning
person,'' says one mom. So she does her best to make sure she's on
time in the morning. ``If I stay after 5 because I came in a bit
late, it doesn't matter to him. It's more important that I am here
on time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the focus on work. Make sure that everyone knows you're
committed to working hard during office hours. Many moms note that
they don't waste time socializing during office hours; many skip
lunch to make the most of their time. ``I let my co-workers know
that I do have deadlines,'' says Tanya Mahoney, a fund raiser for
the Dallas chapter of the American Red Cross. ``If there is a
project looming, I let them know that I am not to be bothered, that
my immediate project is the task of the day.'' With that kind of
clear-cut dedication to getting the job done, co-workers are less
likely to question your commitment or productivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speak up when you have a problem. If you have a conflict that
makes it impossible to arrive on time or forces you to leave a
little early, talk to your supervisor. Otherwise, you're likely to
be seen as someone who doesn't care about your work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have an open conversation with your boss,''
says Kropf. Frame the issue professionally, showing that your goal
is to be more productive. ``You might say, 'I know the standard
schedule is to be here at 8:30, not 9, but that isn't working for
me. I don't want you to think I'm late because I don't care. I want
to be a good performer, and I'm hoping that we can come up with a
mutually agreeable solution.'''
</P>
<P>
   You can then suggest options, such as skipping lunch or staying
a little later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of technology. If you leave at 5, that doesn't
mean you can't still be in touch with co-workers and your boss. Use
a cell phone, voicemail, e-mail, whatever it takes to stay on top
of business that must be done after you leave the office. ``I use
my cell phone to attend meetings after 5 p.m. or before 9 a.m.,''
says one mother. That way, her boss and co-workers don't think of
her as ``leaving early''; instead, they see that she makes every
effort to be a team player.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Scherbel is evidence that a change is already under way.
``When I first started working at home, I tried to keep the
arrangement quiet,'' she says. But now she's extremely comfortable
with it, especially since Merrill Lynch has touted the arrangement
in company newsletters and to the media. Her schedule is now
considered a model, a harbinger of the future. ``I hope that's
true,'' Scherbel says, ``because it seems to be a win-win for
everybody.''

HOW TO HELP A FORGETFUL CHILD 
 BY MARGERY D. ROSEN
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Matthew has always been a sunny, curious child, but in the
past few months he's been so forgetful that my husband and I are
worried,'' says Peggy Simon of Muncie, Ind., who is four months
pregnant with her third child.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy will ask 6-year-old Matthew, her oldest, to do the
simplest thing -- clear his dishes off the table or dump his dirty
socks in the hamper -- and he can't remember to do it. ``This
morning, I asked if he could please bring me the telephone book.
When I went looking for him 15 minutes later, I found him under the
hall table watching a ladybug crawl up the wallpaper. He'd
forgotten all about the phone book.''
</P>
<P>
   During his last school conference, Matt's teacher suggested that
Matt be tested for attention deficit disorder (ADD), since his mind
wanders in class and he rarely hands in a finished homework
assignment. ``Neither she nor I thinks he has ADD, but there are
lots of unanswered questions,'' Peggy continues. ``She'll give the
kids a math packet to complete, but Matt will bring home only the
first page. Or he'll leave his notebook in his cubby so he can't
copy the spelling words.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of his possessions is another problem. ``So far
he's lost two baseball caps, a new pair of soccer shin guards, and,
believe it or not, his backpack,'' Peggy reports. ``When we ask him
where something is, he has no clue that he's even lost the item! Or
he'll cry. I can tell he feels bad about disappointing us.''
</P>
<P>
   A few times Matt has even mumbled that he was stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy wouldn't be so frustrated if Matt's absent-mindedness were
an infrequent thing. ``But after a while, you lose your patience.
I've run out of ways to help him,'' she confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy's a believer in time-outs, but they have had no impact on
Matt's forgetfulness. Neither has the system of rewards she
instituted: ``We made a chart of the things he typically forgets to
do, and I offered a sticker for each task he did without a
reminder,'' she recalls. ``After a week he could trade in the
stickers for a toy. But it didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt's father, Mark, who manages a paint supply business, thinks
Peggy is too lenient. ``He's old enough to keep track of things,''
insists Mark. ``If we didn't let him get away with so much -- Peggy
runs out to buy whatever he loses -- he'd come around. Sometimes I
think he's purposely being defiant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peggy believes her husband is much too harsh. ``Mark's idea
of solving the problem is to yell and say, 'Shut up!' when Matt
tries to explain himself,'' she protests. As a result, Peggy is
increasingly worried. ``I can't help wondering if Matt's just not
as bright as we thought he was,'' she says. ``Isn't he old enough
to recall simple thing, the first time we ask him?''
</P>
<P>
   The Simons consulted Theresa A. Kruczek, an assistant professor
of counseling psychology at Ball State University in Muncie.
Kruczek's analysis:
</P>
<P>
   A child's forgetfulness, though exasperating, is a normal
behavior that peaks and ebbs throughout childhood. And most parents
react to their offspring's absent- mindedness like the Simons did.
They can't comprehend how a child who, for instance, understands
the computer so well can never remember anything they ask him to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that forgetfulness is usually a behavioral
problem. And that means it can be corrected. But first you have to
figure out what's triggering the absent-mindedness. The Simons'
family history revealed several factors that, taken together, were
contributing to Matthew's frustrating forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Peggy and Mark reported that the problem really
started only when their son entered first grade. I told them I
doubted that ADD was a factor, since children with ADD often
display signs of irritability, lack of concentration and a high
degree of distractibility from infancy. (Psychological tests had
also ruled out any other learning problems.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, first-graders are often forgetful. The curriculum
is more demanding and the school day is more structured than it is
in kindergarten. First-graders have to recall loads of information:
the names of their new teachers and friends, school routines, even
the location of the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew has a lot going on in his bead,'' I pointed out, ``and
it can be hard to keep it all straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgetfulness can be unwittingly exacerbated by high parental
expectations. Yes, kids at the age of 6 can do much more than they
used to. But they are, after all, still little. And although
parents want their children to take on increased responsibility,
many never take the time to teach them how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Matthew to draw a picture of his family, another
critical piece of the puzzle fell into place. Matthew drew a house
with his parents, his sister and the dog inside -- and he was
outside. When I asked him to tell me about his picture, he said he
felt like he was on the outside a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Mark were initially surprised when they learned this,
but they soon conceded that, with a new business getting off the
ground and a third child on the way, perhaps they weren't spending
as much time with Matthew as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, the Simons set aside 30 minutes each day for
one of them to spend alone with Matt, doing whatever he wanted.
Mark also acknowledged that raising his voice and insulting his son
weren't helpful, and he vowed to keep his temper in check.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew knew he was forgetful and was comfortable talking about
it. Together we discussed a plan: Since be was a computer nut, I
suggested that he type into the computer a list of Rules for
Remembering:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ask myself, What am I supposed to do right now?
</P>
<P>
   2. Figure out how to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pick a way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   4. Just do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when his mother makes a request or he starts to do his
chores, Matt recites the list like a mantra. This helps him to
concentrate so he's less likely to forget important things.
</P>
<P>
   I also enlisted Matt's teacher to help him stay focused. She
wrote down each day's homework assignment on an index card, which
he gave to his mother as soon as he got home. Peggy now knows
exactly what Matt has to do each night and can gently prompt him.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, homework had been a haphazard affair, so the next
step was to set aside a specific time for Matt to study. The Simons
chose 7 p.m. as the starting time. I suggested they allow Matt to
choose where he wanted to work and that either Peggy or Mark stay
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, not only did Matt seem much happier but his
track record for remembering had improved greatly. ``He is so much
more responsible now, we get less upset with the occasional memory
lapse,'' says Peggy. ``After all, he's only 6!''

SHOPPING: WHAT NOT TO BUY FOR BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  By JEFFREY GOLDBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sort of shopping psychosis overtakes the mind of a father
fresh from the delivery room. It might be rooted in some sort of
primal hunter-gatherer-type urge, the kind that afflicts most men
when they enter a Price Club (``Of course we need 24 gallons of
WD-40, honey. You never know when they're going to stop making
it'').
</P>
<P>
   Conquer this urge, and you may graduate the first month of
parenthood without fielding a call from an American Express
security officer worried about ``unusual activity'' on your card.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, a quick guide to what you need and what you don't.
This is, obviously, a subjective guide written by the kind of
flawed individual who actually considered buying an electric baby
wipe warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Diapers: Diaper bags are a good place to start, since they are
unnecessary: A $20 knapsack and a $2 dry-down--an absorbent,
washable pad--are perfectly sufficient substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Diapers are, however, necessary, and I would suggest as a first
step the purchase of Price Club diapers, which come in huge cartons
and cost about 25 percent less than the equivalent number of
Pampers.
</P>
<P>
   Warehouse club diapers aren't as handsome or sturdy-looking as
``premium'' or ``supreme'' diapers, but even standard diapers today
can absorb the contents of a camel's hump without leaking. Avoid
``premium'' diapers that contain emollients or aloe vera, which
don't transfer to the baby's skin. The only diaper worth paying a
premium price for is one that changes itself.
</P>
<P>
   An indispensable purchase is a Diaper Genie, a brilliant little
contraption that is a vast improvement over the open diaper pail. A
Diaper Genie (which generally sells for around $25) accepts dirty
diapers through a hole on top, and with a few twists of a canister,
seals the diapers in plastic and eliminates most of the smell. It
does not provide Level 4 biohazard containment--ignore the
optimistic ``odor-free'' claim made on the box--but it will do in
most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Car safety: On issues of child safety, I take the SDI position,
which is to say, there is no such thing as too much defense
spending. A maximalist position on safety means only one car seat
will do, the Britax. It is more expensive than the run-of-the-mill
Century line of car seats (a Britax runs above $200), but it is
made of material so hard it would crack your knee if you walked
into it, and its belting system is far more encompassing and
elaborate than the average car seat's.
</P>
<P>
   Home safety: Every baby superstore features a section that could
be called the Wall of Death. At Buy Buy Baby, the suburban
Washington store with which I'm most familiar, the Wall of Death
rises 16 feet into the air and stretches 10 feet wide, and every
inch of the wall is covered with child safety products, some of
which are absolutely useless and most of which I have bought. (I
haven't got around to installing the toilet lid locks yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, outlet guards and rubber padding for low furniture
(the ``Coffee Tables of Death,'' with which most parents are
familiar) are necessary, but the Wall of Death preys on parental
fear. Hence, a product called ``fireplace gas valve safety
covers,'' whose purpose was too obscure for me to understand, and
the VCR Lock, which, according to the packaging, ``prevents child
from inserting objects into cassette opening.'' Another way to
prevent a deadly epidemic of object insertions is to move the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the best way to keep a child from drowning in the
toilet is to keep an eye on the child or the toilet--excessive
reliance on safety products tends toward lower vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the baby monitors, arguably a necessity if you
live in a big house and can't hear the baby crying in her room--and
also a necessity if you're interested in intercepting police
transmissions--but is the Child View Monitor and Television, for
$149.99, really necessary? You can't even use it to spy on a nanny,
since it has no hidden camera capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Breast pumps: Ask someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Cribs: You can spend $500 (or $1,000) on a crib, or you can
spend $200. Spend $200. All cribs do the same thing, which is stand
there. All cribs sold in reputable stores meet current safety
standards, so no worries in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes: Payless ShoeSource, or the equivalent, is the way to go.
Actually, barefoot is the way to go, but in those places where a
small child should wear shoes--such as needle-strewn
playgrounds--it is a waste of money to spend more than $10.99 on a
pair of shoes. We bought Daughter No. 1 three pairs of $35 shoes,
which she outgrew in a month and wore so rarely in that month that,
amortized, the shoes cost $10 per wearing, money that could have
been better spent on fireplace gas valve safety covers.
</P>
<P>
   Toys: An endless subject, one that I'm hesitant to tackle, and
my children aren't old enough for me to comment on Furby with any
authority. One general observation, though: The wrapping paper is
always more interesting to a baby than whatever's inside, so my
gift suggestion would be a cardboard box wrapped in bright red
paper and filled with Tupperware and wooden spoons. That is, if you
can stand the noise produced by wooden spoons hitting Tupperware.

EVERYDAY ECONOMICS: GUILT BY ACQUISITION
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVEN E. LANDSBURG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the German car maker Daimler-Benz announced plans to
acquire a controlling share of Chrysler Corp., Jewish novelist
Cynthia Ozick announced in the Wall Street Journal that she would
never buy a Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jews (some of whom would never buy a Chrysler because
they'd only ever buy a Mercedes) saw the issue very differently.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, shortly after the merger was announced, the Jewish
Bulletin carried an article by Natalie Weinstein surveying the
range of opinion, particularly among Holocaust survivors. The
responses ran the predictable gamut. Some agreed with Ozick. But
others, such as Rabbi Ted Alexander, took their cues from
Deuteronomy, which admonishes that ``Fathers shall not be put to
death for children, neither shall children be put to death for
fathers.'' ``Going by that verse of the Torah,'' said the rabbi,
``I cannot blame this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's analogy treats the Daimler-Benz of 1998 as the
``child'' of the Daimler-Benz that employed slave laborers in 1943.
From a strictly legal perspective, the analogy is inaccurate: Under
the law, a corporation lives forever. The entity that controls
Chrysler is exactly the same entity that collaborated with the
Nazis, not a descendant.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to view an essentially moral question from
a strictly legal perspective. A corporation is not a moral entity;
it's the corporation's flesh and blood owners who are moral
entities. From that perspective, the rabbi's analogy fails in a
different way: The current owners of Daimler-Benz are not, by and
large, the children of previous owners from half a century ago.
Stocks trade hands every day.
</P>
<P>
   That observation seems to strengthen Alexander's position. If we
should not punish children for the sins of their fathers, then
surely we should not punish children for the sins of their fathers'
countrymen. But that analysis can be definitive only to those who
believe that nothing can be added to the words of Deuteronomy;
otherwise there's more to be said.
</P>
<P>
   When is it permissible to punish one person for the wrongs of
another? The question is a tangle of moral and economic issues.
Morally, we're concerned with things such as justice, fairness and
individual rights. Economically, we're concerned with creating good
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   To see how uncomfortable it can be when economic and moral
issues brush up against each other, consider the revision of
accident law that's been proposed by the economist-iconoclast-law
professor David Friedman. Friedman suggests that when two cars
collide causing a total of, say, $10,000 worth of damage, everyone
who was within a mile of the accident should be required to pay a
fine of $10,000. That way, anyone who sees an accident about to
happen will take all cost-justified measures to prevent it (perhaps
by honking furiously to warn of impending danger). To my knowledge,
Friedman's proposal has never struck anyone as fair, but at least
it gets the incentives right.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it? My own view is that the Friedman plan fails even by
its own strictly economic criteria, because it creates an incentive
for people to avoid high-accident areas and take inefficiently long
routes to wherever they're going--or to cancel their trips
entirely. In principle, it could even increase the accident rate by
scaring potential good Samaritans off the roads. Enforcement, of
course, would be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Those objections aside, Friedman's proposal does illustrate the
tension between economic and moral considerations. And Friedman's
innocent bystanders are at least partly analogous to Daimler-Benz's
innocent stockholders. Let's keep those lessons in the back of our
minds as we revisit the DaimlerChrysler controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations can be punished for misdeeds in at least two ways.
One is a consumer boycott and another is a (voluntary or
involuntary) fine. Both kinds of punishment have been visited on
Daimler-Benz (though arguably at levels that are small compared
with the underlying offenses). In the 1980s, the corporation paid
about $11 million to the descendants of its slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Who exactly suffers from those punishments? You might think the
$11 million came from the pockets of those who owned Daimler-Benz
stock in the 1980s, but that's not necessarily the case. Suppose,
for the sake of argument, that in 1950 it becomes foreseeable that
Daimler-Benz will eventually make reparations. Then every share of
Daimler-Benz stock sold between 1950 and 1980 sells at a discount
reflecting that expectation. Without the discount, nobody would buy
the stock. So given sufficient foresight, the prospect of a 1980
punishment hurts the 1950 owners, even if they sell in the interim.
And those who buy stocks after 1950 are not punished at all,
because the discount compensates them for the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, if all companies are permanently on notice that bad
behavior will eventually be punished, they have an incentive to
behave well at all times. That's an outcome that seems both fair
and economically efficient: The punishment falls on the sinners and
thereby deters the sin. But here are two caveats:
</P>
<P>
   First, even if punishment is inevitable, it falls not on the
owners at the time when the sin is committed, but on the owners at
the time when the sin is discovered. After all, it's not till the
discovery that the stock price falls. So punishing past corporate
sins is not like fining everyone who was present when an accident
occurred, but when it was reported, which seems both unfair and
pointless. But this caveat has a countercaveat: The prospect of
future punishments gives you an incentive to investigate the
corporation's history before you buy, which improves the chance
that bad behavior can be uncovered while the actual perpetrators
can still be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's hard to maintain a consumer boycott, especially
when the goal is to punish the past rather than to influence the
future. Consumers can quite reasonably argue that history can't be
changed and so is best forgotten. As a result, corporations have
little to fear from boycotts unless consumers commit themselves to
maintaining the boycotts even when they serve no purpose. It's hard
to imagine how such commitments might be maintained, which suggests
that fines are more effective than boycotts, especially if they are
written into law rather than imposed on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a firm conclusion to all this, you'll have
to look elsewhere; I hope I've at least illuminated some of the
attendant moral and economic issues--though even these can become
very different in situations that are superficially similar.
</P>
<P>
   And punishing evil corporations is very different from punishing
evil governments. In the first case, we punish stockholders who
invested voluntarily, while in the second we punish taxpayers who
might have bitterly opposed their government's policies. But that
is a topic for another column.

MONICA (THE NAME) SUFFERS A SAD DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among Monica Lewinsky's many accomplishments is that she's
achieved the type of fame where people know your last name as soon
as they've heard your first. Just as Oprah Winfrey is ``Oprah'' and
Elvis Presley is ``Elvis,'' Monica Lewinsky is ``Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica's notoriety coincides almost perfectly with the previous
calendar year. Nobody had ever heard of Monica before Jan. 15,
1998, but everybody had heard of Monica by Feb. 1, 1998, and felt
they had known Monica since birth by Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Monica is ideal for being judged by a most unforgiving
standard: How many Americans are naming their babies ``Monica''?
Sadly, not as many as last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a tally of popular names in the U.S. by Michael
Shackleford of the Social Security Administration, ``Monica''
ranked 97th among names given to baby girls in 1998, down from 83
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, however, that the name rallied late in the year:
Shackleford's 1998 calculations are based on samples taken between
January and September.

MONEYBOX: THE NBA SPLITS A CLOSE ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, they split the difference.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of the NBA lockout, that's pretty much what
happened 29 hours before the rest of the 1998-1999 (uh, make that
1999) season was to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   There were lots of interesting tidbits in the deal that was
eventually struck, tidbits that suggest how confused the politics
of this lockout were. For the first time in the history of sports,
there is now a maximum salary for athletes, depending on their
seniority. Players with more than 10 years can earn up to $14
million, players with between six and nine years can make up to $11
million, and players between one and five years, $9 million. (There
is a grandfather clause for current players, allowing them to
resign for up to 105 percent of their current salary.)
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's the owners who insisted on this pretty stunning
repudiation of the free market, but somehow I don't think we're now
going to see Fortune 500 CEOs agreeing to have their salaries
capped according to their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, teams' control over incoming players was
further strengthened. Draftees will now have their potential
salaries in their first four years in the league limited by where
they were drafted in the first round. In other words, the higher
you were drafted, the higher your salary will, and the higher your
potential salary increases will be, regardless of how well you
play.
</P>
<P>
   If this rule were applied to the NFL, Vikings wide receiver
Randy Moss, who was drafted 19th because teams were concerned about
his reputation but who has proved to be one of the league's best
players, would be paid less in future years than whomever was
drafted fifth, merely because 18 NFL teams were stupid enough not
to draft him when he came out of college.
</P>
<P>
   The point, of course, is that the new agreement in many ways
resembles a standard union contract, with its emphasis on seniority
and on the need for players to pay their dues before they're fully
rewarded. Yet where business has traditionally attacked seniority
as paying for experience rather than for merit, in this case the
owners have embraced the idea.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that they've done so. As I've argued before,
in the NBA the players are the means of production. So the owners
have to do everything they can to prevent the players from reaping
the real fruits of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, the players did get some tolerable, though
imperfect, concessions on the heart of the lockout, which was the
percentage of annual revenue that would be devoted to players'
salaries. In the first three years of the agreement, there will be
no limit on that percentage, and in the next three years the
players are guaranteed 55 percent. (They get 57 percent in the
seventh year, if the owners exercise their option for that year.)
The players had wanted more in those last three years, and deserved
more, but the owners had wanted to give them significantly less. So
55 percent is a victory, and not a pyrrhic one.
</P>
<P>
   I still think the lockout will be remembered as a lost
opportunity for labor, because the players never made their case
strongly enough or clearly enough. But the union did hold fairly
firm. Next time, perhaps, the difference won't have to be split.

TRACE'S STRONGARM STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The mangled sod separating the Bills from the Dolphins'
end zone was shrinking fast. So, too, were Miami's hopes of
surviving its wild and woolly AFC wild-card game against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years removed from his Hail Mary heave to Gerard Phelan
that lifted Boston College to a 47-45 victory over the University
of Miami, Bills quarterback Doug Flutie was in the process of
orchestrating another Miracle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 seconds remaining and his team trailing by a touchdown,
Flutie capitalized on an onside kick recovery and had the Bills
knocking on the door at the Miami 5. The Dolphin defense was left
panting while the crowd of 72,698 in Pro Player Stadium clutched
their crucifixes, dreading yet another Hail Flutie finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a horror movie,'' said Miami linebacker Robert
Jones. ``You're sitting there and your heart is pounding. Here they
are, they got the onside kick, and they're marching down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hands on hips and gasping for air, Trace Armstrong stood wearily
on the field and took stock of the situation. As he crouched into
his three-point stance, Miami's 33-year-old defensive end, whom his
younger teammates call ``Grandpa,'' kept telling himself that his
team needed someone to come up with a play.
</P>
<P>
   A big play. No, something bigger than that. A HUGE play.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong wasn't quite sure he was capable. He wasn't even sure
he could summon the strength to unfurl his aching body from its
stance, let alone the will to register the fumble-causing sack of
Flutie that cemented Miami's 24-17 victory last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But he did.
</P>
<P>
   As Flutie took a three-step drop, Armstrong came crashing around
the end, beating Thurman Thomas to penetrate the pocket. Flutie
stood there . . . looking for go-to guy Eric Moulds . . . then for
tight end Jay Riemersma . . . looking, looking . . . When he saw
that nobody was open, Flutie tried to get rid of the ball by
throwing it out of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But as he reared back, he didn't see Armstrong bearing down from
the blind side. A locomotive in teal and white and orange. He wore
No. 93.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just straining to get there and I was just saying,
`Hold it, hold it, hold it,' '' Armstrong said, soaked in sweat as
he stood before reporters in the Dolphins' locker room. ``I got the
hit on him and I saw the ball come out, but I wasn't sure how the
officials were going to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fumble. Shane Burton recovered for the Dolphins,
triggering a celebration that took place over the flattened Flutie,
who was laid out on the Pro Player sod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry (Wilson) and some of the guys dove on top of me and said
it was a fumble,'' said Armstrong, who as a reserve this season led
the Dolphins with 10 1/2 sacks. ``I was glad that it was, because I
didn't know if I could go another play.''
</P>
<P>
   He was spent. Physically exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident to Armstrong's euphoric teammates when
they mobbed him on the field. ``I tried to go up and hug him,''
said linebacker Zach Thomas. ``But I stopped when I saw he had a
hard time breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramps needed some air after causing Buffalo's fifth turnover of
the game. It propelled Miami to its first playoff victory in four
tries against the Bills and set the stage for a rematch with the
Denver Broncos in the AFC divisional playoffs Saturday at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we know a little something about them, having seen
them once this year,'' Armstrong said, referring to Miami's 31-21
victory over the Broncos in a Monday night game Dec. 21 at Pro
Player. ``But I don't think we'll see the same Denver team that we
saw down here. We're going to see the world champions with a week
off and two weeks to prepare for us, so we're going to see them at
their absolute best and we're going to have to be better than we
were the last time we saw them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of that the Dolphins are certain. The defensive line will have
to summon an extraordinary effort to make up not only for the loss
of end Jason Taylor, who fractured his clavicle in a 38-16 loss at
Atlanta Dec. 27, but also Pro Bowl tackle Tim Bowens, who suffered
a season-ending tear of his right biceps tendon against the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Miami's defense was able to overcome those setbacks to
survive Flutie's furious rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good that we did,'' said Armstrong, whose role is not
likely to change because of the injuries. ``I don't know how well
we played as a group, but ultimately, we had guys that stepped up
and made plays when we needed them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock Marion had a fumble recovery on the first play of the
game, then a goal-line interception late in the second quarter.
Terrell Buckley, who caused a fumble, also had a fumble recovery,
as did Thomas and Burton. But it was Armstrong's sack that ranked
as the game's biggest play.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he ever had a bigger play, Armstrong started to say,
``Yeah, I think so,'' then stopped and stammered, ``Well, as big? .
. . I mean, there were a lot of big plays today. Let's not make too
much of this. There were so many big plays. It was just a play.''
</P>
<P>
   But in coach Jimmy Johnson's estimation, it was more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trace has come up big for us all year long,'' Johnson said.
``He's a veteran. I think that says something. Trace has been
through the battles before. He realizes the importance of somebody,
somehow, some way making a play. It's not just another play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an important stand. One on which Trace Armstrong and the
Dolphins held their ground, even as it was shrinking beneath their
feet.

A CAMBRIDGE MAN GOES WEST

  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Billy Crudup and Woody
Harrelson in ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You could say British director Stephen Frears has a way with
women. He took an unknown American stage actress, Annette Bening,
and turned her into a tough little sex cookie in the sizzling movie
``The Grifters'' (1990), garnering her an Academy Award nomination
and the attention of Warren Beatty. Anjelica Huston in the same
film has never been better.
 &HT;    Before that he picked Michelle Pfeiffer out of her sex-symbol
straight jacket, handed her a ``real'' role as the victim of an
amorous count's seductive designs in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988)
and suddenly she wasn't just a pretty face.
 &HT;    And now in his first Western ``The Hi-Lo Country'' he's given
the treatment to not one but two actresses who have never looked
more gorgeous or been more real on screen.
 &HT;    Patricia Arquette plays Mona, wife to one man and object of
desire to two more: best friends and fellow roustabouts Pete Calder
(played by newcomer Billy Crudup) and Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson). Mona is trouble but so seductive that the men risk
their deep friendship and their lives to grab her for themselves.
 &HT;    Arquette is right up there in Frears' book with Bening, Huston
and Pfeiffer. ``She's working class, she's right, she's wonderful,
'' says Frears. ``I saw her in 'True Romance' (1993) and I think
she's quite extraordinary.''
 &HT;    The other actress given the Frears treatment is Spain's leading
star Penelope Cruz. She plays Josepha O' Neil, Pete's
long-suffering girlfriend. Under his direction, a great beauty
becomes an absolute life force.
 &HT;    But while the women in ``Hi-Lo Country'' are the instigators of
the action, this time Frears is telling a story about men--real
men--and the difficult land they are attempting to tame.
 &HT;    ``Woody plays John Wayne here,'' says Frears laughing, ``When I
told him that he said, 'But I'm more flawed than John Wayne.' So I
said, 'That's what this is all about. It's John Wayne with
flaws.'''
 &HT;    For Harrelson's bosom buddy, Frears selected Billy Crudup, seen
in ``Without Limits'' (1998) and still largely an unknown. Under
Frears' direction he comes across like a veteran.
 &HT;    For a Cambridge educated Englishman, making a film in a genre
American audiences know as well as they know their mothers, it was
essential he find actors who looked capable of wrangling horses and
cattle and whose faces reflected a life in the sun in an
unforgiving landscape.
 &HT;    ``When I grew up actors had lines in their faces,'' he explains.
``I looked for actors that looked lived in, who looked as though
they had some experience of life. Billy did. He didn't look like
all those young actors out of Los Angeles. What's on their face is
their life experience.''
 &HT;    As for Harrelson, with whom other directors have had their
run-ins, Frears says, ``He's absolutely wonderful. His Big Boy's a
big lug--crude and rude. He's playing a passionate man, a heroic
American who defends what he believes in. And here I'm talking
about both Woody the person and the character.''
 &HT;    The place is the Santa Fe desert heart of the American West. The
time is immediately following World War II and in the town of Hi-Lo
the two best friends are reunited after their sojourn at war. All
is well until Pete discovers that Mona, a woman he has loved, is
having a hot affair with Big Boy and his own passions are
reawakened.
 &HT;    But the real love affair in the movie is between Big Boy and
Pete. ``In a sense,'' says Frears, who directed ``My Beautiful
Launderette'' (1985) which dealt explicitly with homosexuality,
``when a man loves a man, it must by definition be homosexual. But
making it explicit here would have been to make a different film.
This isn't homosexual, but it's about a man loving a man and it's
from a time when those things weren't laughed at.''
 &HT;    An Englishman's taking on the Western genre is a risk, but risk
has been a part of Frears' career from the beginning. It was a risk
to allow himself to be seduced to come to the Hollywood big time
from England where he had made a slew of small risky films like
``Prick Up Your Ears'' (1987) and ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid''
(1987). It was a risk to go head to head with a director of the
caliber of Milos Foreman who was making ``Valmont'' on the same
subject as Frears' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' at exactly the same time.
 &HT;    Frears' version came out first and blew Forman's away.
 &HT;    ``I was just a bloke off the street,'' says Frears modestly, ``I
had nothing to lose. Christopher Hampton's script was wonderful and
I knew Milos could never have such a good script.''
 &HT;    When the conversation returns to his success with women he
points first to one of his failures: ``Mary Reilly'' (1996) with
Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    ``I think she was wonderful--very, very good in the film. I've
thought how stupid we were to be so undemanding of her. She would
have done anything for us. She would have gone to the moon if we
had asked. But it just didn't work and the problem was right back
there in the writing. We should have stopped it much earlier.''
 &HT;    And when it comes to discussing his triumphs, here too he is
reluctant to take any credit. When Bening's name comes up he beams,
``I'm very proud of her. It makes me laugh that I was there for
this great performance.''
 &HT;    As for Huston, he says, ``I wish I could take the credit for
bringing her out. She had for many years been in the shadow of Jack
(Nicholson). But she'd already won an Oscar for 'Prizzi's Honor'
(1985). The truth is you are just standing there at the moment. I
guess you create conditions, then they suddenly let rip and you
have it in the bottle.''

Kathleen Quinlan in ``A Civil Action.''

 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In early January, John Travolta climbed into one his four jets
and flew himself to Palm Springs, Calif., for the night. The star
of such diverse movies as ``Grease'' (1978) and ``Face Off'' (1997)
picked up the career achievement award at the Palm Springs
International Film Festival.
 &HT;    Next morning, he was back in the cockpit speeding home to his
actress-wife Kelly Preston and their son Jett.
 &HT;    Travolta is a real action man these days--on and off the screen,
flying high in jets and in the very top of the top reaches of
Hollywood.
 &HT;    This year Travolta has two chances to go home with the best
actor Oscar which has eluded him in two previous nominations. In
the past 12 months audiences have seen Travolta in what are
arguably his best roles ever: a Clintonesque presidential candidate
in Mike Nichols' savage political satire ``Primary Colors,'' and an
elegant shark of a civil lawyer in ``A Civil Action.''
 &HT;    Based on Jonathan Harr's dynamite best seller, ``Civil Action''
is the true story of a tenacious personal injury lawyer who battles
corporate America over the pollution of ground water in Woburn,
Mass., and its terrible effect on neighboring families.
 &HT;    Many insiders felt Travolta couldn't handle the role of Jan
Schlichtmann, an odious bad guy; not for the first time, Travolta
proved them wrong. He says he's proud of both the roles. (He can
also be seen in Terrence Malick's World War II film ``The Thin Red
Line''--a cameo he played as a favor to Malick whose latest film is
his first in 21 years.)
 &HT;    Meeting the Los Angeles press in a cashmere turtleneck, sports
coat and slacks, Travolta, 45, looked comfortable with himself. ``I
relished the opportunity to play a man who is cynical, arrogant,
detached and abrasive because these are not the roles usually
offered to me,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``I also like the fact that this movie doesn't preach--and that
it's a movie like 'Philadelphia' (Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning picture
about a lawyer dying of AIDS.) This was a movie about character
rather than issues. I saw Jan as a bit of a blackmailer who had
been corrupted by power so he's actually a villain at the beginning
and is transformed through the experience of working with these
families.''
 &HT;    Travolta got the part in ``Primary Colors,'' opposite Emma
Thompson, after Tom Hanks dropped out. Though the movie was not a
box office success, most critics agreed Travolta did an uncanny
job. ``I was very proud of 'Primary Colors,' he said. ``I think it
will hold up as one of the best political films ever made and
certainly the most informative about how politics really work.''
 &HT;    Although Travolta has been a frequent visitor to the White
House--on one famous occasion he danced with Princess Diana--he
claims he personally never got any feedback from the current
occupant of the Oval Office.
 &HT;    ``I did hear from Roger Clinton (the president's brother) that
the president really did like it and thought I had a heartfelt
feeling about the interpretation. And that was nice.''
 &HT;    So from the first family on down Travolta is the flavor of the
year. Even today, he said, he marvels at the twists and turns his
career has taken.
 &HT;    First there was ``Saturday Night Fever'' (1977) and then there
came a time--a long time--when he couldn't get arrested in
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I was afraid and confused in those days,'' he said, ``but I
wouldn't admit it. I tried to put on a brave face when really I was
having ulcers because of the pressure to make films that didn't
exploit my image.''
 &HT;    He started taking risks, pushing himself beyond the conventional
Travolta type roles and before long, after comeback films like
``Pulp Fiction'' (1994), ``Get Shorty'' (1995) and ``Broken Arrow''
(1996), he was pulling in the same kind of salary as Tom Cruise,
Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson. Today his price is $20 million a film.
 &HT;    He has magnificent homes in California, the East Coast and
Florida, and with his four jets and his love of flying, it's a
breeze to get from one to the other. He's also very proud of the
fact that in l998 he completed a training course that certifies him
to fly a Boeing 707.
 &HT;    And he keeps up a phenomenal work schedule. He's just finished
``The General's Daughter'' opposite Madeleine Stowe and this year
he will star opposite his actress wife in ``Shipping News,'' a
picture he calls ``a funny eccentric piece.''
 &HT;    The pair married in 1991. ``I think we have good chemistry on
film,'' he said.
 &HT;    Travolta's confidence in himself and the absolute inevitability
of his success comes, he is the first to tell you, from his
membership since 1975 in the controversial Church of Scientology.
 &HT;    In tribute to his religion, in l999 he also plans to star in the
science fiction film ``Battlefield Earth,'' written by the church's
founder, the late L. Ron Hubbard.
 &HT;    ``In the '70s it helped me avoid drugs and drinking--that's
where everybody in those days was leaning. Without them, '' he said
``I wouldn't have lived any longer than John Belushi. It gave me
the strength to survive all those years when no one wanted to work
with me, and it helped me overcome a lot of anguish in my personal
life.
 &HT;    ``I've always been so proud of what it's done for me and my
family. I learned the organizational skills that are the basis of
L. Ron Hubbard's beliefs. It's necessary to make sure that Kelly
and Jett and I can have an ordered proper happy life in a home
where both parents are out working almost nonstop.''

<P>
   Looking perhaps to recapture some of the magic of its
award-winning ``Da, da, da'' TV ad for Volkswagen of America Inc.,
Arnold Communications has just created a 60-second spot for VW's
redesigned Jetta.
</P>
<P>
   The latest installment of the ``Drivers wanted'' campaign, a
soft-sell ad dubbed ``Synchronicity'' features a nothing-happens
plot worthy of a ``Seinfeld'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly with no particular place to go, a couple slowly drives
a new Jetta down a rainy New Orleans street, taking in sidewalk
scenes as down-tempo music plays on the car's tapedeck.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers see a man sweeping the street; a kid dribbling a
basketball. Then a van crosses the Jetta's path, sending heavy
spray from a puddle onto the Jetta's windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The laidback Jetta driver turns to his female sidekick and says,
``That was interesting.'' As the Jetta drives away, a voiceover
says, ``Sometimes everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Most car ads feature sedans speeding down scenic highways. If
shining seas aren't in the background, then majestic mountains are.
When it comes to camera closeups, the car's racing lines get the
kind of star treatment normally reserved for Hollywood ingenues or
a burger chain's new whopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike many traditional car ads, this new campaign doesn't
brag about how fast or luxurious our cars are,'' said Liz Vanzura,
Volkswagen's director of marketing and advertising. ``Instead, it's
intended to show how the new Jetta fits into some people's
lifestyle and how some things in life just happen to come together
in perfect harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot breaks this weekend during the National Football League
playoffs. Plans call for ``Synchronicity'' to also air on such
shows as ``Ally McBeal,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' and ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   VW's fortunes have turned around sharply since the early 1990s,
when sales reached a low. The hiring of Arnold in 1995 was part of
that comeback story.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a sport utility vehicle in the lineup, Volkwagen's
US sales rose 59.3 percent in 1998 to 219,679. Thanks partly to the
reintroduced Beetle, 1998 was the best year for Volkswagen of
America since 1981. Now VW is debuting redesigned versions of its
workhorse models, the Jetta and the Golf.

`FIREWIRE' SPARKS EXCITEMENT AT MACWORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Perhaps the most impressive technology
demonstration at the MacWorld trade show involved a bright red box.
The paperback-sized box was a hard drive made by VST Technologies
Inc. of Acton, Mass. The small device could hold up to six
gigabytes of computer data _ or, in this case, a rock-music video.
</P>
<P>
   Apple chief executive Steve Jobs simply plugged a wire into the
red box and touched the keyboard of a Macintosh computer. The video
began to play in less than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The audience went wild, and with good reason. Connecting
external hard drives to Macs or PCs can be a frustrating task.
There are drivers to load, electrical connections to check, and of
course the computer must be shut down and restarted.
</P>
<P>
   Apple aims to change that with a computer interface called
FireWire, that allows instant connections between computers and
sophisticated external devices like disk drives and scanners.
Apple's new line of Power Mac G3 computers will come with built-in
FireWire support. And 20 companies, including VST, announced that
they will begin producing FireWire-compatible devices for use with
PCs as well as Macs.
</P>
<P>
   Apple invented FireWire in the early 1990s as a replacement for
the Small Computer System Interface, or SCSI, a method for
connecting external devices to Macintoshes. SCSI transmits data
much faster than the parallel and serial ports found on the typical
PC. But Apple wanted to develop a better system for connecting even
faster disk drives, as well as a new generation of digital
camcorders and still cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest SCSI connections now available can transmit up to 40
megabytes of data per second. FireWire ups the ante to 50 megabytes
per second. And future versions will be even faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where FireWire really stands out is in ease of use,'' said Jai
Chulani, Apple's FireWire technology manager. SCSI systems can
require fiddling with special termination plugs and switch
settings. With FireWire, the user just plugs in the device, and it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 63 FireWire devices can be ``daisy-chained'' together. So
why is hardly anyone using FireWire?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chicken-and-the-egg thing,'' said Chulani. Few
computer makers would include FireWire technology until there were
hard drives and other devices that used FireWire connections. But
the makers of external devices didn't want to make FireWire
products until FireWire computers began hitting the market.
</P>
<P>
   James Giarrusso, president of VST, says he got the word late
last year that Apple was moving to abandon SCSI and go for
FireWire. In November, the company began a crash program to create
a pocket-sized FireWire drive . ``We pulled this together in an
incredibly short length of time,'' said Giarrusso.
</P>
<P>
   Future versions of the VST FireWire drive will hold up to 24
gigabytes of data. A smaller version, about the size of a deck of
cards, will hold up to 14 gigabytes. Pricing and availability dates
haven't been set.

40-YEAR-OLD NEEDS HOTTER ACTION THAN BOND FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I read your column regularly looking for someone whose life
parallels mine, but have had no luck. Investing is very foreign to
me. I am a single 40-year-old woman. I have been a server in the
restaurant business for 20 years. My income of $20,000 to $30,000 a
year -- give or take -- relies mainly on tips and I will not have
much of a secure retirement plan down the road. I rent and I have
no outstanding bills. I bank most of my income weekly. I started
investing two years ago when I transferred my IRAs from the bank to
mutual funds. The investments presently consist of $10,300 in
Fidelity Equity Income II, $13,500 in Fidelity Growth and Income,
$16,000 in Vanguard Index 500, and $2,000 in Janus Worldwide. I
plan to add the maximum allowed each year to one or two of these
funds. From savings, I invested $23,000 in Vanguard Growth and
Income fund and $10,000 in Vanguard Specialized Health Care. I
still have about $60,000 in the bank. I plan on buying a new car
and paying about $25,000 cash, and I thought I would leave $10,000
in the bank for emergencies. I am thinking of investing the
remaining $25,000 in Vanguard Windsor II. Is that a good idea, or
should I be looking into balanced or bond funds? You suggested a
36-month dollar cost averaging program to another reader -- what is
that? Finally, should I transfer my IRAs to Roth IRA accounts?
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer to your first question -- Windsor II, balanced or
bond funds? -- is none of the above. At your tender age, bond funds
are simply too tame, and even the 35 percent or 40 percent of a
balanced fund that's on the fixed income side is likely, in the
long run, to prove a drag to long-term growth. Windsor II is an
excellent fund, but it's too much like your other funds. I tally
that nearly 84 percent of your fund portfolio is invested primarily
in domestic large-cap stocks -- only Janus Worldwide and Vangaurd
Health Care fall into different sectors. What I suggest is that you
venture into different territories -- increasing your international
exposure by building the Janus Worldwide position to about $10,000
and investing the additional $17.000 in the mid-cap and small-cap
stock sectors. Within the fund families you're now using, solid
examples might be Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock or Vanguard Mid-Cap Index,
and in the latter, Janus Venture and Vanguard Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar cost averaging is a strategy designed to protect
investors who are building a market position from a short-term
market decline. The discipline involves spreading an investment out
over a number of months; in the example, you cite, the investor
would make 36 equal monthly investments. If the market suffers a
sharp decline during that period, the investor can bring his or her
average purchase cost down through later investments made at lower
costs. (Of course, if the market goes nowhere but up, dollar cost
averaging mitigates your gains, just as it mitigates your losses in
the event of a decline.) Typically, an investor puts most of the
cash in a money market fund and directs the fund family to move
equal payments into the target funds each month.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if we presume average 5 percent returns from a
money fund, it would entail monthly investments of $747 to get a
$25,000 nest egg fully invested over the course of 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   (Frequently, minimum initial investments are a complicating
factor, requiring recalculation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you used Fidelity funds, you might start with a
$2,500 minimum investment in one fund on the first month, skip two
months entirely and then make a similar investment in the fourth.
After that, you would move $673 a month to the target funds.) As
for the question of transferring existing IRAs to Roth accounts, my
guess is that you'd be better off sticking with what you have.
Let's suppose that you leave your existing IRA accounts as is until
age 65. If we presume 10 percent average annual growth for 25
years, the pool would grow from the current $41,800 to $452,881.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing the income from such a tax-deferred portfolio in
retirement would not, in all likelihood, put you in an onerous tax
situation. But if you transferred the accounts to Roths now, it
would doubtless have a nasty effect on your current tax bill --
even moving you into a higher bracket if you moved most of the
money.
</P>
<P>
   But making future IRA investments in Roths is a different
question, Let's suppose that you're paying 15 percent of your total
income in taxes. If you chose a Roth IRA over a traditional
deductible IRA, you will bypass about $300 in tax savings on a
$2,000 IRA contribution. But in 25 years, presuming once again 10
percent average annual growth, the investment would be worth
$21,668, and the entire amount could be withdrawn anytime you like
with no tax liability. So I'd use a strategy of making ongoing IRA
contributions into Roth accounts, without changing the traditional
IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a column late last month you advised a person earning
$27,000 a year to start a traditional IRA for retirement savings.
Her current tax liability is only 15 percent or less. Why didn't
you suggest a Roth?
</P>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The person's situation was a bit similar to that of the
writer above -- except that at age 40 this person had just begun to
save for retirement. It seemed to me likely that if her savings
didn't go beyond the IRA maximums, the total amassed by the age of
retirement would not be sufficient to drive her into a higher tax
bracket -- in fact, with an orderly withdrawal schedule it would
likely be lower. So why not take the tax savings now?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I retired from my job as a Portland city employee on Jan. 1,
1998. Since I wanted to leave something for my daughter and
grandchildren I rolled half of my retirement money into an IRA. I
know nothing about stocks or mutual funds, but I tagged along with
a couple of other people who were doing this. The IRA money is
invested in a growth and income portfolio of State Street Research
funds and I get a monthly check of $1,950 from them, plus $2,000 a
month from the state on the other half of my pension. The
investments consist of $101,347 in State Street Research Investment
Trust Class A and $152,021 in State Street Research Managed Assets
Class A. How do you feel about these funds? I went into these
investment for the long run, but since March of last year I have
developed serious, and perhaps life-threatening, health problems.
My wife, who is my beneficiary, knows even less about this than I
do. What do you recommend for us? I feel good about the Investment
Trust fund, but Managed Assets has dragged a little. If something
should happen to me, should she stay with what I have, or go into
bonds or something else? Or should I get something else now?
</P>
<P>
   J.C., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your rollover IRA portfolio is a bit aggressive for a person
your age -- but only a bit.
</P>
<P>
   You should expect results from State Street Research's
Investment Trust fund to exceed those of the Managed Assets fund --
the former is entirely invested in large-cap stocks, while the
latter is a balanced fund, tempering a 59 percent stock position
with the remainder of the portfolio in bonds and other fixed-income
assets. Last year, the Investment Rust holding produced better than
29 percent returns, compared to a little more than 8 percent total
returns from Managed Assets. Your schedule of withdrawals
represents 9.2 percent of the fund portfolio, so the strategy
worked nicely for you last year.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you can afford to ride out the bumps, it's a strategy
that would probably work over the long haul, although it might
deliver some gut-wrenching bumps along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But since the yields of the two funds are fairly negligible --
0.6 percent for Investment Trust and 1.9 percent for Managed Assets
-- the strategy relies upon stock market gains to produce the bulk
of your income stream. As you should know, stock market gains are
far from assured. I would have been much happier had you reduced
the level of withdrawals by about half -- or increased the
fixed-income holdings, perhaps putting a significant part of the
portfolio in State Street Research's Government Income fund, and a
tad in its High Income fund as well.
</P>
<P>
   But before we can go into what to do now, since there's a
substantive change in your health, a different question poses
itself. Will your state pension continue to pay benefits for your
wife during her lifetime? If so, I would advise a fairly moderate
adjustment in the portfolio -- perhaps putting a total of 40
percent of the portfolio on the fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   You could achieve this a number of ways. You could simply
transfer $39,000 from the Investment Trust account to the two fixed
income funds -- perhaps putting $20,000 in the High-Income fund and
the balance in Government Income. Or you could reduce the portfolio
in Managed Assets to $82,000, moving the proceeds to a fixed-income
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Etcetera -- there are almost limitless variations, but the point
is to get about 40 percent of the portfolio on the fixed-income
side, and no more than 20 percent of that in the High- Income (and
therefore higher-risk) investment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the situation changes entirely if your state pension
payments end upon your death. In that event, you or your wife can
afford very very little risk, and you would be best off, in my
opinion, moving the entire rollover IRA to the fixed-income side.

IT'S WAIT AND SEE ON THE NBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol said he is not too worried
about the league repaying the networks for canceled telecasts but
is more concerned about recapturing the interest of casual fans in
the wake of the six-month lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be crazy for me to say that there wasn't damage
caused by the lockout,'' Ebersol told reporters Thursday. ``There
is no question in my mind that the real, longtime fans will be back
immediately. But we have a lot of work to do to bring back the
casual fans to our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said he has been encouraged by his talks with players'
union executive director Billy Hunter and Lakers star Shaquille
O'Neal about having more interaction between players and fans
throughout the shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   Though the schedule is not final, Ebersol said the first game is
expected to be aired on TNT Feb. 5, while NBC will broadcast a
doubleheader two days later. The regular season of 50 games would
end the first week of May, with the playoffs _ involving 16 teams,
as usual _ starting May 8.
</P>
<P>
   NBC signed a four-year, $1.75 billion deal last year with the
NBA and is expected to get its money back for the nine games,
including the All-Star Game, it had to cancel because of the
lockout. Turner paid the NBA $178 million a year for four seasons
and had to cancel about 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which owns the cable rights to 26 of the NBA's 29 teams,
lost about 500 games. Tracy Dolgin, chief operating officer for Fox
Liberty Networks, said he couldn't be happier that the league is
back. Fox Sports Net is built on a combination of regional and
national programming, and the NBA was one of its prized
possessions, expected not only to generate ratings in local markets
but also to promote its national shows, such as the new one hosted
by Keith Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lockout gave us a big void,'' Dolgin said. ``But we'll
have about five-eighths of the season. We don't have it as easy as
NBC, which can simply place a game into a certain time slot. We
will have to do a lot more scrambling and suffer a little more pain
in the short run. But in the long run, we'll have a healthier NBA
and a full season next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the assumption is that people still care about the
NBA. An ESPN poll of 91,265 respondents suggests otherwise.
Fifty-four percent said they were not interested, 27.5 percent said
they were mildly interested, 12.1 percent said they were excited,
and 6.3 percent said they were very interested.
</P>
<P>
   But Ebersol remains undaunted. With or without Michael Jordan.
NBC's NBA trademark was showcasing the Chicago Bulls. That could be
a risky bet this season. Jordan hasn't decided whether to retire,
Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman are unsigned, and the team has a
new coach right out of the college ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said that depending on how good the Bulls are, they
could still merit national appearances. If not, NBC would show them
only in regional markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we signed our deal that having Micahel was never
going to be a sure thing,'' Ebersol said. ``It's not something that
brigns a smile to my face. But when we first acquired the NBA
rights in 1989 for the 1990 season, everyone said then that it was
the end of the era of Magic (Johnson) and (Larry) Bird. And then
Michael appeared. Whether Michael emerges or not this season,
another great player or two will.''

   Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher joins the CBS pregame show
team for this weekend's NFL playoff games . . . CNN/SI's Fred
Hickman and Vince Cellini planned to shave their beards off during
``Sports Tonight'' on CNN Friday. The two have been growing them
since November and vowed to remain unshaven until the NBA returned
. . . USA Today reported that Sterling Sharpe may replace Dan
Dierdorf next year on ``Monday Night Football.''

IF THE SHOES FIT, THEN TREK ONWARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so cross-country skiing wasn't the biggest hit in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say why Europeans, especially Scandinavians and most
especially Finns, are so crazy for the sport, as common there as
bike riding is here.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, maybe they have more winter to work with, but just north
of here, there's not much climate difference.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-country skiing _ called at different times ``Nordic'' and
``ski touring'' _ once was much more popular in this country than
it is now. At the height of the fitness boom in the '80s, in fact,
cross-country skiing was twice as popular as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   According to the annual study done by the National Sporting
Goods Association, some 5.1 million Americans participated in
cross-country skiing in 1990, and by last year, that figure had
dropped to 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost 20 years since America's only recognizable
cross-country ski racer, Bill Koch, was on the scene, racing in
Olympics and winning the World Cup title one year.
</P>
<P>
   That may have something to do with it, but it's doubtful that
there's much connection between star performers and recreational
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the news has to be better somewhere, and if cross-country
skiing is just a bit too heavy on technique for you and a bit too
crunchy and hard to break into, consider big feet _ the return of
the snowshoe.
</P>
<P>
   When cross-country was in its prime in the United States,
snowshoeing wasn't even considered a sport unto itself, merely an
extension of walking. Snowshoes themselves, cumbersome wooden
frames strung with rawhide nets, were tough to learn and hard to
get enthusiastic about.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed when, in the last decade, snowshoes went
lighter, smaller, just as effective in buoying snow travelers in
every condition from loose, deep powder to hard pack to solid ice.
The modern snowshoe is crafted with a pivoting crampon that can
bite into a glacier wall.
</P>
<P>
   The same study by the NSGA shows that snowshoeing has taken off
in the last part of this decade. In 1996, retailers sold 13,397
pair of snowshoes, and last year that number had ballooned nearly
tenfold to 112,121 pair. Most of the snowshoers are male (2-1
majority), and 47 percent are between the ages of 25 and 45.
</P>
<P>
   As any dealer will tell you, the most appealing things about
snowshoes _ aside from all the aesthetic and athletic benefits _ is
the appeal to minimalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``With cross-country skis, it takes you a few days to get the
hang of it,'' says George DeLorey, who sells snowshoes to trekkers
in upstate New York, ``But with snowshoes, people begin as
intermediates.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. The most challenging thing to learn about snowshoes
is how to strap in the foot. From there, with new lightweight
aluminum and plastic frames, the first move is to put one foot in
front of the other. Bingo, you're a seasoned intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   In the right conditions, the right snow _ well-tracked (trackset
for striders) or in new powder across golf courses or woods _
cross-country skiing can be as pleasant a way to spend a winter day
as there is.
</P>
<P>
   But snowshoeing is simply more versatile. It needs no paths, no
uniformity of snow or terrain, nor does the competence level matter
very much, within reason.
</P>
<P>
   A low-end intermediate on skinny skis cresting even a moderate
hilltop with a turn around a tree halfway down presents what seems
like a life-or-death challenge.
</P>
<P>
   One of a skier's newfound techniques at such moments is grabbing
bushes to slow down and possibly steer the body around the corner,
or at least away from the tree. The ultimate survival technique,
however, is the bail-out. Tree coming, Martha, better hit it! And
down we go, another butt plant.
</P>
<P>
   Real skiing technique does take a few years to master, though
there's no detracting from the great sport that cross-country
skiing is. Still, we're Americans. We like instant success, and
during the first walk on snowshoes, the walker can be going up
steep slopes like a mountain goat _ and down again. Broken powder,
deep drifts, rocks, and stumps _ no problem. Ski poles are highly
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   The good news? According to computations on the Tubbs website,
which allows you to calculate your activity level, a 175-pound man
walking on snowshoes with poles on hilly terrain for an hour burns
around 1,000 calories.

HARRICK, FLINT SEEK A CURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They might be different, but he problems problems at the
University of Rhode Island and the University of Massachusetts are
equally frustrating for coaches Jim Harrick and Bruiser Flint.
</P>
<P>
   And both boil down to leadership _ senior leadership.
</P>
<P>
   At UMass, it's not so much what the Minutemen can do, it's what
they can't do. It has become painfully obvious that the Minutemen
cannot shoot with any consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Add the Minutemen's softness _ losing to Davidson and then by 19
to Iona at home? _ and you have problems. People like Charlton
Clarke can take on leadership roles on the court, but pep talks and
players meetings can carry you only so far.
</P>
<P>
   UMass athletic director Bob Marcum took a leap of faith when he
gave Flint a two-year contract extension earlier this season.
Already the critics and cynics are moaning about that.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a wise move? Probably not. Flint needs to prove himself
more, especially in March. It could have waited.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a bad move? Probably not. With the security of that
extension, Flint can smile through losing streaks and streaky play.
But he knows as much as anybody that eventually he will be held
accountable for what UMass does.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there is a sense of panic in Amherst. We're not ready
to do that _ at least not yet. Seasons can get turned around
quickly with a long winning streak. And there still is time, but
the margin for error is rapidly diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   As for URI: It seems simple. Last year, the Rams had guards _
senior guards _ who could solve problems in close games. This
season they don't. There also seems to be an underlying feeling of
discontentment. Is everybody happy?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. Nor should they be. URI had expectations of a Top
20 finish and an NCAA tournament bid. Now it may have to be scaled
down to above .500 and NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick now must prove he can coach on a different level, which
means finding a way to put back together the psyche of a team that
has had it rattled, if not shattered.
</P>
<P>
   As the Atlantic 10 season moves into its showdown stage in the
next few weeks, the Rams and the Minutemen will have to solve their
problems quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But can they? Various problems and transfers have cut the URI
roster down to 10, and Lamar Odom may be a good one, but he cannot
carry a team on his back for an entire season, nor should he be
asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
   UMass? Who knows. The Minutemen are one of the enigmas of the
season. Maybe it's time to make this assessment: They're just not
that good. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Davis's boffo finale &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Davis is certainly making his final season at Iowa
interesting. Going into Thursday night's game against Illinois, the
Hawkeyes had been beaten only once (by Creighton in November) and
looked very much like a team that could win the Big 10 . . . At
14-0, Cincinnati is off to its best start in history. Give coach
Bob Huggins credit. No one knows how to rebuild a team quicker or
better . . . Sometimes when we get caught up in the bright lights
of college basketball's star system, we forget we're still dealing
with kids. Take the case of UCLA's JaRon Rush. He came back late
from Christmas break in Kansas City and was suspended for a game by
coach Steve Lavin. It's not hard to see both points of view. With a
key game against Arizona approaching him, Lavin could not afford to
lose one of his better recruits. But Rush, feeling homesick, did
not want to leave his family. This was a case of no harm, no foul
on both sides. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meaningful schedule &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much has made of the growing lack of meaning the regular season
seems to have. Not in the ``mid-major'' conferences such as the
America East, which is why Boston University's 1-point overtime
loss to Delaware Tuesday night was a vital win for the Blue Hens
and a tough loss for the Terriers. Here's why. With only one NCAA
tournament bid a near-certainty in America East, winning the
postseason tournament is vital. But unlike the major conferences,
America East plays its championship game on the home court of the
highest-seeded remaining team. Thus finishing first _ or as high as
possible _ means everything. A BU win at Delaware would have given
coach Dennis Wolff's team an early edge in what is essentially a
home-court league . . . It's only early January and only three
Division 1 teams remain unbeaten _ UConn, Cincinnati and Auburn. &QL; 
 &QL; 
UConn's `home' game &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things are tough enough at Boston College, but to play at Conte
Forum Wednesday night against UConn and find the place filled with
Huskies fans made it doubly tough on coach Al Skinner's Eagles, who
gave the No. 1 ranked Huskies a surprisingly tough time. But
there's not much BC can do about the fan composition . . . Like him
or not, Fresno State's Jerry Tarkanian deserves some recognition
for winning his 700th game this week. Only 12 major coaches have
reached that milestone . . . Going into the first full week of
conference play, the Pac-10 and the ACC were the only conferences
with every team above .500 . . . It's good to know that college
basketball pollsters are as wacky as their football brethren.
Explain this glitch in this week's polls. Wisconsin and Ohio State
are 12-3. Ohio State had just come into Madison and pulled off an
upset, had a better Big Ten record and yet Wisconsin is No. 24 and
Ohio State unranked. Thank heaven basketball settles its
championship with a tournament . . . One of bigger disappointments
thus far has been South Carolina. A solid SEC contender the past
few seasons, the Gamecocks are a mediocre 5-8 after losing to
Kentucky at home Tuesday night . . . The Big Ten might not have a
Super team, but it's just as hard to find a bad team among its 11
members. at the beginning of the week, Michigan had the worst
overall record at 7-8, but then the Wolverines went out and beat
No. 13 Indiana to get back to .500 . . . Let's get it over with
early this season. ESPN is simply wrong when it has a TCU-SMU game
for its Big Monday show, necessitating an 11 p.m. local time
tipoff. Both schools also are wrong for allowing the game to be
played at such a ridiculous time. With all the yammering about
concern for the well-being of college athletes, isn't it time
someone really had some consideration for the players _ and for the
fans? But it's all about the money, of course, which is why schools
sell their souls for exposure, even if it comes when most people
are asleep.

REVOLUTION MAY LOSE A KEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Revolution could be in danger of losing goalkeeper Ian
Feuer, who is playing for Rushden and Diamonds in the Vauxhall
Conference, the equivalent of the fifth division in England. He
helped the Diamonds hold Premier League power Leeds United to a 0-0
tie in an FA Cup match, setting up a replay at Elland Road next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer is on loan and could be recalled by the Revolution for
training camp later this month. But Rushden and Diamonds could be
in position to offer a decent contract, since the team chairman is
Doc Martens shoe baron Max Griggs.
</P>
<P>
   The team is the product of a merger of Rushden Town and
Irthlingborough Diamonds, and Griggs's goal is to advance to the
Football League, which comprises England's top 92 clubs, in two
years. Griggs is worth 325 million pounds sterling, making him the
61st-richest person in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer was added to the team after the starting goalkeeper was
injured and is residing with friends in Belgium, where he played
before going to Luton Town and West Ham United in England, then to
the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to the States six months ago for a number of
reasons, but mainly because of pressure from the US federation to
get their best players back to help the domestic league to
prosper,'' Feuer told the Daily Mail. ``I quickly realized I had
made the wrong decision to go back. I was biting my fingernails and
thinking that I didn't want to be 35 having never given myself the
chance of playing in the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about money. It's about the honor of playing in
England. My wife and I have a daughter who was born over here, and
we wanted to come back. We found out the hard way that this is
where we want to be. Going back to the States toughened me up
mentally, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer apparently has a better chance to start for Diamonds and
to be scouted by top-level clubs there than he would with the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>

Power struggle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FIFA president Sepp Blatter has proposed holding the World Cup
every two years, starting in 2006. It will not likely happen, but
Blatter is playing a strong hand in the battle for control of
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 40 billion spectators with television and in the stands
at France '98,'' Blatter told the weekly Sonnstags Blick. ``It's a
figure that no other sporting event can even come close to matching
and a testimony to the great bond which the national teams enjoy
with the public. A World Cup every two years could reestablish the
status they merit, that of an enormous promotional vehicle for all
of soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatter noted that the proposal would actually reduce the
demands on players, since meaningless friendlies and mismatch
qualifiers would be eliminated. Continental championships, for
instance, also would serve as World Cup qualifiers. And FIFA could
double its money, though at the risk of devaluing the competition.
</P>
<P>
   But Blatter's main purpose here is to fight attempts to usurp
FIFA's control of world soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Elite clubs, along with television moguls Silvio Berlusconi, Leo
Kirch, and Rupert Murdoch, have attempted to establish a Super
League in Europe. And now the International Olympic Committee is
attempting to apply drug testing and disciplinary standards to
soccer. FIFA officials have noted that many drugs banned by the IOC
do not have performance-enhancing qualities for soccer players.

DAN REEVES GETS BACK TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Reeves hasn't been wrong about many things since
he came to Atlanta two years ago, but he was wrong about one thing.
On Dec. 13, he was nearly dead wrong about himself.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, he felt the burning sensation in his chest and
pain in his throat that he'd become too familiar with over the past
few weeks and knew it was time to tell someone. Until that day, he
had ignored the sensations, but this time the burning was too hot
and it lasted too long, and even prowling the sidelines directing
his Falcons to another victory could not make it go away.
</P>
<P>
   So when the game was over _ and not until _ Reeves took team
physician Charles Harrison aside in the locker room and told him
what he had been feeling, prefacing his words with ``I know I'm
overreacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison immediately gave him two aspirin to help thin his blood
and ordered a heart catheterization and angiogram the next morning.
Less than 24 hours after taking those aspirin, the Falcons'
54-year-old coach underwent four hours of open-heart surgery, a
quadruple bypass that probably saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors found that one coronary artery was 100 percent
blocked, another was 90 percent blocked, and a third was 80-90
percent blocked. Blood was moving through Reeves's heart the way
his running back, Jamal Anderson, moves through a defense. It was
battering its way through small holes, struggling for every inch.
According to Harrison, it wouldn't have been much longer before it
would have been like the Patriots' running game _ it wouldn't have
gotten anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another day or two, another week, who knows when, but soon
enough, Reeves would have suffered a massive heart attack, because
when the left circumflex artery closed completely, it would have
resulted in what Harrison called ``a catastrophe.'' Nobody needed a
definition of what that would have meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had waited any longer, there would have been damage to
the heart muscle,'' Harrison said after the operation. ``A heart
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is no stranger to illness and recovery, the latter of
which began anew only days after he was released from Piedmont
Hospital and is scheduled to continue Saturday when he expects to
return to the sideline in a reduced role for the first time since
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who had five knee operations by his mid-20s, yet
played seven years in the NFL, a man who had two angioplasty
procedures (in which a balloon is inserted into the artery to open
a blockage) in 1990 and 1991 without missing a game as coach of the
Denver Broncos. But this time it was different.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was something both lifesaving and life-shattering, and
Reeves showed its effects at a packed press conference several days
after the operation. He broke down in tears as he held the hand of
his former high school sweetheart and wife of 33 years and said,
``I understand how precious life is. You do break down a little bit
more. You do cry a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet until he went through the near collapse, Reeves didn't
listen. He didn't listen to his doctors and he didn't listen to his
body. Not until Dr. Charlie Brown said, ``We'll have to do a
bypass,'' the morning after the Saints game did Dan Reeves
understand what he was now facing.
</P>
<P>
   As Reeves described it, ``Bypass hits you in the head and starts
ringing in your ears.''
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true if you consider yourself a tough guy
both by inclination and temperament. Then you do what Reeves did
for nearly too long, which was to ignore the signs for four months,
right up to the day his idea of toughness nearly killed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my mind about three or four months ago,'' Reeves
said at a postoperation press conference. ``I had those symptoms
(and) I wasn't going to mention. I didn't want to do anything to
distract the football team. You try to be so tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves will try to be that again as the remarkable Falcon team
he has rebuilt in just two years tries to qualify for the NFC
Champonship Game when it takes on an old nemesis, the San Francisco
49ers. When Reeves came to Atlanta last season after being fired in
New York during a power struggle with then Giants general manager
George Young, the Falcons were coming off a 3-13 season. They had
not won a division title since 1980 and opened the Reeves Regime by
going 1-7, sorely testing both his heart and his patience.
</P>
<P>
   But then the toughness he had been trying to instill in them
through a power running game and scrappy defense began to take
hold. The Falcons went 6-2 in the second half of 1997 and set the
stage for a turnaround so remarkable this season that it brought
Reeves a landslide victory in the Coach of the Year balloting.
</P>
<P>
   That honor came because today his Falcons are 14-2, are the NFC
West champions for the first time in 18 years, and are favored to
beat the Niners at the Georgia Dome, in part because they are 8-0
at home and 20-4 in their last 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Reeves acknowledged this week that he probably won Coach of
the Year honors for more than what his team has done, although he
wouldn't endorse it as the best strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the sympathy vote helped,'' Reeves joked. ``I
wouldn't recommend that anybody go through heart bypass surgery to
try to get Coach of the Year, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it wasn't Reeves's idea, and Thursday he seemed
almost embarrassed to still be answering questions about his heart
instead of the heart of his team or that of the 49ers, who have
beaten Atlanta 13 of the last 18 times they've met.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves understood this affair of the heart could not be
ignored, so he talked softly and patiently of the past two days,
his first back on the practice field at the Georgia Dome, and of
his plans to be on the sideline in the spot where he feels he
belongs but no one knows for sure he is ready to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless I have some sort of setback in the next 48 hours, I
plan to be there,'' Reeves said. ``You get very tired going through
something like this, but I've been able to stand up the whole time
(at practice).
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking into consideration what the doctors said, it's up to me
how much I can do. I want to be as much a part of it as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has worked on the game plan as the Falcons prepare for
the 49ers, attended meetings, and run practice as always, although
he said, ``I'm about 50 percent involved. It's not anything like
what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof came Thursday during the 30-minute drive from the
Falcons' training camp in Suwanee to the Dome in downtown Atlanta.
During that ride, Reeves leaned his head against a car window and
simply fell asleep, a concession to fatigue he would not have made
a month or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his willingness to listen to his body and do what is
best, Dan Reeves still is putting the Falcons first. That is why he
said the plays will continue to be called from upstairs by
quarterback coach Jack Burns but instead of going through him and
out to quarterback Chris Chandler, they will go through offensive
coordinator George Sefcik. Although Reeves will retain the right to
overrule them, he won't be transmitting the plays to anyone on this
game day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be giving Chris the plays,'' Reeves joked. ``I'll just
call the ones that work.''
</P>
<P>
   The way things have gone this season, that would be the majority
of them.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves left New York, he went out the way Bill Parcells
left New England. He left saying he wanted to control the personnel
side of his operation as well as the football side, and that he has
done.
</P>
<P>
   It was he who decided to trade for Chandler, who is 17-4 in
Atlanta in games he has started and finished. It was he who signed
Ray Buchanan, although the free agent cornerback had been an
expensive transitional player with the Colts; Buchanan finished
second in the NFC in interceptions this season with seven. It was
he who hired Rich Brooks as defensive coordinator and Art Shell as
offensive line coach and told them to teach his team what toughness
is all about. It was he who drafted players like tight end O.J.
Santiago and guard Calvin Collins to give his offense that
toughness, which allowed Anderson to rush for 1,846 yards this
season.
</P>
<P>
   And now it is Reeves who is trying to decide if his presence on
the sideline and on the practice field this week will detract from
his team's efforts or bolster them. The decision he has made, at
least for the moment, is simple. This is his team, and Dan Reeves
doesn't have the heart not to be with it if he can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hurt them,'' Reeves said. ``I won't let me
being around hurt them. I put my team first and me second.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, of course, is what led to the foot-long scar
running down his chest. Then again, it's also what led the Atlanta
Falcons to this moment, a game away from earning the right to play
for the NFC championship.
</P>
<P>
   When they play that game against their oldest and most
dominating rival, Dan Reeves's heart has told him to be there with
them.
</P>
<P>
   And so he will be.

BRONCOS HOPING TO DUPLICATE SINGULAR SENSATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ You want to win the Super Bowl. Everyone in
professional football wants to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from getting a laughable amount of money that doesn't
come close to what baseball and basketball players get for winning
their championships, what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos know. It's about a truly indescribable
feeling. And because they know about that feeling, they want very
much to experience it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an even greater feeling than what I expected,'' confides
fullback Howard Griffith. ``And after a couple of days, it really
settles in. You say, `Wow, I really won a Super Bowl!' ''
</P>
<P>
   They are all team championships, but there is an extra dimension
shared by football and hockey players because they are
body-sacrifice sports. And with all due deference to the grit and
spunk of the pucksters, when it comes to laying the body on the
line for the sake of the unit, there really is football and then
there is everything else.
</P>
<P>
   There is no training camp like football training camp. There is
no physical exercise like a football game. These guys get together
in early July and they put those bodies through torture through
four or five exhibitions, 16 regular-season games, and either two
or three playoff games before arriving at the designated Super Bowl
site more than six months later. The shared experience of pain,
misery, and a perverse sort of joy is immeasurable, and so when all
that blood, toil, tears, and sweat culminates in a championship,
the feeling is so exquisite as to be, yes, indescribable. The only
thing you can be sure of at that point is that you want to
experience it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' confirms cornerback/punt returner Darrien
Gordon. ``That's why we dedicated ourselves during the offseason,
working out hard. We know what it takes. Now we've gone through all
those exhibitions and regular-season games just to get to the point
where we can win another Super Bowl and get that feeling all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Phase I of the quest will take place Saturday when the AFC West
champion Broncos meet the Miami Dolphins at celebrated Mile High
Stadium, where they have gone undefeated during the last two
regular seasons. With the home-field advantage guaranteed
throughout the playoffs, the Broncos find themselves clear
favorites to be the AFC representative Jan. 31 in Miami's Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the regular season is over, the truth can be told. The
hoo-hah over becoming the first undefeated team since the 1972
Dolphins was a pain in the butt. The Bronocs like entering the
postseason without that extra burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had become a big distraction,'' says Griffith. ``It wasn't
something that we had focused on, but we couldn't avoid it. It was
in everyone's conversation, and so inevitably, it became part of
ours. We fell into a little trap, and we were no longer having fun.
Here we had good things happening like producing a 2,000-yard
runner (Terrell Davis) and a 50,000-yard passer (John Elway), and
the talk was all about being undefeated. We had gotten away from
our original goal.''
</P>
<P>
   That goal, of course, was to recapture The Feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The Feeling has gradations. There is the overall feeling, the
one you carry every day. When you have won the championship, the
offseason is exquisite. ``Several times during the offseason,''
explains veteran safety Steve Atwater, one of the few Broncos who
had played in the 1990 Super Bowl loss, ``I would wake up and just
start thinking about the fact that we had won. I would see that
final score, 31-24, in my head. That's a feeling I'll carry with me
the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another aspect of The Feeling. Call it the feeling
within the feeling. Just about everyone agrees there comes a moment
in time when you are so ecstatic, you just about explode. It is a
degree of professional happiness you could not possibly imagine, or
describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feeling for me came once we had secured the game and the
offense went back on the field to end it,'' says Griffith. ``And
then when the game ended, you couldn't see any grass _ just
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the best moment,'' says Gordon. ``When John
Mobley knocked down that ball, a rush of adrenaline went through my
body. At that point, I knew we had the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When John Mobley knocked that pass down,'' agrees Atwater, ``I
said, `Fourth down! We're champs!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley is a soft-spoken third-year linebacker out of Kutztown
State. The Fates lined him up as the hero when Brett Favre fired
the last bullet in his gun, a fourth-down pass that was trying to
keep the Packers' fading hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was definitely the big moment for me,'' he says.
``You realize you've finally got the game in hand. And to know that
you were such a big part of it is a great feeling. It's definitely
something I'll remember as long as I'm alive.''
</P>
<P>
   When you are the champion and when your goal is to recreate The
Feeling and The Moment, there are two ways of looking at the
process. Either you can say you own something and it's yours until
someone comes to take it away, or you reason that what got you
there the first time was wanting the prize with all your heart and
acting as if you are going after it for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Put Griffith down as someone who regards the championship as
personal property. ``It is definitely ours to defend,'' he says.
``Now is our opportunity to defend our title.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ours,'' says Gordon. ``We know the feeling. We know the
whole experience. It's a great ride. You get to go to a nice place
and have all that media attention. Then you get to play for the
championship. Who wouldn't want to do it every year?''
</P>
<P>
   Atwater is more cautious, possibly because he is older and
wiser. ``I don't look at it as if it's ours,'' he says. ``It's
something to go after, one game at a time. I mean that. Right now I
am only thinking about Miami. After that, it will be the winner of
the Jets-Jaguars game. And after that, it will be the NFC team in
the Super Bowl. We haven't won anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, rookie Atwater suffered through Super Bowl XXIV
in New Orleans. His Broncos were the docile O's to the dominant X's
of the San Francisco 49ers, whose 55-10 triumph remains a classic
example of How To Play Football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Well, we were in the Super Bowl, and the worst
that will happen is that we'll be in the AFC title game every
year,' '' Atwater explains. They were back the next year, all
right, but they lost to Buffalo. Atwater would not participate in a
winning playoff game for nearly seven years, or until the Broncos
blasted Jacksonville in the wild-card game Dec. 27, 1997. So he
takes nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm closer to the end of my career than to the beginning,'' he
says. ``If there's a chance I'll get another championship, this
looks like the year. But you have to go out and play the games.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular season is over. The Denver Broncos won't go
undefeated. The finished 14-2, so they won't set any records. They
aren't even thinking of a repeat championship as making some sort
of historical statement. They are thinking of one thing _ The
Feeling, and how to get it back.

 &UR; BIOGRAPHY: THE SHORT FORM
</P>
<P>
   BY PETER ACKROYD
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps significant that the first two Penguin Lives -- a
new but not necessarily innovative series of short biographies --
are written by novelists rather than orthodox biographers. ``Marcel
Proust,'' by Edmund White, and ``Crazy Horse,'' by Larry McMurtry,
are widely separated in theme and culture, but they bear testimony
to the fact that biographical narratives can aspire to art rather
than to history. These relatively inexpensive volumes are more than
Auden's ``shilling life,'' which ``will give you all the facts,''
primarily because they are both works that issue from imagination
and intuition as much as from scholarship and research. That may
give them a chance to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Other novelists have crossed the boundary into biography --
Graham Greene on the Earl of Rochester and Evelyn Waugh on Edmund
Campion are two notable 20th-century examples -- but there has been
a general lack of enthusiasm for the enterprise. It is often
supposed that a writer of fiction should stick to his or her trade,
but the reasons are not obvious. A composer is never confined to
writing only string quartets or symphonies, so why should an author
be constrained within any specific genre? Music is music; writing
is writing. Of course there are differences between the two forms.
In novels one is forced to tell the truth, for example, whereas in
biography one can invent more freely. This will sound like a
paradox only to those who do not practice either art. In fiction
the accuracy and coherence of the imaginative narrative must be
strong enough to impart a vision of truth to the reader; in
biography the devices and tricks of historical narrative are so
abundant that it is much easier to disguise lack of knowledge or
loss of comprehension. Biography is the art of concealment; fiction
is that of revelation.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also obvious similarities between the two forms.
Biography and fiction are both concerned with human narrative; they
require a central character and a coherent plot, as well as a
strong engagement with place and motive to drive the developing
story. Indeed it is possible to envisage the moment when biography
and fiction -- or history and fiction, to put it more grandly --
cease to be separate and identifiable forms of narrative but mingle
and interpenetrate each other. That is why the idea of the ``short
biography,'' embodied in this Penguin series, is one way to capture
a presiding truth or vivid impression in much the same manner as a
short story might. Edmund White here explores the pathology of a
man who was passionate and yet oblique, rhetorical and secretive;
sentimental and yet clearsighted, innocent and depraved -- a great
writer condemned as a flaneur and a gossip who wrote a masterpiece.
It requires the skill and intuition of an imaginative artist to
make these aspects cohere within a single and living portrait.
Larry McMurtry, on the other hand, evokes a period and a culture
rather than one man -- a moment when the forces of the burgeoning
American state destroyed whole tribes and indeed a whole
civilization, of which the Sioux warrior Crazy Horse remains the
single most potent emblem. A longer biography might not have been
able to address the issue with such vigor and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Short biographies have always been popular -- starting, perhaps,
with ``Lives of the Caesars,'' by Suetonius -- and the fashion has
continued into the 19th and 20th centuries with series like ``Great
Lives,'' ``Modern Masters'' and others. Oscar Wilde was scathing
about the ``Great Lives'' series in particular -- ``formerly we
used to canonize our great men, now we vulgarize them'' -- but in
fact these series of biographies have commanded the learning and
imagination of some remarkable writers, among them G. K. Chesterton
on Blake and Rose Macaulay on Milton, E. H. Gombrich on Leonardo
and Sacheverell Sitwell on Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   The present Penguin series, edited by James Atlas, has projected
a wide range of subjects, from the Buddha to Marlon Brando, Chekhov
to Martin Luther King. It is a tribute to the ambition and
catholicity of the project that such a choice is possible, and
testimony also to the heterogeneity of contemporary culture, but it
ought not to be forgotten that in biographical narrative the writer
rather than the subject is paramount. If this again sounds
paradoxical, perhaps it ought to be recalled that the only
biographies that have survived the encroachments of time and
forgetfulness are those that have been written well. Who now
remembers the factual and detailed accounts of Charlotte Bronte,
after Elizabeth Gaskell's wonderful if often inaccurate narrative?
All 19th- and 20th-century scholarship and research upon Samuel
Johnson are nugatory beside Boswell's account. Many long
biographies, particularly those by Anglo-Saxon academics, are
stuffed with facts and with research; but they are about as
interesting as telephone directories and are equally transient.
Scholarship is not necessarily art. Only well-written biographies
survive because, by the alchemy of charmed language, the truth they
reveal is the one that lasts. So Edmund White, in his biographical
account, proceeds by evoking memorable scenes -- from the moment
when the young Proust stopped in front of a rosebush and stared at
its flowers for so long that it seemed as if ``his entire being was
concentrated'' to his last night on earth, when he dictated one
final sentence: ``There is a Chinese patience in Vermeer's craft.''
White has a novelist's eye for the telling detail or the remarkable
phrase and, like Proust himself, concentrates upon the minutiae of
the past so that it might live again. He has a wonderful sympathy
with his subject, adduced in such reflections as ``Proust fancied
that so long as he failed to begin his life's work, his life would
go on.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SHORTBIO-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: would go on.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is a weakness, it is a tendency upon White's part to
assert the gay life and consciousness of Proust; it is perhaps
understandable in a novelist and critic who has written extensively
on gay themes, but in a subtle and unintentional way it diminishes
Proust's significance. One of the secrets of the biographical art
lies in the extent to which the biographer can intuit the personal
stirrings of the individual consciousness; it is not a question of
admiring, or liking, the subject of the narrative. It is a question
of making him, or her, live upon the page. To introduce a somewhat
anachronistic term such as ``gay,'' with all its late-20th-century
connotations, is to avoid making that act of personal, intimate
sympathy that a great biography requires.
</P>
<P>
   That is perhaps also the central problem with Larry McMurtry's
biography of Crazy Horse. He writes of ``the Crazy Horse legend,''
concerning a man whose character and beliefs have retreated from
the memory of mankind, and whose activities are surrounded by
``assumption, conjecture and surmise.'' The nature of biography
then changes, and becomes a history of symbolic truth rather than
of a human being. Since ``the man and the way of life died
together'' it also becomes the narrative of a lost civilization in
which man and myth become inextricably aligned. So Crazy Horse
remains a figure trapped in a history that he himself only partly
understood, and the narrative must essentially remain at the level
of supposition rather than of truth.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry is good at the less intimate moments, however, when he
suggests that mutual incomprehension between white settlers and
Indians led to sporadic and at first inconclusive warfare. And this
apparently objective story is striated with the gleams and
intimations of the novelist shrouded within the biographer. ``They
had been marching since the middle of the night,'' McMurtry writes
of Custer's ragged troop. ``A lot of them were so tired that they
could barely lift their guns. For them it was dust, weariness,
terror and death.''
</P>
<P>
   This is fine writing, and suggests once again that history and
biography can best be restored by the creative imagination. This
central point needs to be restated, for writers as well as readers.
The truest biographies are those that are most engaging and
inventive; style precedes fact. But if biographies, like fiction,
are fluent narratives concerning the lives of human beings, they
are also irradiated with historical speculation and cultural
interpretation. Biographers must therefore learn as much from the
masterworks of the past as any poet or novelist, since biography
itself is the great transcript of human life.

 CRIME
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY MARILYN STASIO &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Here it is, just in time for those read-for-your-life months in
the dead of winter: a new 87th Precinct novel from Ed McBain. It
happens to be a good one, too, from its swaggering title, THE BIG
BAD CITY (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25), to the ending that leaves Steve
Carella, the detective who has been on duty in this series since
1956, weak in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   It's just another day in the city that McBain calls Isola. But
``in this city, you had to pay attention. In this city, things were
happening all the time, all over the place.'' In a heartbeat,
Carella and his partner, Artie Brown, are out on the street,
investigating the homicide of a young woman who was strangled in
the park, a case that becomes complicated when it turns out that
the victim was a nun and the nun had breast implants. Nonplused,
the cops have no time to spare for the Cookie Boy, a burglar who
leaves home-baked goodies behind for his victims. Carella is so
distracted, he doesn't even notice that he's being stalked by the
heartless psycho who killed his father in an earlier novel.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's not above a few nun jokes, McBain does his usual
high-wire act of balancing the tone and content of his separate
plot lines: respectful of the nun and her sad little secret, amused
by the cookie monster, vengeful toward the psycho. It's not done by
brute force, either, but with dialogue. When it comes to the voices
of this city, McBain is the man with the golden ear.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody hates Judy Hammer, which gives the former Charlotte,
N.C., police chief a bit of an edge in SOUTHERN CROSS (Putnam,
$25.95), the second book in a new series by Patricia Cornwell, when
Hammer is hired out to Richmond to shape up its sloppy operations.
``The timing was right for a woman to come along and clean house,''
Cornwell observes of the once-proud capital of the Confederacy, now
plagued by soaring homicide rates, marauding drug dealers, nasty
teen-agers, bothersome robberies and other uncivil forces of change
that the natives perceive as a further erosion of their dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Given Hammer's prickly character and the author's storytelling
skills, Cornwell might have come up with some sharp insights into
the criminal corruption that thrives on the social decay of old
cities. But instead of dealing with the big issues, she adopts a
meanspirited satirical tone that makes all the townies look like
Bubbas and boobies. (One prototypical boobie is even named Bubba.)
The only characters who don't come off too badly (and that includes
the sour, paranoid Hammer) are a sadistic young criminal called
Smoke and the teen-age misfit known as Weed whom he torments. ``He
had diagnosed himself as a psychopath,'' we learn about Smoke. ``He
worked hard to be a good one.'' And he succeeds -- to the point of
making us wonder what Cornwell might have done with the Bubbas of
Richmond had she respected them enough to take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The best road trips are the ones you take on lost highways.
That's the way it plays, anyway, in CASES (Mysterious Press/Warner,
$23), a quasi-autobiographical novel by Joe Gores about the golden
summer of 1953, when he crossed the country in the company of
various disreputable strangers and ended up in San Francisco
working for a slick private eye. As related by Pierce Duncan, a
college kid who read too much Hemingway at Notre Dame, the
adventure bounds along with the unquenchable energy of youth, its
reckless spirit only slightly tempered by a touch of authorial
wistfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The trip almost ends before it begins, when Dunc gets picked up
for vagrancy in Georgia and spends a month on a chain gang. To
recuperate from that brutalizing experience, which ends in a savage
act of violence, Dunc goes on a roaring drunk in Juarez. Then it's
off to Las Vegas, where he helps an honest boxer train for a
crooked match, and on to California to soak up more life and learn
more lessons in betrayal from people he has come to trust.
</P>
<P>
   Writing with a young man's sense of wonder, Gores seizes a
moment, savors it and then catches the next ride out of town before
the pleasure fades, a style that runs to vivid characters and short
verbs. Dunc, who wants to be a writer, thinks he's got it all
figured out: life is what you do in order to write. (``You went,
you watched, you learned, until you knew, like Hemingway said, that
you had something to write about.'') But the way Gores goes at it,
it seems to be the other way around: writing is what the writer
does to give himself an excuse for living.
</P>
<P>
   With kidnapped children so commonplace in suspense thrillers
that writers have to snatch them by the busload to get any
attention, it's gratifying to watch Craig Holden, in FOUR CORNERS
OF NIGHT (Delacorte, $23.95), find enough meaning in the loss of
one child to support a multilayered morality tale about the
breakdown of trust between husband and wife, parent and child,
friend and friend.
</P>
<P>
   To the narrator, a sensitive cop everybody calls Mack, the
kidnapping of a 12-year-old girl in an unnamed Ohio city is an
invitation to examine a friendship that ended seven years earlier,
when his partner's 11-year-old daughter left the house for softball
practice and was never seen again. The partner, a raging-bull kind
of guy everybody calls Bank, went a little crazy at the time,
dragging Mack into the vortex with him, and things have never been
the same between them. Now, as all the old issues resurface, so
does all the old craziness.
</P>
<P>
   Holden doesn't write a conventional story line. As Mack's mind
races back and forth from the past to the present, the two time
frames intersect and characters collide, sometimes with their own
younger selves. It's a difficult narrative to follow, and it's
disastrous if you lose sympathy for Mack, whose hero worship of
Bank (``He acted at times as my conscience and my spine'') strains
patience. But in the end, it's worth hanging on, if only to see how
far beyond its conventions a talented writer can take the genre.

 &UR; FRAUDS! FAKES! PHONIES!
</P>
<P>
   BY TIMOTHY FERRIS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you're a famous scientist, blessed with a social
conscience and a gift for writing, who becomes sufficiently
dismayed by the persistence of superstition, pseudoscience and
general muddle-headedness among the masses that you're tempted to
write a book about it -- one that aims to shepherd people out of
the darkness and onto the sunlit path of empirical fact. Your
skills are sharp, your motives lofty. Should you do it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, but don't expect much in the way of reward. You'll
probably flop with the very people you hope to enlighten, and
understandably so. Their exploiters thrill them with hair-raising
tales of alien abductions and how Sally learned from a midnight
dream that Uncle Barney was perishing in a house fire; you get to
tell them that such stories, which they love, are bunk. And that's
if they hear from you at all: while they are paging through The
National Enquirer and watching ``Strange Universe'' on television,
your book will be read mostly by college professors who already
agree with you. Nor can you expect much gratitude from them,
either.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be lucky to escape being nailed by the likes of Richard
Lewontin, the eminent Harvard zoologist and professional scold.
Reviewing Carl Sagan's last book, ``The Demon-Haunted World,''
Lewontin asserted that popularizers of science are motivated by the
belief that ``the truth shall make you free,'' a conviction that,
in this context at least, Lewontin calls ``wrong.'' The biologist
Paul R. Gross and the mathematician Norman Levitt, whose book
``Higher Superstition'' sparked a continuing debate about
post-modernist critiques of science, were dismissed by Lewontin for
what he called their ``obtuse ignorance of the actual state of
science.'' Get the picture? Stick your neck out and you'll be next.
</P>
<P>
   So the first thing to be said about Richard Dawkins's
``Unweaving the Rainbow,'' which argues that scientific fact is
both intellectually and esthetically more pleasing than
pseudoscientific fantasy, is that he is to be congratulated for his
courage in attempting it. Does he avoid all the pitfalls that
threaten those who tilt at the windmills of antiscience? Well, no.
Too often he sounds like Prof. Eat Your Peas, and he can't resist
preaching to the choir. But he's a good enough writer to get away
-- sometimes -- with ignoring the old dictum that no good deed goes
unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins, a zoologist, is the Professor of the Public
Understanding of Science at Oxford and the author of two of the
most widely influential studies of evolution ever written, ``The
Selfish Gene'' and ``The Blind Watchmaker.'' As their titles imply,
they argue that evolution is a mechanical, nonteleological process.
Organisms pursue their own selfish interests, indifferent to any
putative greater good, which indeed they could not serve if they
wished to, since the process is blind. As Dawkins puts it in
``Unweaving the Rainbow'': ``Natural selection is never aware of
the long-term future. It is not aware of anything. Improvements
come about not through foresight but by genes coming to outnumber
their rivals in gene pools. . . . There is no foresight.''
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion seems to me to be virtually inescapable as a
matter of science -- although in theological terms one can always
hold that blind evolution forms part of a larger and ultimately
purposeful system -- but it still strikes many as disheartening.
Even some scientists can't stomach it; Stephen Jay Gould, for one,
has taken Dawkins to task for what he calls his ``evolutionary
fundamentalism.'' Dawkins, evidently a bit stung, asserts in his
new book that Gould writes ``bad poetry'' that ``in his hands is
all the more damaging because Gould is a graceful writer.'' But he
concedes that many readers have complained to him about what they
see as the ``cold, bleak'' tone of his previous books, their air
``of barren desolation, of promoting an arid and joyless message,''
their sense that life is ``empty and purposeless.'' In ``Unweaving
the Rainbow'' he is out to present a kinder, gentler side of his
worldview, from which perspective science, for all its rigor,
emerges as akin to art. ``It is my thesis,'' he writes, ``that the
spirit of wonder which led Blake to Christian mysticism, Keats to
Arcadian myth and Yeats to Fenians and fairies, is the very same
spirit that moves great scientists; a spirit which, if fed back to
poets in scientific guise, might inspire still greater poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the spirit of wonder is kept waiting off stage during
much of the first two-thirds of the book, which falls victim to
several of the rhetorical excesses that can afflict an able
scientist who starts wagging his finger at the ignorant. Dawkins
belabors the obvious: ``We have an appetite for wonder, a poetic
appetite, which real science ought to be feeding but which is being
hijacked, often for monetary gain, by purveyors of superstition,
the paranormal and astrology.'' (You don't need a psychic friend to
discern that.) He seems out of touch: ``It is certainly important
that some people, indeed some of our brightest and best, should
learn to do science as a practical subject. But couldn't we also
teach science as something to read and rejoice in, like learning
how to listen to music rather than slaving over five-finger
exercises in order to play it?'' (What does he think goes on in all
those general science courses called ``Physics for Poets'' and
``Rocks for Jocks''?)
</P>
<P>
   He takes a curmudgeonly view of those who attempt to reach the
young by teaching them that science is ``fun'': ``If children are
lured into science, or any other worthwhile occupation, by the
promise of easy fun, what are they going to do when they finally
have to confront the reality? . . . 'Fun' sends the wrong signals
and might attract people to science for the wrong reasons.'' He
excoriates what he calls ``the kind of populist whoring that
defiles the wonder of science'' and sniffs at the preferences of
the unwashed: ``Many people who read daily horoscopes don't really
believe them. They state that they read them only as
'entertainment' (their taste in what constitutes entertaining
fiction is evidently different from mine).''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-RAINBOW-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: from mine).'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, after a couple of hundred pages Dawkins stops
berating the benighted -- who are, after all, mostly poor and
undereducated and, therefore, frightened -- and settles down to
what he does best, which is to convey each scientific idea with an
affection that brings out its beauty and clarity and makes the
reader feel not only that he understands it but almost as if he had
thought of it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly successful are his foresighted musings on
information theory, an emerging approach to understanding the world
that could eventually transform the philosophical underpinnings of
science, though to date it remains shrouded in fog. Information
itself, often muddled in such discussions, is here succinctly
defined as ``surprise value, measured as the inverse of expected
probability'' -- which is an excellent way of explaining why, for
instance, a ream of yellowed fish-wrapping paper increases in
information value if it is found to contain, say, a lost Bach
cantata. Invoking the information content of genetic material,
Dawkins writes: ``We are digital archives of the African Pliocene,
even of Devonian seas; walking repositories of wisdom out of the
old days. You could spend a lifetime reading in this ancient
library and die unsated by the wonder of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even grumpy professors like me will find ``Unweaving the
Rainbow'' worth reading, if only for passages like that. At such
moments Dawkins throws off the wet blanket and emerges as one of
the most incisive science writers alive.

 &UR; FATAL ATTRACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   BY BARBARA FISHER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FEAR is not only the title but also the explicit theme of Irini
Spanidou's tightly focused second novel. In a series of vignettes
covering a few months of her 14th year, Spanidou's heroine, Anna
Karystinou, recalls and reveals her adolescent terrors.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Greek Army officer, Anna has spent her
childhood being shunted from base to base throughout Greece. The
military has shaped the movements as well as the values of her
family. Strict and Spartan rules govern the household; discipline
and courage are deeply admired. Anna is encouraged to be manly.
(For her 13th birthday, her father presents her with his own copy
of Marcus Aurelius'
</P>
<P>
   ``Meditations,'' with the original inscription intact: ``To my
only son. We are born animals; we learn to be men.'') Approaching
new people and places, Anna anticipates and perhaps even invites
situations that will test her mettle. She is always conscious of
fear. It is the emotion that grips her heart and dominates her
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   In the first section of the novel, Anna and her family have just
moved to Thessaloniki. It is St. John's Eve, June 1959, and
neighborhood children are jumping through a holiday bonfire burning
in the street. Anna approaches the fire but cannot jump; naturally,
her performance provokes irritation, ridicule and scorn. She
understands that it is not really the fire she fears: ``The sudden
fury, the wild beauty of the flames were a burst of joy in her
heart -- a joy she was too frightened to let out, that tore like
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Anna's father is responsible for her emotional
vigilance. When he challenges her to snuff out the household
candles with her fingers, he insists that it is the fright, not the
fire, that stings. When he takes her to a tavern, she drinks ouzo,
just as he does, until she becomes sick. Although she is nauseated
when she rides in her father's car, he never eases up on the gas
pedal.
</P>
<P>
   At her new school, Anna meets Vera, a girl of her own age but of
greater experience. Arrogant, bold and reckless, Vera proves
frighteningly attractive. While Anna's father constructs lessons
about life, Vera impulsively plunges her new comrade into the thick
of things. The trials within the girls' friendship cannot be
located and described as neatly as the elements of Anna's father's
tests. Indeed, the friendship seems to happen almost against Anna's
will; she is overtaken and overwhelmed by it.
</P>
<P>
   All through this time, the town is in a state of anxiety over a
serial killer called the Dragon, who violates and murders young
women. When Anna is asked by her teacher to write an essay on the
meaning of the killer's name, she focuses on the people's need to
demonize and dehumanize him. ``We hate him,'' she explains,
``because we're not honest enough to hate our fear. We make a
monster of him, so as not to face the monstrous cowardice in us.''
Needless to say, her essay is not appreciated by the teacher or the
class.
</P>
<P>
   In the final scene of the novel, Anna confronts a man she
believes to be the Dragon -- and she doesn't fear being devoured.
In her own way, she has triumphed: ``She felt light, as though a
weight had lifted off, a burden she'd been carrying her whole
life.''
</P>
<P>
   While Spanidou's depiction of Anna's uncertain friendship with
Vera is initially sharp and original, much else in the novel feels
artificial, and thus the whole is less moving than it should be.
Too often Anna's fear feels like an artifact to be isolated and
examined; the events of the novel cluster too neatly around this
central concern. As Anna's story proceeds, the reader longs for it
to embrace something uncontrolled, vague, mysterious -- a fear that
cannot be seen or named or known. There is much more to fear in
life than Anna experiences or imagines; even when she is at the
precarious age of 13, her world seems too small and safe.
</P>
<P>
   The whole novel, from its title onward, feels overcontrolled.
And so, despite the occasional risks Spanidou takes with her
characters, this seems in some ways a fearful performance --

 &UR; DEAR DIARY
</P>
<P>
   BY MARGALIT FOX
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, I picked up The American Grocer,'' a Southern
matron wrote in her diary in 1924. ``Dry reading, yes, but listen
to this under Import Prices: . . . Pepper, Singapore /
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, Zanzibar /
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, Mombasa /
</P>
<P>
   Ginger, Cochin /
</P>
<P>
   Mace, Batavia. . . . If I can get drunk on that, it is surely a
harmless dissipation.''
</P>
<P>
   The intoxicated writer was Helen Jacobus Apte, who from her
marriage in 1909 until shortly before her death in 1946 kept a
diary that furnishes an insightful record of Southern Jewish
bourgeois life in the first half of the 20th century. Discovered by
Apte's family in 1995, ``Heart of a Wife'' (the title was Apte's
own) has been intelligently edited by her grandson Marcus D.
Rosenbaum, a journalist formerly with National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Apte displays the gifts of a first-rate
memoirist: a contemplative, probing mind; an impassioned, often
elegant prose style; Austenesque powers of social observation; and
a self-analytic bent tempered by an awareness of the wider world
and a wry humor. ``Wouldn't it be funny if I were like those women
I've heard say, 'I could stake my life on my husband's constancy,'
'' she writes in 1911, ``and everyone else begins to talk very fast
about something else?''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Hawkinsville, Ga., in 1886 and brought up mostly in
Atlanta, Helen was raised with her five siblings by their
indomitable mother following the death of their father, a probable
suicide, when Helen was 11. At 22 Helen married another Jewish
Southerner, Day Apte (pronounced ``apt''), who became a prosperous
grocery broker; they spent most of their life together in Florida
and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Swept up in the Victorian ideal of marriage and motherhood, Apte
opens with a dewy-eyed account of wedded bliss. ``These days since
my marriage have been as a string of pearls to me,'' she writes in
1909. ``Here the clear stone of duty, here is fidelity and here the
great flaming gem of passion.'' The marriage was happy, but Apte,
an attractive dark-haired woman, relished male attention, and the
diary hints tantalizingly of dalliances -- but modesty prevented
her disclosing whether any was in fact consummated. (Rosenbaum, who
was born three years after Apte's death, thinks not.)
</P>
<P>
   She was a recorder of history, writing of watching Halley's
comet, witnessing an attempt on F.D.R.'s life, sending her brothers
off to World War I and their sons off to World War II. She was
proud in equal measure to be an American, a Southerner and a Jew,
stirred as deeply by children singing ``Dixie'' as by the blowing
of the ram's horn at Rosh ha-Shanah. ``The sound of the shofar
thrills me more than any aria from grand opera,'' she writes. ``In
me burns the ancient pride of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Apte, who as a girl dreamed of becoming a writer, movingly
articulates the predicament of so many women of her era. As a
social document, the diary can be read as a deeply intelligent
woman's search for fulfillment in an age that promised little
beyond marriage, motherhood and mah-jongg. ``If I only could do
things that really interest me,'' Apte writes in her 40's. ``I have
everything to make a woman happy, yet always there is that vague
unrest, that faint nostalgia -- for what? I don't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   Permeating Apte's chronicle is her battle with a persistent,
inadequately diagnosed illness -- a ``nervous condition of the
organs'' -- that had forced her to leave school at 16. In an
appendix, Rosenbaum convenes a round table of medical experts to
analyze her symptoms. And in informative essays throughout the
book, he places the diary's prevailing themes -- race, religion,
childbearing -- in a broader social context.
</P>
<P>
   The diary's last years, in which Apte makes a conscious effort
to set down ``a record of these momentous times,'' are less
personal, and less satisfying. But the reader's only real regret on
finishing this lovely volume is that Helen Apte lacked the
self-assurance, and the encouragement of her times, to write a real
memoir, filling in the echoing spaces left hauntingly empty here.

 &UR; A POLITICAL ACT
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID B. GREEN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Israelis still have a lot of questions about the assassination
of Yitzhak Rabin by Yigal Amir on Nov. 4, 1995. Often a question
betrays the political leanings of the questioner, hardly surprising
since the murder was nothing if not a political one. Amir, a
25-year-old Orthodox Jewish law student, believed, like many other
Israelis, that in agreeing to give up to the Palestinians land
taken by Israel in the 1967 war, Rabin was not only endangering the
country's security but breaking God's law as well. He was
delivering into the hands of enemies land promised by God to the
people of the covenant. Amir himself told Michael Karpin and Ina
Friedman, the authors of the trenchant ``Murder in the Name of
God'': ``My deed will be understood in the future. I saved the
people of Israel from destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   So although most Israelis accept that Amir was alone when he
pulled the trigger, there are those who still ask if he wasn't
decisively encouraged to act by the national-religious circles he
moved in, and specifically if he didn't have rabbinical sanction to
murder the Prime Minister. Others ask what responsibility Rabin
bore for his own killing, in particular by treating his political
enemies in the national-religious camp with a contempt that verged
on provocation. That the Shin Bet security service, entrusted with
protecting Rabin, failed at its job is a given, but many Israelis
wonder whether the failure included advance knowledge of Amir's
plans, and even his incitement by one of the service's operatives.
Then there are those who have taken refuge in far-fetched
conspiracy theories that see Rabin's No. 2, Shimon Peres,
engineering the murder so that he could assume power.
</P>
<P>
   Karpin, an Israeli journalist, and Friedman, an American-born
Dutch correspondent, attempt, with significant success, not only to
answer most of these questions but also to describe the social,
religious and political background against which the murder took
place. But it is Ehud Sprinzak, a political scientist at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, who steps back even farther to provide the
historical context. Examining the left-right, religious-secular,
Sephardi-Ashkenazi and Jewish-Palestinian battlefields over a
50-year period, he reminds us that the threat of internecine
violence has always bubbled near the surface. Occasionally it
erupts, but Sprinzak suggests that wiser heads nearly always seem
to prevail. This is because he sees an ``instinctive Israeli
rejection of civil war,'' whose origins he traces back to a
reaction to the destruction of the Second Temple in A.D. 70, which
Jewish tradition attributes not to the Romans but rather to
``baseless hatred'' among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinzak reminds us, for example, of several showdowns between
two of Israel's founding fathers, David Ben-Gurion and Menachem
Begin. Though Ben-Gurion, as the country's first Prime Minister,
did not hesitate to humiliate Begin and even use violence against
what he perceived as challenges to his authority, Begin never
picked up the gauntlet of insurrection, committed as he was to
preventing violence among Jews at almost all cost.
</P>
<P>
   But if Sprinzak's book is meant to be mildly reassuring, I found
it unsatisfying, despite his considerable expertise. It is not only
because he writes vaguely of the ``restraining effect'' of Rabin's
murder, which is said to have ``shocked the Israeli extreme right
almost as much as it stunned the left'' -- this, despite the fact
that right-wing demonstrators against the Wye River agreement today
refer to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a traitor, just as
they did to Rabin before one right-winger killed him. It is also
because, by limiting his purview to political violence, Sprinzak
disregards the country's growing nonpolitical violence. Crime is on
the rise, and one in every seven women is a victim of physical
abuse at home, according to the Israeli press. Take to the roads
for an hour, listen to a parliamentary debate or a radio call-in
show or simply stand in line at the bank for a few minutes.
Empirically, it would be hard to avoid concluding that this is a
country on a short collective fuse. But none of this merits mention
in ``Brother Against Brother,'' and so the picture is left
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, if the Rabin murder so shook up Israeli society,
what changes do Israelis have to show for it? It seems instead that
the trauma led to a circling of the wagons, on both right and left.
As Karpin and Friedman write, ``Before Yitzhak Rabin had even been
laid to rest, the Israeli right began complaining that it was the
object of a cynical campaign'' to hold it responsible for his
death. The left, in turn, ``fought back by portraying itself,
rather than Israeli society and democracy, as the injured party.''
But in place of any serious, binding discussion of the issues that
are splitting the country into a loose federation of partisan
camps, Israelis are being treated to costly public-service ads
insipidly depicting pairs of celebrities, one Orthodox, the other
secular, smiling under the slogan ``Different opinions, Yes. Civil
war, No.''
</P>
<P>
   As to those questions that won't go away: Karpin and Friedman
make a convincing case that Yigal Amir was anything but a ``lone
gunman.'' After the Oslo accords were signed, Uri Elitsur, then an
official in the Yesha Council (the political leadership of the West
Bank and Gaza settlers) and today the head of the Prime Minister's
Bureau, called for the attacks on Rabin to be ``aggressive, on the
border of violent.'' Ariel Sharon, then a member of the opposition
Likud party and today Israel's Foreign Minister, said that the
peace agreement was ``graver than what Petain did,'' and Marshal
Petain, it will be recalled, was initially sentenced to death for
collaborating with the Germans. Rabbi Nachum Rabinovitch, a
formidable figure in the Israeli yeshiva world, compared Rabin's
Government to the Nazis themselves, and was taped explaining why he
thought that settlements that might be evacuated under a peace
treaty (something Rabin never proposed) should line their
perimeters with explosives to deter Israeli soldiers from carrying
out the mission. The examples could fill a book, and in fact have.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-RABIN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: in fact have.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The authors are persuasive in piecing together available
information, much of it previously reported, to portray an
environment that should have left Amir feeling secure that his
plans had not only moral support but also support by religious law.
Yet Karpin and Friedman are unable to point to a specific rabbi by
name as responsible for giving the assassin the all-important
sanction that would have served as a green light to Amir's actually
pulling the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there remains the case of Avishai Raviv, the right-wing
activist and Shin Bet informant, who knew Amir. Conspiracy
theorists have latched on to revelations about Raviv, who
personally set up organizations that attacked Arabs and incited
protests against the Government, as proof that he was an agent
provocateur. What seems more likely is that he was truly a double
agent, providing crucial information to the security services about
the extreme right but also acting on his own as part of that
fringe. Karpin and Friedman seem ready to leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli public isn't. And though the Attorney General
announced in November that he would seek to have Raviv indicted on
a number of charges, many unanswered questions continue to surround
him. For one, how could Shin Bet, which knew of his outside
initiatives, have kept him on its payroll? And how to explain the
early December bombshell, reported in the newspaper Haaretz, that
Raviv revealed to his Shin Bet interrogators, within days of the
assassination, that he had heard Amir say on at least four
occasions that Rabin had to be assassinated; that he had told Amir
he agreed with him; and that he knew of an earlier attempt by Amir,
in January 1995, to kill Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   If Raviv related these things to his handlers at the time they
happened, then the Shin Bet, by not following up on the
information, was fatally negligent. Finally, there is the biggest
question of all: If the Shin Bet knew about all this three years
ago, why did it take until the autumn of 1998 for charges to be
brought against Raviv? It's enough to make a conspiracy theorist
dance a jig.

 HOLY HUNGER

   A Memoir of Desire.

 &UR; PIGGING OUT
</P>
<P>
   BY ALEXANDRA HALL
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ADDICTION is a disease of loneliness, Margaret Bullitt-Jonas
declares. It is a distraction from isolation. ``Holy Hunger'' is
Bullitt-Jonas's memoir of descent into and recovery from her
addiction to overeating.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up with two perfectionist, repressed parents -- an
aggressive, alcoholic father and a passive mother -- the young
Margaret learned her own form of repression: filling herself with
food instead of speaking up for herself. Describing the separate
but equally harsh demands placed on her by her mother (to be
virtuous and noble) and by her father (to overachieve),
Bullitt-Jonas interweaves memories of how food numbed her to those
pressures -- and to the cold relationships that came with them. By
the time she reached adulthood, any negative event, from a romantic
breakup to worry over an unfinished dissertation, could spark a
binge.
</P>
<P>
   Bullitt-Jonas writes that her lowest point came in early
adulthood as a direct result of watching her father being forced to
enter into treatment for alcoholism. ``Healing begins with the end
of illusion, but the fire of truth burns even as it heals. I ran
from its pain. . . . In the months after the intervention, I ate as
I never had before, in binges so frenzied that I was frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the book's most revealing passages center on the binges
themselves: her anxiety while food shopping for a late-night eating
spree (``I disguise my urgent, anxious greed; I keep my face
calm''), her repentance afterward (``Tomorrow, maybe I won't eat
anything to speak of. I'll go for a long run, maybe plan another
diet''). She describes her overwhelming sense of invisibility while
bingeing and her premeal internal debates over whether to eat at
all, for fear a few bites will turn into a binge.
</P>
<P>
   Bullitt-Jonas's first steps toward recovery came in an Anglican
church, at the foot of the cross. Directly afterward, she attended
her first Overeaters Anonymous meeting, where she found
``community, a network of relationships that penetrated the hard
shell of my isolation.'' And though the concept of a ``higher
power'' is a part of spiritual healing at the organization,
Bullitt-Jonas says she also pursued a more traditional deity, using
meditative prayer to focus on her relationship with God whenever
she felt the urge to binge. ``When I stand my ground and refuse to
overeat, I'm saying yes to a life that is lived in relationship,''
she writes. ``I will listen to my body, and I will listen to its
needs. I will live in connection with others, without closing up,
shutting down, or hiding out.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this ``saying yes to life'' that distinguishes ``Holy
Hunger.'' The emphasis on communicative relationships (with humans
and with God) and on individual responsibility seems to have
allowed Bullitt-Jonas not just to forgive her parents but to accept
partial responsibility for her disease. That is a refreshing change
from the stale blame game of so many memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, too much of Bullitt-Jonas's prose is repetitive
and heavy-handed, and overflows with flaccid emotion. Transparent
and flat comparisons -- many of them cliches -- litter the book. At
one point, she acknowledges the mundanity of her story, writing,
``Spiritual recovery in O.A. is characterized by humble stories
like this one: stories that aren't glamorous, spectacular or
heroic.'' Then why try to add glamour and melodrama with
overwrought similes like: ``To resist the internal pressure of
anxiety, you must be fierce. Like a warrior on the battlefield, you
must stand fast''? So much for subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps ``Holy Hunger'' from adding to the pile of memoirs
that are too full of misery to find answers is the author's
relative refusal to find fault. In doing so, she offers an example
of self-examination that is indeed insightful and instructive.
However, though her conclusions may sound mature, Bullitt-Jonas's
endless referrals to the misery of her condition, not to mention
her sentimental and overblown language, undercut that maturity and
therefore ultimately limit how much the book can teach us.

 &UR; GASLIGHT
</P>
<P>
   BY J. HOBERMAN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Readers of the comic strip ``Julius Knipl, Real Estate
Photographer,'' published in The Forward as well as in various
alternative weeklies, recognize its creator, Ben Katchor, to be a
unique walker in the city, one who perambulates in time as well as
space.
</P>
<P>
   Katchor's subject is an imaginary, vanished Manhattan -- an
urban museum of musty, haphazard relics. (His first Knipl
collection was subtitled ``The Pleasures of Urban Decay.'') This
alternative New York is a noirish conglomeration of all-night
drugstores, S.R.O.'s, industrial lofts and wholesale novelty
emporiums. The characteristic Katchor neighborhood is the Cheap
Merchandise District -- streets populated mainly by stolid
middle-aged males in battered fedoras and rendered additionally
melancholy with a delicate gray wash that has intimations of
newsprint, soot and overcast skies.
</P>
<P>
   In his new graphic novel, ``The Jew of New York,'' parts of
which appeared in The Forward in 1992 and 1993, Katchor excavates
an even earlier metropolis -- older, more American. More
elaborately plotted than his Knipl adventures, the story is set in
the New York of 1830. Its inspiration is an obscure incident in
Jewish American history -- the attempt in 1825 by the
journalist-politician Maj. Mordecai Manuel Noah to establish the
city of Ararat as a refuge for the world's Jews on an island in the
Niagara River between the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In Katchor's drawings, reality typically has the quality of a
facade put up to conceal the ruins of some fantastic scheme, and
Noah's bizarre enterprise is more alluded to than represented. A
disgraced kosher slaughterer named Nathan Kishon returns to New
York after a brief stay in Ararat and five years wandering in the
upstate wilderness. His arrival in the city coincides with the New
World Theater's preparations for ``The Jew of New York,'' a
burlesque of Major Noah's utopia written by Prof. Solidus, an
anti-Semitic pamphleteer (who conceals his identity behind a
sinister veil). Katchor introduces a large cast and a half-dozen
subplots while spending nearly a quarter of the narrative on
Kishon's upstate adventures, as recounted over beers in the
Chaldean Gardens to an unscrupulous importer of religious objects,
Mr. Marah. Some concentration is required to follow the skein of
Katchor's plot -- which is rendered all the more tangled by his
talkative characters.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Ararat, Kishon spent most of his time in the
company of an eccentric trapper who made an erotic fetish of Miss
Patella, the (secretly) one-legged diva and former Noah associate
who is to star in ``The Jew of New York.'' Such occult connections
are commonplace. Katchor's novel is set during the Second Great
Awakening, a period of religious enthusiasm in the United States
vividly evoked in Paul E. Johnson and Sean Wilentz's book ``The
Kingdom of Matthias.'' New sects are proliferating. Many speculate
the Indians are the 10 lost tribes of Israel. (Joseph Smith had
only just made public the divine revelation he called the Book of
Mormon.) Kishon and the trapper pass through New Afflatus -- a
commune that regards oxygen as a holy sacrament and, in the search
for a more indigenously American English, has adopted the Hebrew
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the city, however, the main religion is commerce. The
Erie Canal has been open for five years, and New York is booming.
Kishon notes this ``wondrous transformation'' in a series of
panels: ``Fewer pigs are foraging on Broadway. . . . There is a new
mystery to women's clothing. And the Jews' burial ground is now a
sizable necropolis.'' The button merchant Isaac Azarael, awaiting a
lost shipment of abalone shell and pearl oyster, is Katchor's lone
fixed point. The rest of his obsessed cranks and mad businessmen
engage in a series of shifting alliances, promoting elixirs ranging
from Castoreum -- a beaver secretion comparable to Viagra -- to
pickled herring and, most ambitiously, seltzer. A visionary
entrepreneur dreams of carbonating Lake Erie and piping soda water
directly into the city's houses.
</P>
<P>
   More than one character wanders around New York half-naked, as
if in a dream. That many, if not most, of Katchor's principals are
Jews adds another surreal aspect to the mix. Newly arrived from
Jerusalem, a dealer in authentic Holy Land soil ponders a city
where a Hebrew-reciting Indian, Elim-Min-Nopee, appears each Friday
night at Hiram's Museum in a tableau called Welcoming the Sabbath
and -- thanks to the visions of an indigent Jewish scholar -- the
fashionable blow their noses in handkerchiefs of kabbalist design.
Periodically, a character identified only as the Man in an India
Rubber Suit (unofficially representing the Berlin-based Society for
Culture and Science of the Jews) surfaces out of the North River --
as the Hudson was then known -- and into the plot to make his own
ethnographic study of New York's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Set only a few years before the development of photography,
``The Jew of New York'' mixes actual sites, like the American Hotel
on Broadway, with entirely imaginary ones. However understated his
graphic style, Katchor has an extravagantly assemblagist
imagination. At one point he interrupts the narrative simply to
catalogue the contents of Mr. Marah's desk drawer -- ``assorted
leather straps, a Haggadah in the Iroquois language, a Masonic pin,
a half-dozen miniature scrolls of black parchment, a series of
French boudoir prints in a phylactery bag, a wax esrog, a map of
Odessa.'' It is the mission of ``The Jew of New York'' to connect
these dots.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Katchor revels in the strangeness of a self-invented
New World that is also an antiquarian's old one. Nothing is exactly
what it seems. (``He affected the dress and manners of a woodsman,
but was, in fact, no more than an open-air accountant,'' Kishon
explains of his trapper friend.) Gradually accelerating, the
narrative builds to a series of interlocking and disquietingly
comic disasters. Even the most lurid is presented as though behind
glass. The blocky, grimacing figures in Katchor's carefully staged
panels suggest a series of constructed dioramas in some abandoned
municipal historical society.
</P>
<P>
   A word about the physical book itself: The spidery drawings of
Katchor's ``historical romance'' are elegantly bound between two
pieces of embossed but unfinished cardboard and augmented
throughout by an assortment of fake documents, facsimile handbills
and period maps. ``The Jew of New York'' is not only something to
read but to ponder -- an object nearly as strange and striking as
the story it contains.

 &UR; SHOW ME THE MONEY!
</P>
<P>
   BY MARK LEVINSON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THIS volume is an update of Frank Levy's 1987 book ``Dollars and
Dreams.'' In both, Levy, the Daniel Rose Professor of Urban
Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, analyzes
the performance of the American economy since World War II,
explaining that for a quarter-century after the war most Americans
enjoyed steadily rising living standards. This began to change in
1973, when OPEC ended an era of inexpensive energy. In addition,
productivity gains, which had averaged 2.5 percent to 3 percent a
year until 1973, have fallen to little more than 1 percent, for
reasons that remain puzzling to Levy and other experts. Since
rising incomes depend on gains in efficiency, income growth
stagnated and inequality worsened.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``The New Dollars and Dreams'' Levy goes beyond his first
book in two ways. First, he updates his analysis to include the
economic recovery of the 1990's. This is done brilliantly. Second,
he attempts to explain the causes of growing inequality. Here, I
believe, he is less successful.
</P>
<P>
   One of the merits of Levy's book is that he provides a framework
for answering the question: How is the economy doing? According to
some criteria -- inflation, unemployment, the Government deficit
and the stock market -- the economy is in great shape. But Levy has
a different focus.
</P>
<P>
   He shows that despite economic expansion in the 1990's,
inequality has been growing. In 1969 the wealthiest 5 percent of
families had 15.6 percent of the income. In 1996 it had 20.3
percent. Meanwhile the poorest 20 percent of families had 5.6
percent of the income in 1969 and only 4.2 percent in 1996. Levy is
at his best when he looks behind these numbers. If, for example,
you want to know why inequality has such a different feel today
than it did several decades ago (the answer: because the nation's
regions are more alike while differences within regions have grown
larger), or how the changing occupational structure affects white
male workers compared with black female workers, Levy's book is the
place to look.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for growing inequality, according to Levy, is
that since the late 1970's there has been a shift in the economy's
demand for skills, leading to a collapse in opportunities and wages
for low-skilled workers. Levy attributes the shift to technological
changes. Likewise, there is greater demand for workers with
advanced training or education. Thus the main policy suggestion
that emerges from Levy's book is to improve schools, especially in
communities with large numbers of unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   When he is tracking income distribution Levy is meticulous. Each
particular fact is documented. It is therefore strange that he
never presents evidence to support his broader claim that
technological change is occurring at a faster rate now than in the
past. He simply takes it as self-evident. He is not alone in this
view. It is probably the predominant view among economists. But is
it true?
</P>
<P>
   Several economists (most notably David Howell, James Galbraith,
Lawrence Mishel and Jared Bernstein) have presented strong evidence
contradicting the notion that inequality or falling wages can be
explained by technological change. First, throughout most of the
1990's, the real earnings of skilled workers (college graduates)
were falling. The earnings gap between college-educated workers and
workers without a college degree has been getting larger only
because the real wages of the latter are falling faster than those
of the former. Second, if technological change is accelerating in a
way that requires greater skill it should be reflected in growing
productivity. But productivity growth in this period has been
meager. Third, and most important, there is no evidence that the
pace of technological change has accelerated since the late 1970's.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his book Levy hints at another explanation for
growing inequality. There has been, he states, a ``shift of power
away from the average worker and toward a firm's shareholders.
Deregulation, globalization and technology have reduced the typical
employee's bargaining power, and no countervailing institution has
arisen to exert an opposite force.'' Levy's failure to pursue the
implications of this statement -- that the problem is not that
workers lack skills, but that they lack power -- is the main flaw
in an otherwise thoughtful and meticulously researched book.

 STRANGERS TO THE LAW

   Gay People on Trial.

 &UR; COURT V. COURT
</P>
<P>
   BY ROGER PARLOFF
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SOLDIERS in America's gay and lesbian rights movement plot their
operations from treacherous legal terrain. In Bowers v. Hardwick in
1986, a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court upheld a Georgia felony
statute that punished consensual homosexual sodomy with up to 20
years' imprisonment. As a matter of logic, the decision signaled
few restraints on what the heterosexual majority could do to the
homosexual minority at the ballot box. For, as Justice Antonin
Scalia later wrote, ``If it is constitutionally permissible for a
state to make homosexual conduct criminal, surely it is
constitutionally permissible for a state to enact other laws merely
disfavoring homosexual conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, May 1996, when the gay rights movement won a
stunning, if enigmatic, constitutional victory in Romer v. Evans,
the subject of Lisa Keen and Suzanne Goldberg's ``Strangers to the
Law.'' In Romer, the Supreme Court recognized for the first time
that the equal protection clause does bar at least some laws that
disadvantage homosexuals as a class.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the 6-3 majority, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy struck
down a Colorado ballot initiative passed in 1992 as an amendment to
the state constitution. Kennedy found that the amendment (known as
Amendment 2), barring the state or local government from forbidding
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, effectively
disqualified ``a class of persons from the right to seek specific
protection from the law'' and was ``inexplicable by anything but
animus toward the class that it affects.'' ``A state cannot so deem
a class of persons a stranger to its laws,'' he concluded. In an
apoplectic dissent, Scalia protested Kennedy's failure even to
mention Bowers. Since Romer did not overrule Bowers, both
precedents survive today, in great and unexplained tension.
</P>
<P>
   Keen covered the case for two gay newspapers; Goldberg was an
attorney on the legal team that challenged the amendment in court.
Though the authors are hardly neutrals in the Kulturkampf between
homosexuals and the religious right, they display admirable
emotional restraint and objectivity in recounting the case.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to strengthen the analogy between homosexuality and
race, the advocates for the gay cause presented scientific evidence
at trial of the immutability of sexual orientation, its likely
genetic component and the history of unsuccessful attempts to
``cure'' it medically and psychiatrically, through lobotomy,
electroshock and nausea-inducing drugs for ``aversion'' therapy.
They also recounted the history of discrimination homosexuals have
faced, including an executive order President Dwight D. Eisenhower
signed in 1953 that had the effect of firing homosexuals not only
from Federal jobs but from all private companies with Federal
contracts -- that is, from an estimated one-fifth of the nation's
jobs. The lawyers outlined the early history of gay rights
societies in America, which were invariably suppressed. In 1924,
for instance, a gay rights newsletter in Chicago was shut down by
police acting under pornography laws, notwithstanding that the
newsletter's content was entirely political.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the book contains some fascinating material, it will
never become the ``Gideon's Trumpet'' of the gay rights movement.
The authors ultimately succeed too well at muting their own -- or
anyone's -- emotional investment in the case. The key lawyers or
parties in the case never become more than names affixed to a
collection of credentials. The sequential listing of the legal
arguments made by each side, followed by the opposing side's
retorts, are more arid than most nonlawyers will probably be able
to endure. Ironically, the bristling, intemperate, antipodal
opinions that compose the Supreme Court ruling in the case, set out
in an appendix at the end, easily make for the most engaging
reading in the entire volume.

 &UR; MRS. BOHEMIAN
</P>
<P>
   BY MARGOT PETERS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BOHEMIAN, liberated Bloomsbury was tougher on its women than its
men. While young Vanessa and Virginia Stephen relished pronouncing
forbidden words involving the male anatomy, Bloomsbury men hardly
got the same charge from those involving females, many having
little interest in women's privates anyway. Lytton Strachey, Adrian
Stephen and Duncan Grant rewarded Vanessa's penchant for explicit
talk with accounts of their homosexual activities -- not always
entertaining, considering she was in love with Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Another reward of sexual freedom was Virginia's flirtation with
Clive Bell shortly after he and Vanessa married, a betrayal that
put an end to the deep intimacy of the sisters forever. It hardly
mattered that Clive had dozens of affairs, since Vanessa fell in
love with Roger Fry and then with Duncan, reducing her marriage to
a formality. It did matter to her that she had to accept Duncan's
male lovers; in fact, two weeks after her death in 1961, Paul Roche
left his wife to return permanently to him. Little wonder that
reading ``Selected Letters of Vanessa Bell,'' expertly edited by
Regina Marler, author of ``Bloomsbury Pie: The Making of the
Bloomsbury Boom,'' one is as conscious of the pain of a liberated
woman's life as of its pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Though more women might have strengthened their hand, Vanessa
and Virginia resisted female intruders into the circle. Dora
Carrington was tolerated at a distance, Lady Ottoline Morrell
humored (and mercilessly made fun of). But let Clive attempt to
incorporate Mary Hutchinson, or Roger Fry Helen Anrep, or Maynard
Keynes Lydia Lopokova, or Clive (again) Barbara Bagenal -- and
slamming doors echoed from Surrey to Gordon Square. The sisters
jealously guarded the power they possessed as insiders privy to
minutest Bloomsbury gossip.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Vanessa the painter is less obsessed with gossip
than Virginia the novelist: color, light, texture and pattern,
rather than intricate personal relationships, are her stock in
trade. She doesn't dwell on emotions -- ``I'm always being told I
don't understand my own feelings'' -- while Virginia constantly
takes hers over to the window to examine them. But of course
reading Vanessa Bell is not reading Virginia Woolf. Vanessa's
letters have none of Virginia's subtle reasoning, sly innuendo,
skittish rhythms and divine wit. At the same time they have little
of Virginia's snobbery, arch self-consciousness and teasing
cruelty. Never could Vanessa have written, ``Kiss her, most
passionately, in all my private places -- neck -- , and arm, and
eyeball, and tell her -- what new thing is there to tell her? how
fond I am of her husband?'' as Virginia wrote Clive -- not only
because Vanessa preferred men, but because she was innocent of such
subtle bitchery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maternal instincts'' were generally scorned by iconoclastic
Bloomsbury; they are one of Vanessa's strong suits. She bore three
children -- Julian and Quentin with Clive, Angelica with Duncan --
and was, as her letters testify, a more devoted mother than
Bloomsbury could credit. It is endearing when she not only hauls
her children along to St.-Tropez on a painting trip but
requisitions jam and oatmeal for them from home. For all her
bohemianism, Vanessa could be conventional: she remained Mrs. Bell
all her life, called her daughter ``Bell,'' did not tell Angelica
that Duncan was her father until she was 17.
</P>
<P>
   Yet far more than maternity, art was Vanessa's calling. Many of
her letters are about painting, which she discusses, if not with
Roger Fry's erudition, still with passion and perception. Her chief
concern is finding light and landscape; her chief bond with Duncan
became their mutual passion for canvas and brush. Virginia looked
inward, Vanessa outward. If she was not a genius like her sister,
her appealing letters reveal a larger person.

 THE DREAM MISTRESS

<P>

 &UR; DREAM WEAVER
</P>
<P>
   BY DIANA POSTLETHWAITE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JENNY DISKI'S elegantly wrought and unsettling novel ``The Dream
Mistress'' is prefaced by an epigraph from Sigmund Freud: ``Those
dreams best fulfill their function about which one knows nothing
after waking.'' As the book opens, the 46-year-old Mimi awakens
suddenly in a London movie theater to find herself facing both a
blank screen and the abusive rage of her lover, Jack. Like Anne
Sexton's disturbed and disturbing Briar Rose, Mimi is ``a trance
girl'' who ``keeps slipping off'' uncontrollably, at odd times and
places, into seemingly dreamless sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi turns on Jack, walking away from the empty theater and his
obliterating anger, and quickly loses her bearings: ``It was
impossible to grasp where the corridor was finally leading.'' In a
dark alley, she comes upon the ``immobile shadow'' of an
unconscious bag woman: ``Half a face, the part not concealed by
shrouding rags and matted clumps of hair, was visible.'' Instead of
turning away in disgust, Mimi summons help. ``Bella!'' the
ambulance medic exclaims sardonically, christening the nameless
woman toward whom Mimi is inexplicably drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Diski's heroine, it seems, is wandering the landscape of the
Freudian uncanny: that place where we oxymoronically find ourselves
lost and everything is strangely familiar; where (in Freud's own
words) all roads inexorably ``lead back to something long known to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is ``Bella,'' unknown to herself as well as to Mimi? ``A
face without features offered no story, and above all else it was a
story that Bella ached for. She closed her eyes . . . and searched
the darkness for something with a narrative.'' Like a Freudian
analyst, the reader of Diski's novel must connect the dots,
excavate the hidden links that will give Bella a face, a voice --
and a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dream Mistress'' weaves narrative, dream and memory into a
teasing web of resonant interconnections. Seven of the book's
intermingled sections are numbered, four are named and one, without
number or name, is preceded by a blank page. The numbered sections
are conventional chapters following Mimi and Bella, introduced in
Chapter 1. The named sections (``Mask,'' ``Bella'') are, I think,
Mimi's ``unknown'' dreams about two other women, both also called
Bella: the faceless survivor of a bomb blast who lives in a white
room without mirrors (a dream version of Mimi herself?) and a
speechless religious fanatic who abandons her past (a dream version
of the bag lady?).
</P>
<P>
   That numberless, nameless section is the key: it introduces us
to Miriam, a 10-year-old girl cruelly abandoned by her deeply
disturbed mother. This chapter (Mimi's repressed memories?)
directly links the damaged child Miriam to the damaged adult Mimi,
the unremembering narcoleptic drawn to lovers who abandon her. It
also suggests that Bella the bag lady (metaphorically speaking, at
least) is Mimi-Miriam's missing mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cracking the ingenious (and at times, baffling) code of ``The
Dream Mistress'' provides a challenge for any reader who fancies a
psychological game of Clue. But the distinctive power of Diski's
novel lies in the striking way she intermingles a tone of
steel-trap rationality with potent images from the oozy underbelly
of the subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The final chapter of ``The Dream Mistress'' consists of the
first dream Mimi had ever recollected: a woman sits in a tower
above the sea, ``concentrated on a large notebook on the bed, in
which she is writing.'' Readers of Diski's
autobiography-cum-travelogue, ``Skating to Antarctica: A Journey to
the End of the World,'' will recognize in Mimi-Miriam many
similarities with the nonfictional Jenny-Jennifer of that book, an
abandoned daughter who feels most comfortable in blank white
spaces. Jenny-Jennifer, I suggest, also appears in Mimi's final
dream: she is the writing woman. In truth, that woman has been
present throughout the novel, artfully spinning painful memory and
vivid dream into the redemptive gold of story.

 &UR; OH, WHAT AN UGLY WAR
</P>
<P>
   BY THOMAS POWERS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THE sad truth that confronts the serious reader at the end of
1,500 pages of journalism about America's longest war, as beautiful
to hold in these two Library of America volumes as they are painful
to read, is best stated in its simplest form: we lost.
</P>
<P>
   Not all have agreed on this point over the years. The armed
services like to say we quit and left, maybe, but we weren't beaten
in the field, and the reporter Stanley Karnow, represented by two
pieces in Volume 1 and author of a successful 1983 book about the
war, ``Vietnam: A History,'' entitled his first chapter ``The War
That Nobody Won.'' There is a sense in which that is partly true,
perhaps, of all wars, but even those too young to have lived
through the losing of the war either on the ground or on television
won't have much trouble recognizing defeat when they see it in the
11 pieces recounting the collapse of Saigon's Army and Government
in April 1975, and especially in those describing the harrowing
scene at the American Embassy on the night of April 30. That night
and into the following morning, the last Americans clambered aboard
helicopters on the embassy roof and took off for Navy ships in the
South China Sea while thousands of Vietnamese who had been promised
rescue waited in orderly lines in the embassy compound searching
the sky for helicopters that never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Who won the war is not a trivial point. War is painful and
expensive for winners and losers alike. The great achievement of
many of the writers collected in these two volumes -- Gloria
Emerson, Michael Herr, James Sterba, Jonathan Randal, Kevin
Buckley, Jonathan Schell, Lee Lescaze and others who followed the
war out into the boondocks -- was precisely to capture what the war
did to people. Read Specialist 4 Jack P. Smith on the unbelievable
savagery of the battle of the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965, or
John Saar's description of the havoc wreaked in February 1971 by an
accidental bombing of an American unit near Laos with a new type of
ordnance known as a cluster bomb -- one big bomb that separates
into many smaller bombs spewing out ``a blizzard of steel'' over a
wide area. Saar writes, ``If one plane on one run can inflict such
savage hurt, I think, what unimaginable suffering has been
inflicted by thousands of planes on thousands of runs?''
</P>
<P>
   Saar was giving a typically fleeting thought to those on the
other side, but his question goes to the heart of the war as a
whole. What the war did to people physically was horrific to
experience and terrifying to witness. What it did to them
psychologically was often just as crippling and just as permament.
Tot that all up, if there is any meaningful way such things can be
quantified, and call it he price of the war. Forget the money. The
Americans and their North Vietnamese and Vietcong adversaries each
paid a high price in blood for their effort to assert control over
the territory of South Vietnam by force of arms, but the Vietnamese
won -- they got something -- while the Americans lost, and got
nothing. That is why the Vietnam War occupies a special place in
American history and in the American psyche, and why these two
volumes reek of pain, anger, sadness, failure and the despair that
accompanies the recognition that suffering will never be redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   The two volumes of ``Reporting Vietnam'' are very different from
the Library of America's earlier collection of reporting about the
Second World War. Getting shot or blown up in World War II hurt
just as much, the dead were just as dead, but the writing about
that war was infused with a conviction that the suffering was not
stupid and futile. The men who said the sacrifice was important and
would end with success were right. Vietnam, on the other hand,
represents no American triumph of any kind, just a long, slow,
bitter, expensive, inexorable failure ending in sudden, dramatic
and irreversible loss.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing, hidden from the correspondents who reported on
the war as it unfolded but made clear from the work of historians
over the subsequent decades, is that the American leaders directing
the war from Washington had only the frailest confidence in success
themselves, and took each fatal step mainly in the hope of avoiding
defeat in the near term -- that is, before the next election. From
the beginning, which surely came no later than the late 1950's,
they received prescient warnings and advice from those who knew
something about the history of the French experience in what had
been called Indochina. No witness of the French agony assured
Washington that it should expect an easy success where Paris over
eight years of war had failed. Bernard B. Fall, who wrote a classic
book about the crushing French defeat in a set-piece battle at Dien
Bien Phu, ``Hell in a Very Small Place,'' reported a telling remark
by the Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh in The Saturday
Evening Post in November 1962, one of the first pieces reprinted in
``Reporting Vietnam.'' ``I think the Americans greatly
underestimate the determination of the Vietnamese people,'' said
Ho. His Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong, expanded upon this simple
theme. ``Americans do not like long, inconclusive wars -- and this
is going to be a long, inconclusive war,'' he told Fall. ``Thus we
are sure to win in the end.'' As American soldiers often said
later, that was the whole story right there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the whole story is too big even for the two volumes of
``Reporting Vietnam.'' With few exceptions, the 116 pieces and two
entire books -- Daniel Lang's ``Casualties of War'' and Michael
Herr's ``Dispatches'' -- reprinted here were written at the time
and confine themselves to the American experience of the war in
Vietnam. A few pieces (Michael Kinsley's funny and revealing
account of the night some Harvard profs gave hell to Henry
Kissinger; Doris Kearns's essay, based on interviews with Lyndon
Baines Johnson two years after he left the White House, on what was
going through his mind as he took the plunge) touch on the politics
of the war in Washington; others (Francine du Plessix Gray on the
politics of the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in
Vietnam, James A. Michener on the shooting of students at Kent
State University in Ohio by the National Guard in May 1970) tip the
hat to the domestic upheaval commonly referred to as the student
movement, the antiwar movement, ``the movement'' or simply ``the
Sixties.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the war in ``Reporting Vietnam'' is the war of
soldiers in the field, not the one at home, or the one described in
Saigon by American military spokesmen at a daily briefing reporters
called ``the 5 o'clock follies'' -- a war of units, numbers,
objectives, initiatives, programs, targets, enemy body counts given
in exact numbers and American casualties described as ``light'' or
``moderate.'' It's the war that kids had been drafted to fight for
12-month tours of duty (13 months for marines, whose officers, on
the evidence presented here, took pride in doing more and taking
higher casualties than the Army), and the war that newspaper
correspondents visited in the field knowing that they were a
helicopter ride away from comfortable beds and hot meals. Just
about every writer represented in these two volumes seemed to have
a lively apprehension of the moral complexity of reporting on a war
other men had to fight, and very, very few betray any appetite for
geopolitical arguments that Vietnam was the linchpin of defense
against the global creep of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-VIETNAM-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: creep of Communism.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until pretty late in the game the precise outcome, if not the
general drift, of the war was hidden from those who wrote about it
under the pressure of editors and deadlines, so their work is best
judged now as writing -- that is, for the vividness, the human
warmth, the sharpness of eye and the freedom from illusion of the
correspondents' take on what they were seeing and hearing. How does
it hold up as writing all these years later?
</P>
<P>
   The range is wide. At the bottom is a piece by Stewart Alsop, a
decent man who wrote a fine book about the approach of his own
death, ``Stay of Execution,'' but is represented here by a June
1970 Newsweek column on the draft that manages to be both obtuse
and mean. At the very top is the complete text of Michael Herr's
``Dispatches,'' a book that would shine in any company, in which
Herr hunts down the innermost heart of the war with a passion for
the right connection of thinking and feeling that makes you think
of Kierkegaard. For those who tried to sell some theory of the war
Herr has fathomless contempt. Of the way in which he was
simultaneously observing and in the war, Herr, speaking about some
American soldiers, says, ``I stood as close to them as I could
without actually being one of them, and then I stood as far back as
I could without leaving the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   What Herr saw was dark and poisonous in the way of slow poisons.
Some escaped the war any way they could, some embraced it. An
example of the latter took such cold pleasure in combat that he
frightened even the war lovers on a team of long-range patrollers
who stalked the Vietcong in their jungles like scalp hunters in the
old West. '' 'No man, I'm sorry, he's just too crazy for me,' one
of the men in his team said. 'All's you got to do is look in his
eyes, that's the whole . . . story right there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al1 I ever managed,'' Herr comments, ``was one quick look in,
and that was like looking at the floor of an ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that ``Dispatches'' is the book every correspondent
dreamed of writing -- an utterly unsoftened, unillusioned account
of what the war was like, what it was like to travel back and forth
between the inanities of Military Assistance Command Vietnam
headquarters in Saigon and the field where the soldiers counted the
days till departure, what all that sorrow, excitement and fear did
to alter young reporters, many of whom had gentle upbringings and
expensive educations. ``Dispatches'' is the one piece of writing in
``Reporting Vietnam'' that, denied a natural early home in this
collection, probably would have found its way into the Library of
America on its own merits in due time.
</P>
<P>
   But Herr was far from the only reporter to write well about
Vietnam. Having a way with words was the smaller part of it. What
seems to have opened the door to getting it right was putting aside
all care for what the war was about as defined in Washington or
Hanoi, and judging the war instead by what it was and did. Almost
everything collected in ``Reporting Vietnam'' captures some part of
that reality, mostly in the form of short, sharp vignettes or
apposite remarks. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   Ward Just, from his book ``To What End,'' published in 1968:
``The basic and most useful question is not and never has been the
effect of American firepower on the Vietnamese -- it is the effect
on the Americans, who bear responsibility for its use. . . . What
the hell does it take to win this thing? asked a general late one
night. What do we have to do to them?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Arlen, in an article in The New Yorker in September
1967, quoting a Marine corporal at Con Thien: '' 'When we first
came up here, we used to call the enemy Victor Charlie,' he said.
'But now we call him Charles. Mister Charles.' ''
</P>
<P>
   H. D. S. Greenway, quoting a Vietcong leader following the Paris
peace accords in The Washington Post, March 1973: ``Today you see
us in the forest but tomorrow you will see us in the cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Every word from a piece by James Sterba in The New York Times
Magazine, Oct. 18, 1970. The words mostly belong to others --
soldiers describing battles, the transcript of radio conversations,
officers issuing orders, an Army news release, ``an irreverent song
of unknown origin,'' and much else. But in this piece, a kind of
collage, Sterba captures the weird dissonance of a war in which
almost every attempt to communicate conveyed a subversive message
of recoil and despair, as in the following exchange between a
hospital lab technician and a voice that must be Sterba's:
</P>
<P>
   '' 'We use just about all the blood we get. We're in sort of a
slump now -- not much action -- so we got quite a bit on hand.'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'What do you do with it when it gets too old?'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Give it to the gook hospitals.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, of course, we touch at last, if glancingly, what
is almost entirely missing from this book, as it was almost
entirely missing from the thinking of the global strategists in
Washington: the gooks, Mister Charles, the Vietcong, Hanoi, the
enemy. The first rule of war is to know your enemy, but Americans
above a certain Government grade --colonel and its civilian
equivalent, say -- have tended to blame almost everything but the
enemy for the loss of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later,'' Herr writes, ``all of us heard one version
or another of 'My marines are winning this war, and you people are
losing it for us in your papers.' '' What these officers ``with the
teeth shut behind the smiles'' were seeking was some explanation
why the other side didn't give up, but they were looking in the
wrong place. What drove the Vietnamese to fight for 30 years more
or less nonstop -- from 1946 until the last Americans left Saigon
in 1975 -- wasn't faith that negativism at The New York Times would
bail them out in the end, but some much deeper combination of
national character and political organization hidden from most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few to attempt to understand it was Frances
FitzGerald, whose account of the cycles of revolution in Vietnamese
national history, ``Fire in the Lake,'' won a National Book Award
in 1973. Her record of the happy-talk Rotary Club optimism of
Americans trying to pacify the Mekong Delta, published originally
in Vogue in January 1967, is one of only a handful of pieces in
``Reporting Vietnam'' that might be said to be about the other
side. Others print letters and diaries taken from the bodies of
North Vietnamese soldiers (Fox Butterfield, The New York Times
Magazine, February 1973); quote Vietcong prisoners (Bernard B.
Fall, The New Republic, February 1967, in the last piece Fall wrote
before he was killed by a boobytrap near Hue); describe the years
of moral struggle between American P.O.W.'s and their North
Vietnamese jailers (Lieut. Comdr. John S. McCain 3d, U.S. News &AMP;
World Report, May 1973). But it was the American war reporters were
sent to cover, that is what they mainly wrote about, and that is
what we get in ``Reporting Vietnam.'' A great many Americans live
or live again in these pages, but most of the Vietnamese who appear
are trying to please, are running for cover, or are dead.
</P>
<P>
   So coming to understand the character of the men who won the war
in Vietnam, or why we lost, is not the reward for reading these two
volumes. What they deliver instead is a sense of what the war was
like, and why so many people feel about it the way they do.
</P>
<P>
   If you are wondering if the war looks different now, after the
end of the cold war and the passage of so many years, I can only
say, not to me. If anything, the mistakes seem even clearer, the
failure more inevitable. Those reporters were there, and they
weren't making it up. But if you are of a certain age, and if you
are wondering if reading all this stuff, much of it no doubt for
the second time, will bring back what it was like to live through
the first time, the answer is yes -- in a muted way, perhaps, but
yes.

 WHAT REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED

   Mapping the Secrets of the Universe.

 &UR; NEXT!
</P>
<P>
   BY PAUL RAEBURN
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When humanity's ancestors arose out of the primordial soup, they
soon realized there was little to eat except primordial salad --
with, perhaps, an occasional meal of saber-toothed tartare. It fell
to an enterprising young scientist among them to discover fire, and
soon they were dishing up the world's first barbecue. Science had
changed their lives. But what else could science bring them?
Another kind of fire? Not likely. Science was wonderful, but its
work was done. With a well-kept cave, a solid club and, now, a
steady fire, what else did they need?
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong, of course; science had yet to produce the
microwave oven, among other useful things. But on the eve of the
millennium the question about science's future reappears. In his
widely discussed 1996 book, ``The End of Science,'' John Horgan
argued that, indeed, the end is nigh: The big discoveries have all
been made.
</P>
<P>
   Horgan, a veteran science writer, did not argue that we have
answered all the big questions; he is as curious as the next guy
about, say, the nature of human consciousness or life on other
worlds. The problem, he wrote, is that we will probably never find
the answers -- or the solution will be some dispiriting triviality.
Consciousness may one day be revealed to be nothing more than an
accumulation of nerve impulses. As to the question of
extraterrestrials, Horgan says we will never be able to get far
enough out into space to find out. The impossibility of exceeding
the speed of light hangs from us like a ball and chain.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Maddox doesn't buy any of this. Maddox was for almost
23 years editor in chief of the British journal Nature, one of the
world's leading scientific publications. By deciding what to
publish, he was more than an observer of the scientific enterprise
-- he helped to shape it. In ``What Remains to Be Discovered,'' he
attempts to set an agenda for the coming decades, even centuries.
The title was carefully chosen: He discusses what scientists need
to find out, and where they might look. He doesn't try to predict
what they will find. He mischievously avoids mention of Horgan, but
Maddox is clearly out to refute him. ``Science, far from being at
an end, has a long agenda ahead of it,'' Maddox writes. And the
discoveries to come will change our view of the world ``as
radically as it has been changed since the time of Copernicus.''
</P>
<P>
   To show what we don't know, Maddox catalogues what we have
learned. One of the most important discoveries in cosmology, for
example, is Hubble's Law. It says that other galaxies are moving
away from us, and the farther they get the faster they go. Along
with the idea of the Big Bang, it has vastly clarified our
understanding of the universe. Unfortunately, it has also given
rise to contradictions about the age of the universe. A
verification or modification of Hubble's Law is urgently needed and
could come within a decade, Maddox says.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems are likely to be tougher. Two of the towering
intellectual achievements of the 20th century are Einstein's theory
of gravitation and the theory of quantum mechanics. Einstein's
theory deals with the universe and space-time. Quantum mechanics
explains the inner workings of the atom. There ought to be a theory
of quantum gravity -- but nobody has been able to find one. That is
the ``chief present obstacle to a better understanding of the
physical world,'' Maddox says.
</P>
<P>
   In molecular biology research has leaped forward; within a few
years, the entire human genetic code will be available on CD-ROM's.
Yet all researchers will have done, Maddox points out, is name the
parts. They have so far made little progress in figuring out how
genes and the cellular machinery arose or how they work. Given the
complexity of an individual human cell -- crammed with 100,000
genes and thousands of proteins -- researchers will need computer
models to figure out what is going on, Maddox says. Curing cancer
sounds simple by comparison, although that is a likely consequence
of this research.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox also envisions a time when far more will be known about
human evolution. The genomes of apes and humans differ by only a
few percent, but in an unusual way. Humans have 23 pairs of
chromosomes, while great apes have 24. And part of the ``missing''
ape chromosome turns up on one arm of human chromosome 2. How could
natural selection have produced such a radical cut-and-paste job?
Answering such questions will require ``every scrap of information
from paleontology and ecology. . . . But that is how the history of
the human race will be reconstructed in the next century or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddox's optimism extends to brain science and mathematics, and
he is hopeful that we will devise a way to protect ourselves from
any killer meteorite that might be bearing down on earth. Only when
he discusses such problems as AIDS and global warming does he seem
to waver. It is jarring to see him take an unkind swipe at Robert
C. Gallo, the co-discoverer of the AIDS virus: Gallo ``first sought
to diminish the discovery of the virus by Luc Montagnier . . . and
then to give his own comparable work the ring of authenticity.'' He
criticizes Gallo for predicting, in 1984, that an AIDS vaccine was
only a few years away. ``This corrosive incident has reflected
badly not only on those concerned, but on the research community as
a whole,'' he writes. Many researchers agreed with Gallo then, and
Gallo was displaying the kind of hopefulness that Maddox clearly
shares. He also takes a shot at the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, the international agency charged with evaluating
research on global warming. ``I.P.C.C. seems not to have
appreciated that the prospect of climate change is bad news for
most people,'' he writes, and its conclusions would be more
persuasive ``if it were demonstrably open to the possibility that
the bad news may not be true.'' This puzzling remark becomes even
more mystifying when, a few pages later, he agrees with the panel
that under current conditions ``there is no serious doubt that
global warming will occur.''
</P>
<P>
   When he takes the longer view, however, Maddox makes a
persuasive case that science has far to go. Does that mean Horgan
was wrong? It may take a few centuries to find out. Horgan recalls
the early explorers, to whom the swelling seas seemed infinite.
They were wrong; but perhaps the belief sustained them.

   My Life as a Drinker.

 &UR; A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE
</P>
<P>
   BY SARAH PAYNE STUART
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in the 1960s, when, if you were lucky, you could
refuse to go to classes and lie on top of your bed all day smoking
cigarettes and be called the hope of a new generation. We were
revered for being brutally frank before we were old enough to have
anything to be brutally frank about, and when the memoir craze hit
my contemporaries, I stuck to Trollope. Then one day I read Susanna
Kaysen's ``Girl, Interrupted,'' about the writer's experience at a
mental hospital, and found it thoroughly satisfying in a way I
wouldn't have if it had been fiction. The fact that it was true,
that it was a document (it was even illustrated with documents),
infused it with a power not found in the author's earlier novels.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I understood that the new memoirs, the good ones
anyway, weren't about confession, they were about history. And that
behind the writer's words was the thought, ``Well, I may be
invading people's privacy and possibly ruining lives, but at least
what I am saying is important to the larger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The early chapters of Susan Cheever's third memoir, ``Note Found
in a Bottle,'' carry this power because in them she is writing
about her own alcoholism as part of a long heritage -- a heritage
dating as far back as the Pilgrims (who, with beer as their staple
drink, got through their Puritanical life the same way I got
through my 20s -- buzzed). Cheever's own beer-hauling ancestors
came over in 1630, not, as her father used to say, with ``the
trash'' who came over on the Mayflower.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking was more than an accepted vice when Cheever was growing
up in the 1950s, it was a virtue. ``Every evening at 6 o'clock,
right on schedule -- because almost everything in those days was
right on schedule -- the grown-ups in the suburbs would prepare for
what they called their preprandial libation.''
</P>
<P>
   I did not need to look up ``preprandial'' in the dictionary
because I am a WASP. A WASP is allowed to drink all the libations
she wants as long as she does it at the proper time (when ``the sun
is over the yardarm''), and with the proper euphemisms (``May I
freshen that for you?'' or ``Would you care for a little
soupcon?''). Cheever paints this culture with a loving nostalgia,
quite generous for a reformed alcoholic, allowing one to ignore,
for a moment, the noble but less-than-romantic prospect of A.A.
beckoning in the distance, which lent a grim inevitability even to
Caroline Knapp's elegant memoir, ``Drinking: A Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever lyrically evokes the suburban '50s, when the grown-ups
dressed like grown-ups -- the men in ``brimmed felt hats,'' the
women in frocks and high heels -- when the men didn't seem to work
too hard and the women didn't work at all, when, in short, it
looked awfully good to be a grown-up, especially at cocktail hour.
``I loved the paraphernalia of drinking, the slippery ice trays
that I was allowed to refill and the pungent olives, which were my
first childhood treat, and I loved the way the adults got loose and
happy and forgot that I was just a child.'' Cheever looked forward
to the day when she too would join the ranks and ``greet my
homecoming hubby with the ice bucket and the martini shaker.'' The
rest of this memoir recounts a series of alcohol-fueled affairs,
marriages and fresh starts that Cheever embarked upon before
finally relinquishing this dream.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as Cheever ticks off disaster after disaster --
which she attributes to drinking or, occasionally, to the bond of
true love -- she loses her larger context and writes from the more
limited field of her own inner feelings, soggy ground for any
writer: ``A lot of my old feelings started bumping around in the
attic where I had put them. There were crashing sounds as if
someone was going wild up there, and rattling sounds as if someone
was trying to escape into my conscious mind.'' There is a certain
bravery to her brutal frankness; at the same time, she lacks a
basic self-awareness. She confesses to sometimes sleeping with
three men on the same day (while she is married with a child), but
then maintains it couldn't be helped. She recounts how she and one
lover (and later husband) sent a beautifully wrapped box of dog
excrement to William Styron, postmarked from her parents' hometown,
because he gave a friend's book a bad review. We learn how she
taught another married lover (and later husband) how to cheat on
his wife, and in the midst of it all we are told, ``I had three
amazing marriages to three exceptional men.''
</P>
<P>
   Phrases like ``life's great tapestry'' and ``the ebb and flow of
human quirkiness and eccentricity'' crop up. Cheever treads a field
best left untrodden by even the most gifted WASP's (one has only to
glance at Edith Wharton's pornographic forays), the sex scene: ``We
explored each other's bodies inch by inch as if we were discovering
a hidden treasure.'' And most perilous of all, she writes about the
process of writing: ``Most of the time I just typed away without
thinking. Story after story floated to the surface of my mind. The
prose seemed to burn right on the page. I reread each page over and
over again, amazed at how stirring the words seemed to me.'' Or, a
few pages later: ``As I've become a more accomplished writer with
each book, I have relinquished more control over my writing. It's
true I have to sit down and spend the time writing, but beyond
that, what happens doesn't seem to be up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, it's when Cheever takes control, as she does
in the earlier parts of this memoir, that her writing has true
resonance.

   An Adventure.

 &UR; BACK TO IFRIK
</P>
<P>
   BY MICHAEL UPCHURCH
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THE last time Doris Lessing visited the future, the news wasn't
good. In her science fiction quintet, ``Canopus in Argos:
Archives,'' she predicted nuclear holocaust for Planet Earth -- and
a name change too. Once Lessing's star-hopping do-gooders saw the
writing on the wall, they mothballed their euphonious-sounding name
for us, Rohanda, and substituted Shikasta. (That's Canopean for
``the unfortunate one'' or ``the afflicted.'') Place names have
been changed in Lessing's latest novel as well, but not so
drastically as to be unrecognizable. Ifrik, she tells us in an
author's note, is Africa (where Lessing grew up). Cong and Nilus
are the continent's two great rivers, the Congo and the Nile. Even
the bustling metropolis of Bilma can be found in the atlas,
although it appears to be a mere camel stop in the Sahara. Other
places -- Rustam, Chelops -- won't ring any bells.
</P>
<P>
   As for the news, it's still not good. ``Mara and Dann'' is set
thousands of years in the future, during an ice age that has
redrawn the geopolitical map. The book opens briskly enough with
two young children being spirited away from their home in a time of
turmoil. Given new names to protect them from their family's
enemies, they take refuge with an older woman of their tribe, the
Mahondis. Seven-year-old Mara keeps her eyes wide open in this
unsettled world -- her favorite girlhood game is What Did You See?
-- and her curiosity about what she is and where she is proves
persistent. Vague memories of a ``great, airy palace'' where she
and her younger brother once lived provide one clue. So do the 50
gold pieces that her protectress bequeaths her and Dann.
</P>
<P>
   As brother and sister grow up, however, Mara's thirst for
knowledge takes second place to her thirst for water, her hunger
for food and her yearning for safety. Drought is spreading in Ifrik
as seasonal rains become ever more unpredictable, and by the time
the siblings reach their teens, they are forced to join the hordes
of refugees heading north. En route they meet every kind of danger:
beasts of prey, wildfires, slave traders and aspiring rapists. All
the while, they're teased by an intense carnal awareness of each
other, and by suspicions that they've been set apart for a special
destiny. Indeed, both the enemies and the (surprisingly
well-informed) friends they repeatedly encounter suggest that
several parties are monitoring every step of their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mara and Dann'' has the shape of a myth or a folk tale in
which a humble foundling's illustrious origins are eventually
revealed after much hardship. But the book's proportions are those
of an epic; at more than 400 pages, it feels inflated, repetitious
and strangely devoid of surprise. All the necessary elements are
here, often dazzling in their invention, but only intermittently do
they coalesce into tension-filled narrative. Mara herself describes
her ``adventure'' as a ``slog of endurance,'' and those same words,
unfortunately, sometimes apply to the book itself.
</P>
<P>
   It need not have been that way. In a more compressed form --
Lessing's own novel ``The Fifth Child'' offers a possible model --
``Mara and Dann'' could have worked. With greater attention to
character detail, especially that of Dann, it could perhaps have
sustained its length. Dann is clearly meant to be the mercurial
companion who adds a sense of danger and unpredictability to Mara's
journey. But his changes of mood are so mechanically rendered that
they fail to convince, either as legend-in-the-making or
psychological case history. Lacking any interior logic of his own,
he simply feels like a puppet.
</P>
<P>
   MARA, with her eagerness to see and understand the world, works
more to Lessing's purpose, especially in the book's first half,
when her losses yield grim lessons. (``If you're going to feel sad
every time someone dies or goes away,'' she tells herself, ``then
that is all you'll ever do.'') Survival plainly demands a numbing
of feelings -- but in later, safer circumstances, Mara finds it
impossible to describe this brutalizing knowledge or the perils
that gave rise to it. The distance between disaster-struck refugees
and complacent communities that can't see disaster coming is
vividly rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid too are the hand-me-down aspects of Mara's world.
Everywhere she and Dann go, they find themselves stepping through
the detritus of previous civilizations, some unfamiliar, others
more recognizable. (Oral tradition, for example, has preserved
Flaubert's novel as the tale of ``Mam Bova, who hated her husband,
tried to seduce a handsome youth, who rejected her, so she took
poison and died.'') Other special effects include a whole catalogue
of mutated reptiles, along with oversize scorpions and
pincer-wielding beetles; the dispatch with which Lessing consigns
various human victims to these creatures can make certain passages
read like outtakes from ``Starship Troopers.'' A similarly sinister
note is sounded with the appearance of a tribe of look-alikes,
perhaps the result of 21st-century cloning experiments. These
clone-people and other menacing racial varieties convey a chilling
message: no matter what we look like after thousands of years of
evolution, we'll still be fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Such flourishes are fine as far as they go, but they can't make
up for the book's slack pace or lack of involving characters. Like
much of ``Canopus in Argos,'' ``Mara and Dann'' suggests that
Lessing can sometimes be oblivious of her greatest strength as a
writer: her ability to dissect the vacillations and delusions of
20th-century people living in a 20th-century world. Her best books
of the 1990's have been her two volumes of autobiography, in which
Lessing herself emerges as a more engagingly problematic character
than any fictional creation she has come up with lately.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the author of such memorable novels as ``The Golden
Notebook,'' ``The Memoirs of a Survivor'' and ``The Good
Terrorist'' has little left to prove in fiction. Here's hoping she
will soon carry on with her self-portrait -- which, with its
meticulous observation of her African and English worlds and its
withering reading of our century's ideological cant (and her own
susceptibility to it), is the superlative capstone to an
illustrious career.

   WOLF SOLENT
</P>
<P>
   By John Cowper Powys.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage International, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This British novel, recently restored to print, follows a
sensitive young Londoner who returns to an insulated village in his
native Dorset and becomes romantically entwined with two vastly
different women. '' 'Wolf Solent' is a modern prose 'Hamlet,' ''
Percy Hutchison wrote here in 1929. ``The novel is a momentous
piece of work . . . of transcendent interest and great beauty.''

<P>
   GOD &AMP; THE AMERICAN WRITER
</P>
<P>
   By Alfred Kazin.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A renowned critic and impassioned reader, in his final book
before his death last year at the age of 83, argues that classic
American writers from Hawthorne to Frost to Faulkner were driven by
spiritual passion and a yearning for something like faith,
motivations that echo the author's own emotional approach to his
subject. ``He strolls from writer to writer as if through the rooms
of his own house, occasionally shaking hands, by means of an
anecdote, with someone he has known personally,'' Paul Berman wrote
in the Book Review in 1997, adding that when Kazin hits his target
squarely, ``the effect is spectacular and brilliant.''

   FLYING LEAP: STORIES
</P>
<P>
   By Judy Budnitz.
</P>
<P>
   Picador USA, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These tales twist familiar middle-class terrain into strange new
shapes, creating a world where a local baker creates babies from
dough and high school cheerleaders get so charged up at a pep rally
that they set themselves on fire. In 1998 our reviewer, J. D.
Biersdorfer, called this ``a consistently impressive debut.''

<P>
   Memoir of a Platoon Leader in Vietnam
</P>
<P>
   By Nathaniel Tripp.

<P>
   Steerforth, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In his unflinching account of the horrors of war, an ex-
infantry lieutenant also describes his efforts to confront his
guilt and achieve manhood through love and family. ``The writing is
cathartic, an expiation by a middle-aged man haunted by everything
that went wrong in war, in youth, in country,'' David D. Gilmore
wrote here in 1997. In Patches of Fire: A Story of War and
Redemption, by Albert French (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95), a black
novelist tells how his Vietnam experiences became a wellspring he
tapped into after years of struggle in civilian life. ``It is a
classic tale, life-affirming and updated for the modern age,''
Terrence Maitland said here in 1997.

<P>
   THE GUN SELLER
</P>
<P>
   By Hugh Laurie.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Square/Pocket, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this tongue-in-cheek techno-spy thriller is a
dissolute ex-military man who gets sucked into international
intrigue involving money launderers, terrorists, arms dealers and,
of course, beautiful babes. The result is ``a genuinely witty and
sophisticated entertainment,'' Christopher Buckley wrote here in
1997.

<P>
   The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell

   Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16.
</P>
<P>
   The author maintains that the secretive artist known for his
boxes filled with scraps, cutouts and trinkets was primarily an
iconographer and archivist with a basement full of ``source
material,'' including files on movie actresses and 19th-century
ballerinas. In 1997 our reviewer, James R. Mellow, called this a
``thoroughly detailed, highly informative biography.'' Mary
Cassatt: A Life, by Nancy Mowll Mathews (Yale University, $18),
shows how the American-born Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) blended her
love of painting with a desire for financial success. In 1994 in
these pages, Carol Armstrong cited some shortcomings in the
author's straight-ahead approach, but said the book was
``thoroughgoing in its resurrection of the contexts and
conditions'' of the artist's life.

<P>
   WHERE TROUBLE SLEEPS
</P>
<P>
   By Clyde Edgerton.
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this novel is told by a 6-year-old boy who describes
what happens when a stranger in a stolen Buick rolls into sleepy
Listre, N.C., in 1950. The book is ``as much the story of a man who
brings random badness into a good place as it is the story of a
boy's search for his own salvation,'' Mark Childress wrote here in
1997. Rural North Carolina circa 1950 is also the setting for The
Big Ballad Jamboree, by Donald Davidson (University Press of
Mississippi, $17), which follows the fortunes of a country singer
and his sweetheart, who is collecting folk songs for her M.A.
thesis. In 1996 in these pages, George Garrett called this ``a
lighthearted and (in a musical sense) light-fingered'' novel.

</P>
<P>
   By Anthony Bianco.
</P>
<P>
   Times Books/Random House, $20.
</P>
<P>
   This large-scale chronicle tracks the rise and fall of an
Orthodox Jewish family that at its peak in the 1980's amassed
phenomenal wealth through its international property holdings. In
1997 our reviewer, Mordecai Richler, called the book ``a nicely
balanced study.''

   By Thomas Bernhard. Translated by Kenneth J.
</P>
<P>
   Northcott.
</P>
<P>
   University of Chicago, $10.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny stories in this 1978 collection showcase the Austrian
writer's obsessions with hypocrisy, corruption, murder and lunacy
-- and especially his contempt for his homeland. ``Bernhard's rage
against society'' is ``a highly artistic undertaking,'' Peter
Filkins wrote here in 1997.

BOOKS IN BRIEF: FICTION
</HEADLINE>
  (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In modern fiction about the lives of women in middle age, or
fast approaching it, there seems to be one overarching goal -- to
create fresh, quirky types with attention-grabbing jobs and wacky
lives, characters who make at least three crackling quips per page.
Writers will do anything, in other words, to avoid the cliche of
the aging woman who fears she'll either lose -- or never find --
the right man. What's remarkable about Toni Graham's first book,
THE DAIQUIRI GIRLS (University of Massachusetts, $24.95), a
collection of short stories about four 30-something or older women,
is that Graham takes characters who could easily become dreary
stereotypes -- characters left feeling insecure by failed marriages
and failing health, by the realities of aging, by men who treat
them badly -- and fleshes them out beautifully, without doing the
literary equivalent of a rain dance to convince us they're
``interesting.'' Graham doesn't wallow in these women's
vulnerability, but she doesn't apologize for it either. She uses
their loneliness and confusion as backdrops for the action, not as
personality traits. And her prose is entertaining without being
forced: Graham allows a good deal of brainy good humor to flow
naturally. (One woman, who gets a chilly reception from her lover's
progressive, liberal-thinking family because she's a WASP, notes
dryly: ``I saw Phillip's sister Lenore last Sunday night at the
family party. Her smile reminded me of the grille of an old Buick,
except mean.'') Graham's characters aren't spunky role models, cozy
potential best friends or women who run with the wolves. They're
the sort who keep the wolves on their toes. _ STEPHANIE ZACHAREK

   IN THE PRESENCE OF HORSES
</P>
<P>
   By Barbara Dimmick.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleday, $23.95.
</P>
<P>
   All the traditional lingo and lore tucked into Barbara Dimmick's
first novel is evidence of her inspired pursuit of her favorite
animal, the horse. Luckily, she's equally good at depicting human
characters. Natalie Baxter, the protagonist of ``In the Presence of
Horses,'' is a peripatetic trainer whose worldly goods include a
pickup truck, three saddles, a good tea set and a ladylike pistol.
Newly installed as the head of a tiny riding academy in rural
Pennsylvania, the mysteriously shell-shocked Natalie seems
oblivious of everything, including the obsessions of her
increasingly creepy new boss. In fact, the only focus of her
attention is her favorite project, the education of an unruly black
horse called Twister. Natalie's schooling of him builds to a
crucial encounter, but while the ensuing incident begs for nothing
more than a quiet coda, Dimmick takes the novel farther. Without
giving anything away, it's safe to reveal that the action includes
a scene in Natalie's boss's bedroom -- and another in an old
Moravian church on a Christmas Eve paralyzed by snow. _ SALLY

   OUT OF THE DARK
</P>
<P>
   By Patrick Modiano.
</P>
<P>
   Translated by Jordan Stump.
</P>
<P>
   University of Nebraska Press, cloth, $40; paper, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The unnamed narrator of the French novelist Patrick Modiano's
latest book is so successful at escaping his past that he barely
remembers he has one. Only Jacqueline, a fellow drifter whom he met
on the Left Bank in Paris when they were both very young, remains
vivid in his memory. As the action flashes back, the narrator, a
university dropout, is selling used art books for a living.
Jacqueline, who intently plays pinball at the Cafe Dante, is living
in a seedy hotel with a small-time gambler named Gerard. Bent on
going to Majorca, where she and Gerard know an American who writes
detective novels, Jacqueline hatches a plan to steal money from a
gambling friend of Gerard's. Soon enough, a suitcase full of
banknotes is in her possession, and she and the narrator are in
full flight, passing through London on their way south. But they
fall in with a shady crowd, and one night Jacqueline simply
disappears. Fifteen years later, her life and the narrator's
intersect once again when he sees her on the street in Paris and
follows her home. Although Jacqueline pretends not to recognize
him, they spend a few hours together; the next day, he discovers
that she and her husband have suddenly gone to Majorca. Another 15
years pass, and Jacqueline reappears -- but this time the narrator
avoids an encounter. In working through these comings and goings,
Modiano's existential noir novel employs a moody, atmospheric prose
(smoothly translated by Jordan Stump) to create a strange love
story that somehow manages to be both suspenseful and
contemplative. _ JENNY MCPHEE

   FROM A SEALED ROOM
</P>
<P>
   By Rachel Kadish.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam, $25.95.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a fictional landscape informed by the gulf war, the Los
Angeles riots, the Holocaust, the back streets of Brooklyn and
strife-torn Israel hurtles Rachel Kadish's first novel, an intense,
ambitious story that explores the chasms between truth and
falsehood, past and present. The plot circles around three women,
each of whom struggles to admit light into the sealed room of her
inner life. Tami is so accustomed to being ignored by her husband
that it's just a matter of time before her silence curdles into
vitriolic hatred. Her cousin Maya, an American studying at Hebrew
University, moves to a ``religious area'' of Jerusalem and starts
to lose control of her life. At the same time, Maya's neighbor,
Shifra, a Holocaust survivor from Poland, clings ferociously to
memories of the family she has lost -- and develops a curious
devotion to Maya. Most of the action in the book is Maya's, and it
is her future that seems most at stake. But the novel's soul is
found in Shifra. _ MAGGIE GALEHOUSE

   SELENE OF THE SPIRITS
</P>
<P>
   By Melissa Pritchard.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Review Press,
</P>
<P>
   cloth, $22; paper, $14.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Melissa Pritchard's second novel seems like little
more than an episodic portrait of Victorian England with a bit of
romance tucked inside. But as it unfolds, ``Selene of the Spirits''
becomes much more: a commentary on the social landscape of an era
and a rumination on the consequences of forbidden love. The novel
is loosely based on the story of Florence Cook, a popular
spiritualist in late-19th-century London. Her fictional
counterpart, Selene Cook, is a beautiful but poor young woman who
initially seems to want little more than public recognition of her
distinctive psychic gifts. Yet Selene's talents also attract a
wealthy benefactor who supports her family, takes her on trips and
showers her with expensive presents. All this comes to an end when
a member of the London Dialectical Society attends a seance led by
Selene and publicly declares her a fraud. Determined to save both
her reputation and her family, Selene calls on William Herapath, a
respected (and respectably married) scientist, to verify her talent
-- but even as he begins to doubt her, he also begins to fall in
love with her. It is at this point that the novel moves beyond
historical pastiche and becomes a full-blown -- if somewhat
melodramatic -- love story. Selene's happiness unravels quickly and
irrevocably, her only salvation her own unwavering belief in her
spiritual gifts. From these unfortunate circumstances, Selene
emerges as a heroine in the mold of Sarah Woodruff of ``The French
Lieutenant's Woman'': a willful and deceptive woman who nonetheless
earns our sympathy. _ NORA KRUG

   ARCADE
</P>
<P>
   Or, How to Write a Novel.
</P>
<P>
   By Gordon Lish.
</P>
<P>
   Four Walls Eight Windows, $22.
</P>
<P>
   Self-indulgent, full of cute verbal games played to scant point,
stuffed with aimless wandering and empty speculating, with the
barest hint of plot or purpose, ``Arcade'' is nevertheless a
surprisingly funny bit of fiction. Rather than tell us a story,
Gordon Lish has chosen to let readers in on a kind of psychotherapy
session in which he -- or the character who shares his name -- lies
on the couch spewing out disordered memories, fears and obsessions
while we act as his collective shrink. The novel challenges us to
add up its twists and turns because, at first glance anyway, Lish
sure doesn't. Instead, the narrator -- ``I Gordon'' -- wanders
through childhood vacations at a sort of bungalow colony, pausing
every now and then to wonder about such things as flowers, strudel,
the expression ``consider yourself kissed'' and words ending in
-ade. This is all entertaining, but as I Gordon moves on to his
later years, he begins to rant. A novelist now, he berates the
members of his fickle public (``I pour out my heart to you''),
treating them to ridicule, insults and blank pages before revealing
that the whole performance has been something of a private joke
played on us, his therapist/readers: ``Everything in this book, it
is all of it made up.'' For Lish's many acolytes, ``Arcade'' will
carry a lot of weight; for his equally numerous detractors, it will
be weightless. The rest of us can just read and enjoy it. _ JAMES

   ``How . . . could the much-studied Impressionist revolution . .
. espouse a genre which . . . might be considered the least
amenable to any divergence from accepted practice?'' asks Colin B.
Bailey, the chief curator of the National Gallery of Canada, at the
beginning of RENOIR'S PORTRAITS: Impressions of an Age (Yale
University/National Gallery of Canada, $30). Financial necessity is
the primary answer: commissioned portraits paid the rent. Moreover,
we learn that Renoir was the only Impressionist to achieve
financial security through the practice of portraiture. ``Yet, just
as the Impressionists catered, at one level, to the conventional
requirements for bourgeois representation -- namely, portrait
painting -- so did they also expand and redefine the genre,''
Bailey writes. During the years of his greatest demand as a
portraitist, between 1878 and 1883, Renoir painted his most
ambitious compositions of contemporary life, including ``Luncheon
of the Boating Party,'' ``Ball at the Moulin de la Galette,''
``Dance in the City'' and ``Dance in the Country.'' Anne Distel,
the chief conservator at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, contributes a
cogent essay about the Impressionist patron and collector Leon
Clapisson. But it is the art historian Linda Nochlin who offers the
sharpest and most perceptive essay in the book, giving the social
context for Impressionist portraiture and offering a fascinating
explication of Degas's ``Place de la Concorde,'' among other
paintings. Nochlin's essay, which scarcely mentions Renoir, is
accompanied by reproductions of portraits by fellow Impressionists
like Manet, Degas and Cassatt that invite comparison with Renoir
and present an odd disjunction; some readers may feel that the
detailed, psychologically oriented and less romanticized portraits
by these painters are more successful than Renoir's. Nevertheless,
Renoir's portraits, Bailey believes, are distinguished by ``the
extraordinary light with which they are imbued.'' _ ROBIN

   Memoir of a Young Girl and Her Ballet Master.

<P>
   Harper Flamingo, $23.

<P>
   Mothers, don't let your daughters grow up to be dancers. Unless
you want them -- like Evan Zimroth -- to participate in a ``gavotte
of power and submission'' with a Svengali-like expatriate Russian
ballet master. From the time he chose her for advanced training at
the age of 12 (``Do you want to be a great dancer?'') until he
expelled her from his ballet school three years later for
insubordination, the teacher (whom Zimroth identifies only as F.)
challenged, taught, manipulated, occasionally struck and ultimately
made a dancer of an innocent, determined and remarkably
self-centered little girl. Now a poet and novelist but still
seemingly carrying a torch for her impossible ideal of a ``revered
teacher,'' Zimroth writes about training in a ``Darwinian'' world
where, she says, ``normal'' values are reversed. Brutality and
sadism are teaching tools, dancers starve themselves into thinness,
rehearsal studio mirrors give back only images of imperfection,
superstition is rampant and nondancers are the ``real'' people. All
this pain is for the ``focus of all ballet training,'' for ``what
is seen on stage -- the human body in all its breathtaking
loveliness.'' It's enough to make you think of Narcissus as a guy
who didn't much care how he looked. _ MARY GRACE BUTLER

   BAD MAN BLUES
</P>
<P>
   A Portable George Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Methodist University, $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   For a writer less formidably gifted than George Garrett, the act
of publishing an assortment of seemingly unrelated recent stories,
autobiographical fragments and essays might seem mere hubris. But
Garrett, who has published more than 25 volumes of fiction, essays,
poetry and plays, is a mesmerizing storyteller. His humane voice,
sly humor and persistent fascination with the origins of extreme,
even self-destructive, behavior serve to weave the disparate pieces
in ``Bad Man Blues'' into a lively and entertaining whole.
Garrett's accounts from his 40 years as a peripatetic English
professor nicely skewer academic foibles (and offer startling
glimpses of luminaries like Bernard Malamud). And a concluding
section of personal essays -- on his resilient family, on his
admiration for Joe Louis, on the brother he never had -- offer more
somber but equally vivid meditations on the ways in which we strive
to come to grips with the world. For Garrett that striving has
usually focused on the act of creation, and in the essay ``Going to
See the Elephant'' he offers a ringing defense of the necessity of
storytellers, who ``speak for and of the wounds and sorrows of . .
. our people. We act as spiritual treasurers for their stories.''
``Bad Man Blues'' offers further evidence of just how well, and
with what skill and imagination, Garrett has shouldered that
responsibility. _ RICHARD E. NICHOLLS

   ``For better or for worse'' is the undoing of most couples. For
Shirlee Taylor Haizlip and Harold C. Haizlip, however, it is the
whole point. Their marriage is enviable, and luckily for us they
have chosen to write about it in their richly detailed memoir, ``In
the Garden of Our Dreams.'' It begins with their blind date in
1957, when Shirlee was at Wellesley College and Harold was a
graduate student at Harvard. They tell the story in alternating
accounts, their voices as different as their backgrounds. Shirlee
was brought up in an upper-middle-class black home in Ansonia,
Conn., a beloved and much-indulged child of a Baptist pastor and
his beautiful and adored wife; Harold, also black, grew up in much
less gilded circumstances in Washington with his mother; his father
died when the boy was 10. ``My goal after high school,'' says
Shirlee, whose tone is more silken than her straightforward
husband's, was ``continuing the family role of 'uplifting the
race.''' This the couple did, together and separately, in
education, community fund-raising and the arts. Though by any
standard their lives are charmed -- filled with love, two talented
daughters and professional success -- the Haizlips have always been
a ``happily ever after,'' but in a separate world. ``Freedom was an
illusion,'' Harold writes. ``We were not free. No black people we
knew were.'' _ ANDREA HIGBIE

   THE BIRTH OF EMPIRE
</P>
<P>
   DeWitt Clinton and the American Experience, 1769-1828.
</P>
<P>
   By Evan Cornog.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University, $35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most admiring biographers of DeWitt Clinton have
conceded that he was a difficult man to be around,'' Evan Cornog
writes of the man he credits with the two transforming developments
in the early-19th-century American Republic: the spoils system in
politics and the construction of the Erie Canal. Haughty and
unbending, Clinton was born at a time when three families -- the
Schuylers, Clintons and Livingstons -- presided over New York state
politics. At the age of 14, he watched his father and uncle ride
with Washington in the New York victory parade of 1783. At 17, with
both houses of Congress looking on, he delivered (in Latin) the
commencement address for the first graduating class of Columbia
College. After serving as Senator, Mayor and Governor and very
nearly beating James Madison for the Presidency in 1812, Clinton
``could scarcely enter a public room in New York or Albany without
seeing someone he had offended,'' Cornog writes. By 1815, he had
been stripped of all powers and offices except an unsalaried seat
on the state canal commission -- which, with untiring
resourcefulness and vision, and what many saw as characteristic
opportunism, he used to push through a plan to build the Erie Canal
-- and reposition himself in the Governor's seat. ``The Birth of
Empire'' shows how rapidly the canal opened the old Northwest to
migration, established New York as the nation's metropolis and
replaced the power of ``distinguished individuals'' like Clinton
with the democratic enthusiasms of the Age of Jackson. But Clinton,
who emulated the Roman republican ideal of civilis -- the idea that
the virtuous citizen is useful -- may, Cornog writes, ``have
understood better than most the harsh lesson of imperial glory --
that it contained within its success the seeds of its ultimate
failure.'' _ DAVID WALTON

ordinary civil or criminal trial. (Dart, Cox News Service).

   CONGRESS-AGENDA _ WASHINGTON _ Undeterred by the distractions of
the impeachment process, each party in the new Congress has
signaled its priorities for the next two years. Democratic and
Republican leaders alike put four concerns _ Social Security,
Medicare, education and health care for children and working-age
adults _ on their must-do lists, though hard compromises would be
needed in each area to pass a law. In any case, members and
political scientists alike expect any progress to be slowed by the
Senate's impeachment duties, House Speaker Dennis Hastert's
inexperience, deep partisan rancor in the House, and uncertainty in
Congress about whether it will be dealing with President Clinton or
President Gore when the bills introduced this winter reach the
final stages of the legislative machinery next fall. (Mollison, Cox

Chamber of Commerce chief Peter Reichard as finance director.

or bilking Chinese immigrants out of $300,000 they had saved to
open a U.S. restaurant. How does Qureshi make his money? His
company, Escue Management, is no longer listed as an active firm in
state records. According to the suits, Qureshi _ a native of
Pakistan who has Swedish citizenship _ is exceptionally skilled at
persuading people to lend him large amounts of money that he later
fails to pay back. In the past, Qureshi has said people are simply
getting upset because they invested in deals that went bad.

another run at merging the Public Utility Commission into the Texas
Railroad Commission, creating one agency to regulate the state's
electric, natural gas and local telephone utilities, as well as the
oil production industry. Rep. Bill Siebert (R-San Antonio) hopes
he'll have more luck than did state Sen. David Cain (D-Dallas), who
didn't get far in the last legislative session with the same
proposal. (Hight, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

<P>
   LOW-BUILDING-SUPPLIES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ With new home
construction at a record high, builders such as Bailey are having
trouble getting the materials they need to build houses. The
nationwide demand for drywall, insulation, concrete and man-made
stone have outstripped the supply. As a result, builders and others
say, anyone building a home may want to brace themselves for delays
_ and higher prices. It's a situation that shows few signs of
letting up. (Breyer, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

   LOTTERY-PR _ AUSTIN, Texas _ State lottery officials eager to
enlist their most satisfied customers in the war on declining
ticket sales are pitching this message: Talking to reporters is

enticing winners to hold news conferences that garner the kind of

STEPHEN F. AUSTIN LETTERS TO BE AUCTIONED
</HEADLINE>
 (Repeating for all needing) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A collection of Stephen F. Austin's letters that offer a window
into Texas history and detail Austin's changing attitudes toward
Mexico and Texas independence will be offered for sale at a New
York antique show this month. The asking price is $1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only collection I've had with this historical
importance,'' said Kenneth Rendell, a Boston-based rare document
dealer who owns the letters. ``These letters show the story of the
fight for Texas independence all along the way. You see the whole
thought process for what is the founding of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 letters, the majority written from Austin's home at
San Felipe de Austin, west of present-day Houston. Austin, an early
colony leader known as the ``Father of Texas,'' headed the
colonists' first convention and carried their demands to the
Mexican president, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, in 1833.
</P>
<P>
   Other letters were sent from Mexico; Louisville, Ky.; and New
York. All but two were written to Austin's close friend David G.
Burnet, who became the first president of the Republic of Texas.
The others were written by Austin in his role as commander in chief
of the Texas army at the beginning of the revolution. One is to
James Bowie, who would become a hero at the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   The letters from Austin show that his first wish was for Texas
to become an independent state within Mexico. But he eventually
came to believe that independent-nation status was the only course.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 16, 1830, after nine years of living under Mexican rule,
Austin wrote to Burnet that he doubted that Mexico would ever sell
Texas to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it to be the settled policy of this government to
make Texas a state as soon as possible,'' Austin wrote of Mexico's
views, ``and it will be the best, the brightest star in the Mexican
constellation.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin wrote often of his desire to make Texas a separate and
independent state within Mexico, but finally, after years of
turmoil and civil war in Mexico, he altered his views.
</P>
<P>
   From San Felipe, he wrote to Burnet on Oct. 5, 1835, ``I hope
you will enter ardently and warmly in the cause _ now is the time _
no more doubts _ no submission _ I hope to see Texas forever free
from Mexican domination of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell calls the letters the ``most remarkable group of
manuscripts relating to the foundation of the Republic of Texas
ever to be offered for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   But from a historian's standpoint, they might be less enticing,
said Stephen F. Hardin, a Texas historian at Victoria College and
the author of ``Texian Iliad,'' a military history of the Texas
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really two things on the block,'' Hardin said. ``The
old paper is one. The old paper is valuable to people who want to
own it, and there are a lot of people who do. And there is the
information on the paper. That is what is of interest to people
like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardin said the collection is less valuable to historians if the
information contained in the letters is already known. Most of the
letters were published by Trinity University Press in a 1981 book
titled ``The Fugitive Papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Heaston, a rare book and manuscript dealer in Austin,
said collectors would be pleased to own the kind of history
displayed in the Austin letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could ask for more outstanding content,'' he
said. ``Just because they have been published doesn't diminish
them. Stephen F. Austin is the premier individual in Texas history,
and a collector would want his works. I would think an institution
would also.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters will go on sale Jan. 15 at the 45th Annual Winter
Antiques Show in New York City. They are on display at Rendell's
New York City gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said his company acquired the letters from ``an
assiduous collector of Texana.'' He said he could not name the
collector because it would betray a confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people who appear to have a lot of money
suddenly need a lot of money and they don't want other people to
know,'' Rendell said. ``Many times these collectibles remain in a
family until they hit a generation where the financial value
exceeds the sentimental value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tyler, director of the Texas State Historical Association in
Austin, said he had no idea what the collection will bring, but he
said there are ``people out there interested in Texas material who
have a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the controversial Alamo diary of Mexican officer Lt.
Col. Jose Enrique de la Pena was sold for $350,000 to Tom Hicks,
who owns the Texas Rangers baseball club and the Dallas Stars
hockey team, and his business partner Charles Tate. The diary was
given to the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler said the Winter Antiques Show, where the letters will be
offered for sale, is recognized as a big event. ``It is a
tradition,'' he said. ``People come with their pocketbooks open.
The dealers put on a good show; it's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The collector market is always fluctuating, he said. ``There are
some new people involved in it now. The field goes up and down. A
few collectors dominate the market, then they get tired of maps or
letters and decide to collect something else. The field seems to be
very active right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hardin, Tyler said his interest would be more in the
information in the letters, rather than in their value as
collectibles. Austin letters, he said, are not that rare
individually, but a collection of this size is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Austin letters are a momentous event in American
history,'' Rendell stressed. ``You're reading it as it happened. I
loved the drawing of the first flag.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated March 4, 1836, Austin described for Burnet the
flag he envisioned for the new republic. It was not the Lone Star
emblem that would eventually fly.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1836, while in New York to gather support for Texas
within the United States, Austin finally received word of Col.
Bowie and Col. William B. Travis, commanders at the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, Santa Anna's army had ended its 13-day siege by
storming the mission and killing all 169 defenders. But on April
21, a band of Texans led by Gen. Sam Houston won the republic's
freedom at the battle of San Jacinto.
</P>
<P>
   In another letter to Burnet, Austin wrote: ``Travis, brave
Travis &AMP; his historic band _ but my feeling will not permit me to
dwell. Farewell, heaven help &AMP; defend Texas &AMP; give you all
wisdom.''

`A CIVIL ACTION' IS A GOOD, BUT PREDICTABLE THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I were in the legal racket, I might think about suing the
makers of ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   Few mainstream pictures have offered such a devastatingly
negative portrayal of the practice of law in modern America _ and
this is a movie where the morally dubious main character turns into
a hero with a worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a 1980s lawsuit over water pollution that
may have caused the deaths of eight children in a small
Massachusetts town. An arrogant Boston lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann
(John Travolta), isn't interested in the issue until he learns that
deep-pockets corporations are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Though scorned by snotty colleagues as an ``ambulance chaser,''
Schlichtmann nonetheless becomes so consumed by the case that he
ruins himself financially.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds very Hollywood _ cocky legal ace hears the celestial
music and, against huge odds, starts fighting the good fight. But
the context is different.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the working-class people of Woburn, Mass., for
whom Schlichtmann is ostensibly battling, aren't all victims.
What's more, the legal profession is a rigid hierarchy where class
and money are the main issues, the corporations are ethical
pragmatists (to be polite about it) and the court system all but
guarantees that truth has very little to do with deciding a case.
</P>
<P>
   These are all good, liberal, populist _ though not very
startling _ observations (one of the film's producers is Robert
Redford). And the film has the moxie to name the corporations
involved in the actual case (W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. and Beatrice Foods).
</P>
<P>
   But this is a big-time picture with a major star in the lead,
and we're never allowed to forget it. The film begins by making fun
of the Porsche-driving Schlichtmann _ he's been named one of
Boston's 10 most eligible bachelors _ and after a rather
unbelievable jolt of conscience, he hocks his firm and beggars his
partners to take up the noble cause of the victims of Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Steven Zaillian (``Searching for Bobby
Fischer'') does a pretty decent job of working these contradictory
modes: the ``issues'' picture about a flawed legal system and the
traditional ``hero'' movie. But that doesn't mean he's solved the
problem. The film never really takes an unexpected turn; Zaillian
uses a no-risk style of story-telling, and you never feel fully
drawn in or compelled by the material.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that the Travolta character is completely
one-dimensional. Even after he decides to take the case,
Schlichtmann is depicted as fallible, both as a lawyer and as a
human being. Once he's decided that the cause is just, he has
little sense of what he's doing to his colleagues, and he also
makes professional errors. And can he really be expected to beat a
system that's portrayed as a monstrous machine consuming and
excreting vast amounts of money?
</P>
<P>
   If justice is done in the courtrooms we observe here, it's
sheerly incidental, and the picture is clearly designed to tap into
popular resentment of the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   Since Travolta's much-heralded comeback, I've enjoyed some of
his comic efforts, and even his crazy action villain in ``Broken
Arrow.'' While his work here is fine, considered as a ``star''
turn, I have to wonder if another actor might have made
Schlichtmann's transformation more convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Where the film excels is when the camera turns away from
Travolta. Robert Duvall plays a sly, Southern lawyer for one of the
corporations, and it's a highly enjoyable performance: a good ol'
boy front covering up a razor-sharp intellect.
</P>
<P>
   There's fine comic work from William H. Macy as the accountant
who comes up with ever more desperate ways for Schlichtmann's firm
to keep subsidizing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Quinlan stands out as the broken-hearted mother who
first brings Schlichtmann to Woburn, and John Lithgow is memorable
as the judge who falls victim to the Duvall character's cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian is a good director, but here he's trying to squeeze
himself into a more conventional framework than he's comfortable
with. I hope his next film gives him the chance to follow his muse.

'99 CONVERTIBLE COUPE AS A 190-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, January 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who cares if it snows? We're about to ring out the final days of
1998 in a new 1999 Mustang convertible.
</P>
<P>
   It's First Night: No, not New Year's Eve. This first night is
five days before the end of the year. It's the first trip in this
Ford, the driver getting into the unfamiliar vehicle at 2 a.m.
after putting to bed a Sports section containing the sad details of
the Patriots' crushing loss to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The V6 starts with a nice growl, but, to a tired leg, the clutch
feels stiff at first push (maybe I should have been in the gym
doing those clutch exercises that VW is featuring in its ads). Off
we go onto well-soaked roads with a little early-morning mist
guaranteeing to keep them good and greasy.
</P>
<P>
   It's immediately apparent that this is the little brother (or
sister) to the Mustang GTs and Cobras. The 3.8-liter V6 puts out
190 horsepower, plenty to merge and pass and give you a nice power
curve through second and third gears, but none of the neck-snapping
giddy-up of the V8s. And the clutch turns out to be not too stiff
at all. It's just right . . . and coupled to a gearbox that clicks
nicely into all five speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this first trip is about to become one to remember as I
play John White-for-a-night.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the ``long way home'' brings this Mustang along the
network of Fellsway roads north of Boston where the traction
control light starts flashing with every touch of the gas pedal and
the handling becomes squirrelly. ``Can't this thing grip the
road?'' I wonder. ``Is rear-wheel drive the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope, just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the air temperature is mild, it turns out we're
dealing with the beginnings of icy roads, and the traction control
system (a $230 option) is kicking in _ cutting back on the power
and teaming with the ABS system ($500) to cut torque to the
spinning wheel and restore even traction. Given the conditions, the
system does a fine job, and we climb the final steep hills to home
with no problem.
</P>
<P>
   This is a likable car, and some of the things that aren't so
likable can be attributed to driving a summer car in winter. The
basic Mustang convertible lists for $21,070 _ plus the irritating
$525 destination charge, aforementioned ABS and traction control
plus cruise control ($550) for a $22,875 total.
</P>
<P>
   The full instrumentation is striking at night, red on a greenish
background. The one gauge worth watching this night _ the heat
gauge _ takes about a half-mile longer to reach operating
temperature (and get the heater cranking) than I've become
accustomed to in 30 winters of making this nocturnal drive in
everything from a '54 Ford (also a convertible) to my present '97
Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Another winter/summer contradiction of the Mustang is the
narrowness of the front seats. (You want to know about the back
seats? Better your back than mine.) This driver is hardly a giant,
but, wearing a winter coat means the front seat wraps me too
tightly for comfort. Shed the jacket and it's fine . . . barely. A
summer night with the top down is just a dream this week.
</P>
<P>
   Heading out to find gas the next morning brings the realization
that this silver and black car gets second glances, including one
from a passing patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space is lean consisting of a small glovebox, center
box, and bins on the doors. A standard CD player fills what would
otherwise be a dashboard shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The sound is worth the lack of space. Even a confirmed Mr. AM
Radio quickly learns there's much to like with the CD system,
finding Alabama's No. 1 hits soothing company as the early
afternoon traffic rolls slowly along the Lower Deck back to another
day of work. The rear speakers are right behind the doors because,
this being a convertible, there's no rear deck for them.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in traffic gives me time to check out some of the little
things. I immediately wonder why Ford settles for such a pedestrian
shift knob (it's not even particularly comfortable) as finial
adornment for a five-speed that's one of the car's big attractions.
</P>
<P>
   It's also time to admire Ford's cleverness.
</P>
<P>
   With the soft top, there's no dome light; instead, a pair of
built-in lights (with separate switches) in the rearview mirror
make it easy to read the owner's manual in the Globe parking lot in
the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home that second night, it's a little drier, and the
Mustang nicely handles the Mass. Highway Department's Expressway
North chicane _ that nasty right-left turn combo approaching the
Mass. Turnpike exit and South Station tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling down the window a tad (remember, it's winter), I have a
sound idea. There's an absence of the exhaust tone that makes the
big brother Mustangs so unmistakable. Of course, I admit to being a
fan of the original Mustang GT's tuned exhausts.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage on this 300-mile winter tour averaged 21.3 miles
per gallon in mostly city driving, much of it in heavy traffic and
rain, with cold starts _ all the ingredients for hitting the EPA's
minimum number. Or maybe not even that.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Mrs. G if she'd like to celebrate First Night by parking
along the Charles with the top down and watching the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   She in turn asked if we could test drive the car on the Fourth
of July instead.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a plan to me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A word or two from Mrs. G.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. G fell in love with the Mustang immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a woman's car. The size is perfect,'' said she.
</P>
<P>
   And, hardly surprising, she had the opposite view of the seats
that I had found uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the seats. They're just right,'' she said, a thought
seconded by number one daughter on her first ride in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback in Mrs. G's eyes was the five-speed
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad it didn't have an automatic. I'd love to drive it if
it did. I really like this car all the way back to the
taillights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the doors aren't too heavy. A lot of times you get in a
two-door car and the doors are real hard to swing. These are nice
and light.''

   `Cold War' Series on CNN
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, CNN will begin broadcasting the second half of
its 24-part documentary series ``Cold War.'' The first half has
already brought several angry critiques from historians and
commentators over how it interprets the Cold War and how it assigns
blame.
</P>
<P>
   The Times asked three historians with different perspectives to
assess the series:
</P>
<P>
   TV-COLDWAR-RADOSH (Undated) _ An appraisal of the CNN ``Cold
War'' series by Ronald Radosh, co-author of ``The Amerasia Spy
Case: Prelude to McCarthyism'' and ``The Rosenberg File,'' a Senior
Research Associate at the Center for Communitarian Policy Studies,
George Washington University. While he says that overall the series
does a good job of portraying the evils of the Soviet system
compared with the democratic Western allies, he argues that it too
often equates the Soviet Union's moral failings with those of the
United States. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   TV-COLDWAR-GARDNER (Undated) _ An appraisal of the CNN ``Cold
War'' series by Lloyd Gardner, who teaches history at Rutgers
University and is the author most recently of ``Pay Any Price:
Lyndon Johnson and the Wars for Vietnam'' (Ivan C. Dee, 1995). He
questions just how inevitable the Cold War was as well as the
series' European focus. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   TV-COLDWAR-GADDIS (Undated) _ An appraisal of the CNN ``Cold
War'' series by John Lewis Gaddis, who teaches history at Yale
University and is most recently the author of ``We Now Know:
Rethinking Cold War History'' (Oxford University Press, 1997). He
was a consultant to CNN on the three-year project and gives an
insider's account of putting together a documentary of this scope,
arguing that the series explores the era's moral ambiguities
without asserting any moral equivalency. (1000 words)

'99 CONVERTIBLE COUPE AS A 190-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, January 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who cares if it snows? We're about to ring out the final days of
1998 in a new 1999 Mustang convertible.
</P>
<P>
   It's First Night: No, not New Year's Eve. This first night is
five days before the end of the year. It's the first trip in this
Ford, the driver getting into the unfamiliar vehicle at 2 a.m.
after putting to bed a Sports section containing the sad details of
the Patriots' crushing loss to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The V6 starts with a nice growl, but, to a tired leg, the clutch
feels stiff at first push (maybe I should have been in the gym
doing those clutch exercises that VW is featuring in its ads). Off
we go onto well-soaked roads with a little early-morning mist
guaranteeing to keep them good and greasy.
</P>
<P>
   It's immediately apparent that this is the little brother (or
sister) to the Mustang GTs and Cobras. The 3.8-liter V6 puts out
190 horsepower, plenty to merge and pass and give you a nice power
curve through second and third gears, but none of the neck-snapping
giddy-up of the V8s. And the clutch turns out to be not too stiff
at all. It's just right . . . and coupled to a gearbox that clicks
nicely into all five speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this first trip is about to become one to remember as I
play John White-for-a-night.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the ``long way home'' brings this Mustang along the
network of Fellsway roads north of Boston where the traction
control light starts flashing with every touch of the gas pedal and
the handling becomes squirrelly. ``Can't this thing grip the
road?'' I wonder. ``Is rear-wheel drive the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope, just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the air temperature is mild, it turns out we're
dealing with the beginnings of icy roads, and the traction control
system (a $230 option) is kicking in _ cutting back on the power
and teaming with the ABS system ($500) to cut torque to the
spinning wheel and restore even traction. Given the conditions, the
system does a fine job, and we climb the final steep hills to home
with no problem.
</P>
<P>
   This is a likable car, and some of the things that aren't so
likable can be attributed to driving a summer car in winter. The
basic Mustang convertible lists for $21,070 _ plus the irritating
$525 destination charge, aforementioned ABS and traction control
plus cruise control ($550) for a $22,875 total.
</P>
<P>
   The full instrumentation is striking at night, red on a greenish
background. The one gauge worth watching this night _ the heat
gauge _ takes about a half-mile longer to reach operating
temperature (and get the heater cranking) than I've become
accustomed to in 30 winters of making this nocturnal drive in
everything from a '54 Ford (also a convertible) to my present '97
Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Another winter/summer contradiction of the Mustang is the
narrowness of the front seats. (You want to know about the back
seats? Better your back than mine.) This driver is hardly a giant,
but, wearing a winter coat means the front seat wraps me too
tightly for comfort. Shed the jacket and it's fine . . . barely. A
summer night with the top down is just a dream this week.
</P>
<P>
   Heading out to find gas the next morning brings the realization
that this silver and black car gets second glances, including one
from a passing patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Storage space is lean consisting of a small glovebox, center
box, and bins on the doors. A standard CD player fills what would
otherwise be a dashboard shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The sound is worth the lack of space. Even a confirmed Mr. AM
Radio quickly learns there's much to like with the CD system,
finding Alabama's No. 1 hits soothing company as the early
afternoon traffic rolls slowly along the Lower Deck back to another
day of work. The rear speakers are right behind the doors because,
this being a convertible, there's no rear deck for them.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in traffic gives me time to check out some of the little
things. I immediately wonder why Ford settles for such a pedestrian
shift knob (it's not even particularly comfortable) as finial
adornment for a five-speed that's one of the car's big attractions.
</P>
<P>
   It's also time to admire Ford's cleverness.
</P>
<P>
   With the soft top, there's no dome light; instead, a pair of
built-in lights (with separate switches) in the rearview mirror
make it easy to read the owner's manual in the Globe parking lot in
the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home that second night, it's a little drier, and the
Mustang nicely handles the Mass. Highway Department's Expressway
North chicane _ that nasty right-left turn combo approaching the
Mass. Turnpike exit and South Station tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling down the window a tad (remember, it's winter), I have a
sound idea. There's an absence of the exhaust tone that makes the
big brother Mustangs so unmistakable. Of course, I admit to being a
fan of the original Mustang GT's tuned exhausts.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage on this 300-mile winter tour averaged 21.3 miles
per gallon in mostly city driving, much of it in heavy traffic and
rain, with cold starts _ all the ingredients for hitting the EPA's
minimum number. Or maybe not even that.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Mrs. G if she'd like to celebrate First Night by parking
along the Charles with the top down and watching the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   She in turn asked if we could test drive the car on the Fourth
of July instead.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like a plan to me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A word or two from Mrs. G.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. G fell in love with the Mustang immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a woman's car. The size is perfect,'' said she.
</P>
<P>
   And, hardly surprising, she had the opposite view of the seats
that I had found uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the seats. They're just right,'' she said, a thought
seconded by number one daughter on her first ride in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback in Mrs. G's eyes was the five-speed
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad it didn't have an automatic. I'd love to drive it if
it did. I really like this car all the way back to the
taillights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the doors aren't too heavy. A lot of times you get in a
two-door car and the doors are real hard to swing. These are nice
and light.''

   Dear Dr. Bombay: I am having problems with my children accessing
undesirable areas by signing onto America Online under ``Guest''
and using a friend's name and password. How can I prevent this? _
Worried Mom
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mom: Got a pair of scissors? Start with the modem line.
</P>
<P>
   Look, you're never going to stop the kiddos from trolling for
smut just by hoping they won't do it. And it may not be practical
for you to be around playing porn cop whenever the kids are messing
around on the 'puter. You'll have to be more devious than that.
</P>
<P>
   If you're truly worried about what they're doing, try locking up
the computer in your bedroom or home office. If that's not
possible, unhook the keyboard and mouse and throw them in the trunk
of your car. As a last resort, drop your subscription to AOL.
</P>
<P>
   AOL puts that ``Guest'' log-in in their software for your
convenience, so you can connect and check your e-mail from somebody
else's computer just in case Tom Hanks is trying to get in touch
with you while you're on the road. They're not responsible for
hormone-happy teen-agers abusing their Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   You could try an Internet provider that screens out the dirty
stuff, except there's no guarantee the people running it won't
think Gaugin was some sex-crazed hippie pervert. Or you could get
filtering software like NetNanny, SurfWatch or CyberSitter, but a
determined kid can always find ways around them.
</P>
<P>
   Be a parent. Make a hard choice, even if it deprives you of your
online fun. Just realize that if they can't find naked stuff at
your house, they'll go over to the neighbor's house. At least
that's what we did after Mama Bombay found my ``Playboy'' stash.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I get this message: ``Error loading
Explorer.exe. You must reinstall Windows.'' Then things freeze. How
can I reinstall when the CD-ROM isn't working? _ Stuck
</P>
<P>
   Dear Stuck: Now's your big chance to go back to DOS. Not
interested? If you have Win98 and you made a start-up disk like you
were supposed to, boot with it and that'll make the CD live again.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Win95, hold down the F8 key when you see ``Starting
Windows 95.'' Choose Command Prompt Only from the menu you'll get
and use a DOS text editor (such as Edit.exe) to open the System.ini
file. Look for a line that starts Shell and edit to read
ShellWinfile.exe, which abandons Windows Explorer in favor of the
Windows 3.1 File Manager. Yes, it really is still there. That
should get you through the boot process. Don't forget to change
things back after you reload whatever it is you need to reload.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Bill Gates belongs to the same category as
Hitler, Bonaparte and company. All had the same goals: to rule the
world. It's against the basic principles of democracy. You seem to
have a very communist way of thinking by wanting all computers to
speak the same language. _ Righteously Indignant
</P>
<P>
   Dear Indig: You've cleverly unmasked yet another fiendish plot
by the International Communist Conspiracy to help people everywhere
communicate more efficiently. Curses! Foiled again!

MUSTANG IS AS CLASSY AS THE ORIGINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 35 years ago this April that Ford Motor Co. made
automotive history by introducing a new kind of car, a sporty coupe
that became the coming-of-age icon of the post-war baby-boomer
generation.
</P>
<P>
   I was just 16 at the time, with a brand-new driver's license in
my pocket, and I remember conning a salesman at a local Ford
dealership into letting me test-drive a new Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   He probably knew my father wasn't really going to buy me one, as
I had suggested, but he went along with the story and let me drive
the Mustang for a mile or two, sitting beside me in the passenger
seat.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't get to buy one until 1972, when I purchased a still
good-looking '65 model as a second family car.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the 1964-1/2 model I drove at the dealership nor the
'65 model that I owned later came close to the breathtaking
performance of the 1999 Mustang GT convertible I drove for this
week's test-drive column.
</P>
<P>
   This car, with its 4.6-liter V-8, is what driving fun is all
about. Goosing the gas pedal in this Mustang is sure to put a smile
on the driver's face as the car charges forward, leaving lesser
machines in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the 35th anniversary of the original pony car,
Ford has redesigned the Mustang for 1999, and the exterior changes
have brought back some of the styling cues of the early models.
Re-creating some of the automotive design from baby boomers'
childhoods is a trend in the auto industry _ one that manifested
itself rather noticeably during media previews last week at the
North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where I spent
several days trudging through foot-deep snow to check out what's
new on the auto scene.
</P>
<P>
   Ford rolled out a new Thunderbird for 2001 that recaptures the
original '50s T-bird two-seat sports car heritage; Chevrolet showed
a concept Nomad wagon reminiscent of the '50s; and Chrysler
introduced a nifty new compact sport-utility called the PT Cruiser
that is a cross between a '50s hot rod and a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   But for pure performance and retro style, there's nothing quite
like the '99 Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this car a hit with aging baby boomers; it's also in
big demand among Generation X-ers and even kids who are just now
getting their driver's licenses. My 15-year-old daughter had a
choice of riding in the new Mustang or a $55,000 Lexus LX 470
sport-utility last week; she chose the Mustang in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Ford research indicates that Mustang buyers have a median age of
37, a median household income of $57,000, and are 48 percent
female. Female buyers overwhelmingly choose the Mustang for its
style, rather than its power, and therefore buy mostly V-6 models;
male buyers opt for the muscle of the V-8 engines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the automotive Web sites took a poll a couple of weeks
before Christmas to find out what car people would pick as their
own Christmas present, and the Mustang was the clear winner.
</P>
<P>
   The last major change in the Mustang was in late '93, when the
new generation _ a 1994 model _ was introduced to the world at the
State Fair in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the Mustang remains much the same underneath, but
there are significant changes to the exterior and powertrains.
</P>
<P>
   The new body style ``draws equally from the knife-edge lines of
the original Mustang and the taut, New Edge design of the
breakthrough Ford GT90 concept supercar of a few years ago,'' Ford
says in promotional material.
</P>
<P>
   Cues to the original Mustang heritage include the classic long
hood and short deck; a prominent hood scoop; enlarged, sculptured
side scoops with a bold triangular shape; and the signature tri-bar
tail lights. Slim wraparound headlamps are new, and for the first
time, the rear deck is made of a plastic compound to reduce weight
and eliminate corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   The chrome galloping-pony emblem centered on the grille is once
again circled by a chrome ``corral,'' as it was on the original
Mustang, and all '99 models come with a 35th-anniversary version of
the tri-color-bar emblem on the sides of the front fenders, Ford
says.
</P>
<P>
   The base 3.8-liter V-6 engine gets 40 more horsepower than last
year. It's now up to 190 horsepower. The GT's 4.6-liter
single-overhead-cam V-8 has 35 more horsepower, now rated at 260.
That brings it closer to the 350 horsepower of the base V-8 engine
in the Chevy Camaro and Pontiac Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   Standard for '99 is a five-speed manual transmission, but our
bright-yellow GT convertible (base price $24,870 plus $525
transportation) came with the optional four-speed automatic with
overdrive ($815).
</P>
<P>
   Both the V-6 and V-8 Mustangs come with a performance-oriented
3.27:1 rear axle ratio.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Mustang offers a traction-control system
($230) on all models. This system, which works at all speeds, uses
a combination of power and braking to provide better control on wet
roads, Ford says. Although this feature was included on our test
car, we chose to leave the vehicle parked after the ice storm hit
North Texas two days before Christmas. Even with traction control,
a high-torque rear-drive car is not what anyone should be driving
on icy or snowy roads.
</P>
<P>
   As in earlier Mustangs, the front seats are comfortable and
supportive for performance driving, but the two-person back seat is
best left to children or small adults. The trunk holds just 10.9
cubic feet of cargo in the coupe model and 7.7 cubic feet in the
convertible, so don't plan to carry a lot of luggage. The interior
volume is so low that the EPA classifies the Mustang as a
subcompact car.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features on the base GT convertible include
second-generation dual front air bags, antilock brakes, anti-theft
system with remote keyless entry, power rack-and-pinion steering,
air-conditioning, stainless-steel exhaust, 16-inch forged-aluminum
wheels, AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo, power windows and door
locks, tilt leather-wrapped steering wheel, fog lamps, rear-deck
spoiler, tinted glass, dual power outside mirrors, and a power
convertible top with a built-in glass rear window.
</P>
<P>
   Options on our test car, besides the automatic transmission and
traction control included an upgraded audio system ($395), 17-inch
aluminum wheels ($500), leather sport bucket seats ($500), and a
convenience group ($550) that brought us front floor mats, power
driver's seat, cruise control and rear-window defroster.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker was $28,400, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the V-8 automatic are 17 miles per
gallon in the city and 23 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 15.7
gallons of gasoline.

   Dear Dr. Bombay: America Online has $4.5 billion dollars to buy
Netscape, but it's too (darned) cheap to put a server in my area
code, therefore I have to go long distance for e-mail and what
little I do on the Internet. Question: What is a server, what does
one cost, and can a group of people set up their own server? _ Fed
Up
</P>
<P>
   Dear Up: Of course people can set up their own servers. How do
you think this whole Internet thing got so out of hand?
</P>
<P>
   An Internet server is just a big computer running programs that
serve up Web pages or other stuff when you ask it to. There's
nothing special about them, except that they tend to cost an arm
and a leg and you have to hire some major Poindexter right out of
college to run them for you so you can concentrate on making your
clients pay.
</P>
<P>
   Your problem isn't that AOL is too cheap to put a server near
you. It just hasn't gotten around to putting in a local-access
modem number in your town. That would let you dial a local number
that's part of a special long-distance network and that magically
hooks you up to AOL in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep sending your money to the long-distance company. Get
a local Internet account for 20 bucks a month. You can connect to
AOL through that. You'll need to go into the AOL setup (where you'd
change the phone number) and change the connection type to TCP/IP,
which is a bunch of letters geeks like to use instead of saying
``Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Connect with the Internet provider, then start AOL and log in.
Now you can change your billing method to the
``bring-your-own-access'' plan, which is about half the regular
rate. You can send the difference to me. I really think it's the
least you can do after how much I'm saving you.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: What does it mean to format, and is it
something I should do? _ Perplexed
</P>
<P>
   Dear Perp: You know how when your kid plays his Raffi cassette
until your head explodes and then you do a Nixon to the tape in a
moment of blind rage? That's pretty much what a format will do, so
don't attempt it unless you really do want to erase everything from
your hard drive and start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Make a bootable start-up disk (go to Control Panel, then
Add/Remove Programs) and make sure Format.com is on it. Boot with
the disk, then type Format c: /u /s at that old-fashioned DOS
prompt and stand back. When it's done, you'll have to reload all
your programs. Won't that be fun?
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Who are you? Underneath all the insults,
blather and excellent commentary, I suspect there lurks a very
intelligent, well-educated twentysomething woman, perhaps very
petite and pretty, who's afraid to reveal herself for fear she
won't be accepted. Come on _ this is the late '90s! You could be 5
foot 2, eyes of blue and still be a fearless lampooner of the
ignorant. Or are you a scaredy-cat?! _ Just Curious
</P>
<P>
   Dear Just: It's not that I don't like to wear dresses as much as
any other man. I just have a feeling you might be in for a nasty
surprise on our first date. See you tonight. I sure hope you're
open-minded!
</P>
<P>
   Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay isn't really a
cross-dresser. That was just a Halloween costume. No, really. It
was. Send complaints to drbombay\Nstar-telegram.com or snail-mail

VILLAGER IS IN THE MINIVANGUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minivan sales have slowed from their frenetic pace of the late
1980s and early '90s, thanks to booming sales of sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But the minivan market is far from dead; consumers are still
buying them, and manufacturers are continuing to improve them.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, General Motors rolled out three all-new models to
replace its previous Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Chevrolet vans. Last
year, Toyota introduced the Sienna to replace its popular Previa,
and Honda, Nissan and Mercury have all-new models for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   We tested the '99 Mercury Villager, a product that is
essentially the same as the Nissan Quest but with some styling and
interior differences.
</P>
<P>
   The Villager and Quest are assembled at a Ford Motor Co. plant
in Avon Lake, Ohio, from body panels and engines built by Nissan in
Smyrna, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Originally introduced in 1992 as '93 models, the Villager and
Quest have undergone only minor changes until this year's complete
remake. We haven't driven the Quest, so we'll talk about the
Villager. The two vans use the same engine, transmission and other
mechanical components, however, so they will drive and ride
virtually identically.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle was the uplevel Villager Estate model, with a
base price of $25,015 plus $580 transportation. The entry-level
model, called simply the Villager, lists for $22,415 plus
transportation, and a Sport model is offered for the same price as
the Estate. Because of changes and additions, including
air-conditioning as standard equipment, the entry-level price is up
about $2,100 from last year, but the high-end model is just a few
dollars more than it was last year.
</P>
<P>
   With a bunch of extras, including a luxury package ($995) that
added leather seats and a memory for the driver's seat and outside
mirrors, our test vehicle's sticker totaled $30,355, including
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Villager has an all-new body but is built on the same
chassis as before. The biggest difference for consumers is the
addition of a second rear sliding door, this one on the driver's
side. Villager and Quest are the last to add the second sliding
door. Unfortunately, the designers didn't see fit to give either
sliding door the electric-powered option that is available on the
Oldsmobile Silhouette, Chevrolet Venture, Pontiac Montana and now
the Ford Windstar and Honda Odyssey (which is the only van that
offers dual electric sliding doors).
</P>
<P>
   Although the chassis remains essentially the same as last
year's, there are some improvements in the suspension system
designed to give the Villager a softer ride.
</P>
<P>
   Under the hood, there is a big change, however. The engine is
brand-new. This year, power comes from a 3.3-liter Nissan V-6 rated
at 170 horsepower and 200 foot-pounds of torque. This is the same
engine Nissan uses in the updated Pathfinder sport-utility, and it
replaces last year's 3.0-liter V-6 that was taken from the previous
generation Nissan Maxima sedan (151 horspower and 174 foot-pounds
of torque).
</P>
<P>
   Although this isn't the most powerful minivan on the market,
there is plenty of zip even on hills and freeway on-ramps. Unlike
the segment leaders, the Plymouth Voyager/Dodge Caravan, the
Villager is not offered with a four-cylinder engine, which is one
reason the base price is higher than that of those Daimler Chrysler
products.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, though. The Villager isn't designed to be a
mass-market minivan like the Plymouth and Dodge models; it's aimed
at more upscale buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle was so plush and comfortable that it felt like
a luxury sedan. The six-way power driver's seat was as soft and
comfy as an expensive leather recliner, but even the backseat
riders enjoyed a cushy ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Villager is roomier inside than the regular-length Chrysler
vans, but not quite as roomy as the extended vans. Seating for
seven includes two buckets up front, two bucket seats in the center
and a three-person bench seat in the rear. A center bench seat with
two integrated child safety seats is optional.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is paired with a very smooth-shifting, four-speed
automatic transmission that is the only major part of the power
train carried over from the previous generation.
</P>
<P>
   I especially liked the new aircraft-cockpit-style wraparound
instrument panel with electronic instruments (a $245 upgrade on our
vehicle). Instruments and controls have been repositioned to make
them easier to reach and view from the driver's seat. The
AM/FM/cassette unit has been moved above the heating and
air-conditioning controls to bring it closer to the driver, and the
sound system is outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Our van had the optional six-disc CD changer ($370). Headphone
outlets and stereo controls in the rear let passengers listen to
something different from what the folks up front are grooving on.
This makes trips with teens a lot more pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   New standard features for 1999 besides air-conditioning include
power windows/mirrors and door locks, cruise control, luggage rack,
second-generation dual front air bags, a cargo net on the floor
between the two front seats, a rear parcel shelf (Estate and Sport
models only) and machined aluminum wheels (also Estate and Sport
only).
</P>
<P>
   Other options on our test car included a new antilock braking
system ($590), power moon roof ($775), automatic temperature
control ($180), anti-theft system ($100), and two special packages:
a ``comfort group'' ($995) that includes an odor/particulate air
filter, power driver's seat and privacy glass; and a ``convenience
group'' ($495) that adds a flip-open rear lift-gate window, extra
interior lighting, an overhead console and remote keyless entry.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the luxury package is a universal garage-door
opener, as well as a rather silly memo recorder mounted in the
driver's sun visor that allows someone to record up to three
minutes of remarks or thoughts or whatever. I imagine this will be
mostly something the kids play with when they are left alone in the
car.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 17 miles per gallon in the city and
24 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 20 gallons of gasoline,
giving the Villager decent cruising range.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Mercury Villager Estate minivan
</P>
<P>
   The Package: Five-door, seven-passenger, V-6 powered,
front-drive minivan, a completely revised model for 1999
(essentially the same vehicle as the Nissan Quest).
</P>
<P>
   Highlights: This is one of the nicest minivans on the market,
and has more power and a new sliding door on the driver's side for
1999. It offers an excellent ride and interior comfort, good power
and outstanding quality.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: No power sliding door available; no engine upgrades
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Major competitors: Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Mazda MPV,
Chevrolet Venture/Oldsmobile Silhouette/Pontiac Montana, Chrysler
Town &AMP; Country/Plymouth Voyager/Dodge Caravan, Ford Windstar.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel economy: 17 miles per gallon city, 24 highway.
</P>
<P>
   Base price: $25,015 plus $580 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $30,355, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   On The Road rating: A-minus.

ANNAN'S GIFT TO SADDAM'S CHEMICAL WEAPON MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are three grave threats to the national security of the
United States. They are, in order of their lethality, biological
and chemical warfare, ``loose'' nuclear weapons, and technological
terrorism. The most worrisome of these, in terms of strategic
defense, is biological and chemical weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   It would be insane for Saddam Hussein to launch a nuclear
missile attack on the United States or one of its allies. Advanced
radar would almost immediately establish the attack's point of
origin, track its trajectories, and predict its targets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the warhead detonated, US planes would be on their way to
a retaliatory nuclear strike. Every major city in Iraq would be
sand in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult for terrorist computer hackers to crash
the global financial and communications system. Firewalls would
contain the virus's spread. AT&AMP;T and other companies have secondary
systems that would meet the nation's essential telecommunications
needs. Emergency planners would quiet the initial panic. Markets
would be closed for a time while investigators hunted down the
perpetrators. But life would go on.
</P>
<P>
   Biological and chemical weaponry is different. Ten suitcases of
strategically placed anthrax could kill, on a cloudy day, millions
of people and cause something close to complete panic. Once
airborne, it would pass from person to person with every sneeze,
every breath taken. Sunshine would be the only defense.
</P>
<P>
   It is tasteless, odorless, and easily assembled, and the origin
and intent of a multicity anthrax attack would be unknown until
declared. By then, the functionality of the US government would be
very much in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
for the disarmament of Iraq, established after the Persian Gulf
War, is to prevent Saddam from acquiring such weaponry. Since the
United Nations does not have its own intelligence capabilities,
UNSCOM relies on member states to provide such assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The most sophisticated intelligence capabilities in the world
reside at the National Security Agency, the Pentagon, and the
Central Intelligence Agency. Since 1991, UNSCOM has worked closely
with all three in a sustained effort to shut down (or at least
impede) Iraq's development of chemical and biological weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   As well they should. There is little, if any doubt that Saddam
has used such weaponry in the past _ on his own people and in the
war against Iran during the 1980s. There is no doubt that he is
trying to develop an ever more lethal chemical and biological
warfare capability.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Miller and William Broad of The New York Times and other
journalists have reported extensively on this effort and others
like it. Their reports have been chilling. This is a kind of
warfare that can eliminate entire populations.
</P>
<P>
   This week, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan threw a huge monkey
wrench into the UNSCOM machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, The Boston Globe and The Washington Post reported
that, to quote the Post account: ``Annan has obtained what he
regards as convincing evidence that (UNSCOM) inspectors helped
collect eavesdropping intelligence used in American efforts to
undermine the Iraqi regime.'' The Post reported that Annan was
``deeply alarmed by the implications of the relationship for the
(UN).''
</P>
<P>
   The key sources for these accounts were ``confidants'' of Annan.
Which is to say Annan himself. It is believed that he leaked this
story to send a message of displeasure to the US government and to
assuage other members of the UN Security Council (notably Russia
and France), who opposed the recent US attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's ``message'' has done incalculable damage to UNSCOM's
mission and to US intelligence-gathering efforts. Worse, Annan has
delivered unto Saddam a public relations bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the firm denials of UNSCOM officials, Saddam can now
cite the secretary general of the United Nations as his ``source''
when he accuses UNSCOM weapons inspectors of being nothing more
than American ``spies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is worth remembering, as the Washington Post editorial page
pointed out, that the United Nations itself has demanded, ``through
solemn resolutions,'' that Saddam cease development of chemical and
biological weaponry. It also bears repeating that scientists who
once worked at the Biopreparat _ the former Soviet Union's vast
biological and chemical weapons program _ believe that some number
of their former colleagues now work for Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of
terrifying importance to every man, woman, and child on the planet.
Annan's petulant political game set back efforts to contain those
weapons immeasurably.
</P>
<P>
   If he needed to express displeasure with President Clinton's
bombing of Iraq, he should have gone through private channels. If
he did it to ingratiate himself with pro-Iraqi governments, he is
guilty of the worst kind of appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who stands in the way of containing biological and
chemical warfare is on the wrong side of humanity and the evil side
of history.

   DETROIT _ The dateline is a lie _ it's where I should have been
most of this week, traipsing the vast interior of Cobo Hall with
6,000 or so other journalists (that's the number claimed to have
been invited) at the North American International Auto Show.
Better, I was to get an award of some kind or other as a finalist
in the Detroit Press Foundation International Wheel Awards
competition for automotive journalists.
</P>
<P>
   I was looking forward to seeing the new Ford Thunderbird, the
two-seater Millennium Car _ especially so since I do believe I was
first to ferret out Ford's plan for it. Hell, I know I was.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't get to see it, nor did I get to eyeball the five
Chrysler concepts, nor any of the other concepts, nor any of the
new production vehicles. Nada.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I have been living life as airport refugee, and
practicing to become proficient with a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   The first mistake was scheduling comfort, a noon flight allowing
for sleep and breakfast before the long trek to Logan rather than
the daybreak special that would have gotten me to the Detroit
International Airport _ but maybe only in time to be a refugee
there.
</P>
<P>
   I hit the airport at 11 a.m. after dropping a car at the Globe
for pickup by another writer, slide my bag on the security belt,
get through the metal detector without a single alarm bell, and
check in _ flight's delayed, I am told, and your bag's too big. It
gets checked at the gate. I sit, watch the Patriots getting
whacked. The boarding announcement is a cancellation; Detroit is
buried in snow. Retrieve the bag, queue up, make a Sunday
reservation. So far, $45 in taxis, 80 miles driving, a couple of
hours or more at the airport, and I'm nowhere and on my way home.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, no one answers airline telephone. Head for the gate,
lift the bag _ ``That bag's too big,'' the uniform says. ``It won't
fit. Take it downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It fit Friday,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   Uniform calls chief uniform. ``Bag too big,'' he intones.
``Downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It fit Friday.'' This triggers an unfruitful discussion over
what was possible Friday but impossible today because it really was
never possible but only seemed that way to me. I am dealing with
the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs. Flights are canceled and 500 or so people are on
standby ahead of me for the two, maybe four, open seats on the last
scheduled flight, which, if it gets aloft, may have nowhere to go
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I am assured that Monday will be no problem.
</P>
<P>
   By now it is pouring rain in Boston and icing up north and west
of the Hub _ did I mention I am now driving a rear-drive
convertible?
</P>
<P>
   By Portsmouth, N.H., stuff is accumulating on the roadway. By
Somersworth to the north, the stuff has become glaze. The coupe is
hit by a gust of wind and slides across lanes, causing a police
cruiser to speed up, probably so its pilot could ascertain if I
were in trouble or possibly drunk and in bigger trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester, the Lilac City, is a giant Popsicle, and I am
steering by body English as much as anything. Home at last, it is
time to start telephoning people in Detroit; I will not make the
opening press events nor the awards presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Cobo Hall has a media center set up for the event with a
gazillion telephone lines. Detroit information can't find any of
them but does give me a bogus number for Cobo Hall. I try Detroit
info again and am told they are too busy, call back some other
time. Is this the benefit of deregulation and the retirment of ol'
Ma Bell?
</P>
<P>
   I try again. A voice identifies itself as a police department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get Detroit information,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're that, too,'' he assures me, but can't find the media
center, gets me a number for Cobo Hall that is attached to a
recording.
</P>
<P>
   I rummage around to locate ``Show Talk 99,'' the glossy
publication of the Detroit Dealers Association that puts on the
auto show _ big story on the media center. But no number. But there
is a number for the public relations firm . . . which is attached
to another recording.
</P>
<P>
   More rummaging. I find a number for an employee of said firm,
which triggers another recording _ but, hallelujah, this guy's
recording offers a number where he can be reached. At the media
center where the telephone company couldn't find its own
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to come?'' he asks. ``We have two feet of
snow, nobody can move, and there are 2,000 people stranded at the
airport sleeping on emergency blankets.'' He will convey my
messages as best he can. For the record, he is Joe Rohatynski _ or
at least he was answering JR's telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The radio casts doubt on tomorrow's chances . . . suddenly there
is a thundering and clattering on the roof and I know it's too late
for Santa Claus. I rush to the window and where once was a clear
view of the street is now only evergreen foliage. The huge
ice-encrusted pine out front is not quite so big now because 30
feet of it is blocking both front doors, but it has missed the car
and the power lines. Monday, I may be too busy with the chain saw
to think about flying.
</P>
<P>
   I pick up the telephone; time to change the hotel reservation.
Again. Marriott at least answers its telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, I try the airline, just in case. Maybe the tree can
wait. ``Due to weather conditions, we are too busy to take your
call. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   With deep longing in my heart for Ma Bell, I pick up the chain
saw. It is a very big piece of tree.

get through the metal detector without a single alarm bell, and
check in _ flight's delayed, I am told, and your bag's too big. It
gets checked at the gate. I sit, watch the Patriots getting
whacked. The boarding announcement is a cancellation; Detroit is
buried in snow. Retrieve the bag, queue up, make a Sunday
reservation. So far, $45 in taxis, 80 miles driving, a couple of
hours or more at the airport, and I'm nowhere and on my way home.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, no one answers airline telephone. Head for the gate,
lift the bag _ ``That bag's too big,'' the uniform says. ``It won't
fit. Take it downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It fit Friday,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   Uniform calls chief uniform. ``Bag too big,'' he intones.
``Downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It fit Friday.'' This triggers an unfruitful discussion over
what was possible Friday but impossible today because it really was
never possible but only seemed that way to me. I am dealing with
the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs. Flights are canceled and 500 or so people are on
standby ahead of me for the two, maybe four, open seats on the last
scheduled flight, which, if it gets aloft, may have nowhere to go
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   I am assured that Monday will be no problem.
</P>
<P>
   By now it is pouring rain in Boston and icing up north and west
of the Hub _ did I mention I am now driving a rear-drive
convertible?
</P>
<P>
   By Portsmouth, N.H., stuff is accumulating on the roadway. By
Somersworth to the north, the stuff has become glaze. The coupe is
hit by a gust of wind and slides across lanes, causing a police
cruiser to speed up, probably so its pilot could ascertain if I
were in trouble or possibly drunk and in bigger trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester, the Lilac City, is a giant Popsicle, and I am
steering by body English as much as anything. Home at last, it is
time to start telephoning people in Detroit; I will not make the
opening press events nor the awards presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Cobo Hall has a media center set up for the event with a
gazillion telephone lines. Detroit information can't find any of
them but does give me a bogus number for Cobo Hall. I try Detroit
info again and am told they are too busy, call back some other
time. Is this the benefit of deregulation and the retirment of ol'
Ma Bell?
</P>
<P>
   I try again. A voice identifies itself as a police department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get Detroit information,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're that, too,'' he assures me, but can't find the media
center, gets me a number for Cobo Hall that is attached to a
recording.
</P>
<P>
   I rummage around to locate ``Show Talk 99,'' the glossy
publication of the Detroit Dealers Association that puts on the
auto show _ big story on the media center. But no number. But there
is a number for the public relations firm . . . which is attached
to another recording.
</P>
<P>
   More rummaging. I find a number for an employee of said firm,
which triggers another recording _ but, hallelujah, this guy's
recording offers a number where he can be reached. At the media
center where the telephone company couldn't find its own
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to come?'' he asks. ``We have two feet of
snow, nobody can move, and there are 2,000 people stranded at the
airport sleeping on emergency blankets.'' He will convey my
messages as best he can. For the record, he is Joe Rohatynski _ or
at least he was answering JR's telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The radio casts doubt on tomorrow's chances . . . suddenly there
is a thundering and clattering on the roof and I know it's too late
for Santa Claus. I rush to the window and where once was a clear
view of the street is now only evergreen foliage. The huge
ice-encrusted pine out front is not quite so big now because 30
feet of it is blocking both front doors, but it has missed the car
and the power lines. Monday, I may be too busy with the chain saw
to think about flying.
</P>
<P>
   I pick up the telephone; time to change the hotel reservation.
Again. Marriott at least answers its telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, I try the airline, just in case. Maybe the tree can
wait. ``Due to weather conditions, we are too busy to take your
call. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   With deep longing in my heart for Ma Bell, I pick up the chain
saw. It is a very big piece of tree.

STUDENTS SEEKING A `FLAKY' FUTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When you're 20 years old, retirement seems like a long
way off. Joining the snowbirds in South Texas or being able to golf
every day isn't a big conversation starter on campus.
</P>
<P>
   But at an age when students are likely to be telling tales of
drinking vast quantities of beer, many of them are thinking ahead
to an early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of college students reported that they plan to
retire between 40 and 50 years of age in a online poll by the
accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. Another 17 percent plan to
retire between the ages of 50 and 60.
</P>
<P>
   Career counselors weren't a bit surprised to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   Many college students and recent college graduates want to stop
their traditional career early in life and devote their time to a
hobby, focus on volunteer work or start their own business.
</P>
<P>
   Students are thinking of their life as a series of careers,
rather than a climb up one career ladder until retirement, said
Cheryl Matherly, director of career services at Rice University in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   One student told her she wanted to go to medical school and work
as a physician until the age of 40. After that, she'd like to join
a group of doctors doing relief work in Guatemala until the age of
60 and finally buy some land and open an antique store.
</P>
<P>
   Many others plan to teach after ``retirement'' or start their
own businesses, said Matherly, who teaches a career and life
options course for freshmen and sophomores. When these students
talk about retirement, it's not the traditional put up your feet
and watch television all day.
</P>
<P>
   Matherly was also struck by how important money is to the
students she talks to. They recognize that they can't satisfy their
other needs _ such as volunteering full-time _ until they have
enough money to support that career change.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Holdcroft, vice president of Career Management Resources in
Dallas, a company that sets up in-house career development programs
for corporations, said she also has found that recent graduates
increasingly are interested in making financial plans to ensure
they'll have the money they need to retire early.
</P>
<P>
   That's a change. Young people didn't usually focus on financial
planning for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INTERESTING WORK SOUGHT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While students want to earn enough to retire sooner than their
parents, they're also keen to find interesting work, Matherly said.
They don't just want to find a high-paying job that isn't
satisfying until they can earn enough to quit and do what really
interests them.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Laird Jr., a senior at Texas A&AMP;M University in College
Station, Texas, has a clear career plan: He's studying civil
engineering and plans to get a job with a company that will let him
learn everything he can about construction. By the time he's in his
30s, Laird said, he wants to start his own construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Those first years will be tough, so the 21-year-old student
figures he won't be able to retire really early. Laird figures that
retiring at the age of 60 is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Milano, partner in charge of university relations for
KPMG Peat Marwick in Montvale, N.J., said that retirement age is
more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Milano, a certified public accountant who admitted he likes to
see mountains of data before he will proclaim a trend, speculated
that students who are planning to retire in their 40s are doing
little more than wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   What would you say if you're asked if you want to work until
you're 70 years of age or quit when you're 50 and do something
really neat and cool like joining an over-50 football league?
Milano asked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LAYOFFS MAKE IMPRESSION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Career counselors believe, however, that the tide is turning.
Every student today has seen someone close to them get downsized _
either a parent, relative or family friend _ and they have been
deeply affected by that devastating experience, said Holdcroft.
That's convinced students they can't just rely on an employer to
provide them with a lifetime career.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking leads students to consider a much wider variety of
options, including early retirement. It also has removed the stigma
that someone who quits a traditional 9 to 5 job somehow shows a
weak work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Our fathers couldn't retire early from a traditional job for
fear of being labeled flaky, said Matherly, but younger workers
don't have that same constraint. Now, it's cool to think about
retiring early and doing something completely different.
</P>
<P>
   That said, they'd still like to know, ``Where's the beer?''
</P>
<P>

TOO RARE TO GROW ANYWHERE BUT IN A CATALOGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Jan. 10) 
(JT) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tomatoes do not grow on trees. It's an immutable fact. It's also
a fact that some nursery catalogs ballyhoo the ``tree tomato,''
often with a drawing of a roundish, tree-shaped plant laden with
what look to be fat, red-ripe tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   I like the idea. The drawing conjures up the image of a tomato
orchard, with row upon row of nicely pruned trees that bear bushels
of love apples every year without the bother of starting tomato
seedlings, planting them and staking them.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the tree tomato is one of those beguiling novelties that
the nursery trade is so fond of. It's not a tomato at all, although
it's a member of the same family, the Solanaceae. It is a tropical
shrub with the botanical name Cyphomandra betacea. Its fruit _
which is usually yellowish-orange rather than red _ is edible, but
it doesn't taste like a tomato. (It's pulpier than a tomato, and
tart.) It can be eaten fresh, but more often it's stewed or made
into jam.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes a couple of years for a tree tomato to start
bearing that fruit, meaning that you'll need a place to protect the
plant (which can grow to 12 feet tall) in winter if the temperature
drops below freezing. The easy convenience of a tomato-bearing tree
starts to sound like work.
</P>
<P>
   I have no quarrel with garden novelties. Some of the most
interesting plants in my flower and vegetable gardens were
initially experiments, purchased as seed or seedlings from an
irresistible catalog description. Occasionally, but not often, the
description was borne out by performance.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, I tried the Cherokee toothache plant
(Spilanthes oleracea), described as a good salad ingredient and
palate cleanser. Actually, it's more like a palate para-lyzer.
Nibbling a leaf or flower bud numbs the tongue and mouth so
thoroughly that nothing eaten for an hour or so afterward is likely
to be tasted at all. But the plant is attractive, covered most of
the summer with orange-yellow blossoms that look like fat gumdrops.
And sampling it once clears up any confusion about the origins of
its name.
</P>
<P>
   I've grown a number of flowers that are supposed to be black _
pansies, hollyhocks, tulips, irises. The idea of black flowers
isn't all that appealing esthetically, but I can't help myself. I
have to know if it's really black or just deep purple, which is
more often the case. Black pansies are really black, and sometimes
I grow them in combination with orange-flowered ones as a Halloween
novelty.
</P>
<P>
   I don't really care if there's a blue rose. The colors available
seem more than adequate. But if I were a rose grower, I probably
couldn't resist trying every supposedly blue rose that appeared in
a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   I might not even be disappointed when it turned out to be dull
lavender instead, as long as it bloomed well and smelled good. None
of the white marigolds I've tried were really white, but very pale
yellow is still a nice color.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a sucker, too, for vegetables of an unusual hue, like purple
brussels sprouts, red celery, yellow beets, pink-fleshed potatoes,
white pumpkins and green eggplant. The latest rage in Swiss chard
is a variety called Bright Lights, a mixture that has pink, yellow,
red, orange and white stems. It tastes just like regular Swiss
chard, but it's prettier.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth remembering that many common vegetables and flowers
were once novelties in American gardens, and that many plants once
widely known are now grown mostly as novelties. Thomas Jefferson
considered kale a novelty and thought it would be useful to feed
sheep in the winter. Salsify, once a staple in kitchen gardens, is
now offered as an unusual root crop under its common name, oyster
plant. I half expect to see drawings of plants sprouting little
shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   A little hyperbole in the introduction of a plant or variety is
to be expected. When the marvelous vining petunias known as Wave
petunias first appeared, catalogs enthusiastically called them
four-season plants that were impervious to weather extremes and
would bloom even indoors in the winter, in sun or in shade.
</P>
<P>
   Not much chance of that. They're terrific petunias, but they're
still petunias. They need sun and they resent being dragged indoors
in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   When hyperbole reaches the level of the ridiculous, though, it's
time for the gardener to beware. It's possible for fruit trees to
bear several varieties of fruit on the same tree, thanks to the art
of grafting, so a six-in-one apple tree is within the realm of
possibility. But butterfly bushes don't bear blossoms of three
colors on one plant. A neighbor who believed a catalog's claim of a
tricolor butterfly bush last spring received a package containing
three small plants bundled together. Two were dead.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the tree tomato? I still want one, knowing full well
that it is not a tomato and not a tree of the sort I can add to the
landscape. But I also want to try some of those other fascinating
novelties splashed all over the covers of the latest crop of
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   At such times it's good to remember that money, like tomatoes,
does not grow on trees.

   The Cuban Revolution is now 40 years old, and its anniversary is
all the more remarkable in view of the relative shambles the
country is in.
</P>
<P>
   When Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and the other 1,500-odd members
of the Rebel Army and the 26th of July Movement overthrew Fulgencio
Batista and entered Havana in January 1959, no one could have
predicted that events on the small island would be so far-reaching
and significant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they led to the Cuban missile crisis, the most severe
confrontation of the Cold War; to daring revolutionary escapades
throughout Latin America and part of Africa; to a four-decade
animosity on the part of the United States; to Castro's outlasting
the attempts of nine U.S. presidents to get rid of him, one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly an exceptional feat to have survived, and the
authors of the revolution can at least take solace in that. Not in
much else, at this stage, which is why perhaps a reassessment of
the Cuban epic's true legacy and impact, at least in Latin America,
is relevant today.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, for a movement that prided itself on being truly
political, and on radiating its political influence throughout the
hemisphere, Cuba today exists in Latin America through its cultural
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's political impact now is mostly limited to the
displays of small crowds that congregate outside the hotels where
Castro chooses to rest on his sporadic forays into the region. If
Cuba once ignited passions of hatred and mistrust, or inspired
thousands to give their lives for an ideal, today it can barely
cajole Latin American governments to half-heartedly condemn the
U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s nearly everyone _ from Mexican national hero Lazaro
Cardenas to Jean-Paul Sartre and Stokely Carmichael _ made the
pilgrimage to Havana. Today the swarms of revolutionaries,
intellectuals and advisers from the golden age of glory are nowhere
in sight. What you see instead are middle-age Spanish, Italian and
Mexican tourists who come to take advantage of Cuba's beautiful
beaches, cheap prices and readily available sex.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cuban cultural presence is far less than it was 30
years ago, or even as recently as the 1980s, the island's sway
among writers, singers, painters, academics, poets, actors and TV
and movie directors is still disproportionate to its tiny size and
meager resources.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the paradox: the Cuban Revolution has left a much more
lasting imprint among novelists than political ideologues, among
painters than student activists, among musicians than labor
organizers _ in short, among cultural than political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Having once wielded enormous influence over the politics of
Latin America and to an extent the world, today Cuba's strategic
value is highly reduced: Russia prefers IMF dollars to
nuclear-tipped missiles pointed at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And yet hundreds of graduates from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's
School of Cinema and Television in San Antonio de los Banos are
scattered across the influential cities of Latin America. At the
University of Buenos Aires, a Che Guevara rotating chair
inaugurated in early 1997 still attracts hundreds of attentive
students. In Mexico, La Jornada, the mass-circulation daily where
Carlos Fuentes and Octavio Paz published their columns and
commentaries on current events as recently as five years ago,
continues to flaunt its enthusiasm for everything Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller than ever, but nonetheless impressive number of Latin
America's most distinguished cultural icons remain fast and true
friends of Cuba _ from Garcia Marquez to Chilean playwright Ariel
Dorfman, from Ecuadorian painter Guayasamin to Uruguayan
teeny-bopper idol and best-selling novelist Mario Benedetti, from
Brazilian songwriter and folk hero Chico Buarque to the dean of
Latin American sociologists, Mexico's Pablo Gonzalez Casanova.
</P>
<P>
   The continued loyalty to Cuba of these and many other major
figures on the Latin American cultural scene stems in part from the
status and activities of the region's intelligentsia. During the
long night of authoritarian rule in Latin America, intellectuals
frequently spoke out at home and abroad against abuses and
atrocities, and helped to replace banned or weakened political
parties. When democratization finally arrived, that role greatly
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Cuban regime is now so discredited in Latin
American politics that the most a fellow traveler to Cuba can get
away with is to call for an end to the U.S. embargo and harassment
from Miami; but in the field of culture there is greater leeway.
Artists are less accountable to the public than politicians, who
have to face the media and the voters. Artists and performers face
only their audience and youthful, radical fans, most of whom tend
to share their political views. Few openly pro-Cuban politicians
are left in Latin America, but there are still many pro-Cuban
cultural figures.
</P>
<P>
   The festive times of the Cuban Revolution ended many years ago,
as did the heyday of its influence _ political, cultural and
otherwise. What remain are memories and regrets, as well as
vestiges of a singular experience in Latin America history: the way
in which a small island with no particular claim to fame was
transformed into a cultural beacon and haven for many of the
greatest writers the region has ever known, and for some of its
finest thinkers, musicians and painters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is perhaps a fitting tribute to Cuba and to Che
Guevara that they both made a greater mark in the shining field of
Latin culture than in the mundane, mediocre world of politics.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a new, emerging left in Latin America, it is largely
because the Cubans have been banished from political life in the
hemisphere. But if the region's cultural realm maintains its
marvelous vitality, it is partly because of Cuba's contribution to
it.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    PARIS _ Of course, there was never any doubt that it was coming,
but it's still hard to believe that this is really 1999. It's been
out there, waiting for us, for a long time, but more like one of
those things that are always to be expected but never actually
happen.
 &HT;    The year 2000 is something else, the start of a new century, a
new millennium, full of questions, predictions, new decisions. But
1999 is supposed to mark an ending, a long closure that after all
turns out to be uncertain and indecisive.
 &HT;    In terms of world affairs, the 20th century was particularly
short, from 1914, when the 19th century's balance of power and
faith in progress broke down, to 1991 when the Soviet Union and the
reign of ideology collapsed.
 &HT;    It was also particularly monstrous, and yet the very disasters
man wreaked upon man and nature provoked measures to break a
pattern of human horror. The illusion of the 1920s that war could
simply be outlawed was gone, but so was the myth of war as glory,
the noblest calling.
 &HT;    The failure of communism left democracy as the political system
and the market as the economic system _ in both cases, the clearly
preferred concepts. But the new doesn't just slip into place when
the old systems are gone. What is coming instead out of confusion
and greed in the afflicted countries looks totally unforeseeable.
 &HT;    Even democracy, if validated by the end of dictatorships, has
lost self-confidence. There are debates about whether or not it is
still relevant, in fact, about whether there's any need to be
concerned about government.
 &HT;    In the United States, 37 percent of voters cast ballots in the
last national election, slightly more than one in three, though the
Clinton sex scandal had provided all the spectacular drama that
crowd-pullers could wish.
 &HT;    Europe found a way to organize itself to make its worst
traditional enmities obsolete. Now, 11 Western European countries
have pooled their currencies in a single new one, the Euro. It is
not really the first because gold once served as the common measure
of value; yet the Euro is a huge step toward continued integration.
The participating nations will surely be joined by most of the
holdouts in a few years.
 &HT;    The idea that economies can and should be managed, born of the
savage excesses and wild cyclical swings in the rise of capitalism,
has been challenged once more by proof of the market's superior
performance. But at the same time, the market's arbitrary cruelties
spawn new demands for constraining limits, for protection of
workers and the environment. There has to be balance.
 &HT;    There was a vast increase in poverty, primarily because there
was such a vast increase in the world's population. And yet, like
war, poverty no longer seemed inevitable, decreed by nature and to
be endured. It has become possible to provide adequate food for the
world's population and to eliminate famine. It takes human will and
agreement, which exist in some measure, although far from enough.
 &HT;    In terms of changes in the way large numbers of people live, the
20th century was as long as the previous 500 or even 1,000 years.
People fly to outer space. They communicate, with sound and image,
in total defiance of time and space. They can conserve food and
make themselves comfortable despite the climate. They suppress much
disease and swallow pills so that the biblical old age of
threescore and ten is far less than the ordinary life expectancy in
the developed world.
 &HT;    Technological advance has achieved the momentum of a chain
reaction. People adjust surprisingly quickly. Change always has
costs and drawbacks, but it is welcomed for the extraordinary
improvements in material welfare and even just in convenience.
Science is admired and encouraged for its own sake, not only for
love of knowledge but because there's every reason to think that
sooner or later, new discoveries will bring new benefits.
 &HT;    Yet, science no longer provides the reassurance it once did that
the future can only get better and better. It poses weighty new
moral and ethical questions, about the beginnings of life and the
certainty of death, which it cannot even presume to answer. The new
capacities it offers are in many ways also new burdens, new

 &HT;    
 &HT;    PARIS _ Of course, there was never any doubt that it was coming,
but it's still hard to believe that this is really 1999. It's been
out there, waiting for us, for a long time, but more like one of
those things that are always to be expected but never actually
happen.
 &HT;    The year 2000 is something else, the start of a new century, a
new millennium, full of questions, predictions, new decisions. But
1999 is supposed to mark an ending, a long closure that after all
turns out to be uncertain and indecisive.
 &HT;    In terms of world affairs, the 20th century was particularly
short, from 1914, when the 19th century's balance of power and
faith in progress broke down, to 1991 when the Soviet Union and the
reign of ideology collapsed.
 &HT;    It was also particularly monstrous, and yet the very disasters
man wreaked upon man and nature provoked measures to break a
pattern of human horror. The illusion of the 1920s that war could
simply be outlawed was gone, but so was the myth of war as glory,
the noblest calling.
 &HT;    The failure of communism left democracy as the political system
and the market as the economic system _ in both cases, the clearly
preferred concepts. But the new doesn't just slip into place when
the old systems are gone. What is coming instead out of confusion
and greed in the afflicted countries looks totally unforeseeable.
 &HT;    Even democracy, if validated by the end of dictatorships, has
lost self-confidence. There are debates about whether or not it is
still relevant, in fact, about whether there's any need to be
concerned about government.
 &HT;    In the United States, 37 percent of voters cast ballots in the
last national election, slightly more than one in three, though the
Clinton sex scandal had provided all the spectacular drama that
crowd-pullers could wish.
 &HT;    Europe found a way to organize itself to make its worst
traditional enmities obsolete. Now, 11 Western European countries
have pooled their currencies in a single new one, the Euro. It is
not really the first because gold once served as the common measure
of value; yet the Euro is a huge step toward continued integration.
The participating nations will surely be joined by most of the
holdouts in a few years.
 &HT;    The idea that economies can and should be managed, born of the
savage excesses and wild cyclical swings in the rise of capitalism,
has been challenged once more by proof of the market's superior
performance. But at the same time, the market's arbitrary cruelties
spawn new demands for constraining limits, for protection of
workers and the environment. There has to be balance.
 &HT;    There was a vast increase in poverty, primarily because there
was such a vast increase in the world's population. And yet, like
war, poverty no longer seemed inevitable, decreed by nature and to
be endured. It has become possible to provide adequate food for the
world's population and to eliminate famine. It takes human will and
agreement, which exist in some measure, although far from enough.
 &HT;    In terms of changes in the way large numbers of people live, the
20th century was as long as the previous 500 or even 1,000 years.
People fly to outer space. They communicate, with sound and image,
in total defiance of time and space. They can conserve food and
make themselves comfortable despite the climate. They suppress much
disease and swallow pills so that the biblical old age of
threescore and ten is far less than the ordinary life expectancy in
the developed world.
 &HT;    Technological advance has achieved the momentum of a chain
reaction. People adjust surprisingly quickly. Change always has
costs and drawbacks, but it is welcomed for the extraordinary
improvements in material welfare and even just in convenience.
Science is admired and encouraged for its own sake, not only for
love of knowledge but because there's every reason to think that
sooner or later, new discoveries will bring new benefits.
 &HT;    Yet, science no longer provides the reassurance it once did that
the future can only get better and better. It poses weighty new
moral and ethical questions, about the beginnings of life and the
certainty of death, which it cannot even presume to answer. The new
capacities it offers are in many ways also new burdens, new
challenges that nothing has prepared the existing societies to
confront.
 &HT;    With the arrival of 1999, it is now clear where this century has
been, lots to be ashamed of, some things to be quite proud of _ a
lesson and a preparation, one has to hope, for doing better. It did
show that no invention, no trick, no blind belief will solve the
problems people face. For that, it takes people of good heart and
good will.
 &HT;    That seems so obvious that it's odd it took until 1999 for the
century to define itself.

O'HAIR'S DIARY, LETTERS PRESENT NEW SIDE TO MISSING ATHEIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the public arena, she was a tough and profane
atheist battle-ax, quick with a lawsuit or an irreverent curse,
battling always the forces of organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   In private, she spoke tenderly of lovers and children, cherished
family gatherings at Christmas, and complained endlessly about
money, her waistline and the dreary burdens of the atheist cause.
</P>
<P>
   She also pined endlessly for the finer things in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, dear diary, are the only one who listens to me, so I'll
tell you what I want to do,'' Madalyn Murray O'Hair wrote Jan. 6,
1973, in her resolutions for the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``File at least a couple of suits and win one of them, get a
building, get a Bible chair at University of Texas, get a mink coat
and a Cadillac, humiliate Billy Graham for money and move into a
bigger and better home,'' O'Hair wrote.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair disappeared more than three years ago and is presumed
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Her handwritten diaries, covering 1953 to 1995, plus some
personal papers and letters, will soon be sold to help pay some of
the debts she left behind. Foremost is a bill from the Internal
Revenue Service for $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to get whatever assets Madalyn Murray O'Hair had and
turn them into cash, so her creditors can be paid,'' said Ron
Ingalls, an Austin lawyer serving as bankruptcy trustee.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries are the only thing of possible significant value she
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two significant gaps: from 1959 to 1972, during
the court battle over school prayer, and from 1990 to late 1995, a
period that could hold clues to her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known if those volumes are missing or never were
written.
</P>
<P>
   Now secured in an Austin bank vault, the diaries never have been
read closely by outsiders. Their market value is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first goal is to get the word out and see what response
there is,'' Ingalls said.
</P>
<P>
   He has no personal theory of what happened to O'Hair; her son,
Jon Garth Murray; and granddaughter, Robin Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   The three vanished in San Antonio in late September 1995 along
with $500,000 in gold coins and a Florida con man, also presumed
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought is, if she is alive and reading the newspapers, and
sees her diaries are up for sale, she might all of a sudden pop up
with a lawyer and enjoin me from selling them,'' Ingalls said.
</P>
<P>
   When she vanished at age 76, O'Hair was an aging, marginal
cultural figure, decades removed from her prominence as the
self-proclaimed ``most-hated woman in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Her rise from obscurity as a Maryland housewife began in 1959
when she filed a suit against the Baltimore school district seeking
to remove prayer and Bible reading from public school.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court did just that in a
landmark ruling.
</P>
<P>
   And although O'Hair's suit was a secondary one in the case, she
had found her cause in the battle against organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly founded American Atheists, moved to Austin, and ran
the group and related atheist organizations until her
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Her sense of herself always was that of a historic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced now there was for 30 years an enormous
conspiracy for Christianization of our nation as part of the
assault on Godless communism,'' she wrote in a Sept. 15, 1975,
diary entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the spying on me for my church-state activities
substantiates this beyond question. I want this exposed as
Watergate was, and how do I get it? I want it impactfully brought
home to everyone. I can't get TV time which means everything. I am
brought on to bullbait or bounce off some religious zealot, as a
show person, the irascible Mrs. O'Hair. A freak or token atheist,''
she wrote.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 10
 &HT;    Bean entrepreneur Don Wilson traded the fast track for a more
measured life
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Don Wilson had sipped and stirred his future
for years.
</P>
<P>
   It just took him a while to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he liked this North Georgia town, having moved to the
self-proclaimed Poultry Capital of the World from Scotland in 1986
as an animal science researcher. (``I like the climate and Lake
Lanier(Ga.),'' he says in a dancing Highland lilt, ``and I find the
people to be very natural and very friendly.'') After that, he
climbed the ranks as an animal industry veterinarian at Hoffmann-La
Roche, an international pharmaceutical company that had its
subsidiary, Agri-Bio, based here.
</P>
<P>
   But that big-money job developing antibiotics for farm animals
meant constant travel away from his wife and children, and a
growing reliance on alcohol to smooth out the rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he gave up the hard stuff and immersed himself in the
world of coffee. Always a connoisseur of the bean _ even back home,
among the tea and biscuit crowd of Edinburgh _ he became addicted
to learning its finer points.
</P>
<P>
   And one day, he looked up from his daily cup of joe at
Gainesville's homegrown haven _ St. Ives Coffeehouse tucked into a
quirky 1912 house just down from the town's fashionable mansions _
and pondered its brightly painted walls and funky lampshades.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, yes, and smelled the coffee. He'd been looking for a
new way to bring home the bacon; why not something he already
loved?
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly realized,'' says Wilson, ``this looked like a much
better way of life than hanging out in planes and airports.''
</P>
<P>
   So he bought the small retail business _ lock, stock and bags of
beans in the basement _ from Gil and Barbara Johnson, who wanted to
trade the company they'd founded in 1989 for a chance to sail the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say they want to be their own boss and do
something more fulfilling,'' he says. ``But they don't. More
important than money, power and position is personal contentment.''
</P>
<P>
   With its divided rooms where students study for hours in one
corner while others smoke and chat in another, the coffeehouse
already had plenty of atmosphere. Wilson added colorful displays
from local artists, antique lamps with various shapes to the light,
grazing menu.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before he plunged into the wholesale side of the
coffee business in early 1997, turning a warehouse tucked in
between the chicken-processing plants into the headquarters of St.
Ives Coffee Roasters Inc. The jewel of the expanded operation is a
roasting plant capable of turning out 2,000 pounds a day, 20 tons a
week.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Just take a whiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a rose among the thorns,'' jokes Wilson, pulling up to
his warehouse in a blue Dodge pickup. ``It's kind of ironic I ended
up right across the street from the poultry business. In fact, the
building I am in now was where we marketed antibiotics for the
chicken industry.''
</P>
<P>
   His 5,000-square-foot building is chock-full of all things java:
flavored syrups, hefty 100-pound burlap sacks full of raw beans,
rows and rows of roasted bagged beans waiting to be shipped to
gourmet shops and, of course, a coffee room where he samples new
brews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zimbabwe Pinnacle,'' he says, dipping his hand into a sample
bag. ``That's my new favorite up-and-coming bean. We're delighted
with it. Look at its beautiful pastel shade and how round and
perfect the shape is. It has good acidity, too. Some people think
it has an aftertaste like burgundy wine.''
</P>
<P>
   A better cup
</P>
<P>
   Not that he'd know firsthand anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 44, understands there are no guarantees in the highly
competitive wholesale coffee market, but he never regrets walking
away from his old job _ lucrative and secure as it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reviewed my whole life and where it was leading,'' he says,
sitting in an office full of boxes, labels and product information.
``I decided I didn't like where it was leading. I felt I was at
grave risk for alcohol dependence and decided to do everything I
could do to break it.''
</P>
<P>
   He checked himself into Smyrna's (Ga.) Ridgeview Institute and
emerged sober and committed to helping others, agreeing to be part
of Bill Moyers' public television series, ``Moyers on Addiction:
Close to Home'' that aired last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he's not working or with his family, Wilson helps
others in recovery. ``I want to be brutally honest about it,'' he
says. ``I want people to know it's soul-destroying. I want people
to know there is help. And it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally passionate about beans, Wilson traveled to the mountains
of Costa Rica in 1997 to visit La Minita, one of the world's most
discerning coffee estates, home to 175,000 coffee trees. There, he
and his master roaster, Scott Tyre, toured the factory and fields,
picked beans by hand and studied the subtle complexities of
harvesting, milling, processing and roasting.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned the fine art of sorting La Minita's beans. The
100 workers appear to be playing solitaire as they carefully
inspect each bean; only a select 5 percent of each crop is deemed
worthy of La Minita's label.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the highest quality in the world,'' Wilson says.
``Every single bean is perfect because every single bean is
hand-selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson sells La Minita coffee beans for $13.99 a pound; the
brand is one of his best sellers. By comparison, Jamaican Blue
Mountain is his most expensive coffee at $29.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   What St. Ives specializes in, he says, is known as specialty
coffee _ ``the king of the coffee lineage.'' The highest grade of
coffee available, it's made from Class 1 beans (on a scale of 1 to
5).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's J. Martinez &AMP; Co., which supplies coffee to fine
restaurants and stores such as Williams-Sonoma, sells only estate
coffee, grown on family-run Jamaican estates. (Specialty coffees
can also be estate coffees, if they come from a single plantation _
such as La Minita.)
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's imported beans come from all over the world to be
roasted and packaged on-site, and he claims they're the finest and
freshest in Georgia. Or maybe the entire Southeast, he boasts,
after steaming a perfect cup to give a quick lesson on color,
texture and taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this espresso,'' he says, pouring off the dark, thick
liquid from a tiny silver pitcher. ``A good espresso should have a
red flash to it, a reddish-brown tint to it and a perfect `crema'
at the top. Our espresso blend is a big seller. It's a mix of
French Italian, Vienna and Costa Rican Tarrazu beans.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the locals agree with his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go every morning at 8 a.m., after I drop off my kids at
school and before I go to work,'' says Doyle Johnson, 47, who owns
his own clothing business. ``They roast and brew different coffee
every day. It's always fresh.'' Sandy Easterbrooks, a massage
therapist at the nearby Relaxation Center, unwinds in the pleasant
patio area. Here, the business' namesake, ivy, trickles down the
white and green-trimmed house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I especially like to sit under the trees outside when the
weather is nice and talk to friends,'' Easterbrooks says.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gainesville residents who've moved on but still desire
the St. Ives taste (packaged in bright blue bags adorned with the
logo: ``The closest you can get to the coffee tree'') order it by
mail from as far away as Alaska, Australia and Hawaii (really).
Even a just-passing-through New Yorker took a shine to Wilson's
beans last year. He sent the St. Ives retail staff an e-mail saying
how impressed he was with the ``great coffee in Gainesville.'' The
letter hangs above the sink in the small kitchen where salads and
quiches are prepared.

 &HT;    Despite growing sophistication, ski resort remains a friendly
`country town at heart'
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo., _ As soon as I slung my body into an
empty chairlift, headed to a dizzying 10,600-foot mountaintop that
was never meant for ``intermediate'' skiers like me, I knew that I
had made the most boneheaded move of my life.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but I was carried away! Figuratively, by the natural beauty
of this relatively remote ski resort, far from the hipster crowds
of Aspen and Vail; then literally, by a lift that no one else was
riding. I was at the midpoint, where the first tier of lifts ends
and the second tier begins, carrying the skilled (and the
foolhardy) to four peaks that offer the second longest vertical
drop (3,668 feet) among Colorado ski areas.
</P>
<P>
   I drank in a heady vista: craggy, forested steeps falling away
on all sides, aspen trunks as white and sharply etched as
rattlesnake fangs against the deep green of spruce. Far below,
beneath an expanse of violet-blue sky, undulant prairies of
dusty-green sagebrush and scrub pine spilled into the valley of the
Yampa River. Somewhere down there my wife Cathy was taking a ski
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as my chair hoisted away into cold, silent space, part
of me wished I were down there too. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We'd arrived the previous day to a gloomy prospect. What little
snow had been manufactured for the lower slopes was dissolving
under drizzle. It was one of the barest starts of the season ever
at Steamboat (there's no ``Springs'' in the resort name). We had
lunch in the Tugboat Grill, drawing minimal solace from its huge
juicy burgers and rugged saloon ambience (there's a 100-year-old
bar with a real bullet hole in it), gazing gloomily at the melting
slush and a vacation trickling down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   But next morning, when we stepped out of our hotel in town, we
looked up and saw that fresh powder had fallen overnight on the
higher slopes: Mother Nature had rolled out the white carpets
between jagged knobs of rock and swaths of green conifers. As we
drove the few miles up to the resort, the sun lifted above the
front range of the Rockies to our east and beams fell first upon
this slope, then upon that one, as if a theatrical spotlight
operator with a painterly eye were pointing out individual glories.
</P>
<P>
   We were greeted at the lifts by a statue of Billy Kidd, Olympic
silver medalist of the 1960s who's the resident pro here. Wearing
his familiar cowboy hat, Kidd's statue could be nicknamed the
Spirit of Steamboat in bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Steamboat Springs is the cow town that's the ``now'' town.
</P>
<P>
   Cow town: Ranchers in pickups still tool down Lincoln Avenue,
the main drag, trusty sheep dogs in back. One of the West's biggest
rodeos is held beside the Yampa every summer. Longhorns graze near
town, nostrils shooting steam on a frosty morn.
</P>
<P>
   Now town: A store called Old Tibet offers a selection of Hindu
and Buddhist art objects, and Nandu advertises ``tribal area rugs
and eclectic world imports.'' Gastronomic options include
Yama-Chans sushi bar and Antares restaurant, celebrated for its
cashew ice cream with warm mango fondue. Balloons Over Steamboat
offers even better views than Mount Werner.
</P>
<P>
   Steamboat's delightfully split personality stems partly from its
location, three hours northwest of Denver on a fascinating climatic
divide. From some canyon roads you can throw a rock and hit
snow-covered spruce on the shadowed, north-facing slope, then turn
around and peg one against sun-baked boulders and sagebrush on the
southern exposure. Despite heavy development around the ski area,
there are vast unspoiled spaces to explore on foot, snowshoe,
cross-country ski, snowmobile and horseback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steamboat's just a country town at heart. Not a lot of fur
coats, but hey _ those are OK too. Anything goes,'' says Kay
Sullins, 46, whose Windwalker Tours specializes in towing people
around with horses _ by sleigh in winter, chuckwagons in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lift operator Karen Vail (she's a bit chagrined by the name),
33, is quick to list the qualities that define the town and resort:
``There's a strong year-round community, which means a lot; we
cater to families, a lot; our champagne powder is renowned; our
Western flavor is unique; and as you can tell, we have an
unbelievably friendly staff!''
</P>
<P>
   With Vail's parting yell, ``Have a good run!'' fading behind me,
I rode the first lift; then, as previously described, rashly
boarded the second.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional creak of the lift cables the whisper
of a cold wind, the ride to the top of Mount Werner is deliciously
silent. Snow gets deeper on spruce branches with each minute of
ascent. The boundary between whitened sky and quilted, wind-whipped
slopes grows less distinct, as if I were entering a dreamland in
the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, my chair clears the last ridge, the wisps of
cloud dissolve and I glide onto what seems the rooftop of the
world. Even IMAX can't top this astounding 360-degree view. To the
south and west, behind ice-tipped peaks, an ocean of desert begins;
reddish flattop mesas march into infinity. To the north and east
are mountains so titanic, so savagely beautiful with their
knifelike flanks and gleaming icecaps that they might as well be in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, crossing Colorado by stagecoach, described in
``Roughing It'' exactly what I see: ``These sultans of the
fastnesses were turbaned with tumbled volumes of cloud, which
shredded away and drifted off fringed and torn, trailing their
continents of shadow after them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least,'' I think, turning my skis nervously toward the long
ride down, ``having seen this, I will not have died in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting down Mount Werner is no walk in the park, but it is
exhilarating even for someone like me, struggling just to stay
alive. The high empty steeps slowly segued into the peopled lower
slopes, where skiers hooted their enjoyment and shouted greetings
(``Lunch at Tugboat _ 15 minutes!'') into the pristine air.

   STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo.,: pristine air.
</P>
<P>
   A river runs through it
</P>
<P>
   The legend about the town's name goes like this: French
trappers, following the Yampa in the early 19th century, heard a
chugging noise that they took as a steamboat. It turned out to be a
mineral spring spouting water and steam 15 feet in the air, one of
150 local springs that Ute Indians had visited for centuries.
Dynamite used to build the railroad in 1908 is believed to have
caused the mysterious disappearance of the ``chug.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yampa tumbles smack through town, so clean that fishermen
pull in trout just a few steps off Lincoln Avenue. Sullins'
favorite moments are dawn sleigh rides on the river path, ``the
beautiful, eerie sight of mist over the water.'' The town has a
sprinkling of stone Victorian buildings from which you may expect
to see a bowler-hatted Bat Masterson emerge. At the Tread of
Pioneers Museum, a houseful of Indian and pioneer artifacts, you
can get a free map for a self-guided, historical walking tour.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, the 1940 Harbor Hotel, our first
accommodations, does not qualify under ``charm.'' But by the
standards of new motels and condos spilling across the foothills
south of town, the Harbor is a rare intown pocket of homeyness and
a bargain ($85 double occupancy, off-peak) to boot. In the spa, we
encountered a party of Germans apparently quite pleased to be
there: singing the Seven Dwarfs' ``Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho!'' song in
their native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The Harbor has a strategic location for walking to restaurants,
and one of the best is the cozy, clubby Steamboat Yacht Club,
occupying an old fish hatchery on the river. We sampled classic
high-country fare: trout, which was fine and fresh, and elk, which
we found delicious, less gamy than venison and very close to steak.
</P>
<P>
   Ski jumps, waterfalls
</P>
<P>
   An easy walk from downtown across the Yampa bridge is Howelsen
Hill Park, home of the nation's first Olympic-scale ski jump, built
in 1915 by well-known ski jumper Carl Howelsen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, is it just me or is there something irresistibly wacky
about a man called the Flying Norseman (his stage name with the
Barnum &AMP; Bailey circus) landing here at a time when automobiles,
let alone Norwegian celebrities, were rare? International Olympians
still train here. Locals say it's the best show in town: You can
actually hear the contestants whistling down the wind. Howelsen
Park is a good outing with younger kids because there's a skating
rink and kiddie-sized ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   You know you're in Steamboat Springs when the person who runs
the arts center previously worked as a veterinarian's assistant,
birthing calves and once ``tending an eagle with a bum wing _
mountain lion probably got at him.'' Tami Jenkins, 33, runs the
Depot Arts Center (piano concerts, painting exhibits, other
attractions) in a handsomely redone 1908 train depot.
</P>
<P>
   A great hiking site, Fish Creek Falls, is four miles northeast
of town. Paths are strewn with the tarnished bronze coins of aspen
leaves. A few hundred yards from the parking lot you can view the
spectacular 285-foot falls. Water shoots down into the falls'
self-made cathedral _ flying icicle buttresses, wild scrollworks of
frozen spray _ and gushes out the bottom into a deep gorge.
</P>
<P>
   On the slopes
</P>
<P>
   The Steamboat resort opened in the early 1960s and has never
stopped expanding: Today there are 21 lifts (including an
eight-passenger enclosed gondola) serving 140 trails across 3,000
acres.
</P>
<P>
   There are reportedly 43 former or current Olympic skiers living
in the Steamboat area, more than any other town, so there must be
some truth to the boasts about ``champagne powder.'' Steamboat gets
330 inches of the fizzy manna annually. The base area, Gondola
Village, is designed so you can park your skis, have lunch, shop
and sip a hot drink on a sun deck without having to mess with a
car.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of child care, including a ski school for the
tykes. And yet there's far more apres-ski than watching ``Barney.''
The resort's bar scene includes the Inferno (a dance club you could
almost ski into, and someone probably has) as well as Dos Amigos,
which serves outstanding Mexican food.
</P>
<P>
   A certain bravado, an esprit de Steamboat, prevails among
hot-shot skiers and snowboarders. As if the old-time swagger of the
cowboy has been reincarnated in today's snow dudes and snow babes.
I heard the following exchange between two buckos of about 20:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, man, how's yer face?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Great, man! (pointing to his teeth) See, you can't even tell
which ones they replaced!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent! Coulda been worse _ at least you didn't lose
consciousness, man!''
</P>
<P>
   (No, don't fret about dentist bills: There are plenty of
beginner and intermediate slopes, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Goodnight to Steamboat
</P>
<P>
   Our final evening was spent in charming quarters: Steamboat Bed
and Breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The early-1900s house, white with blue-green trim and a steep
tin roof to shed the snows, was originally the parsonage of a
Congregational church that stood next door before it was burned
down by a lightning strike (legend says the event was not
coincidental: the preacher was a rover). There are only five guest
rooms, airy and immaculate, and a big living/dining area full of
plants, antiques and books.
</P>
<P>
   From our Sunset Room, cozily tucked under the eaves, I looked
down on the twinkling lights of town, just a few blocks away; the
faint outline of the Yampa winding through the dusk; the Howelsen
ski jump lit up with spotlights like a runway of the gods.
</P>
<P>
   True, I hadn't taken in the night view from Hazie's Restaurant
on Mount Werner, known as the Steamboat experience. Maybe next
time. For now, I was still reliving the view from that lofty spot
in broad daylight, and I couldn't imagine anything grander.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 10
 &HT;    Bean entrepreneur Don Wilson traded the fast track for a more
measured life
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Don Wilson had sipped and stirred his future
for years.
</P>
<P>
   It just took him a while to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he liked this North Georgia town, having moved to the
self-proclaimed Poultry Capital of the World from Scotland in 1986
as an animal science researcher. (``I like the climate and Lake
Lanier(Ga.),'' he says in a dancing Highland lilt, ``and I find the
people to be very natural and very friendly.'') After that, he
climbed the ranks as an animal industry veterinarian at Hoffmann-La
Roche, an international pharmaceutical company that had its
subsidiary, Agri-Bio, based here.
</P>
<P>
   But that big-money job developing antibiotics for farm animals
meant constant travel away from his wife and children, and a
growing reliance on alcohol to smooth out the rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he gave up the hard stuff and immersed himself in the
world of coffee. Always a connoisseur of the bean _ even back home,
among the tea and biscuit crowd of Edinburgh _ he became addicted
to learning its finer points.
</P>
<P>
   And one day, he looked up from his daily cup of joe at
Gainesville's homegrown haven _ St. Ives Coffeehouse tucked into a
quirky 1912 house just down from the town's fashionable mansions _
and pondered its brightly painted walls and funky lampshades.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, yes, and smelled the coffee. He'd been looking for a
new way to bring home the bacon; why not something he already
loved?
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly realized,'' says Wilson, ``this looked like a much
better way of life than hanging out in planes and airports.''
</P>
<P>
   So he bought the small retail business _ lock, stock and bags of
beans in the basement _ from Gil and Barbara Johnson, who wanted to
trade the company they'd founded in 1989 for a chance to sail the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say they want to be their own boss and do
something more fulfilling,'' he says. ``But they don't. More
important than money, power and position is personal contentment.''
</P>
<P>
   With its divided rooms where students study for hours in one
corner while others smoke and chat in another, the coffeehouse
already had plenty of atmosphere. Wilson added colorful displays
from local artists, antique lamps with various shapes to the light,
grazing menu.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before he plunged into the wholesale side of the
coffee business in early 1997, turning a warehouse tucked in
between the chicken-processing plants into the headquarters of St.
Ives Coffee Roasters Inc. The jewel of the expanded operation is a
roasting plant capable of turning out 2,000 pounds a day, 20 tons a
week.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Just take a whiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a rose among the thorns,'' jokes Wilson, pulling up to
his warehouse in a blue Dodge pickup. ``It's kind of ironic I ended
up right across the street from the poultry business. In fact, the
building I am in now was where we marketed antibiotics for the
chicken industry.''
</P>
<P>
   His 5,000-square-foot building is chock-full of all things java:
flavored syrups, hefty 100-pound burlap sacks full of raw beans,
rows and rows of roasted bagged beans waiting to be shipped to
gourmet shops and, of course, a coffee room where he samples new
brews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zimbabwe Pinnacle,'' he says, dipping his hand into a sample
bag. ``That's my new favorite up-and-coming bean. We're delighted
with it. Look at its beautiful pastel shade and how round and
perfect the shape is. It has good acidity, too. Some people think
it has an aftertaste like burgundy wine.''
</P>
<P>
   A better cup
</P>
<P>
   Not that he'd know firsthand anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 44, understands there are no guarantees in the highly
competitive wholesale coffee market, but he never regrets walking
away from his old job _ lucrative and secure as it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reviewed my whole life and where it was leading,'' he says,
sitting in an office full of boxes, labels and product information.
``I decided I didn't like where it was leading. I felt I was at
grave risk for alcohol dependence and decided to do everything I
could do to break it.''
</P>
<P>
   He checked himself into Smyrna's (Ga.) Ridgeview Institute and
emerged sober and committed to helping others, agreeing to be part
of Bill Moyers' public television series, ``Moyers on Addiction:
Close to Home'' that aired last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he's not working or with his family, Wilson helps
others in recovery. ``I want to be brutally honest about it,'' he
says. ``I want people to know it's soul-destroying. I want people
to know there is help. And it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally passionate about beans, Wilson traveled to the mountains
of Costa Rica in 1997 to visit La Minita, one of the world's most
discerning coffee estates, home to 175,000 coffee trees. There, he
and his master roaster, Scott Tyre, toured the factory and fields,
picked beans by hand and studied the subtle complexities of
harvesting, milling, processing and roasting.
</P>
<P>
   He also learned the fine art of sorting La Minita's beans. The
100 workers appear to be playing solitaire as they carefully
inspect each bean; only a select 5 percent of each crop is deemed
worthy of La Minita's label.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the highest quality in the world,'' Wilson says.
``Every single bean is perfect because every single bean is
hand-selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson sells La Minita coffee beans for $13.99 a pound; the
brand is one of his best sellers. By comparison, Jamaican Blue
Mountain is his most expensive coffee at $29.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   What St. Ives specializes in, he says, is known as specialty
coffee _ ``the king of the coffee lineage.'' The highest grade of
coffee available, it's made from Class 1 beans (on a scale of 1 to
5).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's J. Martinez &AMP; Co., which supplies coffee to fine
restaurants and stores such as Williams-Sonoma, sells only estate
coffee, grown on family-run Jamaican estates. (Specialty coffees
can also be estate coffees, if they come from a single plantation _
such as La Minita.)
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's imported beans come from all over the world to be
roasted and packaged on-site, and he claims they're the finest and
freshest in Georgia. Or maybe the entire Southeast, he boasts,
after steaming a perfect cup to give a quick lesson on color,
texture and taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``See this espresso,'' he says, pouring off the dark, thick
liquid from a tiny silver pitcher. ``A good espresso should have a
red flash to it, a reddish-brown tint to it and a perfect `crema'
at the top. Our espresso blend is a big seller. It's a mix of
French Italian, Vienna and Costa Rican Tarrazu beans.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the locals agree with his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go every morning at 8 a.m., after I drop off my kids at
school and before I go to work,'' says Doyle Johnson, 47, who owns
his own clothing business. ``They roast and brew different coffee
every day. It's always fresh.'' Sandy Easterbrooks, a massage
therapist at the nearby Relaxation Center, unwinds in the pleasant
patio area. Here, the business' namesake, ivy, trickles down the
white and green-trimmed house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I especially like to sit under the trees outside when the
weather is nice and talk to friends,'' Easterbrooks says.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gainesville residents who've moved on but still desire
the St. Ives taste (packaged in bright blue bags adorned with the
logo: ``The closest you can get to the coffee tree'') order it by
mail from as far away as Alaska, Australia and Hawaii (really).
Even a just-passing-through New Yorker took a shine to Wilson's
beans last year. He sent the St. Ives retail staff an e-mail saying
how impressed he was with the ``great coffee in Gainesville.'' The
letter hangs above the sink in the small kitchen where salads and
quiches are prepared.

<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Ga.: are prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The beans, baby
</P>
<P>
   But all St. Ives beans arrive green. They must be roasted _ and
roasted right _ to end up as a fine cup of coffee, espresso,
cappuccino or cafe fortissimo (an original St. Ives creation of
espresso over ice with cream and brandy extracts.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do with specialty coffee is roast it
wrong,'' Wilson says. ``Every single bean has its own protocol as
to how we roast it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter his mean green Diedrich C-180 Coffee Roaster with its
rocketlike dimensions and a control panel of silver knobs, buzzers
and lights. ``This baby can do 300 pounds at a pop,'' Wilson says,
patting his $100,000 investment with pride. ``There's no other
roaster like it in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's only one other roaster like it in the world.
``This is the prototype for a roaster this big,'' Wilson says.
``They then went ahead and built a second one after mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The mighty machine is gas-fired with a spinning drum the size of
a kiddie wading pool. Wilson and Tyre, who's also in charge of
production, usually roast a few mornings a week at the wholesale
site. The retail store cooks up smaller batches nearly every
morning in a mini-roaster.
</P>
<P>
   After roasting, the now-darkened beans are blown by a vacuum-air
system to a packing machine where they're measured and poured warm
into the bright blue St. Ives bags. Wilson uses a state-of-the-art
bag (lined in aluminum with a one-way valve that minimizes
oxidation) that gives the coffee a shelf life of at least nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   St. Ives also caters to those who like their coffee flavored,
preferring such concoctions as Chocolate Hazelnut or Pralines and
Cream over the purebred Kona, Sumatra and Vienna Roast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, y'know Southern'rs, wot they like, Southh'rn Peecan
fla'vr,'' Wilson says, rolling his Highland lilt so far it crosses
into the next county. St. Ives' flavored creations are sold under
the Hawthorne Hills Gourmet Coffee name; two-ounce sample packs are
typically sold in gift stores around the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson supplies St. Ives coffee to coffeehouses around the
state, including his own competition, a downtown coffee shop called
Penny University. (He chuckles when customers tell him the coffee
seems to have improved down the street.) He also stages frequent
tastings of his coffee, ever in search of converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try and do is get people to taste it,'' Wilson says.
``The usual reaction is, `Wow, that's wonderful coffee,' and we
hope they are hooked after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching the consumer there is a difference about specialty
coffee is important. These are not blends. They are the genuine
arabicas, and they do cost a bit more. But we are bringing the
highest level of coffee to the supermarket customer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wilson, waking up and smelling the coffee, then jumping into
it, hasn't been easy. Perhaps most difficult, says Dennis MacArdle,
Wilson's wholesale director, is the challenge of getting people to
change the coffee they'v always brewed at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, when they buy specialty coffee, they usually go
right to the brand they already know and drink,'' says MacArdle, a
former children's dentist who also made a midlife career switch.
``Name recognition and deep pockets is what it takes in this
business. If you have that, you might be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's determined not to give up too soon like many small
coffee business ventures. ``There are coffee-roasting shops and
kiosks opening monthly everywhere, including in Georgia,'' MacArdle
says. ``We know because we supply some of them. I went to one in
Alpharetta (Ga.) the other day, and it was gone. Ace Hardware next
door had expanded into it. ''
</P>
<P>
   A measured life
</P>
<P>
   John Martinez, who's operated Atlanta's J. Martinez &AMP; Co. coffee
business the past 10 years, calls the smaller roasting enterprises
such as St. Ives the microbreweries of the coffee world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at the number of coffee roasters popping up in and
around Georgia,'' Martinez says. ``And they have potential to sell
to the local market.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's own beans range in price from $10 to $300 a pound and
come directly from his Jamaican homestead and coffee plantation.
</P>
<P>
   His critique on St. Ives: ``Not bad. It's a typical generic
coffee that one would buy from a broker.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can't impress everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the judges at the 1998 Atlanta National Gourmet Show
awarded a blue ribbon for best overall beverage to St. Ives'
entered drink _ an ice-cold espresso-based potion called St. Ives
China Bianco, made from coffee, chocolate, English Toffee Cream and
China Bianco flavored syrup. ``That's our only prize so far, ''
Wilson says, peering up at the award above the jars upon jars of
brown beauties. ``We were slightly amazed by it, actually. It was
our first attempt at any contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it may seem crowded in corporate coffee land, with a
Starbucks or Caribou Coffee on every other corner and a Barnie's
Coffee &AMP; Tea in every mall, Wilson sees room for small, home-grown
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Starbucks, I don't know how people can stand to go
there,'' he says, setting down a cup of coffee (cream and sugar) on
a lace tablecloth at his coffeehouse. Whenever he gets on a coffee
rant, his accent thickens: ``They 'ave abso-lootely no characktar.
They'ara so damn sterile. They'ara like the McDonalds of tha coffee
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turns philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to build a nice, viable, medium-size company and
be able to stop once in awhile to take a vacation with my kids,''
he says, taking a sip before peering into the bottom of the cup and
beyond. (So far, so good: He estimates last year's sales at
$450,000 from the retail and wholesale businesses, which is twice
what he made the year before; he says he hopes to double that
figure this year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure of life in the year 2000 and beyond is going to
be unbelievable,'' Wilson reflects, reaching for a Vantage
cigarette he'll wait to smoke till he gets outside. ``Already, the
time for reflection and private thought is almost nonexistent. I
see highly intelligent people coming in here all the time really in
need of a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is ultimately where he thinks he comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my contribution is making a coffee that customers say
is bloody good,'' he says. ``At least it will help put them in a
better mood.''
</P>
<P>
   The man himself
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Born: Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Family: Married to Virginia; one son, Euan, 14 (who loves
coffee but only drinks the high-priced La Minita), and one
daughter, Natasha, 11 (who has not yet developed a taste for java).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Education: Doctorate of veterinary medicine, Edinburgh
University, 1977; member of the Royal College of Veterinary
Surgeons, 1977; and the British equivalent of an MBA, Bradford
University, England.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Guilty pleasure: Tennis, weight lifting and salmon fishing in
British Columbia. Holds the unofficial world record for catching a
``a cock and a hen King salmon back-to-back,'' he says, which
weighed a total of 107 pounds.
</P>
<P>

   You handbag lovers have a reason to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   The bags of the moment are smaller, hand-held styles,
reminiscent of ones carried in the '40s and '50s, such as Chanel's
quilted bag and Hermes structured Kelly bag, named for the late
actress Grace Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Today's hand-held versions range from a tiny canister-shaped
evening bag _ big enough for lipstick, mirror and a $20 bill _ to a
soft, casual tote that holds keys, a billfold and cell phone. They
come in leathers, knits, straws and a variety of linens and silks,
in a bonanza of shapes and colors.
</P>
<P>
   The return of hand-held bags, also called top-handle bags, is
attributed to femininity in fashion ready-to-wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``With fashion designers like Stella McCartney of Chloe and the
team of Dolce and Gabbana pushing ladylike clothes, bags needed to
be less serious and heavy-looking,'' says New York handbag designer
Marcia Sherrill. ``A satchel that you hold is less cumbersome than,
say, a shoulder bag and fits into the mood of today's dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Evening bag designer Mary Norton of Charleston, S.C., says her
customers, who include actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, like to carry
her colorful, whimsical bags to add a dash of glamour to that
little black dress. The eye-catching bags are decorated with
feathers, flowers or stones, whatever strikes Norton's fancy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that Americans spent $4.4 billion on
handbags last year, according to Accessories magazine's fashion
market editor Canty Gross. ``All ages are carrying these types of
bags,'' Gross says. ``Someone older, who is used to this style,
might opt for a more expensive Kleinberg Sherrill straw while a
younger woman would carry the woven nylon Sak, a trendy, less
expensive casual bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Many career women are also carrying these top-handle bags.
``It's a subtle trend,'' says New York trend tracker Ellen
Campuzano, ``yet a fresh approach to handbags.''
</P>
<P>
   And she points out one important selling point for those who
still love their shoulder bags: Many bags have long enough handles
_ or they come with a removable shoulder strap _ so they can be
slung over your shoulder.

 &HT;    Opry faces its future
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Twenty-five years after it moved to the suburbs, the
Grand Ole Opry is coming home. This Friday and Saturday, America's
longest-running live radio show returns to the halls of the
restored Ryman Auditorium _ its home for 31 years _ for three
shows. Few would have imagined this moment back on March 15, 1974,
when Johnny Cash and a cast of country music stars took the Ryman
stage for the last time and tearfully wailed ``Will the Circle Be
Unbroken,'' delivered as the building's eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of this historic homecoming, today's Grand Ole
Opry finds itself at a major crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 10 years, and especially since the closing of the
Opryland theme park in December 1997, management concedes that
ticket sales to Opry shows, now performed at the ``new''
glass-and-wood Opry House on the outskirts of town, have been down.
While the country music audience grows younger, spending millions
on pop-oriented acts such as Shania Twain, Garth Brooks and Faith
Hill, the Opry's cast of regulars is graying. Of the mainstay
performers, for example, Little Jimmy Dickens is 78, Jeannie Seely
is 58, Skeeter Davis is 67 and Bill Carlisle is 90. Many haven't
had a hit record in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``My folks grew up listening to this all their life; it takes
them back to their childhoods,'' says 21-year-old Joseph Ibrahim
after a recent Opry performance. ``But I kind of see it fading away
with my generation. I didn't know the people on the show. It would
be great if they could somehow let this generation know about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to continue the Opry tradition, a passel of newer
artists such as Brooks, Travis Tritt, Clint Black, Alan Jackson and
Patty Loveless have joined the cast, but they appear infrequently,
some not even giving the required four performances a year. (For
decades, the Opry had a strict policy that members were expected to
make 26 appearances a year. The standard now is four, although some
artists, such as Black, have been no-shows in some years.) In the
audience on a recent Saturday night, most ticket holders appear to
be senior citizens, or fast approaching retirement age. About a
fourth of the seats (admittedly, on a holiday weekend) were empty.
</P>
<P>
   In the competitive age of corporate radio, the clear-channel
signal of Nashville station WSM-AM, which once beamed the Opry to
places as far away as Canada, has been significantly diluted by
competing frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids (today) don't sit out in Decatur like I did with an
aerial antennae hanging out the window to listen to Hank
Williams,'' says Opry star Bill Anderson, 61. ``You can't even pick
up WSM in Atlanta anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also concern in the Nashville music community that the
Opry might disappear from television. Since 1985, a half-hour of
the Saturday night show has been broadcast over the Nashville
Network, which was recently purchased by CBS Cable. The New
York-based corporation has been bold in its attempt to seek younger
demographics for the channel, and many fear the Opry broadcast will
be edged out for youth-oriented programs such as ``Roller Jam,''
TNN's new Roller Derby show.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hughes, TNN vice president of programming, vehemently
denies the rumors. ``Our commitment to the Grand Ole Opry on
Saturday night is certainly a long-term one,'' he says, pointing
out that the show brings in 1 million viewers a week. But he also
says the network would like to see the TV broadcast become more
marketable. ``The Opry of today and the future is never one that
slights the older artists, but . . . part of the discussions we're
having (with Opry management) is to also bring young artists on
there who are getting radio play.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing times
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly be premature to sound the death knell for the
Opry, particularly when the company that owns it, Gaylord
Entertainment, says the show still makes money and is passionately
supported by artists and fans alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't even have country music if it weren't for the
Grand Ole Opry,'' declares newcomer Terri Clark, who has played the
Opry half a dozen times in the past two years. ``It's the heritage
and background that has made it possible for us to do what we're
doing now. We need to go there and play, to keep the Opry young,
because when this older generation goes away, who's going to come
to the Grand Ole Opry? We have the responsibility to make sure our
generation knows what's going on there. It isn't as much money as
going out and playing our own gigs, but we wouldn't be making that
money in the first place if it weren't for the Grand Ole Opry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stars are working tenaciously for its survival. Vince Gill
appeared more than 40 times on the Opry stage in 1998, mainly out
of a deep commitment to keep the show going. Major stars such as
Brooks lend their faces to the institution, talking about their
inductions as if their names had been inked onto the roll that's
called up yonder itself. According to her manager, Ken Kragen,
Trisha Yearwood is ``thrilled'' that she has been asked to join, to
be inducted this spring. And certainly there is still nothing like
the near-spiritual feeling of watching the program live. Opry stars
such as Dickens, Jean Shepard or Charley Pride may not be on
contemporary country charts, but their historical contribution to
country music is as valuable as any of today's Top 10 tunes.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, however, some corporate powers on Music Row have
shown signs of dollar-induced amnesia when it comes to the Grand
Ole Opry. As country music has boomed (going from a $700
million-a-year industry in 1990 to a $1.8 billion-a-year behemoth
in 1997), the stakes and competition have gotten higher. New acts
come and go on Music Row like couriers, delivering one hit song,
and then disappearing forever. The country music culture isn't
exclusively controlled by Nashville-based acts anymore, as free
agents such as Twain and LeAnn Rimes sell millions in spite of not
being in ``the club.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, new acts no longer have to step into the wooden
circle in the center of the Opry stage, the holy spot literally cut
out of the floor of the Ryman and transplanted into the new Opry
house in 1974, in order to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, the Opry was the premiere radio showcase for
country music in America, but it's not anymore,'' says historian
Paul Kingsbury, author of ``The Grand Ole Opry History of Country
Music. ``It's a hallowed institution that a lot of artists and fans
revere, but the Opry is no longer in the position to make careers.
A radio show emanating from WSM is not enough to really make a
difference in the careers of people like Marty Stuart or Vince Gill
or Garth Brooks. They don't need the Opry. It needs them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Opry vets such as Anderson are eager to entice new blood
into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what has to be changed at the Opry more than anything
is that we have lived with the attitude that the world is going to
beat a path to our door,'' says Anderson. ``This is almost the year
2000, and things change. I think maybe we got to start meeting
folks halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't an easy task. The basic Opry format has changed little
since the days when hillbilly acts such as Uncle Dave Macon and the
Fruit Jar Drinkers were the main attraction, and that familiarity
is part of the show's appeal. Sure, the Opry has made way for
shifting tastes, such as the era of the pedal-steel singer in the
'50s, the Nashville sound of Patsy Cline in the '60s and even the
introduction of full drum kits to the stage by the mid-'70s. But
its main outlet has always been radio, specifically 650 on the
Nashville AM dial (WSM). In the age of the Internet and cable
television, that exposure is hardly a blip. And, more than just
about anything else, young country artists want exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every contemporary artist wants to be a member. It's an
honor to be involved,'' says Yearwood's manager Kragen. ``But from
a business standpoint, it really revolves around the value and
reach of TNN. It's more than the Opry; it's how much exposure do
you get by appearing on it versus doing other sorts of programs.''
</P>
<P>
   When acts appear on the Opry, they are paid union scale, which
is often no more than $500 to $1,000 an appearance. Unless they
appear on the nationally televised TNN broadcast, an entertainer
such as Brooks is only performing for an in-house audience of 3,000
and a radio audience of 100,000 during an Opry spot. In contrast,
for one night on the road, Brooks can clear a quarter of a million
dollars. And he can pack Central Park.

   NASHVILLE: Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the very thing that so endears the institution to country
fans _ its history and tradition _ may be one of the strongest
barriers to growth. The tight-knit Opry family can be notoriously
resistent to change. Though they may not be the moneymakers they
once were, their power is still strong in this town. Questioning
the Opry's future out loud seems to be a taboo, kind of like
visiting the big Baptist church downtown and pointing out that the
pews aren't full anymore. But for many of the older cast members,
it's their only prestigious performance venue; they gave up the
road years ago. Some of the members' livelihood actually depends on
the Opry check and the health benefits that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the baton
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to wake up in my lifetime and know there is no
more Grand Ole Opry,'' says Opry legend Porter Wagoner. ``It's a
very important cog in country music. It's the mother church, the
cornerstone of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Plopped in an overstuffed chair here in dressing room No. 14 at
the Grand Ole Opry house, the entertainer, 71, contemplates the
future of the Opry. His purple jacket, splashed with rhinestones,
rests on a hanger near a bright wall of dressing table lights. He's
smoking a cigarette, within earshot of the muffled sounds in the
busy hallway outside _ fiddles, bursts of laughter, people tuning
guitars and the clack-clack-clack of square dancers in their shiny
white tap shoes and red gingham skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a picture of me and Minnie Pearl made back in 1970,''
he says, surrounded by four walls of framed photographs crammed
together like mounted pages out of a country music yearbook. ``Me
and `Strang' was good friends,'' Wagoner notes, pointing to a faded
color snapshot of the late comic Stringbean. There's a
black-and-white image of a much younger Wagonmaster (as Porter has
long been called) nestled up against a girlish Dolly Parton, their
matching blond pompadours nearly as big as their toothy smiles. But
tucked in between the vintage portraits, there's also Porter with
Garth Brooks. Porter with Travis Tritt. Porter with Alan Jackson,
Patty Loveless and Vince Gill.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is striking. These younger, slicker artists seem
out of a different time and place than Wagoner and his Hall of Fame
friends. They are the savvy, uptown acts that have turned the once
homespun country music business into a global industry. But the
star with the biggest name recognition in Nashville _ more than
Porter, more than Gill or even Garth _ is still the Grand Ole Opry
itself. Even the green-and-white city limits sign proclaims
Nashville not the center of the billion-dollar country music
recording industry but ``Home of the Grand Ole Opry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants the Opry to thrive for years to come, and I
think there will be a collective effort in Nashville to make sure
this happens,'' says Steve Buchanan, president of the Grand Ole
Opry Group. ``To me, the Opry has always been evolutionary. When
you look at the Grand Ole Opry today, you have to do it in context
with its entire history. It's a vital institution that provides you
with an association with people like Hank Williams and Patsy Cline,
which is still a tremendous marketing value. From a cultural
standpoint, it's important. The Opry is still very much a part of
the Nashville experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's job is to keep it that way. Many here are hoping this
newly appointed head of the show _ a 35-year-old Vanderbilt
graduate who is devoted to the Opry and understands its tradition _
will be the one to make sure the Opry survives into the 21st
century without becoming a museum piece under glass. For the past
five years, he has overseen the resurrection of the renovated Ryman
Auditorium, pumping new life into the old building by booking not
only bluegrass and gospel shows into the venue, but rock acts as
well. It's his idea to bring the Opry back to its roots with the
two special shows this weekend, giving hundreds of fans a chance to
see the Opry in the Ryman for the first time. Buchanan's main
challenge, however, is in courting younger artists while ensuring
that the history and contributions of the older acts aren't
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than leading the industry, the Opry seems to have become
the place where stars return when the spotlight isn't quite as hot
anymore. ``Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I think you need a home to
come to, and that's what the Opry has been to me and my
generation,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner agrees. ``The Opry acts as a stabilizer for your career.
Garth won't be selling out 50,000-seat arenas 20 years from now.
You have to have something to fall back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Whittaker, outgoing president of the Grand Ole Opry Group,
laughs when he says, ``A lot of people would like to read the
(Opry's) obituary right now. But, hey, I've got news for them. The
Opry has more lives than Bill Clinton. Nashville isn't going to let
anything happen to this.''

 &HT;    This landlubber flags interest in boats
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was some talk at my house about a group of us
females going to sales and, mayhap, finding me something new to
wear.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, I was all for it. But in actuality . . . well, I
pulled up a wool throw and scrooched down in the corner of the sofa
closest to the fireplace and picked up a book.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were mystified when they saw the title. But the males
in the family who lent it to me felt that at last I was showing
respect for the important things in life: boats. At least two of
them have boats, and the others either have had boating experience
or yearn for it. They understood completely why I would opt for an
afternoon with ``Chapman Piloting: Seamanship &AMP; Small Boat
Handling,'' a volume now in its 62nd edition.
</P>
<P>
   My interest in Chapman's hefty volume centered on the Coast
Guard and storm warning flags. I had asked around _ for dark
literary purposes of my own _ whatever happened to the storm
signals they used to fly from the top of the Van Antwerp Building
in Mobile, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Cut them out six years ago, one of my boaters told me. With
radio and television, it is no longer necessary for Mobilians to
break their necks scanning the eminence of the 24-story skyscraper
for a warning flag. I protested. You can't have a hurricane without
the Coast Guard's blood red ensigns flying, two at a time, from the
Van Antwerp Building, I told them.
</P>
<P>
   In Creola, 18 miles from the coast and the warning flags, we
managed to keep track of approaching storms by telephoning family
in Mobile who could see the sky over the old drug-store-office
building. We started keeping track the day somebody told us the
small craft warning was up _ a blood red triangular shaped flag.
</P>
<P>
   After that they got more serious: Gale warnings were two red
pennants that told us winds ranging from 39 to 54 mph were on the
way. Even the youngest child knew that two square red flags with
black centers meant trouble _ a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I needed the Chapman book to tell me these important
facts, but once learned, the storm signals could be stowed away by
my computer until I got back from shopping for a new dress, my
daughters told me. What they reckoned without was the fascination
of this big book.
</P>
<P>
   Although I haven't a boat now, I look at them with longing when
we pass boatyards where they are stored or for sale. Lucky people,
I think, to have a boat of their own. Lucky people to slide one
overboard at the Carrabelle, Fla., marina and take off for the
little sand and pine-clad island across the blue waters of the
sound.
</P>
<P>
   When we had a boat, during my husband's lifetime, I could run it
while he fished, and once or twice I took it out on my own to cross
the sound to the grocery store. But I was aware that if I was alone
when the engine quit, I might drift out of the sound and into the
Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   So I have bumbled along for 10 years hitching rides on te boats
of friends and relatives. But with Chapman's big book to guide me,
who knows but what I'd be a safe mariner? (You can also take
lessons from the Coast Guard.)
</P>
<P>
   It is more interesting by far than shopping for clothes. Now
signal flags . . . if I had a boat, I'd need all kinds of flags,
for they speak the language of the sea, telling random observers
important things about you and your craft. There is one picture of
a sailing ship ``dressed,'' which means it is flag strung from
stern to bow and so beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, I missed the glorious holiday sales. I was deep
in the chapter headed ``Boat Handling Under Adverse Conditions.'' A
different kind of sail _ and totally interesting to a landlubber
wrapped up in a wool throw and scrooched down by a fire.

Travel Couriers (IAATC).
</P>
<P>
   The number of scheduled courier flights from U.S. cities will
top a record 40,000 this year, according to the IAATC's Air Courier
Bulletin, which tracks courier flights worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that those interested in giving up their
luggage space to courier firms in exchange for a discounted air
ticket will have more opportunities. Typically, a courier will
carry shipping documents to be turned over to the courier company's
agents when the aircraft lands.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of deals are out there? How about $150 to $300 to
Europe and even Asia? You have to be flexible; you travel on the
courier's timetable, but you can expect to stay from three days to
several weeks.

 &HT;    Music to your ears or not, some shows just work
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The era of big British blockbusters may have peaked
with ``Miss Saigon'' on Broadway in 1991, but out here on the road
there's a powerful echo effect. We go and listen to these
BritBlocks again and again and. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats'' already has been to Atlanta 12 times, playing to
approximately 400,000 people. Its visit this week to the Fox
Theatre gives us the dubious honor of having hosted the national
tour more than any other city. The old war horse (war kitty?) will
be followed at the Fox by ``Les Miserables'' and ``Evita'' _ while
``Miss Saigon'' lands at the Atlanta Civic Center for its second
local run _ over the next eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says that these shows are a triumph of sets
over substance; there is some truth to that, but then the splendid
``Les Miz'' would work on a bare stage. Yes, these shows are
arguably grandiose, but one person's bombast is another's thrill.
One also hears that composers Andrew Lloyd Webber and Claude-Michel
Schonberg and their various lyricists are lightweights (again,
partly true), but the box office doesn't lie. It proclaims that
these fellows are veritable RodgersandHammersteins compared to the
milky American musical-theater writers who followed them in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   What explains the catniplike frenzy inspired by these shows? Why
are many critics still not sold on them? We've sketched out some
theories at right.
</P>
<P>
   `Cats'
</P>
<P>
   (Tuesday-Jan. 17, Theater of the Stars, Fox Theatre.
404-817-8700.)
</P>
<P>
   Why millions love it:
</P>
<P>
   Dazzling feline costuming/makeup and a giant, cat's-eye-view
junkyard create a fully theatrical illusion. Plus, those critters
have claimed human laps and hearts at least since ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Why some don't:
</P>
<P>
   Some strung-together poems _ even by the great T.S. Eliot _ do
not a story make. Sure, kitties dance and sing, but what happens?
</P>
<P>
   Secret to its staying power :
</P>
<P>
   From its 1982 opening until 1994, the show had no Disney stage
competition and cornered the family market. There's more good
melody to Andrew Lloyd Webber's score than the tiresomely ranted
``Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   `Les Miserables'
</P>
<P>
   (Jan. 19-24, Theater of the Stars/MasterCard Broadway Series,
Fox. 404-817-8700.)
</P>
<P>
   Why millions love it:
</P>
<P>
   The Victor Hugo saga of revolutionary France is bracingly
sweeping, the Claude-Michel Schonberg/Alain
</P>
<P>
   Boublil score a veritable melodic tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   Why some don't:
</P>
<P>
   Laughs are scarcer than showers in old Paris hotels. Tons of
plot fly past you in the lyrics: As comedian Richard Lewis said
despairingly, ``What are those people saying?''
</P>
<P>
   Secret to its staying power:
</P>
<P>
   Heroes and heroines you can really root for. For all of its
old-fashioned sentimentality, the 1987 show has a spiritual core
that never goes out of style.
</P>
<P>
   `Evita'
</P>
<P>
   (Feb. 9-14, MasterCard Series, Fox. 404-817-8700.)
</P>
<P>
   Why millions love it:
</P>
<P>
   Two words: Sex and power, driving the saga of Argentine cult
figure Eva Peron. This 1978 show foresaw the retro-'40s look. New
tour showcases Latin-born performers.
</P>
<P>
   Why some don't:
</P>
<P>
   The dark ironies of Hal Prince's direction may smack too much of
`` '70s seriousness'' for our apolitical, escapist age.
</P>
<P>
   Secret to its staying power:
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber's music, and the enduring puzzle: Was Evita a saint
of the people or the devil in a white dress?
</P>
<P>
   `Miss Saigon'
</P>
<P>
   (Feb. 18-Mar. 6, MasterCard Series, Atlanta Civic Center.
404-817-8700).
</P>
<P>
   Why millions love it:
</P>
<P>
   Sure the helicopter's neat, but it's mere window dressing on a
1991 Nicholas Hytner production of tremendous, cinematic sweep.
Schonberg/Boublil score is sub-``Miz'' but still good.
</P>
<P>
   Why some don't:
</P>
<P>
   It's billed as ``Madame Butterfly'' updated to 1970s Vietnam,
but it's really ``Gone With the Wind'' with GIs and strippers. Pass
the hanky.
</P>
<P>
   Secret to its staying power:
</P>
<P>
   Same reason that some don't like it:
</P>
<P>
   Nothing beats love in wartime for pulling in the soap-opera
crowd, as Margaret Mitchell knew so well.

THE AD WORLD RECOGNIZES A GOOD THING: OBSCURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Jan. 10) 
(JT) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Michael Jordan, Cindy Crawford, Bill Cosby and the other
superstars and supermodels. Here comes a phalanx of the prefamous:
gonnabes, wannabes and whozzats peddling products in commercials,
ads and billboards as if they were instantly recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Some are totally unknown. Others are second- or third-tier
stars. Still others are familiar only in narrowly focused fields.
For instance, here's Rufus Wainwright selling eyeglasses and
apparel. There's Alyson Hannigan and Derrick May hawking backpacks.
And look, Bryden Lando and Miguel Oca are pitching cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Who? What? Wainwright is a singer, Ms. Hannigan is an actress,
May is a musician, Lando is a surfer, Oca plays water polo.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue is enthusiastically climbing down the food chain
of celebrity because the public is wearying of big names growing
richer with deal after big endorsement deal. Advertisers are
learning that the best way to cultivate a cutting-edge image may be
to sign up spokesmodels who may be known only to an in crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It confers on an advertiser a presumption of hipness that it
has been able to get people so cool you never heard of them,'' said
Bob Garfield, the advertising critic for the trade publication
Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you don't know this guy (or gal). But you
suspect you ought to.
</P>
<P>
   The quasi celebrity first gained favor in the 1980s, when brands
like Gap, Amaretto di Saronno, Absolut, Barneys New York, L.A.
Eyeworks and Rose's Lime Juice had ads with artists (Andy Warhol,
Ed Ruscha), actors (Julian Sands, B.D. Wong), actresses (Laura
Dern, Joan Chen), performers (Sandra Bernhard, Phoebe Legere) and
writers (Tama Janowitz, Tony Kushner).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the discovery of the corners of our culture,'' said
Gai Gherardi, who with Barbara McReynolds is a co-owner of the L.A.
Eyeworks eyeglasses company in Los Angeles, which has run more than
160 advertisement displaying portrait photographs of lesser knowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the glorious position of being in a town with a lot
of people working toward their 15 minutes of fame,'' Ms. Gherardi
said. Her subjects have ranged from Debi Mazar, an actress, and
Phranc, a singer, to the actor Udo Kier and the Elvis Presley
impersonator known as El Vez.
</P>
<P>
   The trend favoring proto-, crypto- and neo-celebrities waned in
the early 1990s, in part because of the rise of the supermodel as
the premier peddler. But as Cindy, Naomi and Linda were declining
to mere mortal status, the prefamous were returning with renewed
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers say that consumers rarely, if ever, complain about
being puzzled or put off by studying an ad to determine who's
Justin Bond (a drag performer), Michelle Yeoh (a kung-fu star) or
Bokeem Woodbine (an actor). Rather, they may be intrigued or
impressed that the advertisers rank among the cognoscenti.
</P>
<P>
   That's the response reported by Rockport shoes for a campaign
from the Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners ad agency, which features such
semi-celebrities as Clint Rosemund, a Web site builder; James
Cramer, a financial journalist; Spalding Gray, the monologist, and
the performers RuPaul and John Leguizamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction was, `It's cool Rockport knows who that is,'''
said Linda Lewi, senior vice president for global brand marketing
at the Rockport Company in Marlborough, Mass. ``It's about
generating heat and buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Jansport, the backpack marketer, describes a similar response to
its roster of demi-celebrities (not to be confused with Demi Moore,
a celebrity).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a coolness to being the one who knows the person,''
said Jackie Kempher-Jones, advertising manager for Jansport in
Appleton, Wis. ``And we need to push that we're a cool, innovative
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Jansport's not-quite-stars include Ms. Hannigan, who appears on
the television series ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' as Buffy's
friend Willow; May, who helped popularize the music known as
techno; Boyd Tinsley, violinist for the Dave Matthews Band, and the
Olympic athletes Jonny Moseley and Jenny Thompson. The only really
recognizable face belongs to the actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, who
appears on the television series ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   Those niche celebrities, as Ms. Kempher-Jones calls them, help
Jansport reach consumers ages 14 to 22. On the other end of the
demographic spectrum, Anne Klein sponsored an advertising insert
this fall that served as a showcase for niche celebrities who would
appeal to the brand's intended audience of women ages 35 to 60.
They included Ms. Thompson; Ms. Yeoh; Ann Richards, the former
governor of Texas; the playwright and performer Anna Deavere Smith;
Julie Taymor, the director of the musical ``The Lion King''; the
actress Joan Allen, and Wendy Goodman, a style editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're women who have accomplished something or who are on
track to,'' said Laura Wenke, senior vice president for marketing
and communications at Anne Klein and Co. ``The legends and the
future legends.''
</P>
<P>
   The response was so positive, Ms. Wenke said, that for spring
1999 there will be a second insert with a new cast of
personalities, including the photojournalist Mary Ellen Mark; the
makeup entrepreneur Trish McEvoy; the dancer Anne Reinking, and
Caroline Paul, a San Francisco firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for the campaign, which Ms. Wenke described as
``reality-based marketing,'' is to find women to whom the Anne
Klein customer ``can relate.''
</P>
<P>
   That points out another reason for the rash of marginal
celebrities: a shift in the culture that plays down the big stars
perceived by consumers as unreachable, in favor of those who appear
more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less famous, you can more identify with,'' said Bill Lane,
partner and creative director at the McCaffery Ratner Gottlieb &AMP;
Lane ad agency. For the Punch cigar brand sold by Villazon and Co.,
McCaffery Ratner is running a campaign featuring the actor Dennis
Hopper, the author George Plimpton and Wayne Knight, who portrayed
the reviled Newman on ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy smoking our cigars wouldn't feel uncomfortable
striking up a conversation with Dennis Hopper or Newman,'' Lane
asserted. ``But he would feel uncomfortable if it were Paul
Newman.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign for a new men's fragrance from Chanel, Allure Homme,
is based on a similar premise. The ads show interesting-looking men
identified only by their professions and pursuits like hockey
player, film maker, jazz musician, surfer/student (Lando) and
Olympic gold medalist (Oca).
</P>
<P>
   Marketers like Chanel that are edging toward the edgy face
rather than the celebrated one say they perceive a consumer
backlash against traditional advertising practices like lucrative
endorsement contracts and models as role models.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In focus groups, said Laurie Palma, vice president for fragrance
marketing at Chanel Inc., men shown the Allure Homme ads described
the less famous personalities as not only more relatable but also
more believable.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting a typical comment from the men who were interviewed,
she said: `` `They're not just pretty boys paid a lot of money.'
When we were testing a variety of concepts, we asked them about
Michael Jordan, Paul Newman, and they said, `You can pay anyone a
lot of money and they will endorse anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garfield, the ad critic, said: ``When a celebrity is involved,
people can now see the transaction. We see the agent and lawyer and
the check being cut.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign for Coach leather goods featured, in addition to Ms.
Yu and Ms. Kent, the writers John Irving and Gloria Steinem;
Felecia Davis, an architect; the gallery owner Holly Solomon; the
singer Cassandra Wilson, and Milla Jovovitch and Lara Flynn Boyle,
actresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a classic American brand like Coach,'' said Reed Krakoff,
the company's senior vice president and executive creative
director, it would be ``out of character for us to hire a very
famous person because that's not how people perceive us. I don't
think it rings true.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of ringing, an added benefit to hiring the hardly
famous is that the cash register rings a lot more softly when it
comes to paying them. ``To use someone extraordinarily famous can
be extraordinarily expensive,'' Krakoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The mildly celebrated usually are paid four or five figures for
their participation in campaigns compared with the six or seven
figures that can usually be commanded by the bigger stars in the
Hollywood and sports firmaments.
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers say they plan to fine-tune their mix and become
more celebrified for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our names will be more mainstream,'' said Ms. Wenke at
Anne Klein, referring to the appearances of the actresses Kim
Delaney (``N.Y.P.D. Blue'') and Camryn Manheim (``The Practice'')
in the spring ad insert.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, intend to go the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next year, we'll be concentrating more on third-tier
instead of second-tier celebrities,'' said Ms. Kempher-Jones at
Jansport.
</P>
<P>
   Why? One of the Jansport unknowns has lost her ``un'': Ms.
Hewitt, who leapt from ``Party of Five'' to films like ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she's almost overexposed,'' Ms. Kempher-Jones said
plaintively.
</P>
<P>
   If they get too hot, they'll be out of work.

A JAZZ VIRTUOSO IS PICKY ABOUT THE DETAILS

 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Joshua Redman would be the first to tell you, he
is a picky kind of fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, the jazz saxophonist and band leader, was poring over
shirts at the Prada store on Madison Avenue last Wednesday, looking
for stagewear for his coming two-week tour of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As his personal shopper at Prada, Ola Itani, brought in several
dozen selections, each individually boxed with a clear plastic top,
he zoomed in on defect after defect. The color was wrong on one,
the collar too long on another, the shape on a third was too boxy
and a single button on a fourth interrupted an otherwise clean line
of Velcro closures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might see something appealing, but if there's one thing
about it I don't like, I reject it,'' Redman said. ``I'm really,
really picky.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman can afford to be exacting. He graduated summa cum laude
from Harvard in 1991 with the intention of becoming a lawyer, but
instead began a musical career that quickly turned luminous. He won
the Thelonious Monk Institute's prestigious jazz saxophone
competition in 1991, and since then has released six CDs.
</P>
<P>
   He has been on the cover of Down Beat, the jazz magazine, and is
one of the rare musicians who have both critical acclaim and
crossover appeal. He has played with old masters like Milt Jackson,
blown the saxophone with Bill Clinton on the White House lawn and
performed with the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as attuned as he is to the demands of his own taste, he says
he is uneasy with the privileges of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my mother knew I had a personal shopper ...,'' he said,
trailing off. ``It's just a bizarre concept. I prefer to think of
Ola as my friend who gives me great style advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman is used to being of two worlds. He grew up in poverty in
Berkeley, Calif., with his mother, Renee Shedroff. His father,
Dewey Redman, the saxophonist who is best known for his work with
jazz greats like Ornette Coleman, Charlie Haden and Keith Jarrett,
lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Redman excelled academically, won a full scholarship to Harvard,
was accepted at Yale Law School and along the way exchanged the
surname Shedroff for Redman.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a jazz phenom for most of the '90s. Redman is now
29, nearing 30; he is married, to Gabrielle Armand, and has a
suburban home in the Westchester County community of Sleepy Hollow.
He is closing in on full-scale adulthood, and that, of course, can
change the way anybody dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped wearing ties for a long time, but I started again
about six months ago after discovering Prada,'' he said. ``I felt
like I was a banker. Maybe it was my age, but for a while I felt
that anything that had the trappings of business I didn't feel
right about, as a musician.''
</P>
<P>
   But Redman hasn't completely gone over to designer wear. When
he's not working, he's most likely to wear a pair of jeans and
sneakers. And he decided to begin the day's shopping expedition at
a Gap outlet across the street from Bloomingdale's, where he hoped
to pick up some staple black T-shirts. He arrived in a black
cashmere Prada turtleneck, black DKNY slacks and zip-up black boots
from Kenneth Cole. Immediately the picky fellow emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find a good T-shirt,'' he remarked as he went
over the display of choices: ribbed, crew neck, V-neck and single
pocket. ``I mean, you'd think a T-shirt is a T-shirt, but it's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   He was drawn to a lighter-bodied shirt, and he rubbed the
material between thumb and forefinger. ``It has a tiny bit of
sheen,'' he said. ``I could get away with wearing that on stage,
with a nice shirt or coat.'' A saleswoman informed him that unlike
the outerwear T-shirts, the shirt he's holding is underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you hadn't told me that,'' he exclaimed. ``That's like
finding a great shirt and being told it's a woman's.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Redman bought the shirts anyway, seven of them, in
black and gray. And then, like stepping out of the subway and into
a limo, it was off to Prada, a sedate sea of rich fabrics in black
and gray with the occasional subdued color poking through.
</P>
<P>
   He began browsing through the bright, airy third-floor men's
department before Ms. Itani ushered him to a private room. He was
looking for ``not quite a suit _ a nice pair of pants, a coat and a
shirt with color.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Itani, who has been assisting Redman at Prada for the last
six months, brought bottles of San Pellegrino and ice, and began to
make suggestions. She knows that as a musician Redman has practical
considerations for his wardrobe. It must withstand the rigors of
the road, the constant packing and unpacking, and the demands of a
vigorous stage show.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Itani offered a pair of lightweight pale green pants made of
something she called cotton-paper. ``They crackle,'' she said,
rubbing them back and forth. Redman looked doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few songs, those are going to look really funky,'' he
said, ``and I don't mean good funky.''
</P>
<P>
   The color, too, was a problem. ``I don't usually wear things
that light,'' he said. He was concerned that a beige shirt might be
too much of a contrast with black pants. Pale gray? No. Light
green? No. Mustard yellow? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he selected a couple of shiny nylon short-sleeve shirts
_ in black and gray, of course _ and a pair of black slacks made of
a techno-stretch material. ``I love this fabric,'' Redman said.
``That texture and that slight sheen make it special, and it
virtually irons itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Redman would not be fully satisfied with his selections
before a visit with a tailor for alterations. Redman is very
particular about fit. ``I've got a real neurosis about things being
too short,'' he said. ``I was teased in the ninth grade about
wearing flooders.''
</P>
<P>
   A tailor arrived, but Redman, almost abashed, let it be known
that he would be happier with another man, Mostafa Mrabet, who had
altered his clothes satisfactorily before. ``I feel slightly
uncomfortable having all this attention,'' he said, ``but if you're
going to have a personal shopper, you may as well make the most of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, over a meal at the Paramount Hotel, near a shop that is
repairing his saxophone, Redman reflected on the intimate
connection of clothing and jazz, a culture that places a premium on
having a strong, identifiable personal style.
</P>
<P>
   The stylistic signatures leap out _ Lester Young's porkpie hat,
Dizzy Gillespie's beret and hipster pants, Miles Davis' sharp suits
of the 1950s, Wynton Marsalis' return to formality in the 1980s.
But Redman pointed out that those musicians also had distinctive
approaches to language and all elements of style.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing, he said, is the least important. Look at Charlie
Parker, after all, the bebop genius who could barely be bothered to
uncrumple a collar or straighten a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got such an amazingly original style musically,
what else matters?'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success, Redman is still searching for his own voice
on the saxophone, a quest that he feels will be lifelong. Likewise,
he is still refining his own clothing style, seeking personal
expression but avoiding anything that hints of affectation, like
that hoary jazz cliche, sunglasses after dark. ``I'd feel like an
idiot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm attracted to a look that's a combination of hot and cool,
that's casual and elegant at the same time, something that's
subdued and understated but also intense,'' he said. ``That's one
of the key elements of the way I approach jazz, this feeling of
relaxed intensity, and in a certain sense that's what I'm looking
for in terms of the way I dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly for a man who places such conflicting demands
on his music and his clothing, his absolute favorite piece of
apparel is something almost no one gets a chance to see: his black
Calvin Klein button-fly knit boxer shorts. ``They're totally
comfortable. What I should have done today is bought 20 more pairs.
I've got like three pairs, and that's 17 too few.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he has always wanted to wear a really stylish pair
of eyeglasses, but that his eyesight is too good and he can't
justify wearing nonprescription glasses just for the look. But he
accepts his cautious nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit of being picky,'' he said, ``is that I never have
any regrets.''

   RUSSIAN-ICEDANCER (New York) _ What do you get the teen-age girl
who has everything? A horse? A Miata? How about a real live Russian
ice-dance partner? Two years ago, when Ariel Williams, then a 10th
grader at the Dalton School in Manhattan, began to show promise in
ice dancing, her mother, Marian Williams, scouted for a full-time
partner for her. The search led to Dmitri Boundoukin, a
Russian-born skater who was soap-opera handsome. By Marcia
Biederman. Photo. &QL;

<P>
   NEW-AGE-COSMETICS (New York) _ If you are looking for
enlightenment in all the wrong places, how nice that cosmetics
companies are suddenly so eager to help. Because today, in
``Darwin's empty heaven,'' as the writer Chip Brown puts it in his
new book, ``Afterwards, You're a Genius: Faith, Medicine and the
Metaphysics of Healing'' (Riverhead Books), feeling good is the new
religion. And cosmetics companies are the newest of the new
prophets, turning the old notion of hope in a jar on its head. By

   WANNABE-CELEBRITIES (New York) _ Forget Michael Jordan, Cindy
Crawford, Bill Cosby and the other superstars and supermodels. Here
comes a phalanx of the prefamous: gonnabes, wannabes and whozzats
peddling products in commercials, ads and billboards as if they
were instantly recognizable. Some are totally unknown. Others are
second- or third-tier stars. By Stuart Elliott. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRUMP-PAGEANT (New York) _ On Thursday, the temperature had
dropped to a sub-freezing chill, but at Life, the nightclub on
Bleecker Street, things were heating up. Donald J. Trump, the real
estate developer, was expected at any moment for a promotional
party for the Miss U.S.A. Pageant, which will be broadcast live
next month on CBS. By Bob Morris. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ The tree tomato is one of those
beguiling novelties that the nursery trade is so fond of. It's not
a tomato at all, although it's a member of the same family, the
Solanaceae. It is a tropical shrub with the botanical name
Cyphomandra betacea. Its fruit _ which is usually yellowish-orange
rather than red _ is edible, but it doesn't taste like a tomato. By

A MAFIA SHOW _ WITH LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SOPRANOS 
Starring: James Gandolfini, Lorraine Bracco, Edie Falco, Michael
Imperiolo, Nancy Marchand 
On: HBO, Sunday at 9 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when we thought they were out of fashion, they pull us back
in . . . The mafia, that is, the Italian crime families that have
been satirized, romanticized, mythologized, and immortalized in
classic movies by greats like Francis Coppola and Martin Scorsese.
Sunday night at 9, HBO introduces a winning new series called ``The
Sopranos'' that reenergizes the overfamiliar world of made men,
blood-stained car trunks, pistol-whipping hotheads, and aging
crooks with names like Paulie and Uncle Junior. It's a crime drama,
of course, with plenty of thug violence and mob-boss power
struggles. But it's also a postmodern comedy that knowingly plays
on Prozac-era psychology and its own mafia genre. Indeed, by the
second episode Scorsese himself puts in a cameo appearance, walking
into an exclusive New York club. `` `Kundun' _ I liked it,'' a
young thug yells out to the director across the velvet rope.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ``The Sopranos'' is that Mob boss Tony Soprano, who
is violent enough to break a debtor's leg, is having a midlife
crisis. His family life is shaky, as his wife reels angrily from
knowledge of his mistress, and his ``family'' life is losing its
luster, in an era where ``everybody turns government witness'' _
and then author. He's depressed, and for consolation he has begun
to commune with the ducks in his New Jersey backyard, beckoning
them to join him in the swimming pool. One day, he collapses in the
yard, and soon after his doctor sends him to a psychiatrist, Dr.
Jennifer Melfi, who quickly puts him on Prozac. The show is framed
by Tony's sessions with the tough-minded Dr. Melfi, who reminds him
that doctor-patient confidentiality does not extend to murder.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes of Tony's personal life are the show's strongest, as
they call forth his more neurotic behavior. He is a man not to be
trifled with on the street, but he is fairly cowed by the powerful
women who surround him, particulary his mother, played beautifully
by Nancy Marchand. She's a manipulative, stubborn widow who gives
her son no credit for his efforts. His loyal wife, Carmela, also
wields her power over him, trying to hold their family together
with inspiration from a friendly priest. She is about to enter into
a struggle of wills with their teenage daughter, who is her equal
in the headstrong department. As Carmela, Edie Falco is wonderfully
blond and brassy. Meanwhile, Tony is becoming smitten with the good
doctor, as their rapport deepens. Soon, he is using her words as
his own outside of their sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's organized crime family is less interesting, except for a
competitive uncle and a hot-headed nephew played by Michael
Imperioli who has a habit of conducting heists behind Tony's back.
Tony is more reserved as he deals with these men. What adds
originality to the mob scenes are the allusions to real-life
mobsters like John Gotti, and a constant flow of references to
movies like ``The Godfather.'' This mob watches itself onscreen,
with one fellow (played by Bruce Springsteen guitarist Steve Van
Zandt) amusing his pals with imitations of Al Pacino in ``The
Godfather, Part III.'' Despite their use of a Scorsesean soundtrack
that reaches back to the 1950s, the show's creators work hard to
give the action a self-consciously present-tense quality. In a
coffee shop, for instance, Paulie laments that the mob never worked
the cappuccino craze. ``We invented this (expletive) and all these
(expletive) are getting rich on it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As Tony, James Gandolfini offers a subtle mix of pent-up
violence and sensitive boyishness. His performance works at both
extremes of Tony's personality, and he makes the therapy scenes,
which could seem contrived, completely natural. Welling up over his
beloved backyard ducks, his mobster is unexpectedly sympathetic.
Lorraine Bracco is also effective as Dr. Melfi, drawing Tony out
while trying _ not always successfully _ to reign in her judgement.
Her casting is an ongoing reminder of the show's strongest
influence, ``GoodFellas.'' No, ``The Sopranos'' is not the equal of
Scorsese's masterpiece, but it manages to bring a new spin to the
words ``dysfunctional'' and ''family,'' and it deserves its place
alongside other HBO gems like ``The Larry Sanders Show'' and ``Sex
and the City.''

HONDA'S CIVIC DUTY IS CLEAN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The most remarkable thing about the Honda Civic GX,
powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), is that it's so
unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The driveability of the natural-gas Civic feels nearly identical
to a run-of-the-mill, gasoline-powered Civic. Maybe a bit light on
torque at low engine speeds, but otherwise a normal Honda
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The big exception is that the CNG Civic produces 20 percent less
greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent gasoline vehicle, and
emits nearly zero hydrocarbons. The flip side is that cruising
range is limited to about 200 miles per tank of CNG, and CNG can be
hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by Honda's advanced VTEC engine, engineered to deliver a
wide range of power by varying its valve timing and lift according
to engine speed, the small four-cylinder engine in the GX actually
has a tad more muscle than the normal 1.6-liter engine: 110
horsepower in the case of the CNG engine, 106 for the gasoline
engine.
</P>
<P>
   This is not readily apparent on the road, especially saddled
with an automatic transmission, as it is in all GXs. Cruising
speeds are relaxed and comfortable, though acceleration is lax.
</P>
<P>
   The test car, borrowed for an afternoon from Showcase Honda,
came fully equipped with all the trim, comfort and convenience
upgrades, including air-conditioning, stereo system and power
windows, locks, mirrors and seats.
</P>
<P>
   The CNG package adds $4,500 to the price, but the extra cost is
largely offset by state and federal grants and breaks on taxes and
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic GX looks pretty much like any other Civic. The only
external clue is under the fuel flap, where instead of the usual
opening for the gas nozzle, there's a fitting for attaching a
pressure hose.
</P>
<P>
   The natural gas is contained in a large pressurized tank, sort
of a bulbous version of the familiar oxygen tank, or a helium tank
for filling party balloons. The tank takes up most of the trunk
space, leaving some snug space for grocery bags, but that's about
it.
</P>
<P>
   By its nature, the amount of CNG needed to be equivalent to a
10- or 12-gallon tank of gasoline requires a fairly large
container, about 4 feet wide and 1 foot across. Otherwise, the
cruising range would be even more limited.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Honda says its CNG Civic gets a ``real-world'' range
of 175 to 200 miles per tankful, or the equivalent of 28 miles per
gallon city, and 34 miles per gallon highway. That gas mileage is
testimony to Honda's well-designed engine: Natural gas has a lower
volatility than gasoline, so getting equivalent gas mileage is
something of an engineering feat.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas generally costs about two-thirds the price of a like
amount of gasoline. It's also plentiful, and not tied to overseas
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: Natural gas is easier on the mechanical parts of
an engine than gasoline. There's no liquid being squirted into the
engine, no carbon deposits, and no dilution of the motor oil with
unburned gas.
</P>
<P>
   The GX test car was classified as an Inherently Low Emission
Vehicle, or ILEV. There's also a GX model that meets California's
Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) standard. The ILEV category is
the more stringent of the two. Honda also has a gasoline-powered
Accord that meets the ULEV standard.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are essentially no compromises required for
driving the GX, aside from the reduced trunk space, getting fueled
up is another issue. At Showcase Honda, fleet sales director Gary
Kravetz said the GX, the only one currently on their lot,
customarily is taken to be fueled up to a fuel-delivery point near
Sky Harbor International Airport, a significant distance from the
dealership in the 1400 block of East Camelback Road.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the big issue with a natural-gas car _ fuel
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   Around Phoenix, it's not as challenging, because there are
locations in the downtown area. Also, people can get a state grant
to install a natural-gas delivery system in their homes, feeding
off the supply coming in for such things as the home-heating system
or water heater.
</P>
<P>
   A CNG car is largely tied to the urban area. With the maximum
200-mile cruising range, the GX or a similar natural-gas vehicle
would be unable to travel anywhere too far from a known supply of
natural gas. If you run out of gas in an isolated location in one
of these cars, you're (begin ital) really (end ital) out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   So despite its economic and clean-air advantages, the
natural-gas car faces a chicken-and-egg battle for acceptance.
People won't buy natural-gas cars until there are convenient places
to refuel them, but no infrastructure for refueling is likely until
there are more CNG cars on the road. &QL;

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ In a former life it was owned by the infamous
Fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In another incarnation it had a role in the 1968 children's
movie ``Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' and several other feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 120-foot yacht formerly called the ``Chryseis'' is being
prepared for yet another role: that of a floating bed-and-breakfast
inn on the waterfront of this island resort city about 50 miles
southeast of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Tied up at Pier 22, the two-masted schooner is undergoing an
extensive renovation as its latest owners prepare to open it in
early March. It has been renamed the ``Stacia Leigh'' after the
daughter of Pat and Bonnie Hicks, who are among the investors in
the bed-and-breakfast project.
</P>
<P>
   Docked just an oar's throw from the restored 1877 tall ship
Elissa, the inn will offer unusual close-up views of huge cargo
ships and the activities of a major seaport as well as close
proximity to shopping, entertainment and annual events such as
Mardi Gras in the city's downtown historic district, just a block
away.
</P>
<P>
   The bed-and-breakfast will be the latest attraction along the
stretch of waterfront from Pier 19 through Pier 22 that includes an
offshore oil industry museum, a picturesque shrimp boat fleet,
seafood restaurants, shops, a theater that features local history
documentaries and the 42-room Harbor House Hotel, the only other
inn on the busy Galveston Ship Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``Chryseis'' after it was built in Le Havre, France,
in 1906, the schooner was owned until 1937 by Louis Renault, the
designer and builder of Renault automobiles. He sold the yacht to
Count Galeazzo Ciano of Livorno, Italy, who married Mussolini's
daughter, Edda.
</P>
<P>
   Ciano was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1936 until 1943. A
philosophical split resulted in Mussolini branding him a traitor
and ordering him killed. Edda Ciano lived until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mussolini and his mistress took over the boat in 1944 and had
it about a year before Italian rebels caught up with him and killed
him in 1945,'' said Pat Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Not much is yet known of the vessel's history between the war's
end and just a few years ago, when it ended up in Florida, said
Hicks, 52, a Beaumont, Texas, native and retired Austin excavation
firm owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know it appeared in four movies and a couple of
documentaries,'' he said. ``The most well-known movie is ``Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang'' and the others are ``Seven Cities of Atlantis,''
``The Count of Monte Christo'' with Richard Chamberlain and Tony
Curtis, and also a movie called ``S.S. Commodore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We found the boat over in Ponce Inlet in Florida back in March
of last year and were able to acquire it,'' Hicks said. ``It took
31 days to motor it back to Orange (Texas), where we put it in dry
dock.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of care in its past few years in the Daytona Beach area in
Florida did more damage than more than 80 years in active use,
Hicks said. It left the decks and the original wheelhouse in
terrible shape, as was the cabin in which Mussolini slept, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the hull, which is all riveted iron, was in really good
shape after 92 years,'' Hicks said. ``The masts are the originals,
too. We took all the decks off and completely rebuilt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will see the original windlass, which raised the
anchor, as well as the binnacle (compass stand) and ship's wheel, a
desk Mussolini is believed to have used and other original
fittings, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Windows and red oak exterior panels of the cabins, dining and
salon areas are designed identically to those of the original
wheelhouse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have 12 suites with queen-size or king-size beds
and separate bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs,'' Hicks said. ``On the
dock, we'll have a hot tub and sauna and you can even get a massage
by appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent unpleasant odors, the boat's diesel engines have been
removed and its bilge and interior hull completely cleaned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides old photos of the boat, Hicks has other related
historical material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 1939 Life magazine with Mussolini on the cover and
it's got pictures inside of Ciano with Hitler,'' he said. ``We're
going to make a wall-hanging for each suite from that magazine.
Each suite will be named after a World War II figure like
Mussolini, Patton, Rommel, Churchill and others. We'll have a
scrapbook that people can look at, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Room rates will run around $150 and people already have booked
rooms for the first months of operation, Hicks said. Breakfast, of
course, is included, and room service will be available throughout
the day from the neighboring Fisherman's Wharf restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While the floating inn could be moved if Galveston's tourist
economy crashed, Hicks said he believes the ``Stacia Leigh'' will
be a permanent fixture on Galveston's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his wife also envision weddings, parties and
small business functions on the vessel's covered dock area, main
deck and topside 80-foot sundeck. For more information, call
409-750-8858.

UP HEAD DOESN'T WANT TO BE NO. 1, JUST NO. 1 WITH KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The man running The WB, at this moment the
only network to show any viewership gains and, more importantly,
the one to watch, has no problem owning up to his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old man but I hang out with all these young kids all
the time,'' says Jamie Kellner, the CEO of The WB, who claims to be
``over 50'' but probably isn't by more than a year. Either way,
he's Abner Doubleday compared to the youth market he serves, as The
WB is the youngest-skewing of all the networks and has no plans to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my taste. It's my interests,'' Kellner says. ``There's
not a single show I watch on CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Old People's Network, if you haven't figured it out
yet. And though CBS pulled a coup this season and toppled
long-standing king NBC, Kellner has no interest in what the Nielsen
people call ``total households.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a demographics guy. Always has been, since he helped launch
the Fox network from scratch. He left that network when the
decision was made to make Fox more broad-based, more like The Big
Three it was chasing.
</P>
<P>
   So Kellner left and eventually started The WB, the one network
that has out-foxed Fox and taken away most of its teen and young
adult viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be on the leading edge of what's new and
interesting and fun,'' Kellner said. And then he says, flatly,
almost coldly _ especially coming from a guy who's past 50: ``Our
goal is to remain median age under 30. And that's a long-term
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for the guy to watch in the TV industry _ long
term _ it's Kellner. He doesn't have the flash of other TV movers
and shakers like Les Moonves at CBS, or maybe the sense of the
spotlight like former NBC entertainment president Warren
Littlefield. But Kellner is a straight shooter and _ here's the key
_ he's right.
</P>
<P>
   When he left Fox it was because he sensed a dangerous shift at
the network, the desire to one day be No. 1. And to get to be No. 1
_ at least Nielsen ratings-wise _ you need, as Kellner says, a lot
of 50-year-old viewers. That's what CBS has. What they don't have
is a lot of cash _ the kind that pours in from Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people are not as susceptible to the ways of advertisers
and willing to change attitudes like teenagers,'' he says. There's
no condemnation or sneer in his voice when he says ``old people,''
because a second earlier he confesses to being one. He's got
nothing against old people. They're just not good for business when
your business is running a television network.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner doesn't long to be No. 1 in this town because he sees it
as a hollow dream. He believes television is becoming increasing
like radio, where niche broadcasting reigns. TV is getting
fragmented. It's clear. And when that happens, he says, your plan
should be equally clear: ``Make sure that the fragment you hold
onto is the most valuable one.''
</P>
<P>
   Before last season, at what the industry calls the ``upfront''
in New York _ where the networks show their goods to advertisers,
who look at the content, divide it by the demographic and hand out
cash accordingly _ only NBC got more money. Not bad for the No. 5
ranked network.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Charmed'' and ``Felicity'' under
the belt, not to mention ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' _ the
networks numbers are up across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got what we did (at the upfront) without those numbers,''
Kellner says. He's got a little half-smile, half-knowing smirk on
his face. Because he knows what's going to happen at the next
upfront: The WB is going to be drowning in money.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be happening to UPN, which used to be the fifth
network and is now the sixth _ and in desperate need of a
turnaround as it fades in The WB's rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner notes without much apparent glee that the network that
used to be his closest competitor has already switched management
once and has shifted its direction several times. UPN's last plan,
he says, was ``completely unfocused and had no chance for
success.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN will come here and face the nation's TV critics under a much
harsher light. As will all the major networks, come to think of it.
But The WB got away without much damage because most critics like
their shows and understand that of all six networks, it has the
brightest future.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it will ever be No. 1. Because Kellner doesn't think it
needs to be. And a lot of what he thinks is turning out to be
right.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner has become very successful being The Man Who Wouldn't Be
King. He has stuck stubbornly to the idea that the youth of America
control television. And to think that this sort of ``Logan's Run''
attitude about television comes from a guy who likes to visit Napa
because he's something of a wine connoisseur as well as being a
late-developing golfer.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be young, apparently. You just have to think
young.

DIGITAL-TECH (Los Angeles) _ A year ago, Apple Computers seemed
headed to the electronic graveyard, its spark shorting out on
staggering market share, gun-shy developers and wavering
supporters. But as the old song nearly says, what a difference a

that capitalize on the remarkable momentum the company built with
its original iMac. By David Bloom.

PURGATORY-TV (Los Angeles) _ Refuge is a quiet town, tucked away in
a verdant valley. No newspapers here, though, nor a telegraph.
Drinks are free at the saloon, and the doctor sure is nice about
patching up folks for nothing. The sheriff doesn't even pack a gun,
though he does look familiar. It is into this odd little burg that
Blackjack (Eric Roberts) and his gang of about 20 bad guys ride
after a particularly bloody bank heist. By David Bloom.

LET THE BOARD GAMES BEGIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Jonathan Lane was 14 when he came home one day,
troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been at my friend's house, where there was constant
yelling, which I wasn't used to at all,'' said Jonathan, now 17.
``I knew it didn't have to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Mom, my friends all hate their parents, and I feel
really bad. I wish there was something I could do to help','' said
his mother, family therapist and psychologist Kathryn Nessel
Retsky. ``I thought, why not an old-fashioned board game to get
people talking to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   So the two spent nearly every evening for a year sitting at the
kitchen table in their Encino home, devising a game that encourages
players to learn a lot about each other _ their hopes, their
aspirations, their favorite experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Chatter Matters was born.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the mother-and-son team has sold more
than 5,000 Chatter Matters board games and has just ordered a
second production run.
</P>
<P>
   They have yet to make a financial profit, but the real profit,
they believe, is in increased understanding for families who play
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, I think, really need something like this,'' Retsky
said. ``They just don't sit down and talk to each other anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her son are not alone in trying to get families to
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   You know, talk ... the sound that used to come out of people's
mouths when they sat down to dinner together every night: ``How was
your day?'' ``What did you learn in school?'' ``I remember when I
was your age ...''
</P>
<P>
   In many families today, with both parents working and children
dashing off to soccer and music lessons after school, adults and
kids don't even share a box of cornflakes or a plate of fried
chicken on most days, much less discuss their plans or their
problems. And since grandma and grandpa may be living back East or
in a retirement community miles away, there's little storytelling
about ``the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Board games can encourage a return to family conversation, said
Drew Yellen, a Chatsworth psychologist specializing in family and
child therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before there was television, easy access to the telephone,
people talked,'' Yellen said. ``You used to have time together as a
family. Now, kids can come home and pop onto the Internet from 3
o'clock to midnight and never talk to their parents but have
conversations with people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Board games can facilitate dialogue _ as long as they're fun
and kids don't see them as `square' or `uncool'.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro works hard to provide the fun factor, said Dale Siswick,
general manager for U.S. sales and marketing of games for Hasbro
Inc., the world's No. 1 board game manufacturer. It began in
mid-1998 to promote ``family fun night'' for game-playing, just
like families did before home computers and round-the-clock cable
TV took over.
</P>
<P>
   But despite game makers' efforts to reintroduce ``get-together
games'' to families, sales of traditional board games are running
far behind those of new electronic games and CD-ROMs, some of which
are even being marketed by traditional games makers like Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   From December 1997 to November 1998, board game sales totaled
$1.5 billion compared to $5.2 billion in computer and video game
sales, according to the New York-based NPD Research Group marketing
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the purveyors of board games aren't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Board games will always be as American as apple pie,'' Siswick
said. ``I think the time when the board game business might want to
look over its shoulder is when people who make computer games are
able to make computers smile.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that smile factor that keeps people collecting around a
board game, however low-tech it might be, said John D. Williams
Jr., executive director of the 10,000-member National Scrabble
Association.
</P>
<P>
   His association sponsors nearly 200 Scrabble tournaments
annually, offering prizes up to $25,000. And even 50 years after
the game first challenged players, Williams says it continues to be
a family hit.
</P>
<P>
   Monopoly, likewise, has been going strong since 1935. The Game
of Life debuted in 1960. And Clue players have been trying to
figure out who killed Col. Mustard with the lead pipe in the
library since the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say kids don't like board games anymore, that they're
too busy playing video games and online,'' Williams said. ``Well,
those are just new ways of playing. Playing board games is a social
thing. As long as people sit in a circle and play and talk to each
other, board games will be popular. And when you can finally get a
family playing a game together, it's a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Retsky said playing Chatter Matters a couple of times a week has
helped her family get along.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always finding out nice things about each other, about
the past, that you might not ever know any other way,'' said
Jonathan, student body president at Westmark School in Encino.
``Because I know more about my parents, at my age, it becomes less
parenting and more friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the game, which is available in many toy stores, had
only a modest sales rate, Jonathan and his mother aren't
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's close to a 100 percent failure rate for any
new games or toys,'' Retsky said. ``You're fighting the big guys _
Parker Bros., Milton Bradley (both now owned by Hasbro). It's hard
to make it. But I have a lot of faith in us. Even if we never make
any money at it, if it gets kids and parents and grandparents
talking to each other, it's served its purpose.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You may have to look a little harder these days
for the aisle full of board games amid the action figures and
Gameboy cartridges. But they're there.
</P>
<P>
   Clue, Monopoly, Bingo, Yahtzee and the classics among board
games: chess and checkers. Among them are the newcomers trying to
carve their own niche out of the board-game market.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some:
</P>
<P>
   _ Chatter Matters (age 7 to adult): Players move around a board,
drawing cards that require them to tell family stories and answer
questions about their likes, dislikes, favorite people, animals,
places and memories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family Feud (8 to adult): In a game based on the old TV show,
players work in teams to guess the most popular answers to
questions.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Game of Life (9 to adult): Players make ``life'' choices _
Buy a house? Get married? _ and collect money and experience along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Game of Knowledge (10 to adult): Parents and children can
team up, or compete against each other to deduce the answers to
1,500 questions about history, science, nature, sports, fame and
the media.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Game of the Year (8 to adult): Players race around a board
``trying to have the best year of their lives'' while learning
about other players' likes, dislikes, habits and more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judge for Yourself (12 to adult): Players are presented with
actual court cases _ in much abbreviated form _ and act as jurors
to decide who should win. Actual results are provided so players
can check their logic and reasoning abilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Loaded Questions (13 to adult): Players write down answers to
questions like ``If you were invisible, what would you do?'' Then
players guess who came up with which answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pictionary (12 to adult): Like Charades with pen and paper,
teams race to identify the images that individual players draw.
</P>
<P>
   _ Payday (age 10 to adult): Players ``find out where the money
goes,'' allotting their ``paychecks'' to pay bills, cope with
emergencies, such as replacing broken eyeglasses, or finding enough
cash for luxuries, such as piano lessons. When they're broke, they
can raise more money by, say, having a yard sale.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scattergories (12 to adult): Players must name things that
start with the same letter, from pizza toppings to fictional
characters.
</P>
<P>
   _ 25 Words or Less (10 to adult): A board-game version of TV's
``Password,'' players give clues to get teammates to say the five
words on a card within one minute. &QL;

APPLE EXPANDS CORE OF PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVIS BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A year ago, Apple Computers seemed headed to the
electronic graveyard, its spark shorting out on staggering market
share, gun-shy developers and wavering supporters. But as the old
song nearly says, what a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's MacWorld Expo in San Francisco, interim CEO Steve
Jobs unveiled a bunch of new machines and initiatives that
capitalize on the remarkable momentum the company built with its
original iMac. Oh, and the company is headed to a fifth straight
profitable quarter, too.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac already is undergoing a second round of improvements
that, just four months after its debut, make it a substantially
more powerful machine for less money. This for a computer that
already sold 800,000 units in 3{ months.
</P>
<P>
   Apple whacked the price $100 to $1,199; wrapped the swoopy box
in five hip new colors; and goosed the insides with a faster
processor (266 megahertz G3 chip), better video acceleration (an
ATI Rage Pro 128-bit card), more memory expandability (to 256
megabytes) and a bigger hard drive (6 gigabytes).
</P>
<P>
   The changes defuse most of the niggling complaints about the
all-in-one machine, making it a better gaming device, less
expensive (some observers predicted retailers might slash prices
below $1,000), with a terrific amount of power.
</P>
<P>
   For all the iMac changes, however, the biggest news happened
further up the product line, as Jobs unveiled Apple's ``Yosemite''
line of four professional-level machines, ranging in price from
$1,599 to $2,999, as well as three matching monitors from $499 to
$1,499.
</P>
<P>
   The Yosemite design takes cues from the iMac, providing another
welcome _ if less revolutionary _ departure from the Boring Beige
Box Borg that has assimilated most computer industrial design the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Far more interesting, however, is what's happening inside these
new machines. Apple, after years of going its own way with
technology, now is using many common PC standards.
</P>
<P>
   That should mean Mac users will have to spend less _ both on the
machines and any upgrades _ and have far more choices in those
upgradr, just as PCs do, rather than using the unique Mac video
connectors. And the Yosemites have replaced the SCSI bus with
``Firewire,'' or IEEE 1394, connections.
</P>
<P>
   All the new machines use SDRAM, the same kind of memory chips
used by PCs, which will save you money as you try to keep up with
bandwidth-hogging applications.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, of course, is that the more these machines look
different on the outside, the more their insides are like all their
PC competitors. Except, of course, for the super-fast G3 brains at
the heart of these machines, and the truly wonderful Mac OS 8.5
they come with.
</P>
<P>
   For Macintosh gamers, there were two other announcements of
note. One was that the new Macs finally will support the Open GL
graphics standard, which is common on the PC side, but has been
neglected on Macs. The support will make it far easier for
developers to bring their hot PC titles to the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Also, peripheral maker Connectix announced a $49 software
program that will allow you to play many PlayStation games (about
70 of the 500 or so on the market now) on the iMac. For more
information, go to www.virtualgamestation.com.
</P>
<P>
   SINCEREST FLATTERY: All that said, even the Windows world is
being influenced by the iMac's design revolution and stunning
success.
</P>
<P>
   A small Fremont-based company called eMachines plans to come out
later this spring with an iMac-like Windows-based PC called the
eStation for as little as $499.
</P>
<P>
   And Infoworld, a trade publication aimed at big corporate
computer buyers, says numerous companies building Windows-based
machines are now thinking about how to make their computers look
more interesting, especially the more expensive ones where buyers
will pay for style.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation aside, expect other big changes in PC boxes as well,
Infoworld said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade journal predicted radically different machines in
stores by the end of the year, with flat-panel displays,
25-gigabyte hard drives, rewritable CD drives instead of floppies,
a standard 128 megabytes of memory, Firewire connections and a
650-megahertz Intel processor.
</P>
<P>
   And some pundits are predicting even cheaper low-end computers,
whose prices dropped to as little as $399 without a monitor for
some very low-end, though quite serviceable, configurations.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, those prices could drop to as little as $299
without a monitor (add another $100 to $170), a boon for people
with simple needs such as letter writing, home finance and Web
surfing. It's all the computer they'll need for now.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it led one pundit at the San Jose Mercury-News to
propose disposable computers. His thesis: it's cheaper to buy a
$399 computer every year than a muscled-up $1,699 box that might
last four years. And, he argues, the $399 box you buy in the fourth
year probably will be more powerful than that 4-year-old $1,699
model.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder all the computer sellers are complaining that they
couldn't get enough cheap computers in stock but are trying to
figure out how to clean out their excess high-end inventory from
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN LIGHT: Disney finally gets into the online portal business
this week, with a kickoff announcement for the long-awaited Go.com
site, which will tie the Infoseek search engine together with such
sites as Disney Online and ABC TV.
</P>
<P>
   Go.com's most interesting aspect may be Go Guardian, its raft of
parental controls that will differentiate it from well-established
existing Internet entry points such as AOL/NetCenter, Yahoo! and
Excite.
</P>
<P>
   If you register your children through the portal, Go Guardian
will keep them from areas you designate off limits and also e-mail
you with a rundown on the places they do visit while online.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents will welcome the controls. But others may not want
the Big Mouse as their online baby sitter. So, we'll see if that
traffic signal is green or red. &QL;

WESTERN GETS SURREAL IN `PURGATORY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Refuge is a quiet town, tucked away in a verdant
valley. No newspapers here, though, nor a telegraph. Drinks are
free at the saloon, and the doctor sure is nice about patching up
folks for nothing. The sheriff doesn't even pack a gun, though he
does look familiar.
</P>
<P>
   It is into this odd little burg that Blackjack (Eric Roberts in
dastardly good form) and his gang of about 20 bad guys ride after a
particularly bloody bank heist.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival is somewhat unexpected, for both Blackjack's boys
and the townsfolk. After escaping a posse, the gang rides through a
blinding sandstorm and a cave, only to come out by Refuge, which
looks nothing like the high desert they've left behind.
</P>
<P>
   That's the setup for ``Purgatory,'' an entertaining western cum
morality tale with a ``Twilight Zone'' edge that premieres tonight
on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   As the protagonist _ greenhorn would-be gunman Sonny &UR;  &LR; (Brad
Rowe) _ finds out, there's a reason the sheriff (Sam Shepard) looks
familiar. And the doctor (Randy Quaid). And the deputy (Mark
Wahlberg). And the shopkeeper (singer John David Souther).
</P>
<P>
   They're all featured in the dime novels Sonny reads about famous
gunfighters and other notorious figures of the Wild West. ``The
Creator'' has sent them to Refuge for one last shot, so to speak,
at redemption. If they can't resist temptations like violence and
drinking, they'll be tossed into the fires of perdition by a craggy
old Indian who camps nearby.
</P>
<P>
   That quandary sets up the film's conflicts and leads to a
climactic battle between Blackjack and some of the best gunfighters
in the West, an entertaining premise for an altogether entertaining
movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of the Old West equivalent of that old Righteous
Brothers song, ``Rock and Roll Heaven,'' and just as much fun to
think about. Where else, after all, are you going to get to watch
Jesse James, Wild Bill Hickock, Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday all
in the same gunfight?
</P>
<P>
   The show's good fun and well-done. All in all, director Uli Edel
(``Last Exit to Brooklyn'') has done a bang-up job renovating the
western. &QL;

<P>
   Here's a half-time scorecard on the Microsoft antitrust trial:
</P>
<P>
   THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARGE: Microsoft Corp. has illegally sought to
extend its Windows monopoly to Web commerce through restrictive
distribution deals for its Internet browser software.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT'S REPLY: Usage of arch-rival Netscape's browsers, far
from being moribund, is actually on the rise. The Internet will
become even more competitive when a merger between America Online
Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp., announced after the trial
began, goes through.
</P>
<P>
   HALF-TIME VERDICT: The jury (actually the presiding judge) views
Microsoft as a monopolist. But the ``jury'' is still out on whether
the monopoly has spilled over into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARGE: Microsoft has signed predatory
contracts with personal computer (PC) makers that oblige them to
offer their buyers a Microsoft-ordered ``desktop'' when they first
turn on their machines. This deprives users of the right to choose
the Web links and browser software they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT'S REPLY: The latest round of deals with PC firms give
them lots of leeway to promote their own branded products,
including Netscape's browser software. The Microsoft tie-ins were
quietly aborted some weeks before the Justice Department filed its
case.
</P>
<P>
   HALF-TIME VERDICT: Since no major PC makers are complaining,
Microsoft seems to be off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARGE: Microsoft ``polluted'' the Java
programming language, which poses the greatest current threat to
Microsoft's monopoly, in order to keep developers' apron strings
firmly tied to Windows. Java is produced by rival Sun Microsystems
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT'S REPLY: Our flavor of Java runs better than Sun's
Java. Besides, Sun has never met its promise that a program written
in Java can run equally well on any operating system.
</P>
<P>
   HALF-TIME VERDICT: Guilty as charged.

 &HT;    With Microsoft scorecard
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government plans to rest its case in the
Microsoft antitrust trial this week when a top economist from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology leaves the stand. Microsoft
then will begin its defense by calling another top economist from
MIT to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   But the half-time symmetry ends there: the dueling witnesses
hold sharply different views on whether Microsoft Corp., the
world's largest software company, is a predator that flouts the
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   According to one view, Microsoft operates in a highly
competitive, fast-moving, technology-driven business climate that
requires the software giant to grapple with competitors and to
strike deals with partners. As Richard Schmalensee, interim dean at
the Sloan School of Management at MIT, sees it, Microsoft must
innovate or eventually perish.
</P>
<P>
   Under the opposing view, Microsoft is driven by a perceived need
to protect at all costs its Windows-based monopoly in operating
systems for personal computers. Under this scenario, it misuses the
power of Windows to seek control of electronic commerce through its
bid to monopolize the market for Internet browsers. As Franklin
Fisher of MIT sees it, the courts must punish Microsoft for its
anti-competitive conduct.
</P>
<P>
   For Fisher and the government, Microsoft's 1995 decision to give
away its Internet Explorer (IE) Web browser with Windows has
blocked competitors from innovating in that critical sphere. They
see the decision to integrate IE into Windows 98 as an effort to
thwart the courts from imposing effective remedies.
</P>
<P>
   But for Schmalensee and Microsoft, the company markets one
product in response to customer demands. They sense that no real
harm has been done to Netscape Communications Corp., whose browsers
are still widely in use and which is slated to gain traction
through a pending merger with America Online Inc., a leading
gateway to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So who's ahead? No one is really sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department has presented no critical mass of
evidence against Microsoft,'' says William Neukom, Microsoft's
senior vice president of law and corporate affairs. ``There is no
monopoly. There is no predatory pricing. There is no illegal tying
of one product to another. Microsoft's contracts have not
foreclosed other companies from distributing their products.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Robert Litan, director of economic studies at Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank:
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is ahead, but it's not a rout. If this were a
baseball game, it would be something like 2-to-0, or 3-to-0. At the
end of the day, I believe this judge will rule against Microsoft on
one or two liability issues. But remember that this is not a
one-game series. There's going to be at least one more game in the
appeals court, and maybe another one after that in the Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the antitrust struggle still hangs in the balance.
Surely, it still carries profound implications for the way the
nation's high-tech climate will evolve in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the stakes in the landmark antitrust action are so
high that it's hard to find neutral observers _ save, of course,
for U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who has been
trying the case without a jury since mid-October. (In mid-week,
Jackson is expected to reject a plea by Microsoft's legal team to
end the trial in midstream on the grounds that the government has
failed to make its case.)
</P>
<P>
   But an insight to Microsoft's uncompromising legal strategy may
be found from another MIT technical whiz: Michael Dertouzos,
director of the school's Laboratory for Computer Science.
Originally, Microsoft named Dertouzos as one its 12 defense
witness. But soon after he was deposed by the government in
September, Microsoft quietly dropped him.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Department of Justice lawyers told the court that
Dertouzos sees Web browsers as optional applications, rather than
part of an operating system. Not surprisingly, that's the
government's view as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft countered that Dertouzos also envisions the merger
of browser and operating system as an inevitable trend. That
finding suggests that Microsoft competes in a benign fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Dertouzos said he agreed to testify at the trial after Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates called him and promised he wouldn't be muzzled.
But in Gates' take-no-prisoners culture, he proved to be, as
Dertouzos put it, ``a bit too independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond witnesses, real and aborted, for further insights the
judge must review the huge pile of documents placed into evidence.
Taken as a whole, they offer an extraordinary view of the normally
closed world of hi-tech commerce at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   Take government exhibit 1016, offered last week. This is a
17-page document from mid-1995 in which Microsoft executive Ben
Slivka wrote: ``The Web is an application platform that threatens
Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has approached the Web much as the blind men
approached the elephant, with different groups 'feeling' different
parts of the beast and coming to different conclusions about the
Web as a whole,'' Slivka added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hence, we have not had a consistent view of what the Web is,
nor determined how to exploit the Web to achieve our goal of a PC
on every desk and in every home running Microsoft software.''
</P>
<P>
   In weeks to come, as more corporate figures troop to the witness
stand, the government, in questioning them, will try to show that
in meeting that ``goal,'' Microsoft stepped over the line.

NINERS' GARRISON IS FULLY-STOCKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Bobb McKittrick, the line coach with the
starched jaw and rigid posture, got a little gleam in his eye when
Garrison Hearst's name came up.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how the 49ers' running back blocks, how he goes
directly at linebackers and defensive linemen, doesn't just nick
them on the shoulder to slow them down. By the time McKittrick was
done talking, he sounded ready to sign adoption papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a running back can be tougher,'' McKittrick
said, with a crowd of reporters around him. Someone pointed out
that Hearst had the opposite reputation right after college, when
he was hurt and Buddy Ryan, his coach, implied that he was soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, well,'' McKittrick said brusquely, the friendly gleam in
his eye replaced by something more stern, ``that guy's raising
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   That same afternoon, in fact, Ryan was down on his Kentucky
farm, three years removed from his firing as the Arizona Cardinals'
coach. He answered a phone call from San Francisco and proceeded to
revise the popular version of his history with Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always very fond of him,'' Ryan said. ``He got 1,000
yards the second year under me. He was Comeback Player of the
Year.' He continued to praise Hearst for the next five minutes,
calling him the leader of the Cardinals' offense in 1995, reminding
the caller that Ryan didn't get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was (released) after I got fired,'' the
coach-turned-Kentucky-farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's take on his relationship with Hearst proves one thing:
Only a fool would watch Hearst today and admit to ever overlooking
his steeliness.
</P>
<P>
   Against Green Bay last weekend, in the most important game of
his NFL career, Hearst played to the point of collapse. He
staggered off the field in the fourth quarter, in desperate need of
relief from leg cramps.
</P>
<P>
   He had rushed for 128 yards and sustained the 49ers' offense
until the passing game came to life in the final two minutes. Three
days later, with a trip Atlanta on the horizon, his teammates
reveled in remembering his 24-yard run in the third quarter, when
he knocked over safety Darren Sharper and then shoved a stiff-arm
at the Pack's hard-playing, hard-talking LeRoy Butler.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic, old-time, NFL Films kind of play. It was the
kind of play that inspired memories of Walter Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He punishes people when he runs,'' Ryan said. ``I can't say
he's like Walter Payton, but he reminds me of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing _ McKittrick had made almost exactly the same remark
an hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the line coach and his big charges tell it, Hearst is
practically one of them, an honorary lineman. They appreciate that
he does not play a glamour position as if it were all about
styling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're watching film, we definitely rewind to look at some
of his blocks,'' said guard Kevin Gogan, who received one of the
Rolex watches that Hearst handed out to his linemen for helping him
break the Niners' single-season rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in an exceptionally loose 49ers locker room, Hearst's
loud cackling laugh has returned, according to head coach Steve
Mariucci. His injury isn't considered as severe this time.
</P>
<P>
   But the running back has finally jumped into something that
intimidates him.
</P>
<P>
   To help his hamstring heal, he has taken treatment in hyperbaric
chamber. He has to spend two hours in the cramped space, and
claustrophobia makes it agony for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand it,'' he said, in one of his typically brief
remarks to the media.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise. As the Packers can tell you, he is not easily
contained.

competitive, fast-moving, technology-driven business climate that
requires the software giant to grapple with competitors and to
strike deals with partners. As Richard Schmalensee, interim dean at
the Sloan School of Management at MIT, sees it, Microsoft must
innovate or eventually perish.
</P>
<P>
   Under the opposing view, Microsoft is driven by a perceived need
to protect at all costs its Windows-based monopoly in operating
systems for personal computers. Under this scenario, it misuses the
power of Windows to seek control of electronic commerce through its
bid to monopolize the market for Internet browsers. As Franklin
Fisher of MIT sees it, the courts must punish Microsoft for its
anti-competitive conduct.
</P>
<P>
   For Fisher and the government, Microsoft's 1995 decision to give
away its Internet Explorer (IE) Web browser with Windows has
blocked competitors from innovating in that critical sphere. They
see the decision to integrate IE into Windows 98 as an effort to
thwart the courts from imposing effective remedies.
</P>
<P>
   But for Schmalensee and Microsoft, the company markets one
product in response to customer demands. They sense that no real
harm has been done to Netscape Communications Corp., whose browsers
are still widely in use and which is slated to gain traction
through a pending merger with America Online Inc., a leading
gateway to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So who's ahead? No one is really sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department has presented no critical mass of
evidence against Microsoft,'' says William Neukom, Microsoft's
senior vice president of law and corporate affairs. ``There is no
monopoly. There is no predatory pricing. There is no illegal tying
of one product to another. Microsoft's contracts have not
foreclosed other companies from distributing their products.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Robert Litan, director of economic studies at Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank:
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is ahead, but it's not a rout. If this were a
baseball game, it would be something like 2-to-0, or 3-to-0. At the
end of the day, I believe this judge will rule against Microsoft on
one or two liability issues. But remember that this is not a
one-game series. There's going to be at least one more game in the
appeals court, and maybe another one after that in the Supreme
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the antitrust struggle still hangs in the balance.
Surely, it still carries profound implications for the way the
nation's high-tech climate will evolve in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the stakes in the landmark antitrust action are so
high that it's hard to find neutral observers _ save, of course,
for U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who has been
trying the case without a jury since mid-October. (In mid-week,
Jackson is expected to reject a plea by Microsoft's legal team to
end the trial in midstream on the grounds that the government has
failed to make its case.)
</P>
<P>
   But an insight to Microsoft's uncompromising legal strategy may
be found from another MIT technical whiz: Michael Dertouzos,
director of the school's Laboratory for Computer Science.
Originally, Microsoft named Dertouzos as one its 12 defense
witness. But soon after he was deposed by the government in
September, Microsoft quietly dropped him.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Department of Justice lawyers told the court that
Dertouzos sees Web browsers as optional applications, rather than
part of an operating system. Not surprisingly, that's the
government's view as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft countered that Dertouzos also envisions the merger
of browser and operating system as an inevitable trend. That
finding suggests that Microsoft competes in a benign fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Dertouzos said he agreed to testify at the trial after Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates called him and promised he wouldn't be muzzled.
But in Gates' take-no-prisoners culture, he proved to be, as
Dertouzos put it, ``a bit too independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond witnesses, real and aborted, for further insights the
judge must review the huge pile of documents placed into evidence.
Taken as a whole, they offer an extraordinary view of the normally
closed world of hi-tech commerce at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   Take government exhibit 1016, offered last week. This is a
17-page document from mid-1995 in which Microsoft executive Ben
Slivka wrote: ``The Web is an application platform that threatens
Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has approached the Web much as the blind men
approached the elephant, with different groups 'feeling' different
parts of the beast and coming to different conclusions about the
Web as a whole,'' Slivka added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hence, we have not had a consistent view of what the Web is,
nor determined how to exploit the Web to achieve our goal of a PC
on every desk and in every home running Microsoft software.''
</P>
<P>
   In weeks to come, as more corporate figures troop to the witness
stand, the government, in questioning them, will try to show that
in meeting that ``goal,'' Microsoft stepped over the line.
</P>

 &HT;    Pritchard's pointers for accessorizing
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some tips from Atlanta interior designer Jillian
Pritchard for displaying accessories:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy inexpensive items, such as candlesticks, colored glass or
picture frames from stores such as Pier 1 Imports, Crate &AMP; Barrel
or Pottery Barn, if you lack small collections.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use old encyclopedias as platforms for displaying other items
and to fill space in bookcases. Never lean books; brace them with
bookends or lay them flat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vary the heights of items; avoid placing similar-size ones
together.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stack, don't fan, magazines to create impact.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use greenery, such as a potted plant, to add natural
materials.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't use candles when you want to emphasize the candlesticks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pile paperback books in a large basket instead of displaying
the worn copies on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fill gaps under side tables with large baskets or pots to draw
the eye toward the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Emphasize small paintings or mirrors with interesting frames
by propping them against the wall on a table, mantel or bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Put less significant and least-often used items on the lowest
bookshelves, saving upper ones for your best accessories.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Group items of similar color to create impact.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mix metals within a collection, such as brass, bronze and
gold, to create interest.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't throw away broken objects; large pieces of a vase or pot
often make unique items.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accent displays with small lamps or pendant fixtures that cast
intense light on a subject.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Burn new candle wicks so the candles appear used.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't feel obligated to decorate an attractive hearth with
fireplace tools, unless you build lots of fires. Remember: Less can
be more.

 &HT;    Wake up a room by adding new accessories _ or just rearranging
what you have
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Take a long hard look at your living room.
</P>
<P>
   That new sofa and armoire you got for Christmas look great but
seem cold and barren. Something's missing.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe your end tables look less like the perfectly decorated
ones in House Beautiful and more like something from ``The Odd
Couple,'' cluttered with remote controls, CD
</P>
<P>
   cases, candy bar wrappers and month-old newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   If either case sounds familiar, your room may qualify for the
next episode of ``Jerry Springer'' _ ``People Who Need Treatment
for Accessory Disorder Syndrome.'' You know the internal disease _
too few decorating touches, such as pillows, pictures, books and
collectibles, or to the other extreme, too much stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, people usually just have the wrong
things displayed in the wrong places,'' said Jillian Pritchard, an
Atlanta interior designer.
</P>
<P>
   They may own beautiful furniture, but without the right accents
their rooms look flat, she said. Accessories are the crowning
touches _ the necklace or earrings that make that little black
dress come to life. Touches that give interiors personality by
reflecting the things you like, your hobbies and interests. Touches
that inject color and texture into a room, making it intriguing and
inviting.
</P>
<P>
   So you say you're broke after buying that new sofa and armoire
and can't afford any of these precious jewels. Not to worry: Not
all accessories are expensive; a lot depends on your decorating
tastes. Designers contend clients typically already have most of
what they need; it just needs to be moved around. Other things may
just need a little spiffing up _ a new shade for that lamp, a new
fabric for that pillow, new frames for those family photos _
especially ones you suddenly inherit through marriage or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother died, I was overwhelmed as I began the process
of cleaning out her home. It was full of possessions from the late
1930s on,'' Martha Jo Katz said. ``Then I found ones from my
grandmother's home that were packed away from years before.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Marietta (Ga.) resident wanted was to regret
getting rid of something special. And because she loves
contemporary art, Katz also was concerned about mixing the old with
the new. So she resolved to make the experience fun by opening her
mind to new and unconventional ways of displaying accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many ideas to take advantage of what some people
would just consider throwing away or putting in a closet or giving
away,'' she said. ``Plus, it's so nice to be able see and use so
many of these special things every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz was determined to make the emotional experience of sorting
through a parent's belongings a fun adventure, and it paid off. The
additional pieces made her home so attractive that friends have
asked Katz, a cater
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using some accessories as displays, such as books as platforms
for giving other items height or large plates placed on stands as
backgrounds for a grouping.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Emphasizing special accessories with lighting, either overhead
task fixtures or accent lamps.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remembering that less can be more. ``You're better off
accenting a fabulous fireplace by putting no tools on the hearth
and just adding simple logs,'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lean a painting on a mantel to lend informality.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Balance pairs of accessories, such as large hurricane lamps,
to give this vignette symmetry. The natural texture of topiaries
softens the hard look of stone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use furniture as an accessory _ in this case, to make the
fireplace more inviting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use candlesticks too small for so massive a mantel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be without anything to draw you into the fireplace. ``It
should play host to your home's best pieces since it's the focal
point of a room,'' Pritchard says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have too many competing types of items with nothing in common.
``There's no golden thread that ties the accessories together,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use larger pieces to add scale and create impact.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Organize elements by categories into small collections, such
as photos, crystal and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make old encyclopedias into convenient display platforms. Line
treasured books along the shelf's edge ``supermarket style'' so
their spines can be read.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrict movement among the pieces. The scale of the items is
too similar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be without uniformity. No one element plays off another.
``It's just a lot of stuff,'' Pritchard says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be without any color to draw you to the bookcase.

 &HT;    Bigger isn't better: Smaller portions mean smarter eating
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You've purged your cupboards of the double deluxe
chocolate cookies and tossed the praline dream ice cream from the
freezer.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, it's graham crackers and low-fat frozen yogurt,
lean chicken and fat-free bagels.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations for determining to make healthy food choices.
But if you want to lose weight or feel great, you'll have to do
more than pay attention to what you eat.
</P>
<P>
   How much you eat is just as important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portion size is key,'' said Chris Rosenbloom, a nutritionist
and professor at Georgia State University. ``Most of us have a very
distorted view of what portions are. It's triple-beef burger here
and monster-size there. If your goal is to eat healthy, you have to
pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has the message about portions been so clearly
demonstrated than a few years back when all the low-fat and no-fat
products hit the shelf. America was sure to shed pounds, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. If you inhale a whole box of low-fat crackers you've
inhaled a whole lot of calories. Period.
</P>
<P>
   So rule No. 1: Read the label. While you are checking out the
fat content and the calories, be sure and look at the portion size,
Rosenbloom said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the portion size is a half cup, then measure it out.
Atlanta nutritionist Page Love recommends measuring foods in cups
and kitchen scales for a couple of weeks to train yourself on
proper portion sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to do this forever. If you did, you'd be
putting too much focus on food. But do it for a while until you've
learned visually what proper portions are,'' Love said. ``And if
you get off track, pull out the measuring cups and scales again to
remind yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some general rules for serving sizes:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Breads usually are 1 slice of bread, 1/2 cup cooked cereal, a
2-ounce bagel (bakery size is tions are large. One idea is to keep
some visual cues in mind.
</P>
<P>
   A proper portion of meat is about the size of a deck of cards or
the palm of your hand. Bagels should be the size of a hockey puck.
Rice and pasta portions are a half cup, or a mound no bigger than a
tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
   And the next time you say, ``I only had a muffin for
breakfast,'' ask yourself if it was the size of a ``baby's head,''
as Rosenbloom described some bakery portions.
</P>
<P>
   Cut those large muffins in half. Order an appetizer as an
entree. Or ask for a doggie bag at the beginning of the meal and
set some aside before you dig in. And remember you don't have to
finish everything on your plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of words people need to learn, like, `I'm
full,' '' Rosenbloom said. ``If you make no other changes in your
diet than cutting portions, you will see a difference.''

 &HT;    Getting fit is important for everyone, and its an activity
families can do together
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One in four American children is overweight. It's a
sobering fact disproving the belief that kids lead naturally
active, healthy lives, and that these habits only begin to
deteriorate in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that our collective nutritional values
have suffered over the years. But another significant factor is
that _ thanks to video games and other indoor diversions _ the
Saturday morning cartoon set is anchored in front of the TV long
after cartoons are over.
</P>
<P>
   For kids, getting physical isn't always as easy as going with
mom or dad to the gym. Many gyms don't allow kids younger than 12
or 14. By that age, the damage already may be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could start at a younger age, they could avoid a lot
of problems,'' said Eileen Messer, whose 12-year-old daughter is
struggling with her weight. She does step aerobics videos at home
but is looking forward to being old enough to work out with her mom
at their neighborhood clubhouse near Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   Options do exist, however, for families seeking fitness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you already belong to a health club or gym, ask if the
management will be flexible about the age rule, for closely
supervised kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since obesity is increasingly a problem with very young
adolescents, they do occasionally waive that rule and let the child
work out with the parent,'' said Janie Wilson, spokeswoman for the
Australian Body Works chain.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some clubs are starting to offer programs just for youngsters.
This week, Athletic Club Northeast in Atlanta opened a
2,500-square-foot Blast! Kids Center, a step up from the
baby-sitting services gyms usually offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago this club was popular as a singles place,''
said Randy Chamberlain, the club's general manager. ``Now a lot of
members have kids. There's a real need for this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Blast! Center, kids can do homework, arts and crafts or
exercise, with activities such as judo, tumbling and swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere they can look forward to going to. Not a
pressure place, not a competitive sport, not school,'' said program
director Kirsty Lubicz-Nawrocka.
</P>
<P>
   The Blast! Center will cost parents an extra $2 or $3 per hour
on top of membership dues.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Join the Y. The YMCA offers ``lots of outlets for every
interest,'' says Randy Borden, 50, who works out at the Ashford
Dunwoody (Ga.) branch with her husband and two youngest children.
</P>
<P>
   On any given evening, Borden might be lifting weights while her
husband takes a spin class; her 11-year-old daughter might be
practicing gymnastics while her son, 15, shoots hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 15 you want to get them doing something beside just going
to school and coming home,'' Borden said. ``So we're all working
out together. That's a special time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of parents take advantage of the Y's family-friendly
programs by exercising while their kids take swim, gymnastics or
karate classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the parents more regular because they know they have
to bring the kids to class,'' said Linda Spence, the Ashford
Dunwoody Y's physical education director.
</P>
<P>
   Families make up 75 percent of the membership at the recently
opened Ed Isakson/Alpharetta (Ga.) Family YMCA. Its ``Family Fun
and Fitness'' class for all ages involves slightly unusual exercise
equipment, such as Hula Hoops, and is popular among kids under 6
years and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   All YMCAs offer ``family time'' in the pool or gym; call for
times.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kick yourself into high gear. Martial arts studios offer a
great way for parents and children to get into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Ginny Csoka, alarmed by recent local rapes,
marched herself and her 3-year-old son into an American Karate Joe
Corley Studio. Today, Csoka, 58, holds a second degree black belt _
her son has a third degree black belt _ and she easily keeps pace
with the 20-year-olds in kickboxing classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea what it would turn out to be for us,'' said
Csoka. Her son competes in karate. Two grandchildren, ages 4 and 5,
also take classes.
</P>
<P>
   Martial arts studios have long welcomed children, even the very
young, and many make it convenient for families to come together.
The Joe Corley Studios, for instance, schedule several adult and
child classes during the same time slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really encourage family participation,'' said Joe Corley.
``As my friend Chuck Norris says, the family that kicks together,
sticks together.''
</P>
<P>
   Most health clubs, YMCAs and martial arts studios offer
discounted family memberships.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting the whole family moving can be as simple as walking or
bicycling, both excellent exercises, or just running around in the
yard. The key is to spend time together and to make sure it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things adults can do is to lead by
example,'' Wilson said. ``We've got to do that in our health lives.
And one of the best ways to do that is to play with your
children.''

 &HT;    Faith `gives you strength and peace in times of trouble,'
governor-elect finds
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Roy Barnes puts his hand on his worn Ryrie Study
Bible to take the oath of office Monday as Georgia's governor,
he'll be taking another step on a lifelong road of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, 50, will be the third United Methodist in a row to live
in the state's Governor's Mansion, but he claimed Christianity
when, at 8 years of age, he walked down the aisle of Concord
Baptist Church in Mableton to the tune of an old hymn that asks
``Why Not Tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were just expected to go to Sunday school and church,
vacation Bible school, Royal Ambassadors and fall revivals,'' he
said, recalling the Baptist activities of his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He married his wife, Marie, in 1970 at First United Methodist
Church in Marietta and has been a part of the church ever since,
sometimes teaching Sunday school and serving on congregational
boards and committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very loyal, very dedicated, involved member, and he
gives very generously,'' said former U.S. Rep. Buddy Darden, a
member of the same Sunday school class as Barnes, ``but he has very
wisely stayed out of the politics of the church. He's not someone
who tries to bring attention to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Darden, who was defeated in 1994 by fellow church member Bob
Barr, said Barnes' family life, like his church membership, is
exemplary. ``I think Roy is one of those people who conduct his
religion by example rather than precept.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes credits faith with helping to keep his marriage solid
after almost 29 years, while some other politicians who proclaim
``family values'' have had multiple wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any married couple can find an excuse to get a divorce,'' he
said. ``I don't believe a spouse should stay in a situation where a
child or spouse is harmed. But short of that, faith and dedication
will get people through.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he finds a ``healing effect'' in church, listening to
Scriptures and familiar hymns. Among his favorites: ``Amazing
Grace,'' written by a repentant slave dealer (``You talk about a
story of redemption!'' the governor-elect exclaims), and ``O For A
Thousand Tongues to Sing,'' a staple in the United Methodist
hymnal.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes admits that he takes ribbing from his wife because he's
somewhat of a connoisseur of television preachers. ``I like to hear
'em,'' he said. ``I also like to see their style. I'm a lawyer. I
like public speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   He's impressed with the Rev. T.D. Jakes, who, he says, ``can
move a crowd,'' and unimpressed with the Rev. John Hagee. ``I don't
like his condemning style.''
</P>
<P>
   Although worship is important, faith should reach well beyond
the church walls, Barnes said. He reads the Bible frequently and
finds comfort in the Psalms, but said he is on no rigid reading
schedule. ``The Bible and religion ought to be something that laps
over you, that you kind of enjoy rather than something you have to
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he has had to make difficult decisions, he has called on
his faith. ``It's what gives you strength and peace in times of
trouble,'' he said. He considers prayer ``a method of
problem-solving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hardest decisions I ever made was in 1985 when I
gave serious consideration to running for the U.S. Senate,'' he
said. ``I almost decided to run, but our oldest child was 12 and
our youngest was 6. I felt it tugging at me that I did not need to
uproot these children. I decided not to run. I believe I could have
been elected, but in the long run, it turned out to be the right
decision. We have three wonderful children.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Christian groups consistently rated Barnes'
voting record unfavorably during his days in the state Legislature.
He said he is ``very hurt'' by some of the methods used in the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity is based on free will and choice,'' he said.
``The idea that in politics, if you exercise free will and
judgment, you are somehow un-Christian is foreign and offensive to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also disagrees with people who claim to be Christian
but seem to be ``against everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, the harshness and negativity of many Christians
drive away people _ particularly young people more than anything
else,'' he said. ``Christ was compassionate and loving. The whole
idea of Christianity is that we would change our lives to such an
extent that people would see that in us.''
</P>
<P>
   While running for governor, Barnes visited churches and
synagogues across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think politicians should be afraid of faith,'' Barnes
said. ``Politicians confuse the legal separation of church and
state with a personal separation.''
</P>
<P>
   His understanding of his religious obligations influences his
political platform, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility I have as a Christian is to protect those
who are weak and to speak for those in the shadows of life,
children and the elderly,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean I have the
right to impose my view of faith on anyone, but it does mean I have
a responsibility as part of my beliefs to help protect those who
are weak and unprotected.''

   IMPEACH-STATEOFUNION-REVIEW (Washington) _ In State of the Union
speeches before members of Congress and the Supreme Court,
presidents have made an implicit argument that the three branches
of government may be equal, but some are more equal than others.
This year, as President Clinton assesses the union's state before
an audience that is considering ejecting him from office, he will
be testing that proposition. By James Bennet.

   INTERNET-CAPITAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Never in the history of
modern business has there been a class of companies that has
spiraled so high, so fast and with so little regard for convention
as the Internet companies whose market values continue to astonish
Wall Street. What is particularly surprising is that most of them
have few if any physical assets. By David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-LIDDY-REVIEW (Washington) _ It may be the ultimate slap
at the boys in suits who have long dominated U.S. politics: the
hottest electoral commodities, as of last week at least, are best
known for whom they married and have never run for public office:
Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Dole. By Richard L. Berke.

   PET-PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Given the money to be made catering
to Americans' twin obsessions with psychological advice and pets,
it's only a matter of time before a flood of books, TV shows, radio
programs and newspaper columns feature pop psychiatrists whose
specialty is putting Rover on the couch or on Prozac. BY Joe
Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE-DATABASE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Linguists say that digital
libraries like JSTOR will reduce dependence on searching through
libraries to study the history of the language. Already, the word
`hopefully,' long considered a grammatical corruption that
originated in the 1960s, has been found in texts as far back as the
1930s. By Ethan Bronner.

   TV-ANCHORS-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Perhaps to enhance their
legitimacy, America's TV news anchors are increasingly drawn across
the boundary from electronic media to the solid ground of books on

   RUSSIA-MAFIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Comparing the Russian and Italian
mafias. In Italy, the word `mafia' signifies discreet criminal
organizations with strict hierarchical structures, but in Russia it
has come to mean much more. In Russia it embraces the noxious blend
of crime, politics and business that has engulfed the nation in the
post-Soviet era. By Celestine Bohlen.

   CAMBODIA-PROFESSIONS-REVIEW (Phnom Penh) _ In exterminating
Cambodia's lawyers but doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants,
clerks, businessmen, monks, artists and other professionals in the

commerce and civil society. It eliminated the people who might have

SENATE PENS USED IN IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS HAVE SOUVENIR VALUE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Political souvenir collectors, take note.
</P>
<P>
   The pens used by senators to sign an ``oath book'' officially
opening President Clinton's impeachment trial may ultimately fetch
over $100 on the collectors' market.
</P>
<P>
   The Parker Vector pens, with a black shaft, silver cap and
rollerball tip, retail for about $10 at stationery stores.
</P>
<P>
   The pens used Thursday at the start of the impeachment trial are
inscribed with the words ``United States Senator'' along the side
and are standard equipment in U.S. Senate offices.
</P>
<P>
   Their use in the historic opening of the impeachment trial _ the
first impeachment trial of a president in 131 years _ may
dramatically boost the value.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Sullivan, former curator of the Museum of American
Political Life at the University of Hartford, home of the largest
private collection of political memorabilia in the country, said
the 100 pens will be sought after as collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good collectors' market out there for this sort of
thing,'' said Sullivan. ``My guess is they would fetch perhaps $100
or more per pen in the immediate future. Over the years, the price
would probably decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for collectors is determining whether a particular
pen was actually used in the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The pens used at the opening of the impeachment trial didn't
have special markings commemorating the event. As a result, it
would be difficult for collectors to document a particular pen's
connection to the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Olson, editorial director of Pen World International, a
trade magazine that tracks the collectible pen market, said
collectors will use anecdotal evidence to establish the
authenticity of a purported impeachment pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you have to trust the person from whom you are
buying or receiving the pen,'' said Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Fischer, history professor at the Duluth campus of the
University of Minnesota, who helped authenticate pens and other
memorabilia collected by Vice President Hubert Humphrey, said many
collectors would want a signed letter from a senator attesting that
a particular pen was used at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd be worth 20 times as much with a letter of authenticity
from the U.S. senator who got it than they would be as a Parker pen
you could have picked up at the corner drugstore,'' said Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   One bearish note was sounded by John Loring, a Chicago attorney
and avid political pen collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing special in the imprinting to distinguish it
from a pen that would be used last month or next month,'' said
Loring.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a dealer were selling an impeachment pen accompanied by
an authenticating letter, ``I would probably go to $100,'' Loring
said. ``Pens are nice but they are not fantastic collectibles.''

IMPEACHMENT TRIAL MAY POSE FOR REHNQUIST AND HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 10)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist's role as judge at
the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton may be a burden
for Rehnquist personally and may also affect the Supreme Court's
docket of cases to be decided, depending on how long the trial
lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will impact the quality of the Supreme Court's work in
subtle ways that are nevertheless important,'' said Georgetown
University law professor Paul Rothstein, a veteran Supreme Court
watcher, who predicted that impeachment duties will rob Rehnquist
of time needed to ponder difficult cases.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice, however, is not likely to miss oral arguments
in cases before the court because they usually take place in the
morning and impeachment trial sessions start in the afternoon,
unless the Senate sets a different time.
</P>
<P>
   High court rules do not bar justices from deciding cases if they
miss oral arguments. Those who are absent may listen to a tape
recording or read a transcript. In addition, justices and their
clerks can refer to legal briefs submitted in each case.
</P>
<P>
   The court has scheduled oral arguments in 23 cases for Mondays,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays through March 3. Rehnquist should be able
to attend them, since all but one are to be heard in the morning.
The sole afternoon argument is scheduled for Monday (Jan. 11),
which is not a hearing day in the Clinton case under trial
procedures approved by the Senate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 23 cases are a few of the biggest ones the justices
will consider this term. One is a challenge to a California law
that provides more generous welfare benefits to state residents who
have been there more than a year than it does to recent arrivals.
Another looks at whether local school boards can be sued for
damages under a federal sex-discrimination law when students harass
fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist also will be able to continue presiding over the
closed-door conferences that the Supreme Court holds on Friday
mornings. At those conferences the justices announce their views
and vote on most of the cases they have heard that week. They then
decide which ones to take up in the coming months. As chief
justice, Rehnquist assigns the writing of opinions in cases where
he is in the majority. When he is in the minority, the most senior
justice on the majority side performs the task.
</P>
<P>
   To lessen the justices' burden on Fridays, they also meet
Wednesday afternoons to vote on cases argued the previous Monday.
Since Rehnquist's impeachment trial duties will presumably conflict
with the Wednesday meetings, it is possible that the justices may
simply decide their entire week's caseload in their Friday morning
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chief Justice Warren Burger, who served from 1969 to 1986,
conferences were day-long affairs in which justices had free rein
to spar with one another on points of law. Under the energetic,
let's-keep-moving Rehnquist, however, conferences are fast-paced.
Each justice briefly states a view on the case at hand and after
all nine have spoken, a prompt vote is taken.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Brien, a government professor at the University of
Virginia and a close Supreme Court watcher, says Rehnquist ``is one
of the most efficient, business-like chief justices we ever had.
He's superb at compartmentalizing his life and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Most court observers say the 74-year-old Rehnquist should be
able to handle his duties in the monumental marble court as well as
those in the Senate across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about his health come up from time to time. Before he
had surgery in 1995, he suffered from crippling back pain. The
surgery appears to have succeeded, and predictions that Rehnquist
might retire after the 1996 election proved false.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's is going to be a strain, but despite his age he's a
robust man,'' said Charles Cooper, a Washington lawyer and former
Reagan administration Justice Department official who served as a
law clerk to Rehnquist. ``I have no doubt he can bear up under the
additional burden. He'll make the time. The Constitution leaves no
choice in the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But the burden would grow heavier if the trial were to go for
months. The last impeachment trial _ that of President Andrew
Johnson in 1868 _ went 2 1/2 months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running the Supreme Court, Rehnquist also
presides over the Judicial Conference of the United States, the
body that oversees the operations of the entire federal court
system.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clinton trial drags on through the spring, it will cut
into the court's rush to decide cases before the traditional summer
recess at the end of June or beginning of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, the justices are busy writing opinions,'' said
O'Brien. ``It could be that Rehnquist would assign more opinions to
other justices and relieve himself of that burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Few doubt the work of the court will get done, but some
observers wonder whether the quality will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot more to be a good Supreme Court justice than
just taking part in oral arguments,'' said Rothstein. ``It takes
time to read briefs and ruminate'' about how cases should be
decided. ``He wouldn't have that time.''

JOHN THOMPSON RESIGNS AS GEORGETOWN COACH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his past star players along with his current
team flanking him, John Thompson ended an illustrious, influential
27-year coaching career at Georgetown on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning news conference here, Thompson cited the need to
devote more time to his personal life as the reason for his sudden
resignation. Thompson, 57, filed for divorce in October 1997 from
Gwen Thompson, his wife of 32 years. They had been separated since
a fire damaged their home three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson stressed he was not retiring _ and he would not rule
out coaching again someday. But he said he took the advice he has
long given to his players: he stepped aside to deal with private
matters when he could no longer devote the hours and attention to
his job. Georgetown has a 7-6 record, including 0-4 in Big East
Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that I'm going through a problem with my marriage
right now,'' Thompson said. ``I owe it to my family to address
that. I would be irresponsible if I didn't address that.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be succeeded by Craig Esherick, who played for Thompson
from 1974 to 1978 and has been an assistant since 1979 (part of the
time while earning his law degree). His first game is Saturday here
against Providence. The Hoyas will face St. John's at Madison
Square Garden on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's decision came as a shock to almost everyone around
him. Thompson participated in Thursday's conference call of Big
East coaches without giving a clue that the announcement was less
than 24 hours away. And Esherick said he was so surprised that he
tried to talk Thompson into changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not happy for myself but I'm looking forward to the
challenge of this job,'' Esherick, 42, said. ``This is a job I
tried to talk my boss out of for three days. Just like most things
I've tried to talk him out of, I was unsuccessful. He was the very
first recruit I failed to land. I'm sorry for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he also rejected Temple Coach John Chaney's pleas
that he merely take a leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said `Did you ever lend your toothbrush to someone?',''
Thompson said. ``Lending someone your team is like lending someone
your toothbrush.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson will continue to work for Georgetown in what school
president Rev. Loe O'Donovan called a ``coach emeritus'' position,
helping the university on academic, athletic and community
projects.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined at the news conference by Patrick Ewing, Alonzo
Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, three National Basketball Association
stars who gained national attention while playing for him. All
three players credit Thompson with shaping their personal lives as
well as their professional careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great individual, a great man in my eyes,'' Ewing said.
``When I was in school, he was a father figure. We've developed a
great friendship. If there was anything I ever needed, he was
always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Mourning ``just offered me the opportunity to come
to his place and lie in the sun.'' ``I said `Fool, you are crazy if
you really think I'm retiring,' '' he recanted. ``I intend to be at
Georgetown University, getting in the way, while I deal with things
I have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   In leaving the bench, Thompson walks away from a glorious,
high-profile playing and coaching career. He was a member of two
NBA title teams with the Boston Celtics in the mid-1960s and was a
high school coach before joining Georgetown in 1972, taking a
moribund team and turning it into a national power. In those first
two years, though _ when Georgetown did not finish above .500 and
failed to go to a post-season tournament _ some thought Thompson
should be replaced. Before he went to the lectern to speak Friday,
Thompson hugged Mary Washington, a longtime friend who helped rally
support then.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson hasn't had to worry about job security since. He is 4
wins shy of 600 victories _ a milestone he said didn't matter to
him _ and has a .713 career winning percentage. Georgetown lost the
1982 championship to North Carolina when Michael Jordan hit a
jumper in the final seconds. Two years later, Thompson, with Ewing,
beat Houston and Akeem Olajuwon for the title. The following year,
they again reached the championship game but lost to Villanova.
Thompson was the Olympic coach in 1988, where his team won the
bronze medal, the lowest for the United States in Olympic history.
It was also the last Olympics before professional players
participated.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson is nearly as well known for his thoughts and
accomplishments as for his trophies. Even though 17 of his players
went on the National Basketball Association, he was more proud that
97 percent of his players who stayed four years earned a degree. He
has long been outspoken about education and opportunities for
minority groups, and in 1989 walked off the floor before a home
game to protest an NCAA rule that toughened criteria under which
students could receive athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked what the fondest memory of his career is,
Thompson's response had nothing to do with basketball: ``Somebody
walked up to me and told me I wore my blackness well. I thought
that was the biggest compliment I received in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis of St. John's, who coached in Thompson's long shadow
at George Washington University until this season, said: ``His
biggest contribution to the game, because of his stature and his
respect _ whether you like him or not _ is that he has brought a
lot of very positive attention to the fact that African-Americans
can be successful head coaches. ``He's made it possible for people
like me to get the opportunity to be a head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   But last season, Georgetown finished 16-15, its worst record
since 1974. This year's team is off to the worst start in the
20-year history of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Thompson has failed to land many of the
brightest prep stars and he has had to endure off-the-court trouble
with players. Point guard Kenny Brunner abruptly left the team in
the middle of last season only to resurface at Fresno State, where
he has had run-ins with the law. And last autumn, a former player,
Kevin Millen, was arrested twice on campus and was charged with
making threats against Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson insisted that none of the strife played into his
decision, that he, in fact, thrives on adversity. Thompson is said
to have wept when he spoke to his young team Friday morning, but
the normally voluble and emotional coach was dry-eyed during his
announcement. The man who has brought passion _ and a sharp tongue
and wit _ to battles on and off the court seemed very much at
peace.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What do you get the teen-age girl who has everything?
A horse? A Miata? How about a real live Russian ice-dance partner?
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Ariel Williams, then a 10th-grader at the
Dalton School in Manhattan, began to show promise in ice dancing,
her mother, Marian Williams, scouted for a full-time partner for
her. The search led to Dmitri Boundoukin, a Russian-born skater who
was soap-opera handsome.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic imbalances between Russia and the United States
being what they are, Mrs. Williams found herself offering to cover
all of Boundoukin's personal and training costs, which can run to
tens of thousands of dollars a year. In the spring of 1997, she and
her daughter moved from New York to Marlboro, Mass., so Ariel could
train year round with Boundoukin, who was 19 and lived near a
favorite Russian coach in Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The bills, Mrs. Williams said, including living expenses for
both partners, coaching fees, dance lessons and glittery costumes
(which can cost $1,000 for women and $500 for men), and were paid
by her former husband, Gary Williams, a partner at the investment
banking firm of Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Such arrangements are increasingly common in ice dancing, a
sport that attracts many American girls but precious few American
boys, according to skaters, their parents and senior figures in the
sport. They say that girls' parents often wind up dangling the keys
to a car or a house, along with a promise of all expenses paid, to
get foreign-born skaters to lead their daughters in waltzes and
tangos around a rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's buying a partner,'' said Judy Blumberg, a former national
champion ice dancer whose family did not support the American-born
Michael Seibert when they won three medals at world championships
and finished fourth at the Olympics in 1984. (That was the year
Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, ice dancing's most famous
pairing, won the gold medal.)
</P>
<P>
   American boys, who prefer hockey, are seldom interested in
ballroom dances on ice. (The sport differs from freestyle pairs in
that there are no jumps and no lifts above the waist.) So male
partners in the United States are often recruited from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The laws of supply and demand have led young men from Russia,
where ice dancing is just another sport, to increase their demands
for their services. Parents of girls are cultivating something like
a class of foreign gigolos, Ms. Blumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most Russian boys expect to be taken care of,'' she
said. ``They want an expensive costume, or this car and not the
other car.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the foreign-born partners are Russian. Susan Chalom of
West Bloomfield, Mich., said she scoured the nation for a year for
a partner for her daughter, Eve, then 12. The search ended in
Boston, where Eve tried out with Mathew Gates of Hitchum, England.
Mrs. Chalom, recalling that tryout, said, ``I remember I was
filming, and I was filming with my mouth open.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since then, Mrs. Chalom said, she has paid
virtually all expenses for Gates. For him to come from England and
live in her home, she had to become his legal guardian, since he
was then 16. When her son left for Yale, Gates got his room and his
car. Her largest expenses, though, were training and travel. Costs
for the two skaters now top $90,000 a year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of go with what my kids want,'' Mrs. Chalom said. ``Eve
is the one who dragged me to the rink.'' Eve had lost much of her
hearing when she was hit by a car at age 4. ``I probably went along
with it more agreeably because of that,'' her mother said. Where
has the money come from? ``There was a man,'' Mrs. Chalom said: her
former husband, Eve's father.
</P>
<P>
   These days the two train in Texas, where Mrs. Chalom pays for
them to live with two local families. And Gates, now 23, earns some
money by teaching skating so he can pay for incidentals. ``Like
shaving cream,'' Mrs. Chalom said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he is thankful for the Chaloms' support. ``But I am
giving Eve as much opportunity as she gives me to go where she
wants to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership has worked well. The couple have won medals at
the national championships and were on the U.S. World Team in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But even with that success, Mrs. Chalom agrees with critics in
the sport who say that such partnerships often do not result in
medals, because skaters are not matched by leg length and
proficiency, but rather by financial factors. She said she knew of
an American novice competitor whose parents went to Russia to find
her a partner. Although the man was an elite skater in Russia, he
agreed to compete as a novice in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he pulled her around the ice,'' Mrs. Chalom said. ``She
didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Fediukov said Mrs. Chalom must have been describing him.
Fediukov, who is with his third American partner (all three
families have supported him), said that six years ago his initial
patrons, the parents of Julieanna Sacchetti, then 14, traveled to
Russia in search of a partner and found him.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was installed in their home in Wellesley, Mass. ``They
were pretty upscale people,'' he said, But he described skating
with the inexperienced girl as ``six months in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Julieanna ``didn't really trust me and my knowledge,'' he said.
``We couldn't get along,'' he added. ``I would say something
innocent, and she would get upset and tell her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Sacchetti, Julieanna's mother, tells it differently.
She said that Fediukov was too advanced to partner a novice, but
that he did not explain that to the family. ``He played dumb,'' she
said. Of the conflicts with her daughter, Mrs. Sacchetti said, ``he
was rude and unkind and unfeeling toward her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were naive,'' said Julieanna Sacchetti, who is now 20. She
said she knows other American families who were taken advantage of
by what she called manipulative Russian skaters ``because these
parents love their daughters so much.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Fediukov left the Sacchettis. Since 1996 he has
skated with Debbie Koegel, whose family has no complaints. Ms.
Koegel's mother, Susan Clayman, said she and her husband, Martin
Clayman, pay most of the $60,000 in training and living expenses
for the couple, who finished second last month at the eastern
sectional championships for senior-level ice dancers in Oldsmar,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koegel's mother bristled at the suggestion that supporting
Fediukov is tantamount to buying a partner. ``Oleg is not paid to
skate with my daughter,'' she said. ``Oleg wants to skate with my
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt this is true, especially since Fediukov, now 26, and
Ms. Koegel, 21, are a couple off the ice as well, sharing a town
house in Brookhaven, Pa. Mrs. Clayman said Fediukov ``is not
dressing in Calvin Kleins and Polos and driving a Corvette _ he has
a broken-down Honda that needs a radiator.''

 &HT;    SENATORS AREN'T ACTING LIKE REAL JURORS
 &HT;    740&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Larry King, the CNN talk show host, wondered aloud
how senators could sit as jurors in the impeachment trial of
President Clinton when most would be summarily dismissed as too
biased if the case were heard in a criminal courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same rules,'' explained Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchinson, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fact that Hutchinson and several other senators were
opining about the case to a nationwide cable TV audience
illustrates just how different senators are from the millions of
jurors who weigh evidence and render verdicts in courthouses across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine a juror in the O.J. Simpson case popping up on CNBC
at the start of the trial to tell Geraldo Rivera that Mark Furhman
shouldn't be allowed to testify. But some senators _ impeachment
jurors _ openly oppose Monica Lewinsky being called as a witness in
the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a juror in a civil or criminal case went on television and
expressed an opinion, he or she would be promptly removed from the
panel,'' said Bobby Lee Cook, a colorful defense attorney from
Summerville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   This week, all 100 senators raised their right hands and took an
oath to ``do impartial justice'' in the impeachment trial of
Clinton, only the second such proceeding in the nation's history.
In hearing the impeachment case against President Andrew Johnson in
1868, senators did not have to contend with talk shows, DNA
evidence, a controversial special prosecutor, or C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   But those senators were no less political.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between a criminal trial and an
impeachment trial. Senators are the most unique jurors in the
world,'' said Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at
George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic senators ``have already announced they would
vote to acquit regardless of evidence presented,'' Turley said.
``Many are appearing regularly on programs to discuss their
thoughts and concerns before trial even begun.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences between senators and regular jurors are stark.
In addition to going on television and expressing opinions,
senators publicly try to influence their colleagues. No juror can
even discuss a case with another juror before the presiding judge
orders deliberations to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being impartial, three newly elected senators have
already voted on impeachment as House members. Republicans Jim
Bunning of Kentucky and Michael Crapo of Idaho voted to impeach
Clinton, while Democrat Charles Schumer of New York voted against
impeachment. Now each will vote again on whether to remove the
president from office. This is akin to a grand juror voting on an
indictment and then on a verdict in the same case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also not like a jury in the sense that people will call
us and lobby us. You don't have jurors called and lobbied and
things like that,'' Schumer said on ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the legal profession bridle at even using
courtroom terminology to describe what they see as a purely
political process unfolding in the Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sham to call this a trial. None of these people would
be qualified to sit as jurors from either side of the aisle. They'd
all be stricken for cause,'' said Gerry Spence, the buckskin-clad
lawyer from Jackson Hole, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge will ``strike'' or exclude a prospective juror for
having an opinion or having expressed an opinion on case, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a murder case and being asked to choose a
jury from a bunch of murderers,'' Spence said. ``Here we have a
perjury case and having a bunch of liars as jurors. As politicians,
they're all liars by virtue of their profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is ``lying under oath, of course,'' Spence said,
but he judged this a distinction without a difference in a purely
political undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few of these senators would make it through a conventional
jury process,'' agreed Turley.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., is even a member of the extended
presidential family, he noted. Her daughter is married to the first
lady's brother. One juror, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., appeared
with the defendant, Clinton, at a political rally as the trial was
getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The framers had no delusions about the Senate,'' Turley said.
``And history has shown that senators have a remarkably checkered
and uninspiring record on impeachment. They've often engaged in raw
partisan voting'' on cases removing judges from office.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, the senators defended their ability to be impartial
jurors in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have an opinion as long as in the law it's not a fixed
opinion,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``You have to have an
open mind to listen to the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook, the Georgia attorney who successfully defended Bert Lance
in a Carter administration scandal, said the Senate chambers cannot
be equated with a courtroom. An impeachment trial ``is a
quasi-judicial proceeding, yes, but also steeped in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, ``there is no standard of proof that is
applicable'' beyond a reasonable doubt or preponderance of proof or
whatever, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senators ``can make their own rules'' to a large extent, he
said. For example, if a majority of senators disagree with the
ruling of the presiding judge Chief Justice of the United States
William Rehnquist _ they can vote to overrule it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just the jurors,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
``We are also judges in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   For most, it will be a unique experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been called for jury duty in Connecticut five or six
times,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., told King. ``Each time I
go in, they disqualify me because I am a lawyer and a senator. This
is the first time I have had a chance to be on a jury.''

 NEW YORK: a radiator.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But then there is the case of the physician and his wife who
brought a male partner from Russia for their daughter and presented
him with the room and car formerly belonging to her brother, only
to see him leave after a single month with the complaint ``American
girls can't skate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare,'' said the girl's mother, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. But she rejected the suggestion that she
and her husband had been victimized. ``We just got so caught up in
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Gamez, the team director for the U.S. Figure Skating
Association, said such situations are ``a private matter between
those two individuals.'' The association, the sport's governing
body, does not enter such disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents reject any criticism about their part in the
ice-dance bachelor auction. Typically, they maintain that it is
other families who are taken advantage of, that their daughter's
partner is a hard worker with modest needs. Even when the
partnerships win no medals, some parents say they would do it
again.
</P>
<P>
   Before teaming up with Ariel Williams, Boundoukin was the
partner of Tara Modlin, whose parents, Sherry and Bobby Modlin of
Garden City, provided housing for him for two years in Lake Placid,
shopped for his groceries and covered all his training costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I know thought I was nuts,'' said Modlin, who owns a
textile exporting business in Manhattan. He said he used to drive
600 miles round trip, with the family dog, to see his wife and
daughter in Lake Placid on weekends. But he said he has no regrets.
``It cost me a fortune, but I wouldn't give back one minute of
it,'' he said, because Tara ``earned it'' by winning medal after
medal as a novice.
</P>
<P>
   The Modlins had to do more than open their wallets. ``We got
into an adoption situation,'' Mrs. Modlin said. Until Boundoukin
turned 18, the Modlins were his legal guardians so that he and Tara
could compete in the U.S. National Figure Skating Championships.
(He needed an alien-registration card to do so, and their
guardianship ensured that he could get one.)
</P>
<P>
   After finishing last among the junior-level skaters in a field
of 13 at the 1997 nationals, the Modlin-Boundoukin team broke up.
Tara Modlin said there were tensions after an unsuccessful
competitive season capped by a last-minute change of coach and
program.
</P>
<P>
   The family said that there were also romantic problems. ``It was
uncomfortable that his attraction was bigger to me than mine to
him,'' Tara Modlin said. (Boundoukin refused repeated requests for
interviews on his skating career in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Her father was relieved. Although he considers Boundoukin ``a
great kid,'' he did not view him as marriage material for his
daughter, who is now 20 and is majoring in sociology at the
University of Pennsylvania. Tara, who no longer skates
competitively, said she misses Dima, as her former partner is
known, but she said he and other Russian skaters in the United
States didn't understand her interest in academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while,'' Modlin said, ``I wanted him to stay away from
my daughter. I wanted her to pay attention to books.''
</P>
<P>
   The Modlins continued to pay Boundoukin's rent for a few months
until he got on his feet, around the time he teamed up with Ariel
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last year, Mrs. Williams, Ariel's mother, said the
family at first provided sole support for Boundoukin, but
eventually a group that helps ``promising skaters'' began giving
him support. She later confirmed that the group was the New England
Amateur Skating Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Kaplan, the president of the foundation, a charitable
trust based in Providence, R.I., said Boundoukin is one of 100
skaters for whom the foundation raised $600,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel's father, Gary Williams, declined to be interviewed, but a
family friend, who called this reporter at what he said was
Williams' behest, said Williams was contributing to the Amateur
Skating Foundation. The friend, who refused to be quoted by name,
would not say how much.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the sport say that the foundation provides a
funnel for families to give money to skaters while receiving a tax
deduction. For example, Ms. Clayman, the mother of Debbie Koegel,
said she and other relatives pay the nearly $60,000 annual expenses
of Ms. Koegel and Fediukov through the foundation because of the
``tax advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said: ``We support a lot of Russian skaters. I call it my
rent-a-Russian program.'' He said donors cannot earmark checks for
a specific skater (which would threaten the tax deductibility of
their contributions). But he said they can ``suggest'' recipients,
subject to the approval of a three-member foundation committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of donations are under $100, he said. He would
not say if larger donations had come in with the suggestion that
they go to Boundoukin. There is ``nothing unusual or untoward''
about the grants to the young man, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Roberts, a spokesman in Washington for the Internal Revenue
Service, said the foundation's arrangements appeared to violate no
tax regulations, as long as it remained in control of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Boundoukin and his partners have not reached the sport's
senior ranks. The Boundoukin-Williams team, scheduled to make its
first important appearance at a regional competition in Florida
last month, withdrew at the last minute after a ``medical
emergency,'' a competition organizer said. They have not registered
for the national championships Feb. 7 to 14 in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Within skating, people like to gossip about the Russian
partners, but few raise serious objections. Skating, they say, is
expensive, and the demands of training do not allow for a full-time
job. Dick Button, the two-time Olympic gold medalist and television
skating announcer, said it's ``perfectly fine'' for American
families to support foreign-born skaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only interested in good skating,'' he said. ``I don't
care if the person comes from Boise or Vladivostok.''
</P>
<P>
   Until more American boys discover the joys of a twizzle _ a step
maneuver during a waltz _ the imbalance is not likely to change.
``I keep saying to these little hockey boys, `You know, you could
have a great future in figure skating, and all these girls in your
arms,''' Mrs. Williams said.

CROSSOVER VEHICLES DOMINATES AUTO SHOW 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ One problem with auto makers' headlong rush to
cross-breed sedans, wagons, trucks, vans and four-by-fours is
coming up with ways to categorize the new, hybrid forms they are
creating.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen such crossover vehicles made their debuts here
last week at the North American International Auto Show, either as
products soon to be sold, as prototypes of future offerings or as
design studies that may _ or may not _ find their way into
showrooms in some modified form. But even those scrambling to meet
what they perceive as new, unfilled needs in private transportation
seem daunted by the semantics of their creations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Eaton, chairman of DaimlerChrysler, called the
Chrysler PT Cruiser _ a high-roofed small sedan with minivan-style
cargo flexibility and a profile out of the 1930s _ a
``segment-breaker too cool to categorize.'' The car will go on sale
in about a year, starting below $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan called the design of its SUT. ``a collision of a truck
and a sport utility vehicle'' and its new Xterra sport utility ``a
tough, mobile place for stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota described its latest small car, the Echo, as having ``low
floor height with a high seating position.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Mays, Ford's vice president for design, called the (My)
Mercury a concept vehicle ``that blurs the boundaries between a
car, a truck and a sport-utility vehicle.'' And when unveiling the
Explorer Sport Trac, a twist on Ford's popular sport utility with a
pickup bed replacing the covered cargo compartment, spokesmen were
reduced to calling it ``not a car-truck, but a truck-truck.''
</P>
<P>
   While these combinations got much of the attention here, the
auto companies have not altogether abandoned the market for
car-cars. Chevrolet showed its 2000 Impala, dusting off one of
America's best-known automotive names for its new flagship, which
will replace the Lumina when it goes on sale next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Buick showed its redesigned 2000 LeSabre, which is to
reach the market even sooner, and Lexus announced that it would
import in mid-2000 its IS sport sedan, a competitor to the BMW
3-Series and Audi A4.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz showed its all-new S-Class, a trimmed version of
the biggest sedan it makes, while a smaller new Jaguar, the S-Type,
made its American debut.
</P>
<P>
   New small cars included Toyota's Echo, aimed at the
20-somethings Toyota calls the ``Net generation,'' with upgraded
stereos and special CD compartments; DaimlerChrysler's all-new 2000
models of its Dodge and Plymouth Neon, and Ford's Focus, which
replaces the Escort.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few announcements of environmental interest, Honda
said it plans to sell its V V gasoline-electric hybrid, which has
very low emissions and is said to go 70 miles on a gallon of gas,
in the United States. And Ford displayed a working version of a car
that runs on advanced fuel cells that convert hydrogen to energy
with no emissions, though executives acknowledged that a production
version would not come until 2004 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Although nothing on display at Cobo Center generated the buzz
accorded last year to the Volkswagen New Beetle, the car that came
closest to being the show-stopper was a Ford Thunderbird that
captures the flavor of the original T-Birds of 1955-57. The
two-seat roadster has a removable roof, prominent round taillights,
porthole side windows, hooded gauges and a pastel palette. It is
likely to be sold as a 2001 model.
</P>
<P>
   Another name from the mid-50s, the Chevrolet Nomad, was revived
as a sporty retro-style wagon, also resembling a sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Two European sports cars were also crowd pleasers. The Audi TT,
a post-industrial design with a striking Bauhaus-style interior,
made its American debut; it goes on sale in late spring. And
Mercedes showed its Vision SLR, a design study for a high-style,
super-high-performance sports car that draws on the Formula One
look.
</P>
<P>
   Another design study, from Nissan, capitalized on the nostalgia
for that company's Datsun 240Z sports car of the early 70s. The
updated Z has a similar long-hooded look and was planned to sell
for less than $25,000 _ an amount that Nissan said was equivalent,
after adjusting for inflation, to the price of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the few companies without sport utilities joined the
fray. Hyundai showed a prototype, the Santa Fe, that would compete
with vehicles like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. And BMW rolled
out its first all-wheel-drive vehicle, the X5, which it insists is
a ``sport activity vehicle'' not intended for off-road use _ a
strategy intended to prevent the cannibalization of sales from its
Land Rover unit. It will be built in South Carolina and reach
market late this year. &QL;

`SOPRANOS' SINGS; `PJS' DOESN'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Tony Soprano is going through a midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His business isn't what it once was, he's straying from his
wife, and he has been stricken by panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   What does Soprano do? He does what any self-respecting man of
the '90s would do. He starts seeing a psychiatrist and taking
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is that Soprano is not your average yuppy
suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. He doesn't work for a
family business, he works for the family business.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano is a mob boss in New Jersey, and seeing a psychiatrist
is a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese) is fighting him for
power, his mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand), is high maintenance, and
his nephew Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli) is an
overzealous loose cannon who often overlooks Cosa Nostra protocol.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of all that, Tony is falling for his
psychiatrist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco).
</P>
<P>
   And so goes ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's newest series. It deftly
mixes drama with comedy and should do for the hourlong form what
``The Larry Sanders Show'' did for the half-hour: produce the best
television available.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to say what's better in this series, the writing or
the acting.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal scenes are interspersed with brilliant comedy. For
instance, in one episode a mob goon complains that
Italian-Americans have been cheated because they are not reaping
the benefit of the espresso and cappuccino craze. One mobster
imitates Al Pacino from ``The Godfather III,'' and when a mob chief
dies, a naked stripper announces that she will always remember
where she was when she heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   This is a series that can only play on a pay channel such as
HBO. There is nudity, rough language and a lot of violence. It
makes ``NYPD Blue,'' broadcast television's barrier breaker, play
like ``The Teletubbies.''
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini is superb in the lead role of Tony Soprano, and
Bracco also stands out as Dr. Melfi.
</P>
<P>
   HBO is starting out ``The Sopranos'' with a 13-episode order. It
will be back for many more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Give this show a chance. It will be an hour you can't refuse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NICE TO LOOK AT:The foamation technology used in ``The PJs''
makes the cartoon series nice to look at. The voice work by creator
Eddie Murphy and the rest of the cast makes it a fun show to listen
to.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The PJs'' is not a great show to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Other prime-time shows, such as Fox's own ``The Simpsons'' and
``King of the Hill'' and Comedy Central's ``South Park'' and ``Dr.
Katz: Professional Therapist,'' have set a standard for animated
series that ``The PJs'' doesn't approach.
</P>
<P>
   The show's pace is slow. Its pilot story was nothing special,
and the writing was standard sitcom fare.
</P>
<P>
   PJs is short for low-income housing projects, where this show is
set. Thurgood Stubbs (Murphy) is the building superintendent and
the central voice.
</P>
<P>
   The characters have very narrow heads and giant cheeks, sort of
like pinheads with mumps.
</P>
<P>
   The best bits of writing come in the form of pop culture-based
puns. Thurgood exclaims at one point, ``What the LL Cool J. Holy
Moesha.'' Another time he says, ``Whitney Houston, we have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a scene with a crackhead cruising down the street
in a shopping cart, screaming ``I'm king of the world!'' a la
Leonardo DiCaprio in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the script isn't worth mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs'' already has received criticism from African-American
activists who think it pokes fun of the problems in the projects.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that too many characters drink beer out of 40-ounce
bottles, drugging is laughed at, and there are no redeeming
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Thurgood Stubbs, who they characterize as an illiterate janitor,
is actually a well-meaning man with a good heart. But that doesn't
make up for a sitcom that would make a better poster than a
program. &QL;

`MURDER IN A SMALL TOWN': A NEW PERSONA FOR GENE WILDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Wilder might seem an unlikely choice to play a quick-witted
sleuth. But that's just the point. Playing winningly against type,
he makes a charming and surprisingly low-key amateur detective in
``Murder in a Small Town,'' a two-hour A&AMP;E movie to be shown
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, the film's co-writer as well as its star, plays Cash
Carter, a successful Broadway director. (Variety gave him the
nickname Cash because of his string of moneymaking hits.) This is
1938, and he has retreated to Stamford, Conn., to run a local
theater troupe and try to get over the murder of his beloved wife.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Carter's success as a director is his insight into
the human mind, especially the criminal variety. Guiding an actor
through a melodrama, the mop-haired Cash declares that killers have
``this psychopathic juice that flows through their blood.''
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean? Who cares? The look in those familiar
saucer eyes says he's talking from the heart. And the viewer who
engages his own heart and lets his brain idle in low gear will
enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the main order of business is establishing characters
who might return in other mysteries. So here is Cash's pal Lt. Tony
Rossini (Mike Starr), a sweet lug of a cop who tries to show his
affection for Cash with clumsy attempts to use a little Yiddish.
(See, Cash is Jewish. The family name was once Kartofsky.)
</P>
<P>
   To Tony, the solution to each investigation lies inside an
imaginary jar, and he tells Cash, ``You got a special way of
opening up that jar.'' He does, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cash also has a bright, levelheaded college-student daughter,
Sophie (Elisabeth Rosen), who tells him to move on with his life
and marry his girlfriend, Mimi (the splendid stage actress Cherry
Jones). When Ms. Jones and Wilder are on screen together, they
project a sense of goofy fun that spritzes a whiff of '30s
screwball comedy.
</P>
<P>
   You won't confuse this trifle with the works of Sturges or
Capra. But when Wilder, complete with concertina, serenades Ms.
Jones outside her window with a chorus of Rodgers and Hart's
``Mimi,'' and she gazes out at him with an expression of childlike
delight, you may find yourself grinning nearly as widely as they
are.
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say? The plot? Well, here things are back in the
realm of contemporary television, Jessica Fletcher-Lt. Columbo
Division. There's this terrible man. He's unspeakably mean to
everybody: the wife, the son, the secretary; yes, even the butler.
Then somebody kills the terrible man, and Cash figures out who.
</P>
<P>
   The story may not keep you guessing, but the film (the script's
other writer is Gilbert Pearlman; the director is Joyce Chopra)
serves as a warm introduction to Cash and his circle. And the
production, designed by Harold Thrasher, has enough period touches,
like the vintage cars and a garish Chinese restaurant interior, to
reward a close look.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, who has sanded the edges off his usual lunatic persona,
has created an endearing hero: a little smart, a little nutsy, a
little too good to be true. And just winning enough to be invited
back.
</P>

`PURGATORY': SPEAKS SOFTLY, CARRIES NO GUN BUT PACKS A GREAT
WALLOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very few men can stand quietly in the middle of an empty street
with the authority and the tough, soft-spoken sexiness of Sam
Shepard. And the TNT movie ``Purgatory'' is Shepard's best
opportunity since he played Chuck Yeager in ``The Right Stuff'' 16
years ago to show that off.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's character, Sheriff Forest (who turns out to be someone
far more famous), has something in common with Bill Munny, played
by Clint Eastwood in the Oscar-winning film ``Unforgiven.'' He is a
gunslinger, a really good one, who put down his weapons years ago
and became a peaceful, God-fearing man. When a situation arises
that may lead him to strap on his holster again, his decision feels
momentous. And in ``Purgatory,'' a fascinating, deceptively dark
western with more than a touch of ``The Twilight Zone,'' it is.
</P>
<P>
   As the local doctor (Randy Quaid) tells a newcomer, explaining a
fact of life in the little town of Refuge, ``A few bad choices, and
a man could lose his soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The story begins when a gang of bank robbers on the run happen
upon Refuge, an idyllic spot in a green valley bathed in golden
light. They decide to stop and stay a while, especially when the
sheriff tells them that all their drinks, their hotel rooms and the
care of their horses are free. All that is asked of them is that
they not use profanity.
</P>
<P>
   The outlaws, led by Blackjack (Eric Roberts, looking
convincingly scruffy), aren't particularly bright, so none of this
strikes them as strange. Only the young, otherwise naive Sonny
(Brad Rowe, last seen as the blond hunk in ``Billy's Hollywood
Screen Kiss''), who was talked into joining the gang by his rotten
uncle, is suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny is the only one who notices that the mild-mannered
storekeeper looks a lot like Jesse James. In fact, various
townspeople look exactly like Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid and
Doc Holliday (as seen in the dime novels Sonny reads), but of
course they can't be who they look like, because all those famous
gunslingers are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, with mistaken impressions along the way, Sonny figures
out what this place really is. Gordon Dawson's script makes the
process satisfying despite the fact that any viewer who has noticed
the title of the film knows the answer from the beginning. When the
gang's rowdiness gets out of hand, Sonny is appalled that the
townspeople won't defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by new-found love for Rose (Amelia Heinle), a radiantly
beautiful young woman with rope burns around her neck, he decides
to fight back against the guys he rode in with. This leads the
sheriff, the deputy (Donnie Wahlberg), the doctor and the
storekeeper to reconsider their anti-gun stance. Which leads one of
the bad guys to look around at the carnage and observe, ``I guess
they ain't Mennonites'' after all. The shootout, which is
thrilling, goes on a little too long, but don't they all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Purgatory'' has a curious morality. For most of its length,
the film manages to make churchgoing and a determined pacifism look
like the manly, more difficult choices. But then it has the nerve
to make the old-fashioned western shootout exciting again.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Rifle Association who watch the film
will probably conclude that God wants everyone to buy and practice
using firearms. Others, it is hoped, we will realize that what
works dramatically would almost certainly be a disaster in real
life.
</P>
<P>
   The film will probably lose a lot of viewers during the first
half-hour, most of which could be from any western, with a bank
robbery, a posse and lots of horses' hooves in the dust. On the
other hand, a lot of fans of the traditional western are going to
be scratching their heads later when bad guys start getting struck
by strangely purposeful lightning and when the town's church bells,
which should be high and clear, start booming ominously like Big
Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Uli Edel, the director, best known for ``Last Exit to
Brooklyn,'' once directed episodes of ``Twin Peaks'' and ``Tales
From the Crypt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Purgatory'' admirably resists the sentimentality of angelic
voices and diffused heavenly light, at least until the very last
scene; by then even God, it appears, has turned into an old softie.
``The Creator may be tough,'' says the craggy stagecoach driver,
who may be some sort of afterlife courier, ``but he ain't blind.''

ASIAN MARKETS SETTLE DOWN AFTER A DIZZYING WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MARKET) 
(mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The bulls finally stopped stampeding across Asia
Friday, after a week of powerful gains in stock markets from Seoul
to Singapore. Analysts seemed almost relieved, since many were
alarmed by the growing disparity between the rising markets and
Asia's still-sinking economies.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts here worry that the region could face a jolting
retrenchment when investors eventually stop for a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't think this rally will extend beyond the
second quarter,'' said Michael Sargent, head of Asia-Pacific equity
research at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. ``Asia hasn't had
its day of reckoning yet.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, stock markets here registered a mixture of modest
gains and losses. The relative calm came after a dizzying week in
which investors behaved as though the Asian crisis was a memory.
Emboldened by record-setting gains in the United States and a
stronger Japanese yen, they poured money into shares in Hong Kong,
Seoul, Jakarta, Singapore, Taipei and Manila.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index declined by 1.1 percent Friday, the
second consecutive day of losses. Some analysts said the retreat
reflected a recognition that the region's markets were out of sync
with the underlying economies.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Asia, investors have barely paused to catch their
breath since shares first began moving up in September. The
region's markets have sustained the rally in the face of a
relentless stream of dismal economic news, a situation that has
left economists and portfolio managers here baffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really ready to throw in the towel and say, `Nothing
matters anymore but positive investor sentiment,''' said Mac
Overton, a portfolio manager at MBF Unit Trust in Hong Kong. ``The
stock market has continued to increase despite three straight
quarters of lower corporate earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton noted that in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose even
after China issued an unexpectedly bleak prognosis for its economy
in 1999. The Chinese government said lackluster demand would weaken
its domestic economy, while the regional crisis would cause its
exports to falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative implications of these problems for this year's
economic performance should not be underestimated,'' the government
said.
</P>
<P>
   How did Hong Kong, which depends so heavily on China, react to
the warning? Investors drove the Hang Seng 4.5 percent higher on
Thursday and a further three-tenths of a percent Friday. Analysts
said shareholders disregarded the news from China and instead
pinned their hopes on a cut in local interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   After trading ended Friday, the Hong Kong Association of Banks
announced that it would lower its benchmark short-term savings
deposit rate to 4 percent from 4.25 percent. Some analysts said the
announcement might disappoint investors, who had been expecting a
deeper reduction.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, investors were distracted from Indonesia's
continuing economic calamity by a new state budget proposed by
President B.J. Habibie. Unlike previous budgets, Habibie's
proposal, economists said, represented a realistic plan to deal
with Indonesia's stagnant economy, spiraling inflation and weak
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these local factors, experts noted that Asia's stock
markets were now largely propelled by such external forces as rate
cuts by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the
strengthening Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround of the yen has been a big help for the rest of
Asia,'' said Dong Tao, a regional strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston in Hong Kong. ``It has reduced the risk of currency
volatility in the rest of Asia, which has allowed markets like Hong
Kong to cut their own interest rates.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet some analysts wonder how much more Asian countries can rely
on rate cuts to jump-start their economies. In the last three
months, Hong Kong has cut rates five times, Singapore three times
and Thailand more than a dozen times. Even with low rates in
Thailand, economists said the government had not been able to
re-ignite consumer demand or corporate investment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many experts doubt that the Japanese yen will maintain
its strength. The yen has been bolstered in recent days by the
introduction of the euro, which has diverted some investment
capital from the United States to Europe. Late Friday, the yen
traded at roughly 110 yen to the dollar. That makes the yen about
30 percent more valuable than in early August, when it traded at a
nearly eight-year low of 147.66.
</P>
<P>
   But Sargent predicted that as the novelty of the euro wore off _
and the extent of Japan's economic ills re-emerged _ the yen would
resume its downward spiral, reaching 140 to the dollar by late
summer.
</P>
<P>
   To some experts, the most damaging potential side effect of the
rally is that it could breed complacency on the part of Asian
governments, prompting them to delay or scrap needed economic
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators and decision-makers may conclude that they don't
have to act,'' said Jim Walker, chief economist of CLSA Global
Emerging Markets in Edinburgh. ``People could start to think the
stock market is a precursor to a genuine recovery, and that's just
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker noted that the Japanese stock market experienced a
similar rebound after Japan's economic collapse in 1989 and 1990.
Several months later, after Tokyo failed to deal with the country's
growing financial crisis, the Nikkei reversed and plunged to new
lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're into uncharted waters here because Japan was running
huge budget surpluses before its crisis,'' Walker said. ``I don't
think the clock will keep ticking as long for the rest of Asia as
it did for Japan.''

 (af)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Carol Levine has been caring for her husband,
Howard, at home since 1990, when their car skidded on an icy
highway in upstate New York and crashed into a guardrail, leaving
him with a traumatic brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   While Levine, 71, is mentally alert, he is confined to a
wheelchair, cannot feed himself or turn the pages of a magazine. He
seldom leaves the couple's Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The Levines pay $100 a day for a home-care attendant while Mrs.
Levine is at work, but that does not include the cost of physical
therapy or medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Levine was pleased last week when President Clinton
proposed a tax credit of $1,000 a year for people with chronic
illnesses or disabilities who need long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Levine, 63, is one of millions of Americans who care for
close relatives at home. She also works at the United Hospital Fund
of New York, as director of a project that aims to improve the
quality of such services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax credit will be a welcome benefit, a tangible benefit,
for many people,'' she said. ``It also has a lot of symbolic value,
showing the government's support for a type of work that imposes a
tremendous emotional and psychological burden on people.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the tax credit, if approved by Congress,
would help two million people, at a cost of $5.5 billion in the
next five years. The proposal won praise from the American
Association of Retired Persons, the Older Women's League, the March
of Dimes, the nursing home industry, the insurance industry and
Republicans in Congress. So its political prospects appear bright.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the federal government has allowed workers to
claim a tax credit for child-care expenses, but they generally may
not count payments to spouses or their children under the age of
19. By contrast, Clinton's proposed tax break would be available to
people caring for their own relatives, including parents and
children who have chronic illnesses and disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   While the measure would provide some financial relief to many
middle-income Americans, public-policy specialists doubted that it
would do much to encourage more people to care for relatives
because the cost of doing so can easily run to tens of thousands of
dollars a year. That is especially true now that sophisticated
services, like intravenous therapy, can be provided at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's proposal sends a message that he cares, but
I'm not sure that the amount, which averages less than $3 a day,
will make much difference,'' said Andre P. Fogarasi, managing
director of federal tax services at Arthur Andersen.
</P>
<P>
   The government, he said, would get ``more bang for the buck'' if
it offered a similar tax credit to help people buy private
insurance to cover the costs of long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did acknowledge the value of such insurance. He proposed
that the government make it available to federal employees and
retirees at negotiated group rates, but the government would not
subsidize the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Davis, a health policy expert who is president of the
Commonwealth Fund in New York, said she would prefer to see the
government spend the $5.5 billion on improvements in coverage of
home health services under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   That way, she said, the government could channel the money to
lower-income people who most need the assistance and could more
easily set and enforce ``quality standards and basic safety
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tax proposal is probably easier to get through Congress,
which shuns new spending programs these days.
</P>
<P>
   Families claiming the proposed new credit would not have to
collect receipts to document their expenses, but would simply have
to get a doctor to certify that the person receiving long-term care
was unable to perform three or more basic tasks of everyday life,
like bathing, dressing and eating.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says the tax credit would benefit 1.2 million
elderly people, 550,000 younger adults and 250,000 children.
Three-fourths of the people claiming the credit would be spouses or
other relatives tending people who need long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   People could not take advantage of the tax credit if their
incomes were so low they did not have to pay taxes. Indeed, in a
description of the proposal, the administration says, ``Almost all
recipients are middle class'' _ but not necessarily wealthy. About
75 percent of elderly taxpayers have incomes below $50,000, it
said, and a survey found that 40 percent of ``family caregivers''
had household incomes less than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Jackson, a tax partner at Deloitte &AMP; Touche in
Chicago, said the tax credit was ``a great proposal that will help
many people defray part of the cost of caring for relatives.'' But
he observed that the credit would be unavailable to people with
incomes above certain levels _ $130,000 for couples and $95,000 for
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, taxpayers may already take deductions for
medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
Some taxpayers, including middle-income people with high expenses
for long-term care, may find the deduction more advantageous than
the credit.
</P>
<P>
   So, tax experts say, if Congress approves the proposal, many
families should compute their tax returns both ways, to see which
tax break is more beneficial.

`EPISODES': ALIENATION AND BEAUTY IN BALANCHINE WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all their focus on bare movement in time and
space, George Balanchine's most experimental ballets are metaphors
for human existence. How to get through the day might be the
subliminal theme of ``Episodes,'' which Balanchine choreographed in
1959 to orchestral music by Webern.
</P>
<P>
   Revived by the New York City Ballet on Thursday night as part of
its weeklong ``Balanchine Black and White Celebration,''
``Episodes'' stands out by its strangeness even among Balanchine's
most daring works to 20th-century music.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography is unusually spare. Steps are frequently
inverted (hip and knees turned in, feet flexed) but not embroidered
upon. Ingeniously, Balanchine often choreographs in the spaces
between Webern's notes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a quaint sense of 1950s alienation and yet there is
also a gloomy beauty about the ballet. The flesh-and-bones images
of dancers in black leotards or tights eventually yield to a
spiritual respite: a stylized court dance performed to Webern's
well-known orchestration of the ``Ricercata'' section of Bach's
``Musical Offering.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Black and White'' series may suggest old wine in new
bottles, but it has an artistic justification. The Balanchine
ballets, with one exception, are all danced in leotards and tunics,
but even those set to Bach, like ``Concerto Barocco,'' share the
same concentration on purity of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine here is the link between Bach and Webern's view of
Bach. By juxtaposing these leotard ballets in one series, Peter
Martins, City Ballet's artistic director, has made some useful
aesthetic connections.
</P>
<P>
   One is that Balanchine soon dropped the artificiality of
``Episodes.'' The quirkiness of the choreography was absorbed into
his mainstream vocabulary. Nonetheless, the performance on Thursday
was always polished.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Weese and Philip Neal focused on hinged joints, leading
the ensemble in the brave new world of ``Symphony No. 21.'' Their
robotic, streamlined precision gave way to angst, wittily rendered
with acrobatic flair by Helene Alexopoulos and Charles Askegard in
``Five Pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Evans and Wendy Whelan looked suitably trapped, outlining
the convolutions of ``Concerto'' with clarity. They were aided by
Amanda Edge, Andrea Hecker, Carrie Lee Riggins and Jennifer
Tinsley. As for ``Ricercata,'' Darci Kistler and Jock Soto led the
female ensemble with measured grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Fiorato conducted the program, which included ``Apollo,''
in which Nilas Martins, substituting for Peter Boal, and Yvonne
Borree were listless. But Jennie Somogyi, in a technically perfect
debut as the muse Polyhymnia, and Pascale van Kipnis as Calliope,
offered a welcome energy. Danced in tutus (the exception),
``Symphony in C'' nonetheless sported black and white costumes. The
company gave it the same commitment as on opening night in
November.

BRAD MEHLDAU: IMPROVISATION WITH RAPTURE AND OBSESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Toward the end of his first set on Tuesday night at
the Village Vanguard, the pianist Brad Mehldau played his ``London
Blues,'' and the best aspects of his music made themselves clear.
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau can be obsessive when he improvises, stubbornly
repeating phrases, and he did just that; then he slowed the
repeated idea down, letting it jut out against the swing of the
band like a rock in the current of a river. The band slowed down,
picked up his rhythmic ideas and then was on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau's obsessions make his music tense. Throughout the set,
he took figures and mulled them over, placing them in different
registers or slowing them down or speeding them up. Sometimes he
made an idea into a sequence, but mostly he pushed it against the
sound of the trio.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, Mehldau's trio is an exceptional instrument, fluid
and graceful and fully improvising. The three musicians, Larry
Grenadier on bass and Jorge Rossy on drums, along with Mehldau, can
work at three different tempos at once, or come together in deep
swing. Rossy is responsible for much of the group's color, and he
spent a good portion of the night changing tempos behind Mehldau's
improvisations.
</P>
<P>
   Where jazz musicians traditionally are adept at doubling or
halving tempos, Mehldau and the band were working every angle of
time. And Rossy changed the density of the sound, filling up space,
or letting clarity ring. But Mehldau wasn't content to improvise
that way; he was after a different type of romanticism, and on at
least half of the material he dug deeply into the tranquillity of
an early version of the Bill Evans trio.
</P>
<P>
   Mehldau, who has strong foundations in classical music, brought
chord movements and ideas, and a classical articulation, to
ballads. With his eyes closed, his head drooping toward the
keyboard, he seemed to be in deep rapture; that the music became
static and unswinging at times didn't seem to bother him, or the
appreciative audience. (Mehldau will be performing through Sunday.)

CLINTON TOUTS THRIVING ECONOMY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Leaving behind his impeachment woes, President Clinton
came to a snowy Motor City on Friday to highlight a thriving
national economy he touted as the longest in peacetime history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called attention to the very issue that may be keeping
his approval rating at record highs despite his impeachment by the
House and a pending trial in the Senate for perjury and obstruction
of justice, a by-product of his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gather today at a time of an American economic
renaissance,'' Clinton told nearly 2,000 members and guests at the
Economic Club of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The president hailed an estimate by his economic advisers that
December will mark the 93rd month of the current economic
expansion, surpassing the 92-month peacetime record set under the
Reagan-Bush administrations. And, he announced new unemployment
figures showing a 4.3 percent jobless rate for December and an
average annual rate of 4.5 percent for 1998, the lowest in 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton never mentioned his political woes or the
pending Senate trial, congressional Democrats here helped stage a
pep rally outside Cobo Center where the president also toured the
North American International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave Bill alone,'' chanted scores of Clinton supporters as
Michigan Democrats John Conyers, the ranking member of the House
Judiciary Committee, David Bonior, the House minority whip, and
John Dingell, the ranking member of the House Commerce Committee,
condemned Republicans for partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has not committed any impeachable offense,''
Dingell contended. ``On the important issues that people are
concerned about the president is right. You are right in supporting
the president. Let's get down to the nation's business and let's
stop that silly charade in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   A smaller group of anti-Clinton protesters gathered across the
street calling for the president to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's press secretary, said Clinton
watched none of the Senate rituals this week as its members
prepared for trial. ``The president obviously understands what's
going on in the Senate. It's in the hands of the Senate. He's
focusing on his agenda,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Economic Club, only Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer,
recently named by Clinton as a co-chairman of the national
Democratic Party, referred to the ``challenges'' in Washington
facing the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the political challenges facing the president in
Washington, some wonder why his popularity remains so high among
average Americans, those of us here in the heartland. In Detroit,
it's no mystery. We respect and appreciate a president whose
policies put people first,'' Archer said as he introduced the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the Economic Club forum to showcase his
administration's economic policy, which he said helped create ``the
longest economic expansion in peacetime in the history of the
United States.'' The ``peacetime'' caveat excludes the nation's
longest economic expansion, which was 1961 through 1969 during the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equally important to me, this one is different from the ones
of the last several years. It is inclusive, not exclusive,''
Clinton said. He pointed to the highest real wage growth in two
decades, the lowest jobless rates for blacks and Hispanics since
1972 and an average family income increase of $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rising tide that is lifting all boats,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also cautioned against complacency. He said the
nation must deal with the challenges of a global economy, and
protect surpluses in order to reform Social Security, invest in
education and training programs and boost long-term health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main idea I want to leave you with is that the temptation
to rest on our laurels and relax because times are good must be
resisted. We will never have, in all probability, in the lifetime
of the people in this room, a better opportunity to take the long
view, to imagine how our children will live when they're our age,
to imagine how our grandchildren will live when they are our age.
These are the challenges we should be dealing with today,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   William Halling, club president, also read written questions,
none of which referred to Clinton's political problems, but the
president turned wistful as Halling read a question from a child
asking who is the most interesting person Clinton has met.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, said Clinton, was Nelson Mandela, the South African
jailed for 27 years by the apartheid regime and freed to become the
nation's first black president. ``I don't know another human being
that suffered so much for so long and came out so much stronger and
richer and deeper than (when) he went into his period of
suffering,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton often cites Mandela, who befriended his former captors,
as his inspiration for learning how not to hate his own political
enemies.

AUTO-REVIEW (Phoenix) - The most remarkable thing about the Honda
Civic GX, powered by compressed natural gas (CNG), is that it's so
unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The driveability of the natural-gas Civic feels nearly identical
to a run-of-the-mill, gasoline-powered Civic. Maybe a bit light on
torque at low engine speeds, but otherwise a normal Honda
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The big exception is that the CNG Civic produces 20 percent less
greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent gasoline vehicle, and
emits nearly zero hydrocarbons. The flip side is that cruising
range is limited to about 200 miles per tank of CNG, and CNG can be
hard to come by. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in the ``L''

   GALVESTON, Texas _ In a former life it was owned by the infamous
Fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In another incarnation it had a role in the 1968 children's
movie ``Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' and several other feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 120-foot yacht formerly called the ``Chryseis'' is being
prepared for yet another role: that of a floating bed-and-breakfast
inn on the waterfront of this island resort city about 50 miles
southeast of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Tied up at Pier 22, the two-masted schooner is undergoing an
extensive renovation as its latest owners prepare to open it in
early March. It has been renamed the ``Stacia Leigh'' after the
daughter of Pat and Bonnie Hicks, who are among the investors in
the bed-and-breakfast project.
</P>
<P>
   Docked just an oar's throw from the restored 1877 tall ship
Elissa, the inn will offer unusual close-up views of huge cargo
ships and the activities of a major seaport as well as close
proximity to shopping, entertainment and annual events such as
Mardi Gras in the city's downtown historic district, just a block
away.
</P>
<P>
   The bed-and-breakfast will be the latest attraction along the
stretch of waterfront from Pier 19 through Pier 22 that includes an
offshore oil industry museum, a picturesque shrimp boat fleet,
seafood restaurants, shops, a theater that features local history
documentaries and the 42-room Harbor House Hotel, the only other
inn on the busy Galveston Ship Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``Chryseis'' after it was built in Le Havre, France,
in 1906, the schooner was owned until 1937 by Louis Renault, the
designer and builder of Renault automobiles. He sold the yacht to
Count Galeazzo Ciano of Livorno, Italy, who married Mussolini's
daughter, Edda.
</P>
<P>
   Ciano was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1936 until 1943. A
philosophical split resulted in Mussolini branding him a traitor
and ordering him killed. Edda Ciano lived until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mussolini and his mistress took over the boat in 1944 and had
it about a year before Italian rebels caught up with him and killed
him in 1945,'' said Pat Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Not much is yet known of the vessel's history between the war's
end and just a few years ago, when it ended up in Florida, said
Hicks, 52, a Beaumont, Texas, native and retired Austin excavation
firm owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know it appeared in four movies and a couple of
documentaries,'' he said. ``The most well-known movie is ``Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang'' and the others are ``Seven Cities of Atlantis,''
``The Count of Monte Christo'' with Richard Chamberlain and Tony
Curtis, and also a movie called ``S.S. Commodore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We found the boat over in Ponce Inlet in Florida back in March
of last year and were able to acquire it,'' Hicks said. ``It took
31 days to motor it back to Orange (Texas), where we put it in dry
dock.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of care in its past few years in the Daytona Beach area in
Florida did more damage than more than 80 years in active use,
Hicks said. It left the decks and the original wheelhouse in
terrible shape, as was the cabin in which Mussolini slept, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the hull, which is all riveted iron, was in really good
shape after 92 years,'' Hicks said. ``The masts are the originals,
too. We took all the decks off and completely rebuilt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will see the original windlass, which raised the
anchor, as well as the binnacle (compass stand) and ship's wheel, a
desk Mussolini is believed to have used and other original
fittings, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Windows and red oak exterior panels of the cabins, dining and
salon areas are designed identically to those of the original
wheelhouse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have 12 suites with queen-size or king-size beds
and separate bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs,'' Hicks said. ``On the
dock, we'll have a hot tub and sauna and you can even get a massage
by appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent unpleasant odors, the boat's diesel engines have been
removed and its bilge and interior hull completely cleaned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides old photos of the boat, Hicks has other related
historical material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 1939 Life magazine with Mussolini on the cover and
it's got pictures inside of Ciano with Hitler,'' he said. ``We're
going to make a wall-hanging for each suite from that magazine.
Each suite will be named after a World War II figure like
Mussolini, Patton, Rommel, Churchill and others. We'll have a
scrapbook that people can look at, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Room rates will run around $150 and people already have booked
rooms for the first months of operation, Hicks said. Breakfast, of
course, is included, and room service will be available throughout
the day from the neighboring Fisherman's Wharf restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While the floating inn could be moved if Galveston's tourist
economy crashed, Hicks said he believes the ``Stacia Leigh'' will
be a permanent fixture on Galveston's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his wife also envision weddings, parties and
small business functions on the vessel's covered dock area, main
deck and topside 80-foot sundeck. For more information, call
409-750-8858.

FOR THE FED, A SIDESHOW TAKES CENTER RING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, as Alan Greenspan so often says, deals in
the real economy, not sideshows. Inflation, output, profits,
employment, exports, productivity _ these are all aspects of the
real economy.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, in the Fed's scheme of things, is a sideshow.
But the sideshow has now decisively moved into the center ring,
creating a terrible dilemma for the Federal Reserve and the public,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed normally regulates the real economy by adjusting
interest rates, lowering them to stimulate growth and raising them
to remove this stimulus. In normal times, stock prices then rise or
fall in reflection of the changing pace of the real economy, almost
as if the market were a meter. But over the last 12 weeks, and
particularly the last four, the stock market has shot up quite on
its own. Instead of leading the market, the real economy now
follows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who claim that we are in a new era of
economic performance, and the high stock market reflects this new
reality,'' said Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist. ``There is
some truth to that claim. But when all is said and done, what we
really have in the stock market today is a speculative bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   The bubble creates the Fed's dilemma. In the past, Greenspan has
cautiously avoided sharp changes in interest rates, instead
favoring gradual moves to nudge the real economy without provoking
an overreaction in stock and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the bubble has become so sensitive that even a quarter-point
move by the Fed is potentially calamitous, threatening wild stock
market swings with the power to drag the economy along with them.
</P>
<P>
   Say the Fed finds itself wanting to cut rates to offset some new
danger _ a Brazilian meltdown, for example, or the unanticipated
bankruptcy of some high-flying technology company. Wall Street
would view the rate cut as further evidence that, when adversity
strikes, the Fed stands ready to bail out the economy and the
market. And stock prices would shoot up again, just when they are
already 30 percent overvalued, according to several Wall Street
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another rate cut would whip up the near-mania that already
exists,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston
&AMP; Co., a bond firm.
</P>
<P>
   Or say the Fed decides it must raise rates instead, to head off
inflation. It's not such a far-fetched idea: The economy grew in
the fourth quarter at a very robust annual rate of nearly 4
percent, preliminary figures suggest, and the December job figures
came in strong on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending played a big role in the healthy showing, and
rising stock prices fueled a big chunk of this spending. They also
encouraged business investment, another source of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Boom times like these inevitably raise inflation concerns in the
minds of Fed policy makers, even though inflation is very low. But
they pose for the Fed the awful choice of leaving rates alone _ and
encouraging investors to go on thinking that the Fed cares more
about sustaining high stock prices than controlling inflation _ or
raising rates to slow the economy, with consequences that could be
very unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising rates is out of the question,'' said Robert V.
DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``It would burst
the bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   A plunging stock market would then chill the economy much more
than the Fed intended. For example, a 30 percent decline in stock
prices over 12 weeks could reduce economic growth by a painful 2.3
percentage points, according to a computer model of the economy
developed by Macroeconomic Advisers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's top officials, including Greenspan, have said very
little lately about the stock market, although some hinted last
week that they consider stock prices higher today than the real
economy can justify. The Fed put itself in this tough spot
unintentionally last fall, when the Dow Jones industrial average
was 26 percent lower than it is today, and the Fed made three rate
cuts of a quarter-point each.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to save the American economy and the world
financial system from the devastating blow of Russia's meltdown,
the near bankruptcy of Long-Term Capital Management and the abrupt
refusal of frightened investors to lend to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed policy makers recognized, according to the minutes of
their Nov. 17 meeting, that their third rate cut, approved that
day, ``might trigger a strong further advance in stock market
prices that would not be justified on the basis of likely future
earnings and could therefore lead to a relatively sharp and
disruptive market adjustment later.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather prescient, so far. The world was saved, and stock prices
did shoot up, cornering the Fed and setting the stage for the next
disaster _ the disruptive market adjustment _ just when the
American economy seems to be moving along so well.
</P>

THE PROMOTION THAT WASN'T  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wis., Tenn.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Q. (italics)I am an engineer at a manufacturing company. When a
resignation opened up a manager's job, I held up my hand. A slate
of candidates was evaluated, and I was told that the job was mine.
At the last hour, however, the outgoing manager had a change of
heart about leaving _ and the company let him stay. I got an
apology and some vague promises about future opportunities. My
mentor's advice is to get out as soon as I can, reasoning that
these people can't be trusted. But a job change would require
relocating, which I would rather avoid. I was satisfied with the
company until this happened, and I'm tempted to use the situation
as an excuse to ask for a raise.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Easy there. You clearly have had a roller-coaster month, and
you don't want to do anything rash while your head is still
spinning.
</P>
<P>
   First, do not assume that yours is a uniquely horrible setback
perpetrated by an insidious management. ``There isn't a month that
goes by that I don't hear of a similar incident,'' said Thomas J.
Wiltzius, chief executive of Career Development Group in Appleton,
Wis. ``Your employer's decision should not be taken as a lack of
confidence or an act of bad faith.'' By offering you the promotion,
the company has made it clear that it values your contribution,
Wiltzius said. In this case, he added, the organization simply
found it wiser to retain the existing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Just because this situation turned out badly for you does not
mean that your employer made a bad decision, agreed Bruce Barry, an
associate professor of management at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville. After all, he asked, do you really think the company
should slam the door in the outgoing manager's face? ``I would
rather work for a company that tries to keep its people and that
lets somebody change his mind than a company that doesn't,'' Barry
said. ``The fact is that people make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, appreciating the big picture does not necessarily
make you feel any better _ a fact that your employer needs to
grasp. You had ``a big opportunity just snatched away,'' Barry
said, and the question is how well you are being treated in light
of that. He suggested sitting down with whoever made this decision
and explaining (in a reasoned way, of course, and without whining)
how deflating this experience has been. ``Help them to understand
your situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Angling for a bump in salary may not be smart. ``If what you
really wanted is opportunity, don't negotiate for money,'' Barry
said. ``Going for the money could make you a little more satisfied
in the short run but have unintended negative consequences. Others
might say, `All he really wanted was more money.' '' This could
ruin your chances for future promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the magnanimous route, Wiltzius said, is the better
approach. ``Thank management for the vote of confidence and extend
a sympathetic response to them, reflecting that you understand it
was difficult for them to make this choice,'' he said. And make
sure to emphasize your continued interest in advancing into
management.

<P>
   DETROIT _ One problem with auto makers' headlong rush to
cross-breed sedans, wagons, trucks, vans and four-by-fours is
coming up with ways to categorize the new, hybrid forms they are
creating.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen such crossover vehicles made their debuts here
last week at the North American International Auto Show, either as
products soon to be sold, as prototypes of future offerings or as
design studies that may _ or may not _ find their way into
showrooms in some modified form. But even those scrambling to meet
what they perceive as new, unfilled needs in private transportation
seem daunted by the semantics of their creations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Eaton, chairman of DaimlerChrysler, called the
Chrysler PT Cruiser _ a high-roofed small sedan with minivan-style
cargo flexibility and a profile out of the 1930s _ a
``segment-breaker too cool to categorize.'' The car will go on sale
in about a year, starting below $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan called the design of its SUT. ``a collision of a truck
and a sport utility vehicle'' and its new Xterra sport utility ``a
tough, mobile place for stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota described its latest small car, the Echo, as having ``low
floor height with a high seating position.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Mays, Ford's vice president for design, called the (My)
Mercury a concept vehicle ``that blurs the boundaries between a
car, a truck and a sport-utility vehicle.'' And when unveiling the
Explorer Sport Trac, a twist on Ford's popular sport utility with a
pickup bed replacing the covered cargo compartment, spokesmen were
reduced to calling it ``not a car-truck, but a truck-truck.''
</P>
<P>
   While these combinations got much of the attention here, the
auto companies have not altogether abandoned the market for
car-cars. Chevrolet showed its 2000 Impala, dusting off one of
America's best-known automotive names for its new flagship, which
will replace the Lumina when it goes on sale next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Buick showed its redesigned 2000 LeSabre, which is to
reach the market even sooner, and Lexus announced that it would
import in mid-2000 its IS sport sedan, a competitor to the BMW
3-Series and Audi A4.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz showed its all-new S-Class, a trimmed version of
the biggest sedan it makes, while a smaller new Jaguar, the S-Type,
made its American debut.
</P>
<P>
   New small cars included Toyota's Echo, aimed at the
20-somethings Toyota calls the ``Net generation,'' with upgraded
stereos and special CD compartments; DaimlerChrysler's all-new 2000
models of its Dodge and Plymouth Neon, and Ford's Focus, which
replaces the Escort.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few announcements of environmental interest, Honda
said it plans to sell its V V gasoline-electric hybrid, which has
very low emissions and is said to go 70 miles on a gallon of gas,
in the United States. And Ford displayed a working version of a car
that runs on advanced fuel cells that convert hydrogen to energy
with no emissions, though executives acknowledged that a production
version would not come until 2004 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Although nothing on display at Cobo Center generated the buzz
accorded last year to the Volkswagen New Beetle, the car that came
closest to being the show-stopper was a Ford Thunderbird that
captures the flavor of the original T-Birds of 1955-57. The
two-seat roadster has a removable roof, prominent round taillights,
porthole side windows, hooded gauges and a pastel palette. It is
likely to be sold as a 2001 model.
</P>
<P>
   Another name from the mid-50s, the Chevrolet Nomad, was revived
as a sporty retro-style wagon, also resembling a sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Two European sports cars were also crowd pleasers. The Audi TT,
a post-industrial design with a striking Bauhaus-style interior,
made its American debut; it goes on sale in late spring. And
Mercedes showed its Vision SLR, a design study for a high-style,
super-high-performance sports car that draws on the Formula One
look.
</P>
<P>
   Another design study, from Nissan, capitalized on the nostalgia
for that company's Datsun 240Z sports car of the early 70s. The
updated Z has a similar long-hooded look and was planned to sell
for less than $25,000 _ an amount that Nissan said was equivalent,
after adjusting for inflation, to the price of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the few companies without sport utilities joined the
fray. Hyundai showed a prototype, the Santa Fe, that would compete
with vehicles like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. And BMW rolled
out its first all-wheel-drive vehicle, the X5, which it insists is
a ``sport activity vehicle'' not intended for off-road use _ a
strategy intended to prevent the cannibalization of sales from its
Land Rover unit. It will be built in South Carolina and reach
market late this year. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dark brick factory complex on the Brooklyn
waterfront would not look out of place in a moody industrial
landscape by Edward Hopper. A few years ago, most of the windows
were broken, roofs were collapsing, interiors were contaminated
with asbestos and the basement was cluttered with leaking drums of
toxic substances. The city, which owned the site in the Greenpoint
neighborhood, was on the verge of demolishing this cluster of
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Walk inside today, though, and you find a warren of vibrant
spaces filled with hundreds of woodworkers, artists and craftsmen.
You hear hammering and grinding noises, smell oil paint and sawdust
and see teams of cabinet makers banging together kitchen cabinets _
or a single artist laboring over multicolored spiral glass
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Built in the 19th century as a rope factory, the complex at 1155
Manhattan Ave. _ actually eight connected buildings _ is now home
to the Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center, a nonprofit
corporation that provides woodworkers and artists with affordable
work space in a communal environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't moved here, I'd be out of business,'' said Ricky
Eisenberg, the owner of Creative Cabinets and Carpentry Ltd., one
of the center's 68 tenants. ``In Manhattan, I was paying double the
rent for a quarter of the space I have here. So now I have an
eightfold advantage. This building is run by half-communism,
half-capitalism, and it works out pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   However muddled the ideology, urban experts count the Greenpoint
project in the vanguard of a campaign to revive inner-city
industrial zones one building at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really have any models for how to do this,'' said
David Sweeny, 34, the center's chief executive. ``We aren't
visionaries with 10-year plans for incubator projects. We're
problem-solvers, opportunists.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, as in cities across the nation, opportunities
abound for creative reuse of the derelict hubs of once-thriving
manufacturing economies. Over the last three decades, thousands of
New York's manufacturers have been driven out of business or out of
the city, the victims of escalating rents, taxes and crime rates;
onerous zoning regulations, and tight-fisted banks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Greenpoint center offers a model for bringing some of
the abandoned industrial space back to life. In the early 1990s,
Sweeny and his board of directors cobbled together a patchwork of
financial support from public and private sources, and _ with
political pluck, the good will of suppliers and the sweat equity of
tenants _ took control of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the first year of operation, the buildings were in such
bad shape that the center could rent only 40,000 square feet of
space to 12 businesses. Today, virtually the entire
360,000-square-foot complex is rented, and its tenants employ 460
people.
</P>
<P>
   The project has generated jobs and job training for Greenpoint,
a blue-collar neighborhood with a population that is largely
Polish, Irish and Hispanic, and is contributing $135,000 a year to
the city in property taxes and about $800,000 in city and state
payroll taxes. There is a long waiting list of prospective tenants.
Sweeny's organization is consulting for a number of like-minded
nonprofit groups, has just opened a for-profit furniture business
and is evaluating other old industrial sites where it hopes to
reproduce its brand of what Sweeny calls ``commie venture
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all surprised by their success,'' said Anne Habiby,
director of research at the Institute for a Competitive Inner City,
a group in Cambridge, Mass., that was founded by Michael Porter, a
Harvard Business School professor, to promote business expansion in
distressed urban areas. What the Greenpoint center has done, she
said, ``is to reproduce in microcosm the elements of a successful
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the Greenpoint group isn't the only one in the country
doing this kind of work, she said, ``they are way out ahead of the
curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneers in the Wreckage
</P>
<P>
   The buildings at 1155 Manhattan Ave. became the city's problem
in 1972, when their last owner, the Grossen Dye Works, failed to
pay its taxes. Left largely empty and decaying, the complex fell
into further disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, a few artists and woodworkers were allowed to take
30-day leases on odd spaces scattered around the buildings, as long
as they agreed to plug leaks, build walls and wire the work spaces
themselves. The rent was minimal and the space was vast, but only a
few pioneers were willing to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building was a wasteland,'' recalled Dennis Niswander, an
abstract painter who found his way to Greenpoint in 1982, after the
rent tripled on his Times Square studio.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Brooklyn, ``I'd have to walk through 10,000 square feet
of empty, decrepit space to get to my studio,'' said Niswander, now
the center's physical-plant manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emergency conditions all over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city closed down some parts of the buildings for code
violations, estimating the cost of necessary renovations at $14
million. The complex was shopped to residential developers, but
with the drop in real estate prices in the mid-'80s, there was
little interest.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, tenants who were fed up with conditions in the
complex banded together as the Woodworking Center Equity Corp., to
manage the building and negotiate leases. They hired Niswander to
do major repairs, like fixing a burst water main. He and a crew of
three removed some 250 tons of scrap metal and learned to move
abandoned machines weighing up to two tons with nothing but
crowbars.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they developed a sense of ownership for a
crumbling structure that, it seemed, no one else wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building has retained a kind of aesthetic and human
history not documented anywhere,'' Niswander said. ``I crawled
around every square inch of it, until it became like the exterior
of my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sweeny entered the picture in 1990. A slight, bearded economics
graduate of the University of Vermont, he had a mild manner that
concealed a strong will. At the time, he was the director of
economic development for the North Brooklyn Development Corp., a
nonprofit community group. Forgoing the Harvard Business School,
where he had been admitted, Sweeny became swept up in Niswander's
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been studying how to bring employment to low-income
neighborhoods, and this project seemed like a great lab experiment
in which to test my theories,'' Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the angry tenants and a number of volunteer real
estate and legal specialists, the two men incorporated the
Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center in May 1992 and applied
to buy the entire complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed so elegantly simple,'' Sweeny said. ``The city was
getting no taxes from this building and they had no buyer, yet it
was filling up with tenants who were willing to fix it themselves.
I thought it would be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't. On Thanksgiving weekend in 1992, inspectors from
the city's Department of Buildings shut down the elevators, calling
them unsafe, and fined a sister agency, the Department of Real
Property, which owned the buildings. Unable to make deliveries to
the upper floors, 60 outraged woodworkers protested by smashing
wooden chairs into splinters on the steps of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a highly balkanized situation,'' recalled Leslie
Winter, a former assistant commissioner in the Division of Real
Property who now is chairman of the center's board. ``The city was
fining itself, and everybody had different ideas on what should be
done with the building.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the city's Economic Development Corp.
allowed Sweeny's group to take over management of the building,
though not the leasing of space.
</P>
<P>
   The pivot point came in 1993, when city officials refused to
allow a French furniture maker to finance $500,000 in improvements
and lease 30,000 square feet in the complex. Sweeny and Niswander
had had enough. They created a 200-page development schedule and
invited city politicians to Greenpoint, ``to smell the sawdust and
see the furniture,'' Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Weisbrod, then the president of the city's Economic
Development Corp., visited the site on his own and agreed to
intervene on the center's behalf. On Feb. 28, 1994, the city sold
the building to Sweeny's group for $1. The city had already spent
$750,000 on an environmental cleanup of the site and now promised
to set aside an additional $1 million for safety improvements, like
fixing the sprinkler system and elevators.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the city's perspective, we assumed a $14 million
liability for a dollar,'' Niswander said.
</P>
<P>
   Building a Balance Sheet
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the center lost $180,000. ``The first year was the
worst time for us _ and the best,'' Sweeny recalled, stroking his
seeing-eye dog, named Rogers, as he sat in his modest, doorless
office at the center. Born with retinoblastoma, a rare form of
cancer that causes a tumor on the eye, Sweeny has gradually lost
all of his sight over the last few years _ though, as long as he
could, he continued to bicycle fearlessly across the Brooklyn
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In that difficult first year, Sweeny said, enthusiasm did much
to keep the project going. The managers granted rent credits to
tenants for renovation work they had done on their own spaces; some
contractors and materials suppliers deferred their compensation,
and Sweeny, who was working full-time at the center by this time,
didn't take a salary for the first 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the part of the model that I'm not sure others can
replicate _ everyone's dedication,'' Sweeny said. ``It was
completely crazy. I didn't know how we were going to finance our
operations. I didn't even know who our tenants were going to be. A
sophisticated real-estate person would have told us, `There's no
light at the end of this tunnel _ no light.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly what Sweeny was told by most of the
financiers he approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first year we were shopping for a line of credit and were
continually rejected,'' he said. ``The banks gave us good chat on
the phone, but they were skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there were other sources of help. When the founders
established the Greenpoint Center organization, a grant of $7,500
from the J.P. Morgan Charitable Trust accounted for nearly a third
of its budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like that, a little bit of money goes a long
way,'' said Hildy Simmons, managing director of community relations
and philanthropic services at the trust. ``In grant-making, you try
to support the right people, and we really responded to David
Sweeny. He was determined to make things happen. What he's done is
the best of modest-scale economic development in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking possession of the building, the group has received
additional small grants from the Morgan trust and from Brooklyn
Union Gas and Chase Manhattan Bank; aid from foundations like the
New York Foundation, which helps support grass-roots neighborhood
projects, and loans from agencies like the federal Office of
Community Services and the Nonprofit Facilities Fund, a private
group that has some city financing.
</P>
<P>
   The center has used the money to improve the services it offers
to tenants _ _ from computer training programs and apprenticeships
for underprivileged children to help for cabinetmakers in learning
to market their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the center, with an operating budget of about $1 million
a year, is self-sufficient. Rents pay for the upkeep and
improvement of the buildings' windows, roofs and elevators, and
underwrite a full-time construction crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all of our grants were to dry up tomorrow, the building
would be fine,'' Sweeny said. ``We just wouldn't be able to offer
our training programs. What we do isn't social welfare for small
businesses; it's strict economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Today, the center is finishing the last phase of its renovation,
bringing the cost to $6.8 million _ $3 million from the center's
earnings and the remainder from a combination of grants and loans
from government and private sources. The total is half what the
city had projected for restoration, but the project has been spread
over four years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the center's strengths has been staying true to its
mission of keeping rents affordable and building a community of
woodworkers and artists. The directors _ ``four hippie woodworkers;
four gray suits from the worlds of finance, architecture and law,
and me,'' is how Sweeny characterized them _ made it a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fishmongers looking to rent space, and it was tempting
to take their money,'' he said. ``But we learned that real estate
becomes more valuable when you restrict the kinds of tenants you
allow in.''
</P>
<P>
   By being part of a critical mass of businesses that draw on
similar skills, trade their resources and do not compete directly
with one another _ all at a strategic location near Manhattan _ the
center's tenants ``gain a clear competitive advantage,'' said Ms.
Habiby of the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of business development is around clusters,'' she
said. She pointed to Grand Rapids, Mich., the location of another
emerging woodworking cluster, and to a telecommunications cluster
that has flourished in downtown Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is as old as the Middle Eastern bazaar or the
European farmers' market and as fundamental to urban life as the
flower, fish and food markets that still thrive, to varying
degrees, in even the creakiest American cities. But it is being
rediscovered after several decades in which the growth of American
light industry was largely in the suburbs or the cities of the Sun
Belt.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn center, Ms. Habiby said, ``is certainly a model for
others to watch.'' And, she added, ``their mix of funding seems
ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Languages, Few Borders
</P>
<P>
   Inside 1155 Manhattan Ave., the work spaces range from an
artist's 600-square-foot studio to a 30,000-square-foot woodworking
operation that employs 70 people on three floors. Average rents in
the building are $4 to $5 a square foot, compared with $10 to $12
for comparable space in Manhattan and $7 to $9 in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you open a door it's a new story,'' said Mariusz
Cwalina, the building superintendent, a native of Poland whose
father is a woodworker at the center. ``You could wander in here
for a week, and every person you meet is speaking a different
language and doing something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenants often give one another advice or work together on
projects. ``There's a lot of cross-pollination here,'' said Paul
Seide, a glass artist who has been at the center since 1990. Seide
makes colorful glass spirals filled with neon gas, and another
tenant makes wooden pedestals for the spirals to sit on.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the complex invested $200,000 in a wood production
center, filling an L-shaped room with new woodworking machinery for
communal use. Last October, the center established Spacecraft, its
first for-profit business, a joint venture with the furniture
designer Jonas Milder, who is based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to
build and distribute a line of tables, desks and bookcases.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have questioned the harnessing of for-profit
subsidiaries to nonprofit organizations, saying such connections
can create misunderstanding of a nonprofit's finances and pollute
its philanthropic mission. But Sweeny, ever the pragmatist,
dismisses naysayers. If Spacecraft succeeds, he said, ``we'll put
the profits back into the building, which is good for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeny, who draws a $50,000 salary from the Greenpoint center,
says that he is actively seeking to replicate the project in
another industrial site of similar vintage. But he allows that it
won't be any easier the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I'm astonished we survived,'' he said. ``It
would be a disservice to tell people they can put together a deal
the way we did. I think we managed it because of the unique amalgam
of people we have here. You can't franchise that. But if we can
find the right opportunity, we might try it again.''

HELOISE MOVES FORWARD WITH THE INFORMATION AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 10.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROY BRAGG  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It's a weekday afternoon and the best-known name
in American housekeeping isn't doing any.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Heloise is hunkered down at a computer, answering a
questions from inquiring minds on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This is a day set aside for Heloise's monthly online chat. As
she nibbles on a piece of pizza, there's a question about
carving-knife maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Heloise is quick with the answer _ hand-wash it, sharpen it on a
whetstone, and if it's stored in a countertop knife holder, store
it upside down so the blade won't be dulled by rubbing against the
holder's surface.
</P>
<P>
   If this kind of advice seems insignificant to you, you've
probably got a maid, mom or spouse picking up after you.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are your own domestic, you listen to this woman.
</P>
<P>
   Heloise's hints have made her a global, multimedia entity.
</P>
<P>
   At 47, she is an icon, a part of our collective consciousness.
She is identifiable by a single name, just like Cher and Madonna,
and that name is synonymous with household hints.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more here than just great advice. Heloise has
established herself as a savvy, self-assured executive who knows
her customers and her business better than a lot of captains of
industry claim to know theirs.
</P>
<P>
   These helpful hints don't come off the top of Heloise's head.
</P>
<P>
   She gets up to 3,000 letters, faxes and e-mails a week. Some
have questions, others have hints that end up in the column.
</P>
<P>
   Heloise has a staff of five who work in a specially built suite
of offices in the corner of her home in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   She and her posse thoroughly test each hint in her kitchen. Each
idea is checked with state, federal, public and private consumer
and safety experts to make sure they don't contain a hidden faux
pas, says staff member Angie Dolgener.
</P>
<P>
   She's in your paper, sometimes in two different sections, every
day of the year. She's being beamed to your television set on a
regular basis. She's there every month on the magazine rack. She's
way up there on the bookshelf, too.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen times a year, she appears in person at conventions
around the country. And now she's floating on the bandwidth of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the best part.
</P>
<P>
   Those hints intended to make home drudgery go easier _ vinegar
for stains, coffee grounds for odors, boric acid for roaches? They
all work as promised.
</P>
<P>
   And they've worked for a long, long time. Next month marks the
40th anniversary for the Hints from Heloise column, started by her
mother at the family's kitchen table in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Heloise the mom wrote the column until her death in 1977.
Heloise the daughter has been writing it for 21 years, which means
she's been doing it longer.
</P>
<P>
   Hints from Heloise runs in 500 newspapers in 21 nations, says
Ted Hannah, advertising director for King Feature Syndicate, which
distributes the column.
</P>
<P>
   Her eight books have sold more than 4.5 million copies. She is
the lead columnist in venerable Good Housekeeping magazine.
</P>
<P>
   She makes regular appearances on network and cable televisions
shows, including several pet-oriented hints on the series
``Petsburgh U.S.A,'' which is airing over the winter on the Animal
Planet cable network.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the monthly Internet chat, hosted by HomeArts,
a women's lifestyle Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the knife inquiry and a few questions about spills, the
November online chat eventually strayed into the areas of
Thanksgiving etiquette and manners.
</P>
<P>
   When's the best time to serve dinner? How do you handle seating
arrangements? What do you bring when invited to dinner?
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of questions aren't on Heloise's home turf. But the
chatters looked to her for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bischoff, a Houston Chronicle assistant managing editor
and a Heloise friend, says that's because people treat the
silver-haired columnist as a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   How close?
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like they know her so well that she gets cards and
letters and calls all the time from people (suggesting that she)
dye her hair,'' Bischoff says.
</P>
<P>
   A publicity photo of the original Heloise, which appeared in a
1963 issue of Saturday Evening Post, shows the way she connected
with her audience.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the muted lighting and simulated perfection preached
by Martha Stewart, Heloise has always played to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   In the photo, the columnist is pictured as a figure of domestic
mythology _ six arms, each wielding some implement of homemaking,
such as a frying pan, iron, etc.
</P>
<P>
   King Features _ owned by Hearst Corp., which also owns the
Express-News _ is considering an update of the photo for a January
publicity campaign to mark the column's 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   In it, today's Heloise will be wielding modern American
household necessities _ cellular phone and computer mouse, for
example _ as well as some old standard kitchen items.
</P>
<P>
   This, Heloise explains, shows how American life _ and her job _
have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't 1950,'' she says. ``I'm not Donna Reed. What I do
is for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Any discussion of Heloise has to address the line of succession
and the name.
</P>
<P>
   First, her real name is Ponce Cruse Evans, married to plumbing
contractor David Evans for nearly 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Heloise wasn't even her mom's real name.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``She was Eloise,'' she says of her mom. ``When they went to
King Features, they decided it would work better with an H. They
liked the alliteration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hints From Heloise column began in the suburbs of Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Heloise's mom, married to a U.S. Air Force officer and living in
Hawaii in the late '50s, would gather with other military wives on
a regular basis and trade household ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they did in the '50s,'' she says. ``Men went off
to work and the women stayed home, got together and traded ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mom originally wanted to do a newsletter for her
neighborhood, but then she went to a farewell party for a retiring
general.
</P>
<P>
   She mentioned her ``helpful hints'' idea to the retiree, who
ridiculed the idea: ``You're just a housewife,'' were his damning
words that day.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Heloise says, her mom was pitching the idea to
the editor of the Honolulu Advertiser, who liked it and gave her a
shot in print.
</P>
<P>
   The column took off, expanding to a full-time business with a
research staff. Daughter Heloise was taken under her wing and
slowly learned the ropes, working during summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   She studied math and business at Southwest Texas State
University and planned to teach after graduation, but when her
mother's health began slipping, she got back into the business.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the younger Heloise took over the column, the family
business was at a crucial point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mother was very smart to put her into it,'' says King
Features' Hannah. ``She introduced her in the column as Heloise II.
When Ponce took over, there was absolutely no loss of clients.
There was a smooth transition because readers had been introduced
to her. The column had a family feel to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The late 1970s were the dawn of the Information Age. Computers
were on the horizon and cable television had just come to town in
much of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did she have to take over the column, she had to
think about how she would market the column,'' Hannah says.
</P>
<P>
   The original Heloise, despite her incredible popularity, didn't
like doing television. Sure, she'd color her hair to match a dress,
but personal appearances weren't her strong suit, say Hannah and
the younger Heloise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, that wasn't all that important,'' Hannah said.
``But about the time when Ponce took over, the marketing of the
column became important. Ponce had to restyle herself. She had to
do radio, television, newspaper interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Heloise, who refuses to plug products, turned down a lucrative
offer from Hollywood producers seven years ago to do a situation
comedy based on her life, largely because it was fictionalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need it,'' she said. ``It was very tempting, but it
wasn't me.''
</P>
<P>
   Heloise doesn't need fame. She's got that, and she got it
staying close to home. She doesn't want to monkey with the formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I do,'' she says. ``I plan on doing this the rest
of my life.''

<P>
   South Korea is reviving, Thailand isn't far behind, Europe may
be less sexy than it looks and Latin America is a minefield. As for
Russia, it is an investor's version of where you go after losing at
Mortal Kombat: a long, hard fall into a pit full of spikes.
</P>
<P>
   These are the themes that emerge from a sampling of some
top-performing international fund managers _ leaders both for the
fourth quarter of 1998 and longer term. Burned by bad bets the last
two years in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America, they are
treading carefully through the global economic uncertainties
looming this year, with few taking big gambles.
</P>
<P>
   Within the countries they deem less risky, the professionals see
some undervalued stocks, but they are concentrating mainly on
relatively strong, established businesses that appear to be in the
best positions to weather unforeseen storms.
</P>
<P>
   Finding relative safety in emerging markets is the bigger
challenge. ``There's some value to be found in the wreckage, but
it's worrisome,'' said Lilia Clemente, the chairwoman and chief
executive of Clemente Capital, a New York investment firm. She
manages Citizens Global Equity fund and other international funds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Clemente said she had seen some improvement in
Asia, ``we have just stayed away from the volatility in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be overweighted in Latin America, and now we're
not,'' she said. ``All the uncertainty remains high.''
</P>
<P>
   Many managers see the best prospects in three particular
markets:
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH KOREA
</P>
<P>
   If there is any consensus area of perceived opportunity overseas
this year, it is here. A year after it verged on default, South
Korea has reduced indebtedness, upgraded its credit rating,
stabilized its currency, reduced interest rates and begun the steps
deemed necessary by the International Monetary Fund to restore
economic vitality. The government started restructuring the
unwieldy conglomerates, known as chaebols, considered largely
responsible for the country's economic problems. Many of the
businesses emerging from that streamlining are basically sound, and
their stocks trade at big discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago everyone assumed South Korea's restructuring
would fail, and now it's starting to dawn on everyone that it might
work,'' said Mark Headley, a co-manager of the Matthews Korea and
Matthews Pacific Tiger funds, which both ranked among the top
international stock funds in the final quarter of 1998, largely
because of a resurgence in South Korean stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Headley said he especially likes Samsung Electronics, a leading
maker and exporter of televisions, computers, memory chips and
telecommunications equipment that has benefited from the overhaul
of the chaebols. It is attractive, he said, because the electronics
business has been separated from a financially distressed sibling,
Samsung Automotive, which is no longer a drag on the stock. Its
price climbed from less than 32,600 won in September to 79,000 at
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samsung is the obvious big blue chip, but you start realizing
there are a lot of situations like that,'' Headley said.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Hana Bank, a survivor in a drastic winnowing of
South Korean banks. Hana's stock, which finished 1998 at 13,300
won, more than doubled since early November. Even so, it still
trades at less than 12 times 1999 estimated earnings, about half
the ratio of many large U.S. commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   Headley said he began accruing Samsung shares a number of years
ago, when they traded at roughly 100,000 won, and Hana shares in
late 1997, when they cost about 5,000. Although he declined to
specify where he thinks either stock is going this year, Headley
said, ``I think the Korean market in general has the potential to
double again.''
</P>
<P>
   THAILAND
</P>
<P>
   The first of the Asian economies to plunge into crisis in 1997
when its currency, the baht, tumbled in value, Thailand is also
among the first to show promise of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clemente, who recently returned from a three-week trip to
Asia, said she was impressed that the ``economic outlook for
Thailand is slowly improving, the baht has strengthened, and the
real economy is showing signs of bottoming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clemente said she liked three Thai stocks that stood to
benefit from an economic revival: BEC World, a leading
entertainment conglomerate that has a government concession for one
of the country's four television channels; Bangkok Bank, the most
dominant of the three big Thai banks, and Siam Cement, a leading
maker of construction materials, auto accessories and
petrochemicals. BEC and Bangkok Bank shares performed poorly in
1998, but shares of Siam, which as a construction company is
considered a leading economic indicator, more than doubled in the
last quarter, to 560 baht. Ms. Clemente said the stock could reach
1,000 baht in the next 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   She said shares of BEC, which closed the year at 200 baht, could
rise to 360, and that Bangkok Bank, which finished 1998 at 52 baht,
could reach 100.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   Invigorated by optimism over its new single currency, the euro,
Europe still appears to hold much promise. But some global fund
managers are restrained in their opinions, partly because the
economic effects of monetary union are not yet clear. There is also
continuing uncertainty over the Russian economy _ and how any
further deterioration could affect Germany, an important Russian
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, some fund managers are looking mainly at big
European-based multinational businesses that can do well whether or
not Europe prospers. Steve Silverman, portfolio manager of the
Merrill Lynch Global Value C fund, said he favored a couple of big
European companies: Cadbury Schweppes of Britain and Nestle of
Switzerland. Although both are essentially in the food business,
Silverman said, Cadbury's strength is its Dr Pepper brand, one of
the world's fastest-growing soft drinks, while Nestle's is its
successful diversification away from its historical mainstay,
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   His fund has been buying both stocks in the last few years, and
they have appreciated sharply. Cadbury rose nearly 70 percent last
year and Nestle rose nearly 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I expect them to appreciate at the same rate? No,''
Silverman said. While he declined to speculate on their possible
appreciation this year, he said, ``what I'm looking for in the
stuff we buy is that we'd like to feel comfortable that over an
extended period, it will grow 15 percent a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Other managers are more exposed to the European economies,
betting that long-term benefits of the euro will make the current
prices of some stocks look cheap in a few years, particularly those
of the large and technologically advanced companies that will find
it more efficient to do European business in one currency instead
of 11.

PREVIEWING THE STATES OF BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Jan. 10)  
(JT) 
 By BOB MORRIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Thursday, the temperature had dropped to a
sub-freezing chill, but at Life, the nightclub on Bleecker Street
in Greenwich Village, things were heating up. Donald J. Trump was
expected at any moment for a promotional party for the Miss U.S.A.
Pageant, which will be broadcast live next month on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of his arrival, the contestants were all
aflutter. Or maybe they were just cold. Near the door, Miss New
York and Miss Connecticut stood around in skimpy skirts and tops
absolutely unsuitable for winter. But since they had been
instructed not to wear stockings with their BCBG designer outfits,
they stoically exposed their toes and legs (midriffs and shoulders,
too) to blasts of frigid air. The only thing that kept them warm
was the idea of a moment with Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cold, but at least it's not Buffalo,'' said Miss New
York, Kimberly Ann Pressler, a data entry specialist with glitter
in her hair, who will attend college in Buffalo this fall.
</P>
<P>
   So what did they know about Trump anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes lots of money,'' Miss Pressler said. ``And his
upstate casino helps our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He owns a lot of things,'' said Miss Connecticut, Christina
D'Amico, a sales representative, who plans to pursue an MBA degree
after college, ``including some property in Bridgeport.''
</P>
<P>
   Would they consider dating him?
</P>
<P>
   With beauty queen diplomacy, they both said that he was
wonderful, but perhaps not their type.
</P>
<P>
   `I want to marry for love, not money,'' Miss D'Amico said.
</P>
<P>
   When Trump finally arrived, he dispensed two kisses to Shawnae
Jebbia, Miss U.S.A. 1998, who, with the eager tone of a child
reporting good news to father, told him about a new job she had
just nailed as a television host. ``I'm going to become a TV
personality,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After congratulating her, he moved on to peddle his pageant to
reporters. ``What I do is successful because of the esthetics,''
said Trump, who owns part of the Miss Universe Organization
(producer of Miss USA) and is planning to start a modeling agency.
``People love my buildings and my pageants.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, the self-appointed arbiter of all things beautiful
arrived to whoops and cheers. He was swamped by young women.
``Looking good,'' he said. One woman, who called him ``Donald,''
asked for a kiss. He obliged, then asked, ``Do I know you?'' It
turned out he did.
</P>
<P>
   As he posed and mingled, Trump conjured a connection, however
tenuous, to his contestants. Miss New Jersey, for example, has
parents who go to his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. ``That's
what I love to hear,'' Trump said. He told Miss North Carolina that
he plays golf in Pinehurst, and Miss Colorado that he recently got
back from Aspen. ``I own property there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One place where he has not staked a claim yet is Rhode Island.
He regretted that. ``Look how beautiful Miss Rhode Island is,'' he
said before pressing more flesh _ hands, arms and an occasional
bare shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all so beautiful,'' he said. Then, he was out the door,
leaving his fans to their own resources. To that end, Joy Hall,
Miss North Carolina, was seen giving her phone number to Mitch
Marrow, a defensive end for the Carolina Panthers, who had promised
her seats to a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They better be good seats,'' Miss Hall said to a friend, after
he had moved on. ``If you give your phone number to someone, you
should at least end up on the 50-yard line.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump is not the only one to understand the art of the deal.

SENATE UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTS TRIAL RULES BUT PUTS OFF WITNESS ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate, responding to a ringing appeal by Sen.
Robert Byrd for bipartisanship, unanimously adopted compromise
rules for President Clinton's impeachment trial Friday but
postponed the explosive question of calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Senators emerging from the private meeting of all senators in
the museum-like Old Senate Chamber gave credit to Byrd for setting
the tone for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most moving talk I've heard about preserving the
integrity of the institution,'' said Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
R-Colo., referring to the 45-minute address by Byrd, 71, a Democrat
from West Virginia and a self-educated constitutional scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Extra chairs had to be brought into the antiquated chamber to
accommodate all 100 senators. The chamber, initially used in 1810,
was last used for formal Senate deliberations in 1859, when there
were only 33 states in the Union.
</P>
<P>
   Security officers stood outside the chamber doors to insure
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the atmosphere
during the 150-minute session was ``absolutely phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so positive you could feel history in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., a former Democratic party
chairman, said the ``spirits of compromise were at work'' in the
compact chamber where lawmakers from another century struck the
Missouri Compromise of 1820 that permitted the matching admission
to the union of free states and slave states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allowed the spirit of the Websters, Calhoun's and Clays to
infect us a bit,'' said Dodd, whose father served in the Senate in
the 1960s. ``It was divine inspiration that occurred in that
chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., said
senators embraced cooperation at the last moment after days of
public and private wrangling over procedures for the first
impeachment trial of a president since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the final moments, there appeared to be a coming
together of ideas,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   According to participants, Byrd won the attention of his
colleagues by telling a parable known the Pardoner's tale, from
Geoffrey Chaucer, the author of the ``Canterbury Tales,'' who died
in 1400.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd recalled that three partners walking through the forest had
come upon a pot of gold. The partners split the treasure three
ways. But as each became greedy for the remainder, he plotted the
murder of his rivals until all three partners were slain.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd warned his colleagues not to follow suit in their jockeying
over procedures for trying the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., sworn in for his first Senate term just
days ago, called the speech by Byrd, a 40-year veteran, ``clearly
the highlight'' of the bipartisan meeting. Byrd received a standing
ovation, Bayh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed as if the institution walked up to the precipice,
looked over the edge and into the abyss and decided not to take
that road,'' Bayh said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate later convened in open session in its modern chamber
and voted 100 to 0 to adopt compromise trial procedures. The
compromise responded to GOP insistence that, in principle,
witnesses would be permitted to testify, if needed. But the deal
also addressed Democrats' demands that the trial be conducted on
the basis of the public record to date, without fresh testimony
from surprise witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   White House special counsel Gregory Craig, brought in to
quarterback Clinton's impeachment defense, later predicted that
senators ``will conclude that the articles (of impeachment) do not
justify or warrant conviction or removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted last month to impeach Clinton for alleged
perjury and obstruction of justice in the cover-up of his sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable adopted by the Senate Friday set the stage for a
dramatic State of the Union address by Clinton to a joint meeting
of the House and Senate on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   As senators worked out compromise trial procedures, Clinton
traveled to Detroit to celebrate the milestone of the nation
completing 93 strait months of economic growth _ ``the longest
peacetime expansion in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the Detroit Economic Club that ``most things are
going right for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after touring the North American International Auto Show
and watching a demonstration of fuel technologies for the future,
Clinton declared: ``I feel good about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, House prosecutors and presidential
lawyers have until 5 p.m. EST Monday to file pretrial motions. The
Senate will consider the motions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors will begin presenting their case against
Clinton on Thursday over a three-day period. Clinton's defense team
then counters with three days of rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, divided with 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats, would
need to muster 67 votes to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Senators will then have two days to submit questions to House
prosecutors and White House lawyers through presiding Chief Justice
William Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the trial theoretically could end. Senators would
be free to make motions to adjourn the trial, propose censure or
call witnesses after the opening phase.
</P>
<P>
   But under the compromise adopted Friday, senators can't call any
witnesses before Jan. 26. A panel of four senators will conduct
ongoing negotiations to resolve the question of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he expects the bipartisan bonhomie
to ebb when senators face a decision over witnesses. ``Look out,''
said Harkin.
</P>
<P>
   Bayh concurred. ``The fundamentally important votes are yet to
come,'' said Bayh, whose father served in the Senate in the 1960s
and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in an effort to forestall the calling of
witnesses, agreed Thursday to accept 7,000 pages of testimony given
the Senate by the House and special prosecutor Kenneth Starr as the
basis for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers are urging the Senate to hear testimony from
Lewinsky, presidential secretary Betty Currie and Clinton
confidante and Washington superlawyer Vernon Jordan. House
prosecutors met on Friday to weigh whether to add to their witness
list Kathleen Willey, the former White House volunteer who alleges
that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead
House prosecutor, reiterated House insistence that witnesses be
permitted, saying: ``Witnesses are necessary during a trial so that
evidence may be thoroughly weighed and tested before a
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a result of Friday's compromise the House prosecutors
must now wait until after the opening phase of the trial to learn
whether senators will permit witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed compromise was struck by an improbable pair of
senators, both of whom have run for president _ conservative
Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, and Democratic Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts.

NBA PICKED A GOOD TIME TO HAVE LABOR PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As any smart politician knows, the best time to pass an unsavory
piece of legislation is at the beginning of a term in office; come
re-election, voters are apt to have forgotten what they'd been
forced to swallow a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   One smart politician, David Stern, no doubt took this into
account in his negotiations with the NBA players union.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's seeming willingness to scuttle the season made him and
his league about as popular with basketball fans as a pol pushing a
tax hike.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of his mind, though, Stern had to be aware that it
would be a few years before the most important test of the NBA's
popularity was administered. By then, he must hope, all will be
forgotten, if not entirely forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The test we speak of will come in the form of the league's next
television contract negotiations. Those won't take place until some
time near the end of the current broadcast contract that runs
through the 2001-2002 season. By then, we'll be talking about
serious money, maybe a billion dollars or more per season in rights
fees for the league.
</P>
<P>
   If, that is, the NBA can recover all the good will that leaked
out during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's well-calculated strategy to press the union all the way
to a season-cancellation deadline was a gamble, indeed. But it was
the right time to take such a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Had a lockout occurred in the final year of a network TV
contract, the league might not have had enough time to win back
fans _ and viewers. That would have driven down the value of that
next TV deal.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson Major League Baseball learned the hard way. In
1993, the year before the players' strike, baseball clubs earned an
average of $336 million a year in network TV money, sports media
analysts say. Last year, they earned $345 million, a net decline
factoring in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In the same time, NFL rights fees increased from an average of
$925 million annually to $2.3 billion. The NBA's rights fees jumped
from $219 million to $660 million per year. Even the NHL's
broadcast rights increased from $14 million to $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball has still not recovered in national TV
rights fees,'' observed David Marin, a sports business analyst at
Paul Kagan Associates, a sports and media research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The renegotiated contract coming out of the \Rbaseball\S
strike was lower than going into the strike, in stark contrast to
the NBA, the NFL and the NHL, all of whose rights fees soared.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin figures that baseball frittered away a total of about $2
billion in rights fees when it negotiated its post-strike contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The escalation of national rights fees is a phenomenon that
baseball missed,'' Kagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was not about to let that happen to his league, especially
with the NBA's popularity on TV soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Smart guy, that David Stern.

BROKAW DRAWS RAVES FOR HIS HEARTFELT NOD TO A GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw is getting lots of fan mail these days, and it has
nothing to do with his anchorman gig on the ``NBC Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very gratifying,'' he said this week as he prepared for a
West Coast swing to promote a book that hardly needs more
tub-thumping. Brokaw already is atop The New York Times'
best-seller list, and anyone who watches even a tiny amount of TV
has probably seen him on a talk show _ talking excitedly about
``The Greatest Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he's got a publisher to please. But it's a subject
Brokaw doesn't seem to tire of, even when discussing it for the
umpteenth time. And now, as America embraces this paean to a
generation that emerged from an economic depression only to face a
world war, he hopes his first book might be a catalyst, an agent
for ``creating a dialogue between generations'' that could lead to
a sort of bonding over common ground.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't happen, Brokaw still is happy to have told the
stories of dozens of American heroes, some of whom did
extraordinary things on the battlefield and have the medals to
prove it, but most of whom did not what their country expected of
them but simply what they expected of themselves when the chips
were down.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw writes: ``This generation helped save the world from
fascism, returned home to marry and go to college in record
numbers, rebuild their former enemies, stand fast against
communism, give us great art, science, the interstate highway
system, Medicare, and the greatest economy the world has ever
known.''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point in an age when it's almost easier to play the
victim than to exercise personal responsibility, he adds: ``They
never whined or whimpered. I am in awe of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It shows. Though he is no spellbinder, Brokaw writes clearly and
with abiding reverence about the people who agreed to share their
``war stories'' with him _ men like Thomas Broderick, an American
paratrooper who was shot through the head during the World War II
Battle of Arnhem. Broderick survived; his eyesight didn't.
Embittered at first, he eventually accepted his blindness, married,
had seven kids and founded a successful business.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem few could match Broderick's story for sheer
courage and determination, but Brokaw's book is brimming with such
tales of personal heroism, whether it was overcoming serious
injury, watching a brother die on a bloody beach, or taking care of
business on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   It is these people who are now writing ``wonderful, handwritten
letters'' to Brokaw, appreciative of being appreciated for things
they did a half-century ago. It's hard to get through most chapters
of the book without wiping away a tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``These truly are people who never expected that other people
would take notice,'' said Brokaw, who, at 58 is old enough to
remember the final days of World War II. ``They simply lived by the
rules established early in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a code of honor that made no distinction as to class, sex
or race, even if society didn't always return the favor. As George
Bush, former president and naval aviator, points out in the book,
service in the war was more honor than duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we owed?'' Bush asks. ``Nothing. Not one damn
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It might sound suspect coming from a career politician, but one
gets the impression that each person Brokaw interviewed would utter
the same words. Indeed, a lesser-known Bush _ Bob Bush of Raymond,
Wash. _ is a genuine war hero who promised his mother that he would
enter the service to help people, not to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was an 18-year-old Navy medic on Okinawa when circumstances
forced him to hold off a band of attacking Japanese soldiers as he
administered plasma to a wounded Marine. He was hit several times,
lost an eye, and won the Congressional Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Would today's American teenager do the same? Brokaw says he's
optimistic, and several members of ``The Greatest Generation'' also
suspect today's young people would rally to a just cause. We might
never have to find out, which could very well be the greatest
legacy of the greatest generation.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In our brave new world of investing, assets are out
and ether is everything. Tangibles like a rising book value at a
company or even significant growth in corporate earnings are no
longer required by investors who are looking to justify their stock
purchases. Rising share prices are what counts.
</P>
<P>
   So, while investors' ardor for Internet and other technology
companies drives those stocks to the heavens, many companies with
hard assets underlying them _ oil and gas concerns, for example _
have been left for dead. That many are trading at extreme discounts
to their assets matters not to investors dazzled by ether stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shun oil shares today because of the depressed state
of crude-oil prices. A barrel of West Texas intermediate fetched
about $13 on Friday, down from almost $17 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in just three weeks, oil prices have jumped 26 percent from
their 12-year lows of $10.35 a barrel. As a result, some investors
think the outlook for oil _ and some oil-related equities _ may be
brightening.
</P>
<P>
   The price of oil has fallen because there's just too much of it.
Demand for oil grew 1 percent to 2 percent worldwide last year, but
production remained high.
</P>
<P>
   The oversupply shows signs of lessening a bit, however. Last
week, oil prices jumped on news of the biggest decline in United
States oil inventories in 18 years. More important, capital
spending by oil companies is plummeting. Michael Spohn, principal
at Petroleum Research Group in New York, says such investment will
fall 10 percent to 20 percent from 1998 levels at American
companies this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they are cutting capital expenditures now, productive
capacity will be below expectations in the future,'' Spohn said.
``But there is a lag between spending and production, so you don't
see it in the numbers right away.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that supply is shrinking, some investors think
the demand for oil may increase this year in parts of the world. If
rebounding stock markets in parts of Asia are indicating a
turnaround there, demand from that region may increase. Asia
accounts for roughly one-quarter of the world's oil demand.
</P>
<P>
   One sign that oil stocks' fortunes may be rising is that the
shares no longer fall on bad news. On Thursday, Smith
International, a large oil-services company, warned investors that
its fourth-quarter earnings would likely be between 25 cents and 27
cents a share, not the 36 cents a share that Wall Street had hoped
for. The shares rose $3.65.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all oil-related shares are buys. Some of the
biggest companies are not cheap, according to Spohn, and some of
the smallest, with heavy debt loads, could find themselves on the
ropes if oil prices stay low.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the best values in the oil patch, Spohn said, are ARCO,
Kerr-McGee and Unocal. ARCO is trading at a 22 percent discount to
its asset value, as he reckons it, and the shares pay a 4.3 percent
dividend. Kerr-McGee, out of favor among investors because of its
announced merger with Oryx Energy, trades at a 41 percent discount
and pays a 4.6 percent dividend.
</P>
<P>
   And Unocal, which closed on Friday at $32.75, has a value of $42
a share, Spohn said; he considers Unocal a takeover candidate to
boot. &QL;

INS DEPORTS RECORD NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A record 171,154 undocumented immigrants were
deported by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in fiscal
year 1998, and Commissioner Doris Meissner said Wednesday the
agency has ``much more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The number deported in fiscal year 1998, which ended Sept. 30,
represents a 50 percent increase over the 114,386 removed in fiscal
1997, according to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removals play a crucial role in our effort to restore
credibility to our nation's immigration laws,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the progress we've made in removals, but in
the interior and at our borders, we have much more to do,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration, was not as enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the INS continues to increase the number of
deportations, but let's put the numbers in perspective: The INS
reports that 400,000 permanent illegal aliens arrive each year, and
there are more than 5 million already living in the United
States,'' said Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Smith said, the record increase was ``further
proof'' that the 1996 immigration reform law ``has untied
immigration agents' hands to promptly return illegal aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the new law ``is securing America's borders, reducing
crime, protecting jobs and saving taxpayers billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS, though, has reported an increase in deportations each
of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Deportation figures for fiscal 1998 do not include the estimated
1.5 million apprehensions and voluntary returns reported at border
ports-of-entry.
</P>
<P>
   Deportation of undocumented immigrants who served sentences for
felony convictions totalled 56,011, a 9 percent increase over the
51,272 deported in fiscal 1997, the INS said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the fiscal 1998 criminals deported, 47 percent were convicted
on narcotics charges, 15 percent violated immigration laws, 5
percent were convicted of burglary, 5 percent were convicted of
assault and 4 percent were convicted of sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the INS deported an average 1,077 undocumented
immigrants convicted of felonies each week in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in non-criminal deportations came from expedited
removals ordered by immigration judges. Expedited deportations
totalled 76,113, and most came in Southwest border states.
</P>
<P>
   The three Southwest border districts with the largest number of
expedited deportations were: San Diego, 40,894; El Paso, 11,129;
and San Antonio, 6,778.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican nationals accounted for 81 percent of the total number
of undocumented immigrants deported in fiscal year 1998, or
138,249.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican nationals accounted for 78 percent, or 43,451, of the
criminal deportations.
</P>
<P>
   Nationals from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras each
represented 3 percent of the total number of deportations.

`SHAKEN' SADDAM EXECUTING ARMY OFFICERS, U.S. SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, ``shaken'' by
massive U.S. and British bombing of his military last month, has
executed army officers who might have disobeyed him, the chief U.S.
military officer for the region said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The allied campaign leveled much of Saddam's military
establishment and killed between 600 and 2,000 soldiers in the
dictator's elite Republican Guard, including senior officers, said
Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, who leads the U.S. Central
Command.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni also said the executions indicate a weakening of Saddam's
hold on his military, but the general added that he did not know
whether a coup was imminent. Citing intelligence reports, Zinni
said Saddam purged officers, including a commander in southern
Iraq, following the four-day U.S.-British assault code-named
Operation Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was shaken and the regime was shaken,'' Zinni said of
Saddam. ``It looks like he may have been behind some of these
executions, and there might be still some going on in military
ranks and civilians also.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
that the Iraqi dictator ``lost a lot'' in Desert Fox because many
Republican Guard senior officers are ``no longer available to him
to advise or to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam claims the U.S. and British bombs hit mostly civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Desert Fox, a now ``desperate'' Saddam has
become more dangerous, challenging U.S. pilots in the no-fly zones
over northern and southern Iraq and urging Arabs to overthrow
governments that do not support him, Zinni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's capable of not only doing things irrational, but of
miscalculating,'' Zinni said. ``We have tried to look at every
possibility, any event, every eventuality as to what he might do
militarily in reaction to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Saddam opts for more serious military action, he might
find his soldiers unwilling to fight for him, Zinni contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's some confusion in the ranks and there's some
disgruntlement with ... who they answer to,'' the general added.
``I can't ... give you a feel for how serious this is, how
extensive it is, but we are certainly seeing these kinds of signs
that there are problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two weeks, U.S. jets have fired missiles at
Iraq's military on four separate occasions after Iraqi radar zeroed
in on the planes while they were on routine patrol in the no-fly
zones, the Pentagon reported. No U.S. planes were hit during these
clashes, which Saddam might have initiated in an attempt to capture
an American pilot, Zinni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clearly he's trying to lure us into a possible
shoot-down situation,'' the general added. ``Our pilots are smart
enough not to fall for traps or get themselves in some sort of
maneuver or position where they're vulnerable or follow a plane
into a missile engagement zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinni also characterized as a failure Saddam's televised speech
Jan. 5 in which he called for the overthrow of Arab governments.
Despite the vitriol, popular uprisings in these countries have not
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language he used, his attack on all the other leaders in
the region, I think showed a degree of desperation that we hadn't
seen before,'' Zinni said. ``To us, that speech was shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military will continue to look for signs of Saddam's
weakening hold on power, including indications of ``disloyalty or
breaking ranks'' in Iraq's regular army, the sudden disappearance
of key Iraqi leaders and acts of sabotage against the dictator,
Zinni said.
</P>
<P>
   The general also updated U.S. damage estimates from Desert Fox,
saying it will take Saddam two years _ instead of merely one as
first thought _ to repair the military installations U.S. and
British bombs destroyed during the assault Dec. 16-19. Zinni said
the revised estimate was based in part on intelligence reports that
bombed buildings initially reported as empty contained equipment
necessary for Saddam's missile development program.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni said he had ``no knowledge'' of whether the U.S. military
chose what sites to bomb based on intelligence gathered from United
Nations weapons inspectors in Iraq. The United Nations is
investigating whether the inspectors illegally spied on Saddam for
the United States while they were examining whether he was building
outlawed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The no-fly zones extend south from the 33rd parallel, just below
Iraq's capital city of Baghdad, and north from the 36th parallel.
The zones, which the U.S. and British military have enforced as a
condition of Iraq's surrender in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, are
designed to prevent Iraqi aircraft from attacking Kurds in the
north and Shi'ite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam refuses to recognize the no-fly zones, regarding them as
an illegal encroachment on Iraq's sovereignty. &QL;

FINDING ENLIGHTENMENT IN A BOTTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 10)  
(DW) 
 By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week I bathed in purple water (``I Trust''
bubble bath, made by Philosophy), and powdered up with pink powder
(Rebirth, by 5S, ``to renew the spirit and recharge the soul'').
</P>
<P>
   My moisturizer was Bliss (Chakra VII by Aveda, for ``the joyful
enlightenment and soaring of the spirit''); my nail polish,
Spiritual (by Tony and Tina, ``to aid connection with the higher
self''). My teeth were clean, my heart was open _ although my
bathroom was so crowded with bottles and brochures, the latest
tools and totems from the human potential movement, that I could
hardly find my third eye (perhaps I should have purchased a bindi,
$15 from Jade on Elizabeth Street, to help me do so).
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for enlightenment in all the wrong places,
cosmetics companies are suddenly eager to help. Because today, in
``Darwin's empty heaven,'' as the writer Chip Brown puts it in his
new book, ``Afterwards, You're a Genius: Faith, Medicine and the
Metaphysics of Healing'' (Riverhead Books), feeling good is the new
religion. Cosmetics companies are the newest of the new prophets,
turning the old notion of hope in a jar on its head. ``Oh Lord,''
Brown groaned in protest. ``They're just vendors, shouting in a
different way.''
</P>
<P>
   What marvelous shouting! ``Cosmetics are our satellite to the
divine!'' This is what you'll hear from Tony and Tina, for example.
Tony and Tina (Anthony Gillis and Cristina Bornstein) are nice
young artists. He's from London, she grew up in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Chakra nail polish, which they invented for an installation at
the Gershwin Gallery in Manhattan two years ago, was intended as an
ironic commentary on the beauty business. But then a friend
suggested they get into the beauty business, and now Tony and Tiny
have a $2 million cosmetics company with a mission statement ``to
aid in the evolution of human consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Their products include nail polishes (Vibrational Remedies) in
colors meant to do nice things to your chakras, as well as body
glitter and hair mascara, lipstick and eyeshadow. You can buy them
at Fred Segal, Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's, where last month they
outsold Hard Candy and Urban Decay.
</P>
<P>
   At Rialto in NoLIta the other day, Tony cupped his hands over
his spinach and Gorgonzola ravioli _ Tina said he likes to greet
his food before he eats it _ and said, ``We think color therapy is
going to be the new medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainbows are proliferating as rapidly in the New Age as angels
once did. Philosophy, a three-year-old Arizona company, makes a
sort of head/ &QL; 
heart kit _ ``a self-help program,'' the company insists _ called
the Rainbow Connection, $45 for seven bottles of colored bubble
bath in a neat metal box. ``Choose your colored bath according to
the area of your emotional life that needs attention, i.e.
self-love, self-worth,'' reads the brochure. Like Tony and Tina's
nail paints, the colors work on those pesky chakras.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role as I see it,'' said Christina Carlino, Philosophy's
founder, ``is to help you stay on your destiny path. It's not about
what you look like. Beauty is defined by your deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are beauty products that are not intended to make you look
better, but to make you act better, feel better and be a better
person. The product claims eclipse even the most grandiose in the
history of the notoriously grandiose beauty business. Think of it
as trend seepage: the so-called New Age _ the loose and goofy
assemblage of Eastern mysticism, psychic phenomena, astral
projection and so on that has waxed and waned for the last three
decades _ has again gained such luster that companies are slapping
the word ``chakra'' on a bottle of nail polish. Words like ``energy
system'' on a jar of face cream throb with iconic power.
</P>
<P>
   Today you don't need a month's visit to India to find your
higher self; you need only buy this bubble bath, that lipstick,
this night cream. The beauty business' old come-on _ trap your man!
_ has been swept away in favor of a new pitch. I don't have
wrinkles anymore. I've got a chakra blockage.
</P>
<P>
   5S, a new sprout of the Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido,
offers a regimen that plays, the company says, on the ``fundamental
and mythical significance of 5'' (the Five Pillars of Islam, the
Five Classics of Confucianism, and so on), and which is organized
into emotional rather than physical categories.
</P>
<P>
   At the 5S store in SoHo, which is designed with white
incandescent light, glass shelves and bottles that glow with color
_ you don't buy things for dry skin, you buy things that are
``energizing'' or ``nurturing'' or ``adoring.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also believes in color therapy. Hence, Rebirth, a
group of products tinted ``nouveau pink'' (the color of bubble
gum). A customer can achieve rebirth with 5S pink soap, pink powder
and pink toner. Into the baptismal river with you and your pink
soap!
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these things are born to some degree out of looking for
what's next,'' said Anne Gottlieb, a cosmetics industry consultant.
``Spirituality or whatever you call it is certainly going to come
after makeup lines for color, and fruits and flowers for
toiletries. I think everything is headed this way. Of course, who
knew about chakras before Aveda?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the plant-based, eco-friendly cosmetics company Aveda
trademarked Chakras I through VII to use as titles for moisturizers
and scents. Chakra products were perhaps a little ahead of their
time back then; the purchase of Aveda nine months ago by the Estee
Lauder Companies, the General Motors of the cosmetics world,
suggests that the pendulum of history has finally caught up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make Aveda more Aveda,'' said Jeanette Wagner,
the vice chairman of Estee Lauder. ``Aveda isn't a marketing idea.
It is a passionately held belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wagner said Estee Lauder intends to extend the Aveda concept
through ``life style'' stores built with sustainable woods and
nontoxic elements, selling ``beauty, health, life style, you name
it.'' Watch for 40 of them opening this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view,'' Ms. Wagner said, ``the appeal is
first the spirituality, and then the products. I'm passionate on
the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that statements like this one depressed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so rankly commercial, I don't see how it could possibly
have any spiritual benefit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Aveda's Chakra VII moisturizer, for instance, smells
quite lovely, kind of fizzy and clove-y, like Old Spice or root
beer. Since the folks at Aveda were smart enough to trademark what
they saw as the end result of Chakra VII moisturizer as well as the
chakra itself, you will be able to buy Bliss (from Lauder) forever.

NASA TO END CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICE BETWEEN HOUSTON, MOSCOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ NASA will end a year-old, charter flight service
between Houston and Moscow for its international space station
workers after the agency's inspector general and a Senate oversight
committee declared it too costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where we tried to make things more
efficient, and in the end it simply didn't yield the cost benefits
we anticipated,'' Peggy Wilhide, a spokeswoman for NASA
administrator Dan Goldin, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An audit completed by NASA's office of inspector general this
week uncovered a range of problems with the charter:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use of the charter through September 1998, its first nine
months of operation, cost NASA's already financially-strapped space
station program $3 million more than if it had relied on
traditional commercial airline service.
</P>
<P>
   _ The per seat cost ranged from $2,753 to $19,883 for the two
dozen charter flights during the period, largely because fewer
passengers and less cargo were on the flights than NASA had
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency's own travel regulations limit the use of charters
to a ``one-time'' basis _ when scheduled airline service is not
readily available between the intended destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhide said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
will revert to the use of commercial airline service between the
countries as soon as it can end the charter agreement without
incurring a penalty. ``A couple of more flights'' are likely, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chair of the Senate's Government
Affairs Committee, called on Goldin to end the use of the charter
Thursday, citing the findings of the inspector general's audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA dollars should be devoted to science, not lost to
bureaucratic waste,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the audit, the charter flights were initiated in
January 1998, when NASA contracted with the Pentagon's Air Mobility
Command through the Johnson Space Center, where the agency's
station program is headquartered, in far south Houston. The
military air charter service supplied a Boeing 727 with a
143-passenger capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In order to achieve a savings over traditional commercial
airline service, the space agency estimated it needed an average of
90 passengers for the flights. The flights originated at Ellington
Field in Houston and typically stopped in Huntsville, Ala., home of
NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, and then Washington D.C.,
where the agency is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   During the audit period, passenger loads ranged from nine to
108, but averaged only 44 people, well below NASA's goal, according
to the inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Those eligible for passage included Russian government and
contractor personnel as well as NASA civil servants and U.S.
aerospace contractor personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The charter flights were advantageous because they allowed
workers to conduct meetings during the long flights and to hasten
their passage through customs once they reached their destinations,
something that will not be possible on traditional commercial
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that when NASA's own assessments questioned cost
effectiveness of the arrangement after three and six months of
service, it began to incorporate security and the health and
welfare of its workers into its justifications.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general, however, took exception to those claims
and challenged a practice in which NASA allowed 41 dependents of
U.S. and Russian space agency workers to travel on the charter on a
``space available'' basis during the charter period at a cost equal
to the ``lowest coach fare'' on commercial service. That practice
allowed the dependents to reimburse the federal government an
average of $954.10 for the round trip.
</P>
<P>
   By booking their flights on a scheduled airline and charging the
expense to a credit card, station workers are eligible for $200,000
in flight insurance coverage, a benefit unavailable to them during
the charter travel, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency does not expect that the use of commercial
airlines for travel to Russia will jeopardize station development,
Wilhide said.
</P>
<P>
   The first large components of the orbital outpost were joined in
orbit during December. Construction will continue into 2004.

POPE MEETS COMMUNIST PRIME MINISTER  (JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema, a former Communist, had a
private audience Friday with the pope who helped make ``former
Communist'' a common moniker throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Using a cane, the stooped and frail John Paul II, 78, walked
slowly to the door of his private study in the Vatican to greet
D'Alema and personally ushered him in for a 25-minute conversation.
Seated across a desk from the pope, D'Alema perched stiffly on the
edge of his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, D'Alema said that he went into the meeting ``feeling
extremely tense.'' But he said his tension quickly melted ``thanks
to the Holy Father's extraordinary capacity to engage in direct,
human contact.'' D'Alema, who brought along his wife and two
children, described himself as ``moved.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II has granted a formal audience to almost every
Italian prime minister since he was elected pope 20 years ago, but
the symbolism of his tete-a-tete with Italy's first former
Communist leader held a special resonance. The event was covered
live on state television, with journalists likening it to the
pope's meetings with Mikhail Gorbachev and Fidel Castro. Commenting
on the television images of their first handshake, one television
reporter excitedly described it as ``the falling of the last stone
of the Berlin wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, it was a protocol visit with a historical twist.
D'Alema, who was named prime minister in October, was for many
years a leading member of the Italian Communist Party, the largest
in Western Europe. After the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989,
followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Italian
Communist Party split and D'Alema left to form a non-Marxist
movement, the Democratic Party of the Left.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, the Roman Catholic Church in Italy led a fierce
battle against the Italian Communist Party. In the 1948 elections,
priests warned believers that they would be excommunicated if they
joined the party. The church helped keep the left out of power for
50 years, loosening its strictures to Catholic voters only after
the ruling Christian Democrats collapsed under the weight of
corruption scandals in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the selection of D'Alema as prime minister was
viewed with dismay by many in the church. The Vatican newspaper,
Osservatore Romano, published a scathing editorial against him the
day he was named. But since taking office, D'Alema, a nonbeliever,
has made a point of smoothing relations with the church. Last
month, he told El Pais, the Spanish newspaper, that ``the spiritual
void of countries ruled by Communists was real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope was right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema has spoken in favor of a draft law to increase state
subsidies to private schools in Italy, which are mainly Catholic.
The two men discussed the issue in their meeting, according to the
Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls. The pope has made state
support for private schools one of his pet projects, but it remains
a deeply contested issue within Italy's political left.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Alema succeeds in passing legislation to increase financing
for religious schools, he will have done far more for the church
than previous Christian-Democratic governments. That irony has been
a theme of journalistic commentary in Italy. This week, the news
magazine L'Espresso, dryly noted that, ``over Christmas, D'Alema
has become more Papist than the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of issues that still divide the Italian
government and the Vatican, from abortion to biotechnology. Most
notably, the Vatican is in a fierce diplomatic battle with Italian
law enforcement, disputing a state prosecutor's right to
investigate the archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Michele Giordano.
</P>
<P>
   The police raided the palace of Giordano last summer seeking
evidence that he had ties to an extortion and loan-sharking
operation. The cardinal's brother, Mario Giordano, was arrested on
such charges. The cardinal denied any involvement, and the Vatican
argued that the investigation violated the church's sovereignty as
laid out in the 1984 Concordat. To resolve the impasse, D'Alema's
predecessor, Romano Prodi, reached an agreement with Vatican
officials to set up a commission to examine the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Vatican spokesman, Navarro-Valls, said that the pope
and D'Alema discussed the need for the commission to settle church
sovereignty issues. Later, after D'Alema met with the Vatican
secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Italian government
issued the names of the government officials appointed to the
commission.

EBULLIENT CLINTON SPEAKS TO DETROIT CLUB ABOUT ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related: IMPEACH, IMPEACH-CANING, IMPEACH-ASSESS,
IMPEACH-CAUCUS, IMPEACH-SCENE)  
(JT) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The stock market is in record territory. The economic
expansion just hit its 93rd month, making this the longest
peacetime period of sustained growth in American history.
</P>
<P>
   And if President Clinton needed any more reason to be upbeat
when he stepped before the Economic Club of Detroit Friday, he got
it Friday morning when the Labor Department announced that the
economy had generated a resounding total of 378,000 new jobs in
December, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate moved forward in its impeachment trial, the
confluence of good economic news was just another reminder that
this president remains either the most skillful overseer of the
economy in decades, or the luckiest. If he escapes removal from
office, it will be in no small part because of his high approval
ratings, which are rooted in the nation's long run of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a somewhat cynical view, but the public values leaders on
outcomes, not character,'' said Thomas Gallagher, a political
analyst in Washington for Lehman Brothers. ``That's not to say that
character could never trump outcomes, but with these outcomes the
public doesn't want to change leaders now.''
</P>
<P>
   How much of the credit Clinton deserves is of course a matter of
debate. But he was not shy about claiming some Friday as he spoke
to 1,500 members and guests of the Economic Club of Detroit,
including hundreds of automobile industry executives, union leaders
and most of Michigan's Democratic congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We meet today at a time of an American economic renaissance,''
Clinton declared. He said the current expansion was more impressive
than past ones for several reasons, among them that it had brought
higher real incomes for most Americans and minority-group
unemployment rates that are at the lowest levels since the
government began keeping those statistics in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rising tide that is lifting all boats,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at Cobo Arena, also the site of the North American
International Auto Show, the world's largest new-car exhibit. The
automobile industry is celebrating its second-best sales year ever
and the region's economy is booming. Employers are having trouble
finding workers, particularly for low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, clearly recognizing how important the economy's
performance is to Clinton's survival in office, is making certain
that he is seen presiding over high-profile announcements of the
latest good economic news.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he announced that the federal budget surplus for
1999 would be at least $76 billion, the highest such figure ever in
dollar terms. And Friday, Clinton braved snowy runways in both
Washington and Detroit to spotlight the latest favorable trends.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides insist these are not events stage-managed
solely to divert attention from the impeachment trial. ``The
president obviously understands what's going on in the Senate,''
said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ``It's in the
hands of the Senate. He's focusing on his agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 35-minute address Friday afternoon, Clinton said that the
government still faced challenges in dealing with economic matters,
despite the steady flow of good news. He said that the
administration must still grapple with caring for the elderly and
providing an education to equip the nation's young to compete in
the global high-technology economy. He said that many inner cities
and rural areas have yet to share in the benefits of the nation's
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the huge volume and high speed of
international capital flows posed a threat to the stability of
nations around the world, whose problems could spread to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted that rapid growth posed problems for the
environment that must be met with new investment in
energy-efficient technologies and a reduced dependence on fossil
fuels, which contribute to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting time in which we live, and we should feel
fortunate to be here,'' Clinton said. But he added, ``The
temptation to rest on our laurels and relax because times are good
must be resisted. Good times today can become bad times tomorrow if
you don't stay ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though many of the club's members, who include a number of
auto parts company owners and executives, are Republicans, they
were interested mostly in the economy and said they wanted the
president's impeachment difficulties over as soon as possible.
Heinz Prechter, a big donor to Michigan Republicans and the
chairman and founder of ASC Inc., a manufacturer of car sun roofs,
said that while he was uncertain whether Clinton should be removed
from office, he was sure that the current political furor should be
brought to a quick conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that most of us in leadership positions can
condone what President Clinton has done, but we can't have this
public show go on forever,'' he said. And Prechter praised Friday's
speech. ``I think President Clinton hit all the hot buttons which
are of interest to our industry and our city,'' he said. ``His
speech was outstanding.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of moderate to locally heavy rain will fall along the
Eastern seaboard from northern Florida to southeastern New England
on Saturday as unseasonably moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and
the Atlantic Ocean is lifted by an advancing cold front.
Thunderstorms, some heavy, will erupt along the Southeast seaboard.
An isolated storm or two will approach severe levels, with damaging
straight-line winds posing the main threat for severe weather.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the cold front, precipitation will change to snow
as Arctic air presses eastward. Before the front arrives, a swath
of freezing rain or sleet will be occurring in some of the deep
valleys of New England, where trapped cold air holds steady against
the advance of milder air. Snow will accumulate a few inches in the
mountains from Pennsylvania to New York and the central mountains
of New England. Nearly all of the precipitation that occurs in the
mountains of northern New England will fall as snow.
</P>
<P>
   Snow showers and snow flurries will form near the southern and
eastern shores of the Great Lakes, with moderate snowfalls in a few
areas in the western Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Farther west,
another disturbance from the Canadian province of Alberta will
plunge southeast across the border. Owing to a lack of moisture,
only broken areas of generally light snow will fall over the
northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, snow will continue on the west-facing slopes of the
northern Rockies as a plume of high-altitude Pacific moisture is
forced to rise over the mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Lightning With Snow
</P>
<P>
   Lightning accompanied an area of heavy snow across southern New
Jersey early Friday, offering the first clue that much of the snow
over the Northeast would eventually change to ice or rain.
Lightning with snow implies that a layer of warm, moist air a few
thousand feet above the ground has wedged between cold air near the
ground and cold air higher up. Then, invading warm, moist air rises
to form thundery clouds. A further incursion of warm air results in
falling snowflakes melting into raindrops, which may freeze into
pellets of ice or freeze on impact with cold surface objects.

&HT;        MURTHA SAYS CLINTON STEEL PLAN NOT STRONG ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 -- Rep. John Murtha dismissed the Clinton
administration's new plan for curbing cheap foreign steel imports,
calling it ``not strong or fast enough'' to help save jobs in
Pennsylvania and other steel-producing states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a stop to the subsidized steel coming into
this country,'' said Murtha, who is vice chair of the House Steel
Caucus. ``We need to enforce the trade laws in place, and expedite
the enforcement of those laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Murtha, D-Johnstown, said he was disappointed with the plan that
offers tax breaks for steel companies. He said steel industry
officials would not be satisfied because the administration did not
set quotas on steel imports or force nations to adopt voluntary
limits on their exports.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said the plan did not send a message to countries that
``they cannot subsidize imports without penalty while we accept
financial losses and job losses in our domestic industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report ordered by Congress last term, Clinton outlined the
plan to give $300 million in tax breaks for steel companies that
claim to be losing money because they can't compete with foreign
companies that sell their product cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's budget won't be done until February, and it won't be
approved until months later,'' said Murtha's spokesman Brad
Clemenson. ``The Congressman just doesn't think companies can wait
that long for that kind of relief. And it is not addressing the
problem of the surge of imports.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign steel industry producers sent 3.9 million net tons to
the U.S. in September -- about a 49 percent increase in imports
from the same month last year, according to the American Iron and
Steel Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also promised to name a point-person who will make sure
government benefits are doled out quickly to the thousands of
laid-off steel workers whose companies had to cut back production,
according to the report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the administration will expedite its
investigations and enforcement actions under the country's trade
laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Murtha was not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be anything in the report that provides
the kind of comprehensive and immediate solution we need,'' Murtha
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after being sworn into the new Congress, Murtha said
his immediate priority will be to help the 2,000 or so steel
workers who live in the Johnstown area and commute to work at small
steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really a crisis,'' Murtha said in a recent interview.
``I thought the president seemed to understand the gravity of the
situation and would be impressed enough to take strong action.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel industry officials in Pennsylvania and others states have
charged that foreign steel companies are selling their product so
cheaply that domestic companies can't compete or are having to cut
back in production.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign steel industry officials say they are not to blame.
Instead, they point to an over-supply of domestic steel caused by
the General Motors strike, and other economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to issue a preliminary
decision in mid-February on whether Japan, Russia and Brazil are
engaged in steel ``dumping'' -- selling their product for below
production cost, or below what it sells for in its home market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our American steel worker needs protection from the dumping
that's going on by Japan, Korea, and other countries,'' Murtha
said. ``We need to keep pressing the White House for a more
immediate, workable response in the quickest possible time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new Congress, Murtha said he also hopes to work on
reforming Social Security so that it will not go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the steel crisis, Social Security reform promises to
be a controversial issue in the next session.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha criticized some proposals already on the table for the
government to privately invest a portion of the taxes collected by
workers. The idea of private investments, usually proposed by
conservative lawmakers and economists, is that by linking Social
Security to the profits of the stock market, more money would be
available to be payed out in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letting people invest is too risky,'' Murtha said. ``I don't
know how that could be done to make sure it was safe. If we let
individuals invest, how do we know they would use it for Social
Security?''
</P>
<P>
   Murtha also criticized proposals for raising the retirement age,
saying the plans would not be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in my district count on Social Security
payments as their sole source of income already,'' Murtha said.
``Raising the age won't help them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what he thinks should be done?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know yet,'' Murtha said. ``We have a lot of really
important work to do in this session.''

   Conceptual artist  &UR; Don Celender &LR; , whose solo show at the O.K.
Harris Gallery in New York is his 30th annual, has turned his
attention to museums this year. Celender contacted 300 small and
unusual museums and asked: ``Do you think your museum contributes
to the cultural life of Americans? ... Please say how.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of Baltimore's Dr. Samuel D. Harris National Museum
of Dentistry described it as a ``treasure house dedicated to all
things dental'' and called it ``a safe and friendly environment in
which to meet or seek refuge.'' The owner of the Wonder-View Tower
&AMP; Museum in Genoa, Colo., said he ``could go on and on'' describing
its delights, including the opportunity to ``see six states, 20,000
Indian artifacts, two-headed calves and so on.'' The owner of
Hartung's License Plate and Auto Museum in Glenview, Ill., said his
museum depicts ``the history of license plates from all 50
states,'' and the president of the RV/MH Hall of Fame in Elkhart,
Ind., boasted of visits by ``thousands of consumers and industry
personnel each year.'' Meanwhile, the director of the National
Lighter Museum in Guthrie, Okla., took pains to note, ``I have been
collecting lighters for 58 years and I have never smoked. ... I
have never looked at lighters simply as a means to light a
cigarette, but as man's first invention (a way to make fire).''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Beer Can House in Houston said the house
contributes not only to ``Americans but all people of the world.''
``As a history lesson, the museum could be Beverage Industry 101,''
writes the director of the Beverage Containers Museum in
Millersville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietor of the Mini Cake Museum in Pasadena reminds
Celender that ``cakes touch everyone, before birth and till
death''; in Denton, Texas, a man who calls himself ``the Pecan
Picasso'' and operates the ``world's only Pecan Art Museum'' notes
that he ``uses the medium of pecan art to portray people, animals
and objects (real and/or fictional) relating to Americana past and
present.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Earl's Art Gallery and Store in Vicksburg, Miss.,
demonstrates his patriotism: ``Americans have been striving for
freedom and independence for years, and I believe that by building
this museum it proves my freedom to build what I like and how I
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The curator of the Arnold B. Tofias Industrial Archives in North
Easton, Mass., noted that although his center is ``not for the most
part a place to take out-of-town visitors,'' he's hoping to turn it
into more than ``the `shovel museum,' as it is frequently called.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the American Sanitary Plumbing Museum in
Worcester, Mass., praised plumbers, the ``professional tradesmen
who have carried out their works knowing that the very lives of our
society depend upon their efforts. ... The significance of those
contributions is great. Our efforts to preserve and trace this
history are minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally modest was the executive director of the Water Ski
Museum in Winter Haven, Fla. Do you think your museum contributes
to the cultural life of Americans? she was asked. ``No,'' she
answered.

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE EXPECTS QUICK SENATE VOTE TO DISMISS CASE
 &HT;    730&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's legal team predicted Friday
that the Senate would vote to dismiss the charges against him after
the first phase of the impeachment trial procedure approved Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That procedure _ adopted by all 100 senators of both parties _
calls for presentations by House prosecutors and the White House
defense team and questioning by the senators, followed immediately
by a motion to dismiss the perjury and obstruction of justice
charges outlined in the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House expressed confidence that it would win that
motion to dismiss, which would require the support of a simple
majority, or 51 senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are optimistic, we are confident that the senators, once
they see and hear this defense in this opening phase of the trial,
will conclude that the articles do not justify or warrant
conviction or removal from office,'' said Gregory Craig, special
counsel to the president. ''We remain hopeful that this matter can
be resolved expeditiously and fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate procedure left open the possibility of a
drawn-out trial that could include witnesses and new revelations
about the president _ three possibilities Clinton's lawyers
fervently hope to avoid _ the White House refrained from
criticizing a plan that arrived with the backing of every member of
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate has decided how it wants to proceed. We respect
that,'' Craig said in brief remarks to reporters at the White
House. ''And in accordance with the procedures adopted by the
Senate, we plan to present on behalf of the president a vigorous,
successful and complete defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig predicted that, through the motion to dismiss, the defense
team would head off the prospects for an extended trial, surprise
revelations or witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If the motion to dismiss is defeated, however, the process
agreed to by the Senate on Friday poses grave risks to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial moves into a second phase, senators would hear
presentations as to which witnesses should be called and for what
purpose. They would then vote on whether to depose those witnesses,
or subject them to questioning under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after reviewing the results of any depositions, the
Senate would be asked to vote on whether to call witnesses to
actually testify in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, a Washington attorney who served as chief counsel
for the Democrats during the impeachment hearings last month before
the House Judiciary Committee, praised that portion of the process.
He said it would force anyone who wants to call witnesses to first
demonstrate why they were necessary, and then to show why it was
essential that they appear before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good procedure,'' said Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans holding a 55-45 advantage over Democrats, there
is a risk that Republicans could, by themselves, determine whether
to call witnesses and, if so, which witnesses to call.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you control who will testify and who will not testify, you
control the outcome,'' said Washington attorney James M. Cole, who
was special counsel in the House ethics committee's investigation
of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said the Senate should decide whether to hold its trial
based solely on the evidence contained in the 7,000-page report the
House sent to the Senate to document its articles of impeachment,
or open up the trial to a full evidentiary hearing, with both
prosecutors and defense attorneys having the right to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to have a trial, you have a trial,'' said
Cole. ''You should have the lawyers in charge of determining who
the witnesses should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to deal with that dilemma, the Senate
decided to name two Democrats and two Republicans to work with
senior staff members to try to clarify the procedures for dealing
with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Senate resolution provides for a vote on whether
to allow new information beyond that in the 7,000-page House report
to be introduced. That would add another dimension of potential
uncertainty for the White House defense team.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're still unsure of exactly what the Senate procedure will
be, they still have to prepare for too many contingencies,'' said
Lowell, of the Washington firm Brand, Lowell &AMP; Ryan. On balance,
though, ''I don't think it's a terrible process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his public strategy, Clinton ignored Friday's
proceedings, traveling to Detroit, where he used a speech to
economists to highlight the latest good news on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Wall Street surged to record highs, Clinton
announced that unemployment last year, at 4.5 percent, was the
lowest since 1969, during the height of the Vietnam War, and was
the lowest peacetime annual unemployment figure since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the U.S. economy has been growing for 93
consecutive months, the longest peacetime expansion in the
country's history.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's rosy economic performance has been the leading
reason cited for Clinton's ability to maintain job approval ratings
topping 60 percent ever since last January, when the
sex-and-deception scandal involving former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky first surfaced.

DODD SEEKS SENATE HARMONY IN RETELLING SUMNER CANING STORY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Appealing for a sense of harmony, Sen. Christopher
J. Dodd, D-Conn., reminded colleagues gathered in the Old Senate
Chamber for a rare bipartisan caucus Friday that the room was the
scene of a ``tragic event'' in 1856: a brutal physical assault by
one member of Congress on another.
</P>
<P>
   On May 20 of that year, Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts
delivered a scathing speech denouncing the Kansas-Nebraska Act of
1854, which, in repealing the Missouri Compromise, permitted the
two new territories to decide for themselves whether slavery would
be allowed there.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked the leaders of the South and spoke pointedly of Sen.
Andrew Butler of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, while the Senate adjourned in memory of a
recently deceased member of Congress, Sumner was seated at his desk
in the rear row of the Senate chamber when he heard his name
called. As he looked up, he was rebuked for his speech and struck
about the head, neck and shoulders with a heavy walking stick. The
cane was broken by the force of the blows.
</P>
<P>
   Few senators were present in the chamber at the time of the
attack, and even fewer felt compelled to come to the unpopular
senator's aid.
</P>
<P>
   His assailant was Rep. Preston S. Brooks of South Carolina,
nephew of Butler. Expulsion proceedings of Brooks failed on a
straight party vote. He resigned his House seat in July 1856, but
was elected to fill the vacancy caused by his own resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Sumner, left bleeding and unconscious from the attack, was
absent from the Senate until December 1859 because of his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The caning of Sumner emerged as a symbol of the escalating
violence between the North and South and of the tension with which
political leaders of the nation had to deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most historians will tell you that whatever civility and
comity remaining in the Senate in the late 1850s ended with that
event,'' Dodd said. The Civil War broke out five years later.

`COLD WAR' ON CNN: THREE APPRAISALS

<P>
   Sunday night, CNN will begin broadcasting the second half of its
24-part documentary series ``Cold War.'' The first half already has
brought several angry critiques from historians and commentators
over how it interprets the Cold War and how it assigns blame. Some
critics have complained that the series does not deal critically
enough with American responsibility for perpetuating the Cold War.
Conservative critics, meanwhile, have taken the opposite tack,
saying it draws no moral distinctions between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times asked three historians with different
perspectives to assess the series. Ronald Radosh, co-author of
``The Amerasia Spy Case: Prelude to McCarthyism'' and ``The
Rosenberg File,'' is a senior research associate at the Center for
Communitarian Policy Studies, George Washington University. While
he says that overall the series does a good job of portraying the
evils of the Soviet system compared with the democratic Western
allies, he argues that it too often equates the Soviet Union's
moral failings with those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd C. Gardner, who teaches history at Rutgers University and
is the author most recently of ``Pay Any Price: Lyndon Johnson and
the Wars for Vietnam'' (Ivan C. Dee, 1995), questions just how
inevitable the Cold War was as well as the series' European focus.
</P>

FINDING A MORAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE SOVIETS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Turner and the producers Jeremy Isaacs and Pat Mitchell have
managed to produce an often riveting and generally comprehensive
account of the Cold War that will probably become the source most
used to acquaint young generations with its history.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts that there was a fundamental struggle between
the forces of democracy based in the West with its thriving civil
society and those of the totalitarian camp led by Stalin and his
successors will find stark and powerful evidence of what it meant
to try to lead a normal life in the so-called socialist camp.
</P>
<P>
   Watching clips of the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the
suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, one can't help being
moved by the courage and commitment of the first generation of
Soviet bloc dissidents. As one of them says, the Soviets had to
suppress them; they were afraid of their ``becoming an organized
political force.'' It was, another says, a system that ``produced
only evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The final episode gives the last word to President Vaclav Havel
of the Czech Republic, who says that Communism simply was an
affront to the normal desires of human beings just moments after we
see Fidel Castro reaffirming his commitment to the Communist
ideology. The moral difference is starkly presented for those who
doubt that the long conflict was simply an unnecessary fight
between two imperial superpowers vying for hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   It is more unforgivable then that this message has been
undermined by some abhorrent episodes, which suggest a moral
equivalence between the Soviet Union and its satellites and the
democratic Western allies. To me, the single worst episode was
``Reds'' (the sixth of the 24 programs, which appeared on Nov. 1),
because it compares the epoch of Stalinism and the gulag to that of
McCarthyism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In both countries, the narrator, Kenneth Branagh, states: ``The
Cold War was fought by fear. . . . Both sides turned their fear
inwards against their own people. They hunted the enemy within.''
The millions killed by Stalin are somehow to be equated with the
few who were blacklisted or lost teaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The ideological bias in these episodes is usually implied by
selectively using facts and combining them in a one-sided way.
Although the most recent evidence has proved that Alger Hiss was a
Soviet spy for decades, for instance, he is presented as a noble
figure hounded by an evil Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiss,'' we are told, ``firmly denied that he had betrayed his
country. Richard Nixon, an ambitious young Republican, was
convinced that Hiss was lying. Hiss was jailed for perjury. Nixon's
name was made.'' The documentary does not say that Hiss was guilty,
suggesting that Nixon unfairly did him in.
</P>
<P>
   As for Julius Rosenberg, who the latest evidence shows was a
Soviet agent who put together a network of spies, viewers are left
with the impression _ after hearing the grisly details of the
execution _ that just as Stalin killed his dissenters, America
killed its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of McCarthyism, the smearing of dissent as
Communist treason,'' Branagh says, ``stained American democracy for
decades. In the Soviet Union, all dissent was suppressed.'' But
Hiss and Rosenberg were not arrested and found guilty for dissent.
They were Soviet agents.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an overly sympathetic slant when it comes to
Central America and the Caribbean. Unlike the last episode, these
episodes present the United States as the oppressor, while Fidel
Castro is presented as a hero and given a disproportionate amount
of air time. He is never challenged in any of his arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The series says that Castro turned to the Soviets only after the
Coubre, a Cuban munitions ship, blew up in 1960 and declared
himself a socialist only after the Bay of Pigs invasion. New
evidence showing that Castro already had made military agreements
with the Soviets before the Bay of Pigs in 1961 and had privately
made clear his Marxist allegiance is simply ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The series also suggests that Daniel Ortega Saavedra and the
Sandinista revolutionaries freed Nicaragua in 1979 from an
American-backed dictator and that when their power collapsed, it
was because of fierce American opposition. In ``Backyard'' (the
18th program, to be broadcast Feb. 21), we hear that in 1990
``Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega asks the Nicaraguan people to
vote him President. . . . Violeta Chamorro, Ortega's opponent,
narrowly won a surprise victory. Washington spent nearly $10
million backing her campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that were it not for the overwhelming
political and monetary intervention of the United States, the
revolution would have stayed in power. But those who were there to
monitor the election, as this writer was, saw that the Sandinistas
had a virtual monopoly on government-provided campaign funds and
resources, including American-produced music videos, and that it
regularly interfered with opposition freedom during the campaign.
The opposition, the historian Robert Kagan notes, ``spent a little
more than half of what the Sandinistas spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Chamorro obtained a 55 percent majority, while
Ortega received only 41 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers chose to focus on the voices of ordinary people
who lived in the Cold War era. But whose voices did they choose?
</P>
<P>
   We get to hear the blacklisted writer Ring Lardner Jr., a
committed member of the American Communist Party, rather than, say,
Edward Dmytryk, a director, one of the Hollywood 10 who broke with
Communism. We see the screenwriter John Howard Lawson yelling at
members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, but we do
not hear from his son, Jeff Lawson, who has written in his new book
that his father ``believed that Russia was a paradise and could do
no wrong'' and that he turned ``a blind eye to Soviet reality.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of people who criticized Communism but
vigorously supported the civil liberties of its supporters, but we
don't hear from them. Had such a witness appeared, the presentation
might indeed have provided some real balance.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, leftists are presented as heroes unfairly
persecuted. We see mobs attack Paul Robeson at the famous
Peekskill, N.Y., concert in the late 1940s; we are not told that
Robeson was a lifelong acolyte of the Stalin regime and that he
opposed civil liberties for those on the Left with whom he
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have praised the series for not having the
proverbial ``talking heads'' so familiar from other documentaries.
In my view, this is a weakness. Knowledgeable commentators could
have put events in context, corrected some of the absurdities
offered by self-interested contemporaries, and separated truth from
falsehood. No amount of powerful film and remembrances by observers
can compensate for the absence of informed commentary.

BUSH QUESTIONS TRIAL LAWYERS' MOTIVES IN SEEKING TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
DELAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush questioned Friday whether
private trial lawyers who helped the state win a $17.3 billion
tobacco settlement will try _ at the state's expense _ to fatten
the $3.3 billion in legal fees that cigarette companies have
already agreed to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will fight a motion recently filed in federal court
by the five lawyers that would ``delay letting taxpayers off the
hook for legal fees.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cornyn, the new attorney general, said he shared the
governor's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the lawyers said the state had nothing to
worry about. He said the lawyers were only seeking more time so
they could meet with Cornyn before formally closing the tobacco
case.
</P>
<P>
   The outside lawyers want to ``bring this to an early and
amicable resolution,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cornyn, then a candidate for attorney general, spent
much of last year fighting then-Attorney General Dan Morales, who
left office Dec. 31, over the legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Morales hired the five private attorneys _ Walter Umphrey and
Wayne Reaud of Beaumont, John O'Quinn and John Eddie Williams of
Houston and Harold Nix of Daingerfield _ on a 15 percent
contingency contract to try the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing sides reached a truce last summer to give a
three-member, national arbitration panel time to set the fees. The
panel last month awarded the lawyers $3.3 billion _ more than 15
percent _ which the tobacco industry is committed to pay under the
state's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The five lawyers received their first payment of about $200
million shortly before Christmas. It will be many years before the
Texas lawyers' entire award is paid because the industry has set a
cap of $500 million a year on lawyer payments from all states, and
most states have now settled lawsuits with the cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the private attorneys had until Dec. 30 to tell U.S.
District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana, who presided over Texas'
tobacco lawsuit, that they were releasing the state from any claims
for additional payments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the lawyers asked Folsom for more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appalled at the nerve of lawyers who have been awarded an
exorbitant fee yet refuse to honor their agreement and let our
taxpayers off the hook,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' spokesman, who didn't want to be identified, said
the attorneys asked for the delay to give them time to meet with
Cornyn to discuss various issues, including how much the federal
government may seek from the state's settlement to cover federal
Medicaid expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this suggests to me is they are not satisfied with $3.3
billion and intend to go for more,'' Cornyn said, adding that he
would fight the lawyers if that is the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said he also is investigating what role a sixth attorney,
Marc Murr of Houston, had in the tobacco case. Murr was awarded $1
million by the national arbitration panel, although other lawyers
in the case said he did little, if any, work on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, before he left office, said Murr did important work on
the case.

 &HT;    Pepsi strengthens No. 2 spot with bottling spinoff
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pepsico Inc. on Friday filed notice with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it will spin off its
bottling business, a move expected to raise $1 billion and make the
No. 2 soft drink maker a more formidable competitor for
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy filing left many questions unanswered, such as when
the Purchase, N.Y.-based company plans the initial public offering
for its bottling subsidiary, Pepsi Bottling Group, how shares will
be priced and how much of a stake Pepsico plans to keep in the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, who say the IPO is expected this spring, have hailed
plans for the spinoff. Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Conway has
called it ``the most positive strategic action by Pepsico since the
acquisition of Frito-Lay more than 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi's stock closed Friday at $41.37 1/2, up 62 1/2 cents,
after nearly 5.2 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico's board approved the sale in November as a way to
separate the low margin, cash-intensive bottling business from the
company's more profitable concentrate operation. Such a strategy,
which lessens financial volatility and earnings pressures, has paid
off for Coca-Cola, which in 1986 sold 51 percent of its bottling
operation to form Coca-Cola Enterprises, now the world's largest
soft drink bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi Bottling Group, which now handles 54 percent of Pepsico's
domestic volume and 32 percent of the company's volume worldwide,
would be able to ``invest significantly'' in infrastructure after
the spin-off, according to the SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the bottler has 36,900 full-time employees, 72
production plants and 296 distribution facilities. It uses 16,500
vehicles and 1.3 million vending machines to sell more than 100
million 8-oz. servings of Pepsi products each day.
</P>
<P>
   The bottler makes and sells Pepsi products in 39 states, the
District of Columbia, eight Canadian provinces, Spain, Greece and
Russia, and last year accounted for $6.8 billion of Pepsico's $20.9
billion total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The filing makes it clear that the bottler will remain indelibly
linked to Pepsico. The bottler is leasing space for its
headquarters at Pepsi-Cola Co.'s Somers, N.Y., corporate campus, a
short drive from Purchase. Pepsico executives are expected to serve
on the bottler's board.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the bottler will be required to submit annual
marketing, advertising, management and financial plans to Pepsico
for review and approval.
</P>
<P>
   If Pepsico executives don't like what they see, they can
terminate their agreement to provide the bottler with soft drink
concentrate, marketing dollars and other vital means of support.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is part of Pepsico Chief Executive Roger Enrico's
efforts to compete more aggressively against rival Coca-Cola. In
the past year he's spun off the company's KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza
Hut restaurants, bought the Tropicana juice business for $3.3
billion and brought in a new management team for the beverage
division.

UNHEEDED WARNINGS: A SPECIAL REPORT ON THE EMBASSY BOMBING IN
KENYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A short version has moved as EMBASSY-BOMBS-ABR) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN and BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to
Kenya, sent an emotional letter to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright begging for the secretary's personal help.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, a career diplomat, had been fighting for months
for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats
and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot. The
department had repeatedly refused to grant her request, citing a
lack of money. But that kind of response, she wrote Albright, was
``endangering the lives of embassy personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the FBI had been amassing increasingly ominous and
detailed clues about potential threats in Kenya, officials said.
But the State Department bureaucracy still dismissed Ms. Bushnell.
She was even seen by some at the State Department as a nuisance who
was overly obsessed with security, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   Albright took no action. And three months later, on Aug. 7, the
American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were simultaneously
attacked with car bombs. Twelve American diplomats and 254 Africans
were killed in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has acknowledged that Ms. Bushnell raised
questions about security before the bombing. But a close
examination of events in the year before the assaults, based on
interviews with officials throughout the U.S. government, shows her
concerns were more intense, more well-founded, more specific, and
more forcefully expressed than has previously been known.
</P>
<P>
   The review shows that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA repeatedly told State Department officials in
Washington and in the Kenya Embassy that there was an active
terrorist cell in Kenya connected to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
exile who is accused of masterminding the attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA and FBI investigated at least three terrorist threats
in Nairobi in the year before the bombing and took one seriously
enough to send a counter-terrorism team from CIA headquarters. The
agency ultimately concluded that threat was unfounded, but some
officials believe the inquiry was botched, and the agency's
inspector general is investigating how it was handled.
</P>
<P>
   _ State Department officials brushed aside Gen. Anthony Zinni,
commander of the U.S. Central Command, who had visited Nairobi on
his own and warned that the Nairobi embassy was an easy and
tempting target for terrorists. Zinni's offer to send his own
specialists to review security in Nairobi was turned down by the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ The State Department had all but abandoned the commitment it
made after the 1983 bombing of the Beirut embassy to improve
embassy security. Department officials had long since stopped
asking Capitol Hill for the money needed to meet its own standards,
and had adopted a strategy of improving the handful of embassies it
believed were at greatest risk. Nairobi was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, in her first interview about the bombing, said by
telephone from Nairobi on Friday: ``This is a tragedy in the real
sense of the word, and it's a tragedy that has caused us to think
differently. We no longer operate under the assumptions that we did
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A report made public Friday by a commission appointed by
Albright excoriated the State Department for failing to safeguard
American missions against terrorist attacks, particularly for the
practice of giving vulnerable missions like the one in Nairobi
lower priority when experience shows they make tempting targets for
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, signed by Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concluded that ``intelligence provided
no immediate tactical warning of the August 7 attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, classified cable traffic and intelligence reports, which
were not included in the public version of Crowe's report, show
that while none of the warnings gathered by American intelligence
in the year before the bombings pointed to a particular act of
terrorism on a particular day, the United States had growing
evidence that the embassy was a target of terrorist plots, and that
terrorists hostile to American interests were active in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials say it is impossible to respond to
each terrorist threat it receives. In addition, State Department
officials assert that even if Ms. Bushnell's requests had been
granted, a new embassy could not have been in place in time to
prevent the attack in August.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were told at the time by the CIA that the
threats in Nairobi had either proved unfounded or had been dealt
with by Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Ms. Bushnell began raising
concerns about the embassy's security soon after her arrival in
Nairobi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She sent two cables to headquarters in December 1997, outlining
the dangers and asking for a new embassy. Her request was not
seriously considered, officials said, when senior State Department
officials met in January 1998 at the State Department to set a
budget for embassy construction in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up on the radar screen,'' said one senior
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Ms. Bushnell to try her end-run with Albright. In
memos sent in April and May, she asked Albright to cite Nairobi's
vulnerability to Congress in seeking more funds for security. In
addition, Ms. Bushnell was lobbying every senior American official
and member of Congress who came to Nairobi. The ambassador would
say, ``How do you like our building? I think it's terrible,''
according to an American official. Ms. Bushnell ``did not want to
be in that building,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the terrorist threats investigated by the CIA
panned out, they focused Ms. Bushnell's attention on just how
vulnerable her embassy was. ``If you know there is a viper's nest
around, then that gives you pause,'' one State Department official
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the global investigation touched off by the
1993 World Trade Center bombing had focused on bin Laden and his
associates. FBI agents from New York were hard at work building a
criminal case against the Saudi exile. At the same time, the CIA
was tracking the group's movements and finances in hopes of
preventing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One trail led to Kenya where the agency discovered that bin
Laden's operatives were living in the country. Intelligence
officials say they briefed Ms. Bushnell about the presence of the
group in early 1997 but told her there was no evidence of a
specific threat against the embassy or American interests in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, American intelligence officials began to
look more closely at what bin Laden was doing in Africa. The CIA
identified an intriguing suspect: Wadih el Hage, a Lebanese-born
American citizen in Kenya who was believed to have close ties to
the leadership of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials prodded their Kenyan counterparts to raid el
Hage's home in Nairobi, an overture that was shared with Ms.
Bushnell and others in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police, accompanied by the CIA and FBI, searched the
house in August 1997. They found his computer, downloaded its
files, and read a letter describing the existence of an ``East
African cell'' of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the letter mentioned recent attempts by American
intelligence to investigate the group's Kenyan operations and
alluded to its role in attacking American soldiers in Somalia a few
years earlier. According to the document, the group had moved a
cache of incriminating files from el Hage's house and hidden them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That reference set off alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   American officials suspected that the missing files might
contain evidence of an upcoming attack by bin Laden's Kenyan
operatives. The working theory, officials said, was that such a
plot would be aimed at another country, with Nairobi used as a
``jumping off point.''
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official said American investigators began a
``somewhat frantic, concerted effort'' to locate the missing files.
``The concern was high enough about something being out there to go
right away,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, a second search was conducted in Kenya
at another location in September 1997. This time, a State
Department official from the embassy joined the CIA, FBI and
Kenyans. No files were found.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI interviewed el Hage, who had moved to the United States,
three times, but he professed to know little of bin Laden or his
activities in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Today, el Hage is in jail in New York, awaiting trial on charges
of lying in those interviews and conspiring with bin Laden to kill
Americans abroad. He has not been directly linked to the bombings
in Kenya, but has been accused of being one of the Saudi exile's
chief lieutenants, responsible for setting up front companies in
Kenya and seeking components for chemical weapons. He has pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CIA and FBI believed at the time that they had
uncovered a potentially dangerous terrorist group linked to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were not told of
this and stress that they were given only a ``fragmentary''
understanding of the reasons for the raid on el Hage's house.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were told only that the CIA was
assisting a criminal investigation by the New York FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time were we told he was connected to Osama bin Laden or
to any threat against U.S. interests in Kenya,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official said: ``If we had known there
was a significant bin Laden network in Kenya we would have gotten
our people the hell out of that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence and law enforcement officials strongly dispute the
State Department's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, said one intelligence official, was
briefed about the presence of bin Laden's operatives in Kenya
``before, during and after'' the August 1997 raid on el Hage's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, intelligence officials said the CIA sent the
State Department numerous reports detailing the activities of el
Hage and others linked to bin Laden in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those reports referred to Osama bin Laden in the first
paragraph,'' recalled one U.S. intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, the CIA's Nairobi-based officers learned
of another possible terrorist threat to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence service of another country, which American
officials declined to identify, turned over an informant to the
CIA. In a series of conversations, the informant said that the
Nairobi branch of an Islamic charity, the Al-Haramain Foundation,
was plotting terrorist attacks against Americans, according to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The informant eventually warned that the group was plotting to
blow up the American embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the CIA's station chief in Nairobi relayed the
threats to the ambassador and other embassy officials, touching off
a dispute between the agencies over what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Senior diplomats at the embassy wanted the CIA to ask the Kenyan
authorities to arrest the group's members immediately. But the
CIA's station chief, uncertain about the credibility of the
informant, initially favored keeping an eye on the group, according
to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats prevailed, and on Oct. 31, the Kenyans arrested
nine Arabs connected to Al-Haramain, and seized the group's files.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States receives thousands of terrorist threats
a year, this one was taken so seriously that the CIA took the
unusual step of sending a team of counter-terrorism specialists
from its Langley, Va., headquarters to Nairobi to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA team, which included an Arab linguist, scoured
Al-Haramain's seized files, but could find no evidence of a bomb
plot. Members of the counter-terrorism team then wanted to question
the Al-Haramain members in jail, to make sure they were not missing
any clues.
</P>
<P>
   But that request set off another dispute, officials said. The
agency's station chief, the highest ranking CIA officer in Nairobi,
refused to ask the Kenyans for access to the Al-Haramain suspects,
insisting that he had pushed his local counterparts far enough. The
station chief said he did not want to strain his relations with the
Kenyans.

TWO SALT LAKE OFFICIALS RESIGN AMID ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes `big payoff' text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The top two heads rolled at the Salt Lake Organizing Committee
Friday as the worst scandal in modern Olympic history broadened and
deepened.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Joklik and Dave Johnson, the committee's president and
senior vice president, respectively, resigned under pressure after
admitting that SLOC officials made cash payments to International
Olympic Committee members, apparently to influence enough votes to
land the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions during the Olympic bidding process that besmirch
our reputation break my heart,'' said Joklik, who was chairman of
the bid committee when the Utah capital was awarded the Games three
years ago but denied knowing about the payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and dismayed over new revelations regarding
actions of the former bid committee,'' added Joklik, who has been
involved with the Olympic bid for more than a decade. ``Although I
had no personal knowledge of these activities, it became clear that
changes must be made in order for the Games to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other senior SLOC officials _ marketing and legal affairs
vice president Kelly Flint and licensing director Rod Hamson _ were
placed on paid leave. And former president Tom Welch, who resigned
in 1997 after spousal abuse allegations, will no longer receive a
$10,000-a-month consulting fee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Utah Governor Mike Leavitt had urged top
SLOC officials to step down amid ongoing investigations by the IOC,
US Olympic Committee, and US Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC officials had already admitted to paying hundreds of
thousands of dollars in college tuition for relatives of IOC
members and providing free medical care, lavish trips, and
expensive gifts, including a pair of shotguns for IOC president
Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   When the New York Times Friday reported that individual cash
payments up to $70,000 had been made to IOC members, Joklik and
Johnson stepped down after meeting with USOC officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deplore it,'' Leavitt said of the scandal, which has also
rocked the august IOC, which prides itself on being beyond
financial and political influence. ``We cannot avoid the fact that
we've been injured. We will clean this wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, who does not vote for Olympic host cities and said he
did not ask for the shotguns, said he regretted the shakeup but
that ``they had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which confirmed Friday that Salt Lake City still will
be allowed to stage the Games, is conducting its own investigation
of the bribery scandal, with Samaranch vowing to expel any members
who sold their votes.
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Richard Pound of Canada spent two days in
Salt Lake City last month interviewing officials and gathering
documents. ``We're looking at everything that might be regarded as
inappropriate conduct,'' said Pound, who estimated that his inquiry
panel would have its findings complete in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After competing unsuccessfully for the Winter Games several
times and losing the 1998 bid by four votes to Nagano, Salt Lake
decided to make sure it had enough support for 2002. So the
committee focused on IOC members from Africa, who had no stake in
where the Winter Games were held.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cash payoffs, the SLOC paid nearly $400,000 for
college tuition or athletic training for 13 people, six of them
related to IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Committee officials also provided $28,000 of free medical
treatment, including a knee replacement, for three IOC members from
Africa at a local hospital. They helped arrange a Utah land deal
that turned a $60,000 profit for IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga of
the Republic of Congo. And they procured jobs for relatives of IOC
members with local companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Marc Hodler of Switzerland, the IOC's
longest-serving member, the SLOC was merely doing what other bid
cities have done for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody blames Salt Lake City,'' said Hodler, who claimed that
the 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002 Games were all tainted with
vote-buying. ``We blame those voters who can be bought. For us,
Salt Lake City was a victim of blackmail and not a villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Salt Lake, which blew away Oestersund (Sweden) and
Sion (Switzerland) by a 54-14 margin on the first ballot, didn't
need the African votes. And since balloting is secret, the Utah
group couldn't be sure it had gotten the votes it was paying for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely certain that Salt Lake City didn't need to do
this sort of thing to win,'' said IOC director general Francois
Carrard. ``The value of the bid was absolutely uncontestable.''

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The BIG PAYOFF &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Salt Lake City allegedly did for Olympic votes:
</P>
<P>
   _Made cash payments ranging from $5,000-$70,000 to unidentified
International Olympic Committee members from Africa and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   _Paid nearly $400,000 for college tuition or athletic training
for 13 people, six of them related to IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   _Arranged a Utah land deal that turned a $60,000 profit for IOC
member Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   _Provided $28,000 of free medical treatment, including a knee
replacement, at a local hospital for three IOC members from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _Procured local jobs for relatives of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   _Offered free ski trips to Utah resorts.
</P>
<P>
   _Gave skis and shotguns to IOC members.

 UNDATED: the Kenyans. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senior officials at CIA headquarters urged the station chief to
reconsider, but they said the decision was ultimately his, and he
held his ground.
</P>
<P>
   There were no interviews. Because the documents seized from the
group's offices showed no evidence of a bombing plot, the CIA soon
dropped its investigation. Without any evidence against
Al-Haramain, the agency concluded that its informant was not
credible, officials said. Kenya washed its hands of the group,
ordering the nine deported.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of the counter-terrorism team were furious,
officials said, and complained that their investigation had been
dangerously short-circuited. They felt they were unable to conduct
a thorough investigation without talking to the suspects
themselves. Some team members blamed the decision on the station
chief's lack of field experience; he was a career analyst from the
CIA's directorate of intelligence on his first overseas espionage
assignment. Embassy officials say they were not aware of the
internal CIA dispute, and add that they assumed at the time that it
was the Kenyans who had denied access to the suspects. ``Why would
you not want to interview them?'' asked one State Department
official.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell was told of the findings of the inquiry, and
assured that the threat had been eliminated by the arrests. In
fact, there were some lingering questions. Some intelligence
officials believed at the time that members of the charity were
tied to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   It was, perhaps, another clue about possible terrorist activity
in Kenya. However, the CIA did not circulate any intelligence
reports throughout the rest of the government about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Today, intelligence officials insist there is no evidence
linking the group to the embassy bombings. But they say they now
have evidence that connects them to bin Laden. The agency's
inspector general is examining the case.
</P>
<P>
   A third warning surfaced in November, 1997. Mustafa Mahmoud Said
Ahmed, an Egyptian, walked into the embassy and told CIA officers
he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb-laden truck
inside the diplomats' underground parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interrogation by Kenyan security officials, which
was relayed to the Americans, Ahmed made his own involvement in the
plot clear, saying he had already taken surveillance photos of the
embassy for the attack, which he said was to involve several
vehicles and stun grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA issued two intelligence reports on Ahmed's statements,
but cautioned in its reports that Ahmed may have fabricated his
story, thus downplaying the significance of the warning.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed is now being held in jail in Tanzania in connection
with the Dar es Salaam embassy bombing, and U.S. officials still
aren't sure what to make of his 1997 warning.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings in August and November prompted Ms. Bushnell to
renew her case for a new embassy.
</P>
<P>
   On December 15, 1997, she sent a report back to State Department
headquarters warning that the embassy's location made it
``extremely vulnerable to a terrorist attack,'' and that it had to
be replaced with a more secure building.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, on December 24th, she sent another
cable noting again that ``the embassy's security profile, in a
congested, downtown location, is cause for serious concern,'' and
asked for a comprehensive review of the embassy's security status.
</P>
<P>
   She also asked that State Department officials go back to
Congress to ask for more money in order to fund a new Nairobi
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials were not swayed, arguing that the dangers were
nonexistent or already dissipated. Ahmed's warning, one senior
official said, had been largely discounted as not credible. The
Kenyans had taken care of the more serious threat, he said, by
arresting members of al-Haramain.
</P>
<P>
   In a January 1998 budget review concerning embassy construction
funding, which included Undersecretary of State for Management
Bonnie Cohen and other senior officials, Ms. Bushnell's request was
not seriously considered, officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to her warnings of a worsening terrorist threat,
in a January 1998 cable, Ms. Bushnell was told by headquarters that
other embassy projects had priority, and that a new Nairobi embassy
was not in the State Department's future plans.
</P>
<P>
   The cable said that headquarters agreed that a ``new chancery
would be ideal,'' but that State ``had reviewed the case and
understood her concerns'' and had turned her down. In fact, the
State Department had a long wish list of embassies it eventually
wanted to replace, and Nairobi was not on it.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and State Department officials say that, prior to
the August embassy bombings, State asked Congress to include funds
in its fiscal 1999 budget for only two new embassies _ in Beijing
and Berlin. Those were the only new embassies the State Department
had sought congressional funding for since at least fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell's increasingly insistent demands for a new embassy
were so far out of step with the State Department's plans that
officials at headquarters were beginning to see her as a nuisance
who was obsessed by security, according to one official familiar
with the matter.

 UNDATED: the matter. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in addition to the terrorist threats, Ms. Bushnell had other
reasons for concern about security, including street crime and
local political violence.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, the CIA's deputy station chief in Nairobi was
mugged near the building. Ms. Bushnell, officials disclosed, had
been told about a plot to kill her in early 1998 as well. And local
police refused to guard the embassy, and sometimes beat up
political dissidents right in front of the building, according to
an American official.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even similar warnings from other senior government
officials failed to persuade the State Department to change its
mind. Zinni sent a cable to the State Department warning that the
embassy was vulnerable to a terrorist attack after having seen
security conditions at the embassy for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the cable, Zinni offered to send a security team from CentCom
to review security at the embassy, but his offer was turned down by
the State Department because it already was planning to send its
own team to placate Ms. Bushnell. In March 1998, a team from
diplomatic security and the foreign building office, which handles
embassy leases and construction projects, arrived in Nairobi to
conduct a security review.
</P>
<P>
   In March, officials updated the security assessment last
conducted at the embassy in 1994, and found that the embassy was in
compliance with the security standards the State Department had
established for a post facing a medium terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
   Security recommendations made in 1994 had been carried out, the
review found. A week later, the team sent out from Washington
conducted its review, and proposed about $500,000 worth of new
security measures, including the installation of a new fence around
the front parking lot, upgrading perimeter surveillance, and
construction of a fence in front of the embassy's front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   In March, funding for a special roll-down door for the
underground parking garage was approved. Two months later, funding
for a similar door for the front entrance of the building and a new
perimeter fence was approved. But by the time of the attack, only
the garage door had been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the attack, the State Department said it had
been planning to spend about $3 million in 1999 to upgrade security
at the embassy. But officials now acknowledge that most of the
money was earmarked for interior remodeling, and only a small
portion was to go for security. ``We felt they shouldn't bother to
renovate,'' one official said. ``We said they should use that money
for a new building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the bombings, the Clinton administration has also
asked Congress for $1.8 billion to improve security at diplomatic
posts around the world, and to build new embassies in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam. On Friday, the Crowe panel included among its
recommendations that State spend an additional $1.4 a year over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   And just before Christmas, the State Department briefly closed
the embassy in Nairobi after the U.S. was warned that bin Laden and
his group might be ready to strike again.

AMERICA, THE BEAUTIFUL: FROM SEMEN TO SHINING C-SPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With 355 days to go before you-know-what, it is possible to make
some definitive claims about our fair country as the millennium
draws nigh:
</P>
<P>
   1. The American economy, despite everything we've learned about
burst bubbles this century, looks bulletproof. Not even the
.50-caliber Asian meltdown, the Japanese swoon, Russia's collapse
into kleptocracy or the successful advent of the euro can dampen
the planet's hottest economic volcano. New home sales, car and
truck sales, gasoline at a buck a gallon, the stock market: This
baby just keeps pouring out the good-times lava and sucking in the
investment cash.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Klown Kollege of Kongress that is the House of
Representatives is even less essential to the country's progress
than we had suspected. The tawdry descent into partisan and
prurient persecution of the presidency that has diminished the
standing of the House now threatens to engulf the more staid
Senate. The public stubbornly refuses to abandon President Clinton
despite the philandering; his job approval poll numbers persist
despite the worst efforts of his Republican enemies and the ``new''
news media.
</P>
<P>
   3. The infotainment industry formerly known as network news is
melting before the eyes for which advertisers fork over huge chunks
of money. Word that the Nielsen numbers show a 6 percent decline
for 1998 in the 18- to 34-year-old television viewing audience hit
network execs right in the old breadbasket. Standing of network
news? Right alongside Kongress's. Those ``White House in Crisis''
logos are now more than a year old.
</P>
<P>
   4. The befuddled conglomerates that paid top dollar for the
networks are turning to the oldest medium (let's hear it for
books!) or the oldest gimmick in show biz: running out the sequel.
How do the geniuses running television handle the dilemma of their
incredible shrinking audiences? You had to ask. Peter Jennings
(ABC) and Tom Brokaw (NBC) put their names on books that sold big
numbers during the Christmas gift season.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I just don't see the 18-to-34 crowd flocking to Barnes
&AMP; Noble or Amazon.com for the Pete and Tom tomes. I hope I'm wrong.
Over at Black Rock, CBS is cooking up ``60 Minutes II,'' a Dan
Rather-led rehash of ``60 Minutes'' (get it?), the aging
industry-standard TV news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Seasoned Six of ``60 Minutes'' _ Mike Wallace, Morley
Safer, Ed Bradley, Lesley Stahl, Steve Kroft, and cranky old Andy
Rooney _ have amassed the astonishing collective total of 127
years' service on the program, and 176 years combined at CBS. How
old was the hotshot VP who came back to the office from lunch and
said: ``Hey, how about a knockoff of that show we run Sunday nights
with all the geezers? That should yank those 18- to 34-year-olds
away from their VCRs and PCs, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   6. Not to be outdone in the obeisance to our elders is the US
Senate. To receive the articles of impeachment hand-delivered by
septuagenarian US Representative Henry Hyde, 74, the House
Judiciary foreman of the get-Clinton gang, and the nation's oldest
confessed political adulterer on record, the Senate trotted out
Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, who is 96, and a
ladies' man of note for much of this past century.
</P>
<P>
   7. It is not only the networks and the Klown Kongress that need
help with their image, and their grip on the public imagination. We
in the newspaper game (a.k.a. The Dead Pine Tree biz) struggle to
maintain circulatory health. The Monica Story, a.k.a. Devil in the
Blue Dress, turned out to be an empty-calorie fast-food fix for
what ails us. You are what you eat? Ugh! Thank God the ads still
stick to your ribs. Today's Sunday Globe help-wanted section of 162
pages of jobs begging for workers is the third-largest such section
ever. Did I say bulletproof? You can't slow down this economy with
Kryptonite.
</P>
<P>
   8. We burn through personalities in the news biz at a pace that
would make Andy Warhol proud. Who are the, ahem, journalists who
made the biggest splash in 1998? I give you _ please, I'm trying to
give these first two guys away _ the following choices:
</P>
<P>
   A. Larry Flynt. B. Matt Drudge. C. Geraldo Rivera. D. Joe
Lelyveld.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope, please?
</P>
<P>
   Flynt is the skin mag tycoon who was into pornography before
special prosecutor Ken Starr and the House Republicans discovered
the power of prurience. Drudge is the cyber-punk who trolls the
bottom of the barrel for the top of the news. Rivera is the
formerly-declasse downmarket TV hyper (i.e., one who hypes) who has
rehabilitated himself with punchy puncturing of the vast right-wing
conspiracy (Hillary is right again) to demonize Clinton. And
Lelyveld? Oh, he's only the top editor at The New York Times. You
never see him on TV. He must work for a living. While on the
subject: Anyone heard from Rush Limbaugh lately? How come no one
mentions him anymore?
</P>
<P>
   9. The collective silence of all those who would succeed Clinton
(save for his ever-present defender Al Gore) on this impeachment
stinker is deafening. They are like visitors to the bedside of the
deathly ill: shaking hands, shuffling feet, clearing throats,
shifting eyes, mouthing inanities, doing anything to avoid saying
the obvious. This is leadership?
</P>
<P>
   10. There is a way to resolve Washington's plunge into the
sheepdip. Since a vast silence engulfed my first assay on how to
resolve the Washington imbroglio, I repeat it, in truncated form:
A. The Senate vote to remove Clinton falls short of the 67 needed.
B. A harshly worded resolution of censure is adopted by a vote of
99 to 1. (I don't know who the one will be; I just know there's
always at least one.) C. The chastened president is summoned to the
floor of the House chamber, and is read the riot act by Thurmond,
which takes a long time, because he's such a slow talker.
</P>
<P>
   And, then, D. Former Presidents Ford, Carter and Bush give
10-minute declamations on the need for presidents to obey the law,
tell the truth, resist groping the help, and set an upstanding
example for the youth of America. (Maybe in the spirit of the
occasion, Bush apologizes for fibbing about Iran-contra on Rather's
show.) E. Clinton has to stand there chewing his lip, taking his
medicine, unbidden to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Being shamed in silence is a huge punishment for this guy. He's
always been able to talk his way out of everything, but the genius
of my plan is that Big Bill just has to listen; he can't wangle his
way out with mere words. F. Everyone sings ``America the
Beautiful.'' G. the Rev. Billy Graham delivers a benediction. H.
Everyone goes home for lunch. I. Next day, everyone gets back to
their regular jobs, including Clinton and the TV moguls, who call
an 8 a.m. emergency meeting to ask underlings: ``So what bright
ideas do you have for replacing all the Monica stories and
Clinton-in-crisis stuff? Anyone heard from O. J. lately?''

UNHEEDED WARNINGS: A SPECIAL REPORT ON THE EMBASSY BOMBING IN
KENYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A long version has moved as EMBASSY-BOMBS.) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN and BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to
Kenya, sent an emotional letter to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright begging for the secretary's personal help.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, a career diplomat, had been fighting for months
for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats
and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot. The
department had repeatedly refused to grant her request, citing a
lack of money. But that kind of response, she wrote Albright, was
``endangering the lives of embassy personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the FBI had been amassing increasingly ominous and
detailed clues about potential threats in Kenya, officials said.
But the State Department bureaucracy still dismissed Ms. Bushnell.
She was even seen by some at the State Department as a nuisance who
was overly obsessed with security, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   Albright took no action. And three months later, on Aug. 7, the
American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were simultaneously
attacked with car bombs. Twelve American diplomats and 254 Africans
were killed in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has acknowledged that Ms. Bushnell raised
questions about security before the bombing. But a close
examination of events in the year before the assaults, based on
interviews with officials throughout the U.S. government, shows her
concerns were more intense, more well-founded, more specific, and
more forcefully expressed than has previously been known.
</P>
<P>
   The review shows that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA repeatedly told State Department officials in
Washington and in the Kenya Embassy that there was an active
terrorist cell in Kenya connected to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
exile who is accused of masterminding the attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA and FBI investigated at least three terrorist threats
in Nairobi in the year before the bombing and took one seriously
enough to send a counter-terrorism team from CIA headquarters. The
agency ultimately concluded that threat was unfounded, but some
officials believe the inquiry was botched, and the agency's
inspector general is investigating how it was handled.
</P>
<P>
   _ State Department officials brushed aside Gen. Anthony Zinni,
commander of the U.S. Central Command, who had visited Nairobi on
his own and warned that the Nairobi embassy was an easy and
tempting target for terrorists. Zinni's offer to send his own
specialists to review security in Nairobi was turned down by the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ The State Department had all but abandoned the commitment it
made after the 1983 bombing of the Beirut embassy to improve
embassy security. Department officials had long since stopped
asking Capitol Hill for the money needed to meet its own standards,
and had adopted a strategy of improving the handful of embassies it
believed were at greatest risk. Nairobi was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, in her first interview about the bombing, said by
telephone from Nairobi on Friday: ``This is a tragedy in the real
sense of the word, and it's a tragedy that has caused us to think
differently. We no longer operate under the assumptions that we did
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A report made public Friday by a commission appointed by
Albright excoriated the State Department for failing to safeguard
American missions against terrorist attacks, particularly for the
practice of giving vulnerable missions like the one in Nairobi
lower priority when experience shows they make tempting targets for
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, signed by Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concluded that ``intelligence provided
no immediate tactical warning of the August 7 attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, classified cable traffic and intelligence reports, which
were not included in the public version of Crowe's report, show
that while none of the warnings gathered by American intelligence
in the year before the bombings pointed to a particular act of
terrorism on a particular day, the United States had growing
evidence that the embassy was a target of terrorist plots, and that
terrorists hostile to American interests were active in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials say it is impossible to respond to
each terrorist threat it receives. In addition, State Department
officials assert that even if Ms. Bushnell's requests had been
granted, a new embassy could not have been in place in time to
prevent the attack in August.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were told at the time by the CIA that the
threats in Nairobi had either proved unfounded or had been dealt
with by Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Ms. Bushnell began raising
concerns about the embassy's security soon after her arrival in
Nairobi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She sent two cables to headquarters in December 1997, outlining
the dangers and asking for a new embassy. Her request was not
seriously considered, officials said, when senior State Department
officials met in January 1998 at the State Department to set a
budget for embassy construction in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up on the radar screen,'' said one senior
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Ms. Bushnell to try her end-run with Albright. In
memos sent in April and May, she asked Albright to cite Nairobi's
vulnerability to Congress in seeking more funds for security. In
addition, Ms. Bushnell was lobbying every senior American official
and member of Congress who came to Nairobi. The ambassador would
say, ``How do you like our building? I think it's terrible,''
according to an American official. Ms. Bushnell ``did not want to
be in that building,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the terrorist threats investigated by the CIA
panned out, they focused Ms. Bushnell's attention on just how
vulnerable her embassy was. ``If you know there is a viper's nest
around, then that gives you pause,'' one State Department official
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the global investigation touched off by the
1993 World Trade Center bombing had focused on bin Laden and his
associates. FBI agents from New York were hard at work building a
criminal case against the Saudi exile. At the same time, the CIA
was tracking the group's movements and finances in hopes of
preventing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One trail led to Kenya where the agency discovered that bin
Laden's operatives were living in the country. Intelligence
officials say they briefed Ms. Bushnell about the presence of the
group in early 1997 but told her there was no evidence of a
specific threat against the embassy or American interests in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, American intelligence officials began to
look more closely at what bin Laden was doing in Africa. The CIA
identified an intriguing suspect: Wadih el Hage, a Lebanese-born
American citizen in Kenya who was believed to have close ties to
the leadership of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials prodded their Kenyan counterparts to raid el
Hage's home in Nairobi, an overture that was shared with Ms.
Bushnell and others in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police, accompanied by the CIA and FBI, searched the
house in August 1997. They found his computer, downloaded its
files, and read a letter describing the existence of an ``East
African cell'' of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the letter mentioned recent attempts by American
intelligence to investigate the group's Kenyan operations and
alluded to its role in attacking American soldiers in Somalia a few
years earlier. According to the document, the group had moved a
cache of incriminating files from el Hage's house and hidden them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That reference set off alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   American officials suspected that the missing files might
contain evidence of an upcoming attack by bin Laden's Kenyan
operatives. The working theory, officials said, was that such a
plot would be aimed at another country, with Nairobi used as a
``jumping off point.''
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official said American investigators began a
``somewhat frantic, concerted effort'' to locate the missing files.
``The concern was high enough about something being out there to go
right away,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, a second search was conducted in Kenya
at another location in September 1997. This time, a State
Department official from the embassy joined the CIA, FBI and
Kenyans. No files were found.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI interviewed el Hage, who had moved to the United States,
three times, but he professed to know little of bin Laden or his
activities in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Today, el Hage is in jail in New York, awaiting trial on charges
of lying in those interviews and conspiring with bin Laden to kill
Americans abroad. He has not been directly linked to the bombings
in Kenya, but has been accused of being one of the Saudi exile's
chief lieutenants, responsible for setting up front companies in
Kenya and seeking components for chemical weapons. He has pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CIA and FBI believed at the time that they had
uncovered a potentially dangerous terrorist group linked to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were not told of
this and stress that they were given only a ``fragmentary''
understanding of the reasons for the raid on el Hage's house.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were told only that the CIA was
assisting a criminal investigation by the New York FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time were we told he was connected to Osama bin Laden or
to any threat against U.S. interests in Kenya,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official said: ``If we had known there
was a significant bin Laden network in Kenya we would have gotten
our people the hell out of that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence and law enforcement officials strongly dispute the
State Department's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, said one intelligence official, was
briefed about the presence of bin Laden's operatives in Kenya
``before, during and after'' the August 1997 raid on el Hage's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, intelligence officials said the CIA sent the
State Department numerous reports detailing the activities of el
Hage and others linked to bin Laden in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those reports referred to Osama bin Laden in the first
paragraph,'' recalled one U.S. intelligence official.

SHANAHAN HOPES THE CROWD IS IN IT THIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Here's a question for you. What do you suppose the good
people of Denver are talking about this morning? Is it the
under-.500 Avalanche, the 11-71 Nuggets going back to work, the
Rockies re-signing Curtis Leskanic, or the defending Super Bowl
champion Broncos beginning defense of their title at Mile High
Stadium against the Miami Dolphins?
</P>
<P>
   Duh.
</P>
<P>
   And as the fans are talking about the team, so the head coach is
talking about them. He holds them at least partly accountable for
the most shocking and depressing result of his four-year tenure in
Denver. On Jan. 4, 1997, the prohibitively favored AFC West
champion Broncos were knocked out of the playoffs by the
Jacksonville Jaguars right here in Mile High Stadium, where the
team had won all eight of its regular-season games and was starting
to feel invincible.
</P>
<P>
   There were many reasons for the 30-27 Jacksonville victory, most
notably 245 yards and two touchdown passes by quarterback Mark
Brunell and 140 yards rushing and one touchdown by battering ram
Natrone Means. But to those reasons Denver coach Mike Shanahan adds
one more.
</P>
<P>
   The fans didn't do their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question about it,'' he says. ``In
that Jacksonville game two years ago, we had a very nonchalant
crowd. I was very surprised. But I don't anticipate that happening
again this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that the Broncos haven't lost a game in this
venerable Den of Din since that day. They have gone 8-0 at home in
each of the last two regular seasons and they added a 42-17 revenge
triumph over the Jaguars in the wild-card game last season. You can
make a compelling case that no team in the NFL operates from a
better position of strength than the Denver Broncos at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Though nobody in the Broncos' camp speaks openly of payback, the
simple truth is that this game has a little bonus for the defending
champs. On the night of Dec. 21, the Broncos went into Miami's Pro
Player Stadium and got spanked. The final score was 31-21, and it
was probably a bit more authoritative than that.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan &AMP; Co. say that is a matter of greater interest to the
media and fans than to his team. Even if his team had beaten the
Dolphins by three touchdowns that evening, he would be looking at
Miami strictly as a quality opponent. What happened Dec. 21, he
says, will be of little consequence Saturday. His team would have
needed a big effort no matter who had shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is one of the great I-dotters and T-crossers in the
game, and he says his team is ready to go. Oh, there is the matter
of return specialist Vaughn Hebron and a hamstring boo-boo (there
is little likelihood he will play), and 2,008-yard rusher Terrell
Davis will play with a flak jacket to protect tender ribs, and
veteran defensive end Neil Smith is banged up, and a bunch of other
guys have assorted owies, but, says Shanahan, ``This is pro
football, and these things are to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we got a lot of work done this week,'' he adds.
``The intensity was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Broncos finished 13-3 and were rewarded with
the much-coveted first-round bye. Big deal. They lost, anyway. Last
year they started out as a wild card and ended up as world champs
by defeating Green Bay in one of the great Super Bowls ever. So
what's the moral of that story?
</P>
<P>
   According to Shanahan, there is none. You'd better be ready to
play; that's all.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Broncos do not have is doubt. Nobody writes any
Carrollian stories in Denver on the subject of questionable
leadership. Being a highly successful NFL coach is a matter of
having that elusive ``It,'' and there is unanimous agreement that
whatever ``It'' is, Mike Shanahan is in possession of same. And you
really can't win the whole thing without having ``It'' _ unless, of
course, your name is Barry Switzer and you have about 18 potential
Pro Bowlers on your team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must believe in the coach and his staff,'' reports
fullback Howard Griffith. ``If you don't, you can't win. If you
didn't believe in the coaching staff, that would mean you wouldn't
have faith in the offensive schemes, the defensive schemes, or the
special teams. You have to believe in them. Look at Bill Parcells.
Those players believe in what he says. He brings out the best in
people.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ed. note: I swear on every available religious work imaginable
that Mr. Griffith brought up the subject of The Tuna spontaneously.
He was absolutely, positively not coached).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible to win unless you believe in the coach and
the staff,'' agrees safety Steve Atwater. ``People can have
opinions, but in the end, you must believe that the coach is
putting the best players on the field and giving you the best
possible game plans. As players, you want someone to take the
pressure off you, and that's what a good coaching staff does. We
have that here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos believe they can win because they have won, and
because they believe they are better technically than they were
last year. But they also know they must win with their bodies and
heads and not with their mouths and hearts. They must stop Dan
Marino and they must find a way to score at least two touchdowns
against a very rugged and aggressive Miami defense. They also know
they can't expect the crowd to win the game for them, although they
would appreciate it if the crowd would live up to its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to play. The champs are primed for battle. ``I think
we're ready, but we'll find out on Saturday,'' says Shanahan. ``Our
football team has had a great week of practice. But talk is cheap.
We'll find out how ready we are Saturday afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   And God help the crowd if they let Mike Shanahan down again.
Have you ever seen the serial-killer look in this man's eyes?

FRAZIER OUTGUNNED AGAINST JONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally, Ricky Frazier tries to prevent muggings. Saturday
he'll be involved in one.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to say that a 39-year-old New York cop has a
chance to beat World Boxing Association and World Boxing Council
light heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr. at the Pensacola (Fla.)
Civic Center, but that would be accurate only if you conceded that
Jones also has a chance to be hit by a meteor on the way into the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Both are true. Neither will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Take the word of the people televising the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky Frazier should not be fighting Roy Jones,'' HBO Sports
senior vice president for programming Lou DiBella admitted
recently, even though he's the guy paying for the fight. ``He does
not have an iota of a chance to win. He's not a worthy opponent for
Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Ricky's fault. It's not Roy's fault. It's not our
fault. It's a mandated mismatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is, courtesy of the alphabet organizations that foist
such fights on both the public and world champions who have no
choice but to show up or lose the titles they worked so hard to
win. That is why Jones is in Pensacola and also why lightweight
champion Shane Mosley will fight Golden Johnson on the undercard.
If either is challenged, someone should check their water bottles.
</P>
<P>
   This has been been Jones's fate for a time now and will continue
for at least one more fight. After this match, he has already been
told, he must fight another mandatory challenger, Dario Mattioni,
before he can try to unify the 175-pound title against
International Boxing Federation champion Reggie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   As for Frazier's fate, it is simply this: Before this night is
out, he will know what it means to be NYPD blue. Black-and-blue, as
a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier (18-3-1) is a cop from Harlem who boxes on the side when
given the opportunity. He is a man who can take care of himself,
but not in this fight, because he is in the kind of predicament all
cops try to avoid. He's facing someone with a lot more weapons than
he has.
</P>
<P>
   Even his fellow officers have been ribbing him unmercifully
about this undertaking, because cops know trouble when they see it,
and what Frazier's friends see in Jones is a lot of trouble for
their man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Ricky to put my photos on the bottom of his shoes so
when he hits the canvas, I could see myself on TV,'' said Francis
Seguinot, who works with Frazier in the 26th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the kindest thing that could be said about you, but
Frazier is used to it. He has come to work and found posters of
Jones staring back at him from his locker. He has seen a message
from ``a Mr. Jones'' pinned to a bulletin board asking for him to
call because Mr. Jones has an extra-strength can of whip-ass
waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier has heard these skeptical points of view ever since he
turned pro at the advanced age of 32 following a foray into
kickboxing and a brief spell as New York Golden Gloves champion as
both a middleweight and light heavyweight. Since then, he has had
to scuffle to make a living with his fists, never earning more than
$12,000 until promoter Don King got him a No. 1 ranking (wonder
how?) and a $400,000 payday.
</P>
<P>
   That will be hard-earned money. It will likely also be blood
money, because Frazier's blood seems destined to stain his trunks
and probably the floor before he collects. It is highly likely King
will collect more than Frazier does and just as likely Frazier will
have to collect his wits after Jones (38-1, 30 knockouts) scatters
them around the ring.

   Yet this is Ricky Frazier's moment, and he hopes to seize it. It
is his moment even if it lasts only a moment. It is his moment
until Roy Jones Jr. makes clear it is not . . . which should take
only a moment, by the way.

ARMS RACE HAD MOMENTUM, BUT IT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY

<P>
   The opening sequence in CNN's first episode of ``Cold War''
takes viewers on a tour of the secret underground rooms where the
business of government was to be carried on in case of nuclear war.
In a subsequent episode, Robert S. McNamara tells an interviewer
that when he became Secretary of Defense in 1961, he knew almost
nothing about nuclear weapons. Learning quickly, he said, he
dedicated his life to making sure that they would never be used.
``It's not mad,'' McNamara says quietly of the nuclear stand-off
and the policy of mutual assured destruction (MAD); it was the best
way to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   There is a meditative sense of inevitability in McNamara's
reflections on the arms race. As the still familiar events of the
Cold War appear on the television screen, crisis begets crisis, and
the superpowers threaten each other with ever larger weapons.
Certainly the arms race created its own powerful momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with U.S. and Russian citizens engaged in this
patriotic endeavor offer an example of the ways the external Cold
War reshaped the entire society inside the superpowers, favoring
certain geographical areas and occupations, shortchanging others.
Eventually the strain of keeping up caused the Soviet Union and its
Eastern European empire to collapse with an astounding rapidity.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, CNN retells the Cold War story from the
perspective of knowing how it all came out, emphasizing systemic
Soviet weaknesses while faulting the United States mainly for
miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   The enterprise is successful in many ways. Episodes devoted to
the ``domestic'' side of the Cold War often provide insight into
the Soviet leaders' halfhearted struggle to find a way out of the
grim Stalinist legacy and into the racial and social upheavals in
the United States during the 1960's.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding what the Cold War was about, however, and why it
developed in the ways it did to become a global confrontation is
not easily accomplished. And it is here that the conceptual and
editorial problems are not always so well met. Choices must be made
from rough cuts of interviews and then placed in the framework of
the scripts produced by several authors. But were they always the
best choices?
</P>
<P>
   Postwar Europe, where the Cold War began, is presented in the
narrative as a ravaged landscape fought over by two non-European
powers, one invited in to save the ancient civilizations, the other
a brutal dictatorship with crude aggressive intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador W. Averell Harriman recalls that Stalin shrugged off
a compliment to the Red Army's victories with an unsmiling comment
that Czar Alexander got to Paris. To U.S. policy makers worried
about the state of postwar Europe, Stalin's shadow did seem to
reach to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   What is missing here, though, is commentary on the prewar
differences between Eastern and Western Europe, whether in terms of
resources or of political organization, and the heritage of the
anti-Soviet cordon sanitaire policies practiced by France and
Britain. Also missing is a discussion of the abortive secret
surrender negotiations that prompted Stalin's protests to Roosevelt
that the West's plan was to see the war end as far East as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Were there, then, any legitimate Russian concerns at the wartime
conference, or just evidence of Stalin's paranoia? The series is
ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   In one episode we are told that the postwar division of Europe
into spheres of influence was essentially a product of the 1943
Tehran Conference, the unhappy result of teaming up with the
Russians to fight Hitler, while in the following episode the
division is presented as the tainted result of appeasement at the
1945 Yalta Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Given the special place Yalta plays in interpretations of the
origins of the Cold War, perhaps much more ought to have been
included about the Big Three debates over other issues _ Stalin's
argument for reparations, for example, or Roosevelt's efforts to
inaugurate the United Nations before territorial issues were
settled.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Yalta negotiations were stymied on all fronts, while doubts
grew about the future of the Grand Alliance. Still pending,
however, were the agreements on Russian entrance into the Far
Eastern war, only briefly mentioned in the series. With the
successful atomic bomb test, President Harry S. Truman decided at
Potsdam that he could strike out on a new path to check Russian
advances. No time is devoted to the continuing controversy over the
implications of this decision and to countervailing views on
``atomic diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, after the Berlin blockade ended in 1949, the Cold War
wasn't foreordained. The Chinese Revolution triggered a new phase
in the conflict. Throughout the series, policy makers exclaim over
and over that they were shocked or surprised at each turn of
events, a subtheme that underwrites the conclusion that the Cold
War was about one thing only: resistance to Soviet expansionism.
</P>
<P>
   But the attempts of America's Western allies to regain their
colonies and the joint decision to divide Korea, a temporary
expedient, set in motion forces that would produce the limited hot
wars and draw in the superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   American concern and postwar planning had always been about
stabilizing the world economy and restructuring Germany and Japan
into peaceful workshops for Europe and Asia. Eastern Europe was
sacrificed but still served the containment policy well as a
stimulus to Western unity under American leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In the Far East, however, the boundaries were not as easily
established. China's revolution finally undid the Yalta Far Eastern
agreement, not an adventurist Stalin. The series also neglects the
decision to go ahead without Russia in writing a peace treaty after
the Japanese surrender, and the building of atomic-capable air
bases on Okinawa as influences on the Stalin's decision to give Kim
Il Sung a green light for his plan to unify Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the series stresses Soviet recklessness and China's
intervention to halt Gen. Douglas MacArthur's march to the Yalu
River, as if there were no other explanations than Communist
aggression. After Korea it proved impossible to limit the Cold War
to one part of the world. Gen. Andrew J. Goodpaster confirms that
Eisenhower understood that genuinely free elections in Vietnam
would have brought Ho Chi Minh to power, an unacceptable solution
to that problem. What viewers are not told is why; that Eisenhower
thought a Communist victory would destroy American plans for safely
reintegrating Japan into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the series takes up the Vietnam War in the 1960s,
however, credibility has replaced political economy as the crucial
focal point. If you like what the United States has done in Europe,
Dean Rusk preached to skeptical NATO policy makers, you must
support us in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War consensus came apart for a time. But Russia's
constantly threatening presence in Eastern Europe and its war in
Afghanistan eased the potential problems of mobilizing the nation
for a new campaign against the ``Evil Empire'' after Richard M.
Nixon's failure to make detente an acceptable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has effectively recounted the events of the Cold War era.
Their various meanings, however, could still use further
examination.

TASKMASTERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jacksonville Jaguars play the New York
Jets in the Meadowlands Sunday which means Bill Parcells and Tom
Coughlin will meet again. It must be like looking in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are almnost identical, really,'' said Glenn Foley, who
played quarterback for Coughlin at Boston College and now plays
backup quarterback for Parcells with the Jets. ``They are very
similar. They have identical styles. They're both really intense
and great coaches. Behind the scenes and on the field, they're
basically the same. They're both maniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and Coughlin can't seem to get away from one another.
When he was head coach of the New York Giants, Parcells hired
Coughlin as his wide receivers coach in 1988. Coughlin was with
Parcells in Tampa when the Giants beat the Bills in Super Bowl XXV
in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Parcells and Coughlin both worked in Greater Boston.
Coughlin was in his final year at Boston College, going 9-3 and
coming within one fumble of taking the Eagles to the Sugar Bowl.
Down in Foxborough, Parcells was in his first year of resurrecting
a moribund Patriot franchise for owner James Orthwein.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Parcells's Patriots beat Coughlin's Jaguars,
20-6, to put New England in the Super Bowl. Now they are meeting
again, and the winner plays the winner of Sturday's Denver-Miami
game for the right to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells hired Coughlin after a 15-minute chat at the Senior
Bowl in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had quite a bit in common,'' remembered the Tuna. ``We're
both Northeastern guys. We have a little Irish in our background.
He went to Syracuse. I know what that's about. I've been around
guys like Tom my whole life, so I basically understood him him
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin remembered, ``I had been an admirer of his team in the
way in which they played, but I really didn't know him then. But
when I got to know him a bit better, I had a great deal of
admiration for the way in which he went about things, like his
focus, for his tunnel vision, and for his intensity which he brings
to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells acts like he invented intensity. Coughlin makes it a
way of life. Players, beware. These guys are no barrel of laughs on
the job. Parcells cut his teeth coaching at West Point (when Bobby
Knight was the Army hoop coach). Coughlin is equal parts Patton and
Dean Wermer. Neither man allows his asssistant coaches to speak
with the media. It's one voice only, something Parcells started.
</P>
<P>
   Think Parcells was nasty for belittling Terry Glenn by calling
him ``she''? Get this one: Two Jacksonville players this week
miraculously escaped injury when they rolled their BMW four times
while rushing to get to a team meeting on time. Coughlin greeted
them with the news that they'd been fined $500 for tardiness.
Rules, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lesson to be learned here, and the fines are
consistent with my policies,'' explained Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Both Parcells and Coughlin left a legacy in New England.
Parcells bequeathed the Patriots a string of sellouts and a team
good enough to stagger back to the playoffs in successive seasons.
Coughlin left behind enough good players to beat Notre Dame and a
monstrous new configuration of BC's Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Thave have something else in common: Both go into the game on
the heels of a rout of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   As a workaholic and disciplinarian, Coughlin may have topped the
Tuna. There's a well-worn story from their days together with the
Giants about when Parcells called the Giants' office on Christmas
morning and heard Coughlin's voice on the other end of the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells chuckled at the memory and said, ``Every time now when
I catch him where he doesn't answer the phone, I always leave a
message about `when you get done with your 18 holes, when you get
back from the beach, give me a call,' because I obviously know
that's not where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley rolled his eyes at the memory of Coughlin at BC.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, he had you,'' said the QB. ``It was amazing what
we did. You were getting drilled into the ground physically,
regardless. And if you screwed up, it was doubled. One year guys
had a little fun filling out the recruiting card they gave us. That
was it. They were up at 6 a.m. running. If you missed one class,
you ran for a week at 5:30 or 6 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen our practice sheet. There were 24
periods, six or seven minutes each. He's meticulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells thus far has been a bigger winner, but Coughlin is five
years younger and building a nice team in Florida. John Calipari
wants to be Rick Pitino and Bob Kraft wants to be Jerry Jones, but
Coughlin is comfortable being Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to study the guy that I think is the master at what
he does and how he maneuvers the things that put you in a position
to win,'' said Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had to coach against his pal Bill Belichick when the
Patriots made their first playoff appearance in eight years back in
1994. Now the Jets are playing their first home playoff game in 12
years, and Parcells finds himself facing Coughlin for the second
time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather we didn't have to do this,'' said Parcells. ``This
happens in this industry. You have guys that go on, and I'm very
proud of what Tom has done. I'd just prefer to play against
somebody else. But he's the opponent and I'm the opponent for him.
If we can't win, then there isn't anybody I'd rather see win than
him. It's like playing against family.''

WILLIAM LEONARD SHEARER III, 92; FORMER FURNITURE EXECUTIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   William Leonard Shearer III of Dublin, N.H., the former
president of the Paine Furniture Co., a Boston fixture owned and
operated by his family for more than 160 years, died Monday in
Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Shearer, who enjoyed yachting and skiing in his youth, also
was a champion sled dog racer. As a major in the Army during World
War II, he trained dog teams and commanded a unit that rescued
downed fliers from northern Maine to Greenland. On Feb. 17, 1949,
he won the 90-mile International Dogsled Derby in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   He was the great-grandson of Leonard Shearer, a cabinetmaker who
opened a shop at 77 Blackstone St. in Boston in 1835.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Shearer contracted with local farmers to tap New
England's old-growth pine and maple trees to fashion furniture in
home workshops that was shipped to his business for painting,
finishing, and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   He employed John F. Paine of Uxbridge, Mass. as an apprentice.
Paine served as a wagon driver, cabinetmaker, and salesman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1854, Paine married Eliza Ann Shearer, the sister of the
founder. This brought about a partnership, and the firm became
Shearer &AMP; Paine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1864, after the founder's death, Paine operated the business
under his name.
</P>
<P>
   William Leonard Shearer III was born in Swampscott, Mass. and
graduated from Harvard College. He was president of the company
from 1936 until his retirement in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Harvard Club of Boston, the Union Club,
and the Dublin Lake Club.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Constance (Murphy); two sons, Daniel H. and
Jonathan C.; two daughters, Michaele Shearer Osgood and Abigail
Shearer Robinson; and six grandchildren.

LITTLE BITE LEFT IN WATCHDOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new governor has been inaugurated. Freshman legislators have
been welcomed by the House speaker and the Senate president.
Boston's mayor will deliver his State of the City speech Monday,
with the City Council on hand.
</P>
<P>
   All these newly minted, or reminted, leaders will have their
agendas, their plans, their dreams. But there's one thing they
won't have _ anything to fear from the agencies that are supposed
to protect the integrity of government. Because most of those
agencies have become invisible. Or sclerotic. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   Inside and outside government, agencies that used to advocate
good government, demand fiscal accountability and pursue corruption
have been brought to their knees, unemboldened by the chore of
policing their political benefactors and suffering from the same
malaise that afflicts so much of government.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the State Ethics Commission? The Inspector General's
Office? When was the last time you heard from the Boston Finance
Commission? Do you recall anything about the state Auditor's
Office, other than the auditor's fondness for midweek tee times? Do
we still have an Office of Campaign and Political Finance or a
Boston Municipal Research Bureau?
</P>
<P>
   Many of them seem to be in a persistent vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wondering whether some of those agencies should be busier
need look no further than the office of Representative Philip
Travis, the House banking chairman, who pressured banks into
contributing $20,000 for an Indian tribe in his district last
spring _ just as his committee was debating automatic teller
legislation that has since provided banks with a huge windfall.
</P>
<P>
   Travis returned the money only after the Globe started asking
about it. But that was months after he collected it, apparently
heedless of the oversight of agencies charged with safeguarding
clean governmment.
</P>
<P>
   Lousy government and dishonest officeholders haven't disappeared
from the landscape. But agencies that were once devoted to keeping
a critical eye on them nearly have.
</P>
<P>
   The public spends millions of dollars on watchdogs _ $12 million
a year on the state auditor's office alone _ but has less and less
to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Campaign and Political Finance cannot even file a
lawsuit. When politicians refuse to file reports or respond to
questions about questionable practices, the agency is reduced to
writing polite letters asking them to please, if it's not too much
trouble, obey the law. They send out thousands of these letters
every year.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Senator Dianne Wilkerson of Roxbury refused to file
campaign reports, or to respond to scores of letters. Even when
thousands of dollars of reimbursements to Wilkerson were
challenged, all the agency could do was beg a reluctant attorney
general's office to file a lawsuit. After Wilkerson's other legal
woes caught up with her in 1997, it fined her committee and
Wilkerson herself. The committee missed its last payment.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor, Joseph DeNucci, points to his audit of the Lawrence
School Department nearly two years ago as one of his signal
accomplishments in recent years. (He looked into misallocation of
education reform funds, after dozens of news stories pointed out
exactly where to find the wrongdoing.)
</P>
<P>
   Samuel R. Tyler, the long-time president of the Boston Municipal
Research Bureau, whose reports were once feared by city officials,
admits that his business-funded group has lost some of its
missionary zeal. He attributes that to a lack of concern by many of
the companies that give the bureau $400,000 in annual funding.
Increasingly, he said, the companies are headquartered elsewhere
and don't really care about anything in Boston that doesn't affect
the corporate bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Finance Commission, a state-appointed overseer of the
city, has not noticeably raised an eyebrow since it did a report on
overlapping duties by Boston's Fire and Emergency Medical Services
departments. That was in 1994 _ well before Bill Clinton met Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, some of the watchdog agencies are casualties of
Beacon Hill combat. After the Ethics Commission fined a slew of
legislators, including Senate President William M. Bulger in 1992,
its budget was promptly slashed. OCPF has essentially been
level-funded for most of its 25-year existence _ by the very
legislators who are most likely to run afoul of the campaign
finance law, which, not incidentally, they have progressively
weakened.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing is about to change. So wish the best for your newly
enshrined leaders. Given what's become of the watchdogs, they are
effectively the only judges of their own behavior.

DIRTY BIRDS WILL GIVE 49ERS NO QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there is to be a new world order in the National
Football League, it could begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the perennial NFC powerhouse San Francisco 49ers
come to the Georgia Dome to try to reassert themselves in the face
of upstart challengers who call themselves the Dirty Birds and made
quite a mess of the NFC this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons marched through their schedule the way
General Sherman once marched through downtown, burning and
pillaging nearly everything in their path, including the once-proud
49ers. Just three years ago, the Falcons were a dismal 3-13 and
going nowhere. But Dan Reeves arrived the following season and has
led them to the second-greatest turnaround in NFL history (plus-7
from last year's 7-9 finish) and to 20 wins in their last 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   There are many who still believe the Falcons are more mirage
than miracle. But there is no denying they have won nine straight,
10 of their last 11 in their division, and went 11-1 against NFC
opponents this season, running their conference record to 14-2 in
their last 16 such games. One of those losses came against these
same 49ers, but that was an 11-point setback three weeks into the
season that was avenged by a 31-19 rout six games ago that the
Dirty Birds insist was a mess with a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``What beating them did for our team was tell our guys we can
play with those guys and win,'' said veteran Pro Bowl safety Eugene
Robinson, who made a habit of beating these same 49ers while
anchoring the Green Bay Packers' defense before leaving for Atlanta
this season. ``That does a lot for the psyche of our team. We're
playing with consistency, and things are clicking. We're not the
lowly Falcons anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they are not, and the 49ers know it. If they questioned
that, the Falcons ended all doubt Nov. 15 when they survived a
second straight onslaught from Steve Young (684 passing yards in
the two games) and Jerry Rice (18 receptions for 331 yards and
touchdowns of 66, 65, and 26 yards) by ramming the ball down their
throats with running back Jamal Anderson, throwing it over them to
Terance Mathis, and harassing them with a defense that has few
familiar faces but a habit of producing turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson rushed for 1,846 yards and scored 16 touchdowns and is
the key to everything Atlanta tries to do on offense. Meanwhile,
the defense has shut down the run so effectively that it finished
second in the NFL in that category after allowing just 3.3 yards a
carry and 75.2 a game. When the latter is coupled with the fact San
Francisco running back Garrison Hearst comes into this game with a
bad hamstring, it is further food for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Yet so, too, is the fact that despite all the numbers, a doubt
remains, and that is Young's demonstrated ability to shred
Atlanta's defense. Even in victory, Atlanta allowed 307 passing
yards and won only because the defense scored one touchdown and set
up a second.
</P>
<P>
   While some look at that game and suggest it was a fluke, you
can't discount those defensive plays, because the Falcons have been
making them all season. They have scored six touchdowns, compiled
the leading takeaway/giveaway ratio in the league (plus-16), and
made their bones by crushing the bones of running backs, which is
why they are favored and believe they can survive another assault
from Rice, Young, and Terrell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating them before . . . you have more confidence in your
ability,'' said veteran linebacker Jessie Tuggle, who has been here
10 years and well remembers that the 49ers owned his team not so
long ago. ``We're going to be the ones to try and set the tempo
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do, the 49ers expect it will be done by Anderson, who is
so commanding a force that since Reeves arrived, Atlanta is 19-2
when he has carried 20 times or more, including 14-0 this season.
Considering that he has already carried a record 410 times, it is
obvious to the Niners what they must deal with _ a battering ram.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that, 49ers coach Steve Mariucci has said his team
will often put seven or eight men at the line of scrimmage, using
safety Tim McDonald as a counterweight to Anderson. If that works
and quarterback Chris Chandler is forced to carry too much of the
load, it could mean a revival for the aging 49ers. But if it fails,
Mariucci knows what could follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Falcons have big-play capability,'' he said. ``Their
passing game is based on selling the run. Then they'll throw in
some trick passes and it's bombs away.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows that better than McDonald, who watched helplessly
while he was trapped at the line of scrimmage pursuing Anderson as
Mathis three times burned man-to-man coverage for touchdowns, all
more than 31 yards. In those two games, Mathis had eight receptions
for 208 yards, a fact that normally would cry out for double
coverage. But if Atlanta gets Anderson rolling, the Niners would be
forced to take their chances and hope they can pressure Chandler
(10 sacks in the two games) enough to save themselves. If that
fails, McDonald understands the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they have a legit running back, it makes it tough,''
McDonald said this week from San Francisco. ``Do you commit an
extra guy to try to contain Jamal Anderson or do you keep him back,
which could be to Jamal's advantage? They can always stick you with
a big play if you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the Niners. San Francisco has won eight of
the last 11 meetings and has outscored the Falcons, 622-349, in the
'90s. But those numbers may be merely history now because the
Falcons' defense led the NFL in fumble recoveries (25) and
takeaways (44), was second in rushing yards allowed per carry
(3.33) and rushing yards allowed per game (75.2), fourth in points
allowed (18.1 a game), and eighth in total yards allowed per game
(295.9). It has not allowed more than 20 points in eight of its
last nine games, not allowed a 100-yard rusher during its nine-game
winning streak, and has 14 interceptions and 21 sacks during that
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, during the Falcons' 20-4 run, that defense has allowed
only one rusher to gain 100 yards and held Hearst to averages of
3.2 and 3.5 yards in this season's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings the 49ers fate back to an old guy named Young, who
will be trying to beat a team that is unwilling to believe 1998 is
anything but the dawning of a new age.

THE VIEW FROM INSIDE:   ANSWERING SOME CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
   (See TV-COLDWAR-INTRO, TV-COLDWAR-RADOSH, TV-COLDWAR-GARDNER) 
John Lewis Gaddis, who teaches history at Yale University, was a
consultant to CNN on the three-year project.  
(dw) 
 By JOHN LEWIS GADDIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It always has been hard to view the Cold War dispassionately, so
it's no surprise that CNN's televised version has provoked
controversy. Ted Turner's involvement alone _ he conceived the
series _ would have insured that. Then there's the fact that
historians still are hotly debating the significance of new
evidence from the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China. Of
course visual images always pack more of an emotional punch than
the printed page, especially the academic prose in which most Cold
War history has been written.
</P>
<P>
   When I signed on as a consultant to ``Cold War,'' therefore, I
knew that it was going to be a great white whale and that harpoons
would fly from several directions. It's been interesting over the
last four months, though, to see their trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   First, there has been the charge that it isn't scholarly. True
enough in a traditional sense. Video archives still are unfamiliar
to most historians; nor can one pitch a television presentation at
the level one might for, say, an annual meeting of the American
Historical Association. But surely visual evidence is no less valid
a guide to the past than what is put down on paper. The real
problem is that previous television histories haven't always been
careful in citing their sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold War'' breaks new ground in this regard. Every scrap of
film used has been authenticated and documented; full versions of
its 500-plus interviews are to be made available on line, and there
was careful coordination throughout with the Cold War International
History Project and the National Security Archive, the principal
centers now for assessing recently released documents on Cold War
history. The interviews are to be on the archive's Web site: &QL; 
www.seas.gwu.edu/nsarchive/
</P>
<P>
   Second, some critics say too much is left out. ``Cold War'' has
24 episodes of 46 minutes each, not counting the commercials that
helped pay the bills. This makes it the longest television
documentary since its co-producer, Sir Jeremy Isaacs, completed his
classic series on World War II, ``World at War,'' a quarter-century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cold War lasted four and a half decades, not seven
years, so even this much air time left a lot that we couldn't
cover. The critics _ particularly the historians _ have noticed:
one early review listing all that we had neglected in a single
episode was about twice as long as its actual script.
</P>
<P>
   Triage comes with the territory. A clear narrative is as vital
in doing history as compelling dramatization is in theater: both
involve selecting what is really important and leaving the rest
aside. How that is done, then, becomes critical.
</P>
<P>
   Third, other critics say ``Cold War'' tells the story from a
particular point of view. Correct, but I would argue that our
selection criteria were methodological, not ideological. Turner
insisted that the series reflect an international perspective;
hence its global coverage and its reliance on consultants from
Russia and Britain as well as the United States. Isaacs, in turn,
determined the format: minimal narration, interviews only with
participants in the events (not talking-head historians) and a
particular focus on the Cold War's impact on ordinary people's
lives.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the tone is neither as celebratory nor as
condemnatory as some of our critics would have liked. We did not
try to settle old arguments about responsibility for the Cold War.
Instead we tried to allow all kinds of people simply to tell their
stories: most surviving leaders to be sure but also a Berlin baby
sitter, a Russian rocket scientist, a Hungarian street fighter, a
Cuban farmer, an Afghan mullah, an American housewife.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we've heard the complaint that the series suggests
moral equivalency. Our playing down of ideology has upset the
neo-conservative right, which seems to harbor deep fears that
Turner has been hoping all along to transform the Cold War into the
``goodwill games'' _ that he wants a history devoid of moral
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes speak for themselves on this issue. Because I use them
in my classes, I've watched the responses of several hundred Yale
undergraduates to certain events portrayed: the Red Army rapes in
Germany in 1945, the crushing of the Hungarian uprising in 1956,
the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, the invasion of
Afghanistan in 1979 and the persecution of dissidents in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe throughout the Cold War. I see few if any
students who come away convinced that the two sides in this
struggle were morally equivalent. Most would find the notion
laughable.
</P>
<P>
   What they do come away with is an awareness of moral ambiguity,
which is quite a different thing. The Cold War was full of
instances in which moral priorities competed with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Was it right, for example, for the CIA to subvert the 1948
Italian elections to prevent the kind of Communist takeover that
had occurred that year in Czechoslovakia?
</P>
<P>
   How, within the United States, did one balance the requirements
of internal security against those of civil liberties?
</P>
<P>
   Could one justify reliance on nuclear weapons to deter
aggression when the consequences of using them would have been far
worse?
</P>
<P>
   Should the West have risked war to prevent the erection of the
Berlin wall? Did Washington's fears that it might ``lose'' the Cold
War in the third world excuse all it did there?
</P>
<P>
   These are tough questions, but it is hardly moral equivalency to
raise them. It was precisely the inability of the ``other side'' to
confront similar issues that ultimately eroded whatever legitimacy
it had left in the Cold War. Taking morality seriously means posing
unsettling dilemmas, not providing smug and self-congratulatory
answers.

BAY STATE OFFICIAL TAKES ENVIRONMENTAL JOB IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE AND SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ David B. Struhs, the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection commissioner who once worked for President
Bush, is going back to work for the Bush family _ as chief
environmental aide to the former president's son, Jeb Bush, the new
governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Struhs, who had been happily settling in for another four years
running one of the state's most influential agencies, stunned DEP
employees Friday by announcing he was headed to Tallahassee next
month to become secretary of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Christmas and New Year's holiday, I got an
unexpected, out-of-the-blue, quite remarkable invitation to travel
to Florida for a few days and meet with then governor-elect Jeb
Bush,'' Struhs said in an interview from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was immediately taken by the size of the opportunity and
also impressed by their interest in trying to break the mold and
bring in some new ideas,'' Struhs said. Florida is pursuing a
massive restoration of the Everglades and a $3 billion open-space
protection program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Struhs served as chief of staff at the White House
Council on Environmental Quality under President Bush, he said he
had never met Jeb Bush and did not know anyone in the governor's
administration personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a call (from Jeb Bush) based on the
Massachusetts environmental management record. As far as I can
decipher here, it had absolutely nothing to do with my working in a
staff position in Washington'' for the governor's father, said
Struhs, a 38-year-old father of four.
</P>
<P>
   News of Struhs's departure came so suddenly that Beacon Hill
insiders were hard pressed to speculate on who might succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and environmental activists said two people who
were considered for environmental affairs secretary, former state
senator Lucile Hicks of Wayland and Boston attorney R.J. Lyman, who
ran the state's environmental review office, might be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Several current top DEP aides, including legal counsel Ralph
Childs and water resources chief Arleen O'Donnell, are also seen as
possible successors. The deputy director of the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority, Thomas B. Powers, formerly held top positions
at the DEP and could also be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci's administration has tapped several
former legislators and political operatives for administration
posts. But Jack Clarke, a top lobbyist for the Massachusetts
Audubon Society, said, ``We're hoping they'll put a lot of effort
into it and make it not a patronage position but an
environmental-professional position.''

IN THE POLITICS OF FILM AWARDS,   CANTANKEROUSNESS HAS A ROLE
</HEADLINE>
   (dw) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the winner was . . . ``Out of Sight''?
</P>
<P>
   A fair number of filmgoers must have scratched their heads when
the National Society of Film Critics picked the George Clooney and
Jennifer Lopez film, which disappeared virtually unseen soon after
opening last summer, as the best film of 1998 in voting on Sunday.
Its director, Steven Soderbergh, won for best director, and the
film also won for best screeplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is viewed as the year's likely awards
steamroller. And other films like ``Happiness,'' ``The Thin Red
Line,'' ``Affliction'' or ``Shakespeare in Love'' might seem more
likely critic's favorites.
</P>
<P>
   But both the nature of the National Society of Film Critics, a
famously contrarian bunch, and the convolutions of awards politics
can conspire to make the unconventional choice the conventional one
these days. As awards for such endeavors as films and books
continue to proliferate and take on wider commercial importance,
choices increasingly appear to be made on grounds that have as much
to do with politics and personalities as with merit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Out of Sight'' won less as the critics' favorite
movie and more as a compromise candidate favored by critics voting
against ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of critics feel they don't want to just second what
others have done,'' said Owen Glieberman, the lead film critic for
Entertainment Weekly and one of the 51 members of the film critics
society. ``They want to make some kind of statement of their own.
But it's a slippery slope. You shouldn't vote for something just
because it's popular, but you shouldn't vote against something
because it's popular either.''
</P>
<P>
   This award season already has seen its share of surprise
choices. In film, the New York Film Critics Circle raised eyebrows
by giving its best-actress award to Cameron Diaz for her role in
the popular gross-out movie ``There's Something about Mary.'' In
books, ``Charming Billy'' won the National Book Award for fiction,
which many people had already conceded to Tom Wolfe for his
much-ballyhooed ``A Man in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   All the surprises had their advocates, and ``Out of Sight''
received warm if not necessarily ecstatic reviews and turned up on
a smattering of critics' Top 10 lists for the year. But awards
today can reflect a broader agenda than just honoring superior
books or films, and they can mean millions of dollars for the
winners.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Ms. Diaz was seen by some as quirky populism and
by others as a reflection that the sexy Ms. Diaz would make a
better trophy guest at the awards dinner than the other main
contender, the 69-year-old Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro.
Others argued she just deserved to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges aren't operating in a vacuum,'' said Neil Gabler, the
author and cultural critic whose most recent book is ``Life The
Movie.'' ``They know when they're making a declaration, a contrary
act. In some ways, the process of giving awards is like everything
else in American life; it becomes a form of entertainment in
itself. When the awards create controversy, it's a way for a
seemingly nonentertainment institution like high literature to get
a piece of the entertainment swag. People may not care about
`Charming Billy,' but put it in competition with `A Man in Full,'
and you've got a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one need only view the Oscars, the most heavily
politicked award of them all, to remember that there was never a
time when awards were meted out for pure merit, whatever that might
be. Groups like the National Society of Film Critics, founded in
the late '60s as a hip, opinionated alternative to less adventurous
critics' groups, are in the business of dispensing prickly,
unexpected opinions. The film critics society consists mostly of
writers for large newspapers, major weekly magazines like Newsweek
and Time, and alternative weeklies like The Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   The group named ``Babe,'' the original charming sow movie, as
its film of the year a few years back, and, Gabler notes, its
members would probably feel like fools if they ever picked the same
best picture as the Oscars did.
</P>
<P>
   The awards of the film critics society tend to be skewed as well
by the nature of the publications represented, by the fact that
they are announced after the other critics' awards and by the open
voting, so everyone can see how everyone else votes.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group said that on Sunday, ``Out of Sight''
trailed both ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Affliction'' when the
critics cast their first votes. A film seldom gets the needed
plurality on the first vote, and subsequent rounds play out like a
demolition derby with voters as conscious of which film they don't
want to win as which one they do.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Out of Sight'' appeared to be the most likely film to
beat ``Saving Private Ryan,'' it attracted enough votes to win,
like the compromise candidate at a political convention. Some
critics simply were underwhelmed by ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Some
thought after being cited as best film by critics groups in Los
Angeles and New York, it had won enough awards and did not need any
more help in its march toward the Oscars. Others simply resented
the power and clout of Steven Spielberg, the movie's director, and
chose to cast a vote for a David rather than for Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people genuinely liked the film, even if it didn't
have the passionate support that some other films had,'' John
Anderson, a film critic for Newsday, said of ``Out of Sight.'' He
said he cast his first vote for the Japanese film ``Fireworks,''
and then switched to ``Out of Sight'' when it appeared the most
likely alternative to ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``If people resent Spielberg because he has every
resource in the world at his disposal and still ends up making
middlebrow movies, they'll want to use the award to give
recognition to someone else. If you accept the idea that these
critics' awards can have an impact on the Oscars, you want to throw
your support to something that won't get the recognition
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear that the award will do much for ``Out of
Sight,'' although one result is that the film is being re-released
in New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film's been dead for months,'' said Dave Kehr, a New York
critic most recently with The Daily News. ``It's not going to do
the movie any good. It's certainly not going to redeem it in the
eyes of the academy enough to get it a nomination. Maybe it will be
good for Soderbergh, who's more of a critics' darling than a
popular filmmaker. But I think the vote was mostly an honest
attempt to reward achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The makers of ``Out of Sight'' certainly hoped the award would
do them some good. Universal Studios immediately took out a
two-page color ad on the inside cover of the trade publication
``Variety,'' hoping to attract the attention of Oscar voters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there's a contrary mentality in the awards world, even
National Society members said that their group had a strong dose of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group has been the one to do it from way back,'' said Jay
Carr, film critic for The Boston Globe. ``We've voted for
`Drugstore Cowboy,' `Babe,' films no one else voted for. If you're
going to find a counter-Oscar mentality, this is the group to look
for it.''

IN DEBT REDUCTION MOVE, HYUNDAI GROUP   PLANS TO SELL 11
AFFILIATES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Bowing to pressure to bring its debt levels down from
stratospheric levels, the Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest
conglomerate, said Friday it would sell 11 of its affiliates in an
effort to raise more than $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai Group, which makes everything from cars to computer
chips, has been criticized for increasing its debt during South
Korea's economic crisis, which began more than a year ago. In the
first 11 months of 1998, as the Korean economy slid into an abyss
and many of Hyundai's core businesses declined dramatically, the
group's debt rose by $1.5 billion, to more than $36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Few details were immediately available about the planned
disposal of assets. Park Se Yong, the head of Hyundai's
restructuring activities, told reporters in Seoul today that the
companies to be sold have total assets of $16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., an arm of the group,
also plans to sell any of its operations that do not directly
relate to its core computer-chip business by the end of this year.
By doing so, the company hopes to raise money to finance its
purchase of the LG Semicon Co., its former chip-making rival, from
another Korean conglomerate, the LG Group.
</P>
<P>
   The two chip makers are merging as part of the so-called Big
Bang, the South Korean government's effort to reduce overcapacity
in its industries. The government is forcing the country's five
largest family-dominated conglomerates, called chaebol, to swap
businesses among themselves so that, for example, some emerge
dominant in automobile manufacturing while others become
high-technology giants.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of LG Semicon is expected to add some $3.8 billion
in debt to the Hyundai Group's financial obligations. The group's
purchase of the insolvent Kia Motors Corp. will increase its debt
by another $5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, LG and Korea's three other large conglomerates _
Samsung, Daewoo and SK _ so far have avoided the sweeping overhauls
forced on some of their smaller brethren by South Korea's economic
slump. They still have relatively free access to credit and tapped
the local bond markets regularly in 1998.

PARKER AND HUNTER GROOVING AT BIRDLAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By BEN RATLIFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Musicians mostly want to make music that feels stout,
with a sturdy glow, but sometimes they enjoy stripping the veneer
off themselves. From the drummer Leon Parker, we're used to this;
his hard slap on the snare and hypnotizing patterns on the ride
cymbal produce a stock-quality sound that swings yet seems almost
pre-jazz. From Charlie Hunter, we're not used to this at all.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's 10-string guitar usually is heard in his group pumping
out grooves for dancers, and he likes to make it seem as if it's
more than a guitar: he inflates it with a swelling vibrato effect,
as if it were an organ, and while he improvises he plays
simultaneous bass lines on the low strings.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them played together at Birdland on Thursday night as
part of a double bill with the singer Kurt Elling, announcing that
they had just made a recording for Blue Note. (The label is
blanketing the city's jazz clubs with its own artists this month in
honor of its 60th anniversary.)
</P>
<P>
   When they were grooving, in a shuffle or a montuno or a
slow-building wave of cymbal noise from Parker, they were at their
best. When they were being delicate, simple sometimes tipped over
into lackluster: a version of Brian Wilson's ``Don't Talk (Put Your
Head on My Shoulder),'' a clever choice of material, was played
absolutely straight, with no particular feeling, and ``You Don't
Know What Love Is'' featured some skillful but dry improvising.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hunter and Parker are jamming-oriented musicians with
renegade notions about jazz; one almost gets the sense that they'd
be better suited to performing one long song, or a suite of
interconnected rhythmic ideas, allowing themselves to ebb and flow.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Elling is an actor as much as a singer, and he comes almost
overprepared for a jazz show; he brings with him a beatnik-angel
persona and a ton of words. In front of an impressive trio _ the
pianist Laurence Hobgood, the bassist Essiet Essiet and the drummer
Lewis Nash _ he sang Wayne Shorter's ``Night Dreamer'' with his own
words, fitting one to each of the hundreds of notes Shorter had
sprayed out in his own version of the song.
</P>
<P>
   That was a piece he was performing last year; among the fresh
material was a performance of an Ishmael Reed poem stuck in the
middle of a racing Charlie Parker piece. Elling has excellent pitch
and breath control, and even in ballads he made his middle-range
voice bellow and crack without losing notes; it was good, battering
entertainment.

<P>
   MCI Worldcom Inc. Friday bowed out of the bidding to acquire
AirTouch Communications Corp., leaving Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Vodafone Group PLC to battle for ownership of the West Coast
wireless telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reviewing the possibility of a combination with AirTouch
Communications Inc., MCI WorldCom has determined not to pursue a
bid for the company at this time,'' MCI Worldcom said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom did not explain the reasons for its decision,
which, according to Bloomberg News, followed a verbal offer for the
San Francisco-based wireless carrier. AirTouch received a $54
billion offer from Vodafone this week after Bell Atlantic bid $43
billion. MCI's bid was less than Vodafone's, Bloomberg reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seemed to approve of MCI Worldcom's decision to exit
the fray. Its stock dropped 5 1/2 points before the announcement
helped it climbed back to close at 75, down 1/8 for the day. More
than 36 milion shares were traded Friday, _ triple its average
trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owning AirTouch just did not make sense for MCI Worldcom
because there was not much strategic value and to find the cost
savings to justify the high cost of the deal would be difficult,''
said Crispin Vicars, director of Yankee Group's wireless/mobile
communication planning service.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, Miss.-based MCI Worldcom, created through last year's
merger of MCI Communications and Worldcom, is the nation's second
largest long-distance company after AT&AMP;T, and it also provides
local phone and Internet services. But it owns no major mobile
telephone facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring AirTouch would require significant additional
investments before MCI Worldcom could effectively compete equally
with AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCs. Industry and Wall Street analysts agreed
that AirTouch would fit nicely with Bell Atlantic, which is looking
to expand its wireless operations nationwide to better compete
against AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, the large British-based wireless provider, with 9.1
million customers, primarily wants AirTouch for its European mobile
phone investments in Italy, Portugal, Germany, and Spain. Both
companies have joint ventures in Egypt and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch shares closed down 3 at 79. New York-based Bell
Atlantic gained 5/8 to close at 56 5/8. Vodafone's US-listed ADRs
slipped 3/8 to 17 3/8

ECONOMY PACKS ON NEW JOBS IN LAST MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The US economy capped a year of strong employment
growth by adding a spectacular 378,000 jobs last month and driving
the unemployment rate back down to a generation-low 4.3 percent,
the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 of the new jobs were the result of the last
month's abnormally warm weather that allowed building to continue
at a time when construction workers are usually laid off. But even
taking that into account, the economy has produced far more jobs
and proven far more resilent than almost anyone had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're into some new territory here, no question about it,''
said Paul E. Harrington, associate director of Northeasten
University's Center for Labor Market Studies.
</P>
<P>
   December's decline in the jobless rate from November's 4.4
percent matched the 28-year low reached last April, the
government's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. For the year,
unemployment average 4.5 percent, its lowest annual rate since
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the nation's ability to churn out new jobs
last year was especially striking given the Asian crisis that
dampened demand for US exports and drove down US manufacturing
employment. Overall, the economy added 2.9 million jobs in 1998,
down from 1997's 3.4 million level, but still a powerfully large
number. The fraction of Americans who work outside the home set a
record for the third year in a row at 64.1 percent, according to
BLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good numbers. They show the economy continues to be
strong,'' said Michael J. Montgomery, an economist with Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are deeply divided over how much longer the good times
can last. Despite being repeatedly contradicted by the economy's
sterling performance, most predict that growth will slow this year
and, with it, job creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a reluctant slowdown, but it's still going to
happen,'' predicted Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist of Fleet
Financial Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but for now the boom in jobs, output and investments
continues rolling along. The stock market climbed on news of the
new employment figures Friday, sending the Dow Jones industrial
average up 105.56, or 1.1 percent, to 9643.332, its first ever
close above the 9600 mark. Other market measures also hit new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the one dark spot in the latest figures was
manufacturing, where employment tumbled 13,000 in December bringing
the loss of factory jobs since March to 272,000. Traditionally,
such losses would have been considered a portent of coming
recession. But with the shift to services jobs in recent years,
they have seemed less and less important to the economy as a whole.
The government said that the manufacturing losses were offset by
the addition of 104,000 construction jobs and another 290,000
service positions.
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth year in a row, the economy created more new jobs
than it did new workers, a trend that analysts said has created
some othe highest job vacancy rates the country has ever
experienced. ``In some industries like bio-tech and software
development, there are 25 percent vacancy rates,'' said Harrington,
the Northeastern labor economist. ``There are a lot of unfilled
jobs out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the latest government figures show that labor
costs continue to rise only modestly. Workers' average hourly
earnings, a closely watched indicator of whether the economy is
overheating, rose only five cents, or 0.4 percent, in December to
$12.98, according to BLS.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate has been below 5 percent, a level
that most analysts thought until recently could not be sustained
without inflation, since June of 1997. During the recession of the
early 1990s, it was as high as 7.8 percent.

THOMPSON CITES MARITAL WOES, RESIGNS COACHING JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He probably didn't go out the way he would have
wanted. No, that's not true _ Georgetown coach John Thompson
departed Friday from basketball exactly as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps not as he would have hoped. Ask any coach and he'll
tell you he wants to resign after leading his team to victory in
the final game of any season.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen to Thompson. Friday he stepped down midway
through his 27th year at Georgetown, citing marital problems and
leaving behind a team mired in its worst Big East start (0-4) since
he took over as coach in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But most coaches know that retiring as a national champion is
about as rare as viewing lunar eclipses and cicadas on the same
day. So Thompson, 57, settled for what he surely wanted, what every
person in one of the most unpredictable and tenuous professions in
the working world wants.
</P>
<P>
   To leave at his own time and on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a former backup center with the Celtics, departed from
coaching after compiling a 596-239 mark at Georgetown _ which named
19-year assistant Craig Esherick, a former player under Thompson,
head coach, starting with Saturday's game against Providence _
Thompson's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 27 years, I was at Georgetown, working as hard as I
possibly could. I probably made far more mistakes than I ever had
success, because we attempted to do things,'' said Thompson,
flanked by many of his former players, including Patrick Ewing and
Alonzo Mourning. ``And any time you attempt to do things, you're
going to fail far more than you ever succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when you tabulate the record, don't worry about the
numbers. I did fail at more things than I ever succeeded at. But
the thing that is very important is that we tried. And in trying to
do those things, we tried to always emphasize to those students
that it was important for them to get an education.
</P>
<P>
   ``But any time a player's academics interfered with his ability
to go through Georgetown, we tried to stop him and let him deal
with what he had to deal with personally and privately pertaining
to his academics. So I had to follow my own advice. Basketball is a
24-hour job, a seven-day-a-week job, and I do not have the ability
at this time to address the things in my personal life and do my
job at the level of excellence I feel it should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach who intimidated many with his size and stature
struggled to fight back tears, as did many of his former players.
``I am going through a problem with my marriage right now,''
Thompson said. ``And I owe it to my family to address that, not
just to myself and to my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese, in a prepared statement,
called Thompson's resignation ``a huge loss for Georgetown and a
huge loss for the Big East. His contributions to the university and
college basketball are immense. I hope John feels he is making the
right decision for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson leaves behind a program he transformed from nondescript
status into one of the most prolific in college basketball in the
1980s, capturing the national championship in 1984 and finishing as
runner-up in 1982 and '85.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his program became a hallmark for academic
excellence: 97 percent of the Hoyas who stayed with the program
four years earned degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The dynasty has faded over the last few years. This season the
Hoyas are 7-6. Last year they had a 15-14 regular-season record and
were invited to the NIT in part because of their reputation, and in
recent years, some players have been the subject of ugly headlines.
Yet Thompson ranked 10th among active coaches in victories and is
considered one of the game's best teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries to prepare you for life,'' said Ewing, who added that
he and Thompson had talked about the resignation for a couple of
weeks and that the topic left him at a loss for words. ``He always
taught me how to grow, not only as a basketball player but as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown's success on and off the court drew enormous
attention to Thompson, and he used the spotlight to speak out on
various academic, social, and racial issues. Many of his
uncompromising stances drew Thompson favor and disfavor, and his
unrelenting control over his program and his players (particularly
regarding their relationship with the press) made the coach an
enigma to some and a pain in the neck to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you agreed with his stance on issues, I always
respected the fact that he stepped forward and expressed his
opinion,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``His opinion opened up
dialogue about issues that maybe would not have been discussed. As
a result, action was taken. We need more people like that. He is
not afraid to tell you what he thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach embraced the same traits on the way out the door
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I most proud of? Someone once told me I wore my
blackness well. I think that was the greatest compliment I ever
received,'' said Thompson, who made it clear he was resigning, not
retiring. He added he has not tired of the sport, nor has he tired
of coaching Generation X players.
</P>
<P>
   And he stated quite emphatically that his resignation has
nothing to do with health. ``I've got some boxing gloves in the
back and a ring if you want to go a couple of rounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson intends to remain at Georgetown in some unspecified
official capacity and struck down notions that he will pursue the
vacant Los Angeles Clippers coaching job now that the NBA lockout
has ended.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked about the Clippers job, Thompson shot
back, ``Some of you-all called out to the Clippers and asked them,
and didn't they tell you, `Hell, no'? It's not about that. If that
was something I was doing, I would tell you. When I was talking to
pro teams a few years ago, I told you. So how in the hell is a 6-10
black man going to sneak out to LA?''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he received a call from Temple coach John Chaney
suggesting that he take a sabbatical instead of resigning. ``I
said, `Do you ever lend somebody a toothbrush to use?' '' recalled
Thompson. ``It's either their toothbrush or your toothbrush. You
don't lend a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who during the preseason was enthusiastic about next
season's recruits, said he will be backstage to allow Esherick to
put his stamp on the program. Yet Esherick said not to expect him
to change much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be an absolute fool if I did anything different
basketballwise,'' said Esherick. ``I think what (Thompson) has done
has worked. We have been very successful, and I would be more than
an absolute fool if I didn't take what I learned and put it to
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning said he feels the program will be in good hands under
Esherick. But he said it will be difficult not seeing Thompson on
the sideline. ``This is definitely a decade of change. It was
similar to when Dean Smith retired,'' said Mourning. ``I was
shocked when I found out, but I'm pleased because he's going to get
some rest.''

HIGH COURT ACCEPTS CASES ON DISABILITY LAW AND FEDERALISM
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., N.J., Colo., Calif., Fla.)   (bl)  
By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking up an issue that could substantially extend
the reach of federal disability law, the Supreme Court on Friday
agreed to decide whether someone with a correctable condition, like
high blood pressure or nearsightedness, falls within the law's
protection against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The lower federal courts have been divided over whether to
assess a person's asserted disability with or without regard to any
``mitigating measures,'' as courts in these cases typically refer
to high blood pressure treatment or other medications, as well as
glasses and other devices that allow a person to function normally.
</P>
<P>
   While few of the millions of Americans who wear glasses face
discrimination on that account, the issue comes up in specialized
settings like the airline and trucking industries.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently eager to conduct a broad review, the justices Friday
took the relatively unusual step of accepting not just one case
with which to resolve the issue but also three cases, each with a
different twist.
</P>
<P>
   The court also announced Friday that it would take up an
important federalism issue, the question of whether Congress had
the constitutional authority, in a pair of laws enacted in 1992, to
open the federal courts to suits against states for patent and
trademark violations. This issue reached the court in a longrunning
dispute between the state of Florida and the College Savings Bank,
based in Princeton, N.J., over competing college savings investment
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans with Disabilities Act defines disability as an
``impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major
life activities'' or being ``regarded as'' having such an
impairment.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law bars discrimination against a person with a
disability who can perform a job with reasonable accommodation. But
the 1992 law does not specify whether the limitation itself, the
factor that brings a person within the law's protection in the
first place, should be judged with or without corrective measures.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the cases the court accepted Friday, identical twin
sisters, both nearsighted but with 20/20 vision or better when
wearing glasses, were turned down for jobs as pilots by United Air
Lines because their uncorrected vision did not meet the airline's
standard of 20/100. Both women, Karen Sutton and Kimberly Hinton,
fly as pilots for regional carriers.
</P>
<P>
   They sued the airline and lost, first in U.S. District Court in
Denver in 1996 and the next year in the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals, also in Denver. The appeals court said that because the
sisters' vision was correctable, their suit had no legal basis
because they did not suffer from a substantial limitation. The
appeal is Sutton vs. United Air Lines, No. 97-1943. United Air
Lines is a subsidiary of UAL Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, a mechanic for United Parcel Service, whose
job regularly required him to drive a truck, suffered from high
blood pressure that was controlled with medication. He sued after
the company dismissed him. He also lost in U.S. District Court in
Kansas City, Kan., and in the 10th Circuit, which ruled that his
normal functioning when taking his medication meant he was not
disabled. This case, Murphy vs. United Parcel Service, No. 97-1992,
raises the additional question of whether the plaintiff was
``regarded as'' disabled by the company, which would bring him
within the law whether he was disabled or not by some objective
standard.
</P>
<P>
   In the third case, Albertsons Inc. vs. Kirkingburg, No. 98-591,
the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, went the
other way and ruled that a truck driver with a vision impairment
might qualify as disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's position, as expressed in a brief filed
in December at the court's invitation, is that the existence of a
disability _ even a correctable vision impairment _ should be
assessed without regard to any mitigating measures. That was the
intent of Congress as well as the long-held view of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   The College Savings Bank cases the court accepted Friday, one a
patent infringement case and one a false advertising claim under
federal trademark law, bring the justices back to a potentially
far-reaching issue they last examined three years ago, the extent
of state immunity from suit in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 case, the court ruled that Congress lacked
constitutional authority to permit Indian tribes to sue states in
disputes over setting up casinos. That decision, Seminole Tribe vs.
Florida, was issued as the College Savings Bank was in the midst of
suing Florida on charges that the state's program of offering a
savings plan for college costs was an illegitimate copy of the
program the private bank initiated in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Florida moved to dismiss the bank's two lawsuits,
claiming immunity from suit.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the trademark case was dismissed but the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled last year that the College
Savings Bank was entitled to protect its ``property'' _ its patent
on its investment plan _ by pursuing its lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, backed by 24 other states, is arguing that the federal
law authorizing a patent infringement suit against a state is
unconstitutional. The case is Florida vs. College Savings Bank, No.
98-531. The trademark case, which the court also accepted, is
College Savings Bank vs. Florida, No. 98-149.

EURO'S FIRST WEEK GOES SMOOTHLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT _ Except for a few minor procedural glitches, the euro
finished its first week as Europe's new single currency with
remarkable smoothness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost boring, really,'' remarked James O'Neill, currency
strategist at Goldman, Sachs in London. ``For all the great
excitement that built up ahead of the euro, it turned out to be a
little bit of a damp squid.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was just fine for the central bankers and political
leaders who launched the euro on New Year's Day. If the euro did
not jump in value, as some had hoped, it did not fall much either.
</P>
<P>
   And by Friday, traders were confident that the overwhelming
technical conversion of computers and trading systems had indeed
been a success. The electronic settlement systems that clear
transactions between banks, brokerage firms and institutional
investors were generally proceeding properly.
</P>
<P>
   After jumping modestly against the dollar and most other
currencies on Monday, the euro slipped and ended the week slightly
below its starting price against the dollar _ $1.15540 vs.
$1.16675.
</P>
<P>
   Those movements seemed within the range expected by Wim
Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank. In the days
leading up to the euro's launch, European currencies showed signs
of being uncomfortably strong against the dollar, which raised
concerns that European exports might weaken if they became too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting of the bank's governing council on Thursday,
Duisenberg made it clear he was pleased with the euro and saw no
need to cut interest rates to bring down its value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any tendencies that could force us to change
rates,'' Duisenberg said. ``There is no bias any longer in any
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   European stock markets climbed sharply, finishing the week about
8 percent higher than they had started. Optimism about the euro,
and relief at a seemingly smooth launch, provided part of the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real surprise was the strength of the European stock
markets,'' said David Bowers, an equity strategist for Merrill
Lynch in London.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip European stocks were among the biggest winners as
institutional investors began lining up their portfolios with
Europe-wide stock indices.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, at least three Europe-wide stock indices are in
competition as standard reference points. Those are the Dow Jones
EuroStoxx 50, the Financial Times' FTSE International and the
Morgan Stanley Capital International indices.
</P>
<P>
   In a study by Merrill Lynch, the 28 stocks listed on all three
of those charts outperformed the broader indices by about two
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move into blue-chip stocks is clearly one of the
consequences of the euro,'' said Joachim Fels, senior economist at
Morgan Stanley. ``Most of the investors are now targeting euroland
benchmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors remained cautious throughout the week, with trading
volumes still low in both currency markets and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and traders reported few technical problems, none
of them major. Some banks had trouble settling money transfers.
Peter Wolf-Koeppen, head of Commerzbank's euro conversion efforts
in Frankfurt, said some banks had not clearly specified to their
counterparts the specific method, among several possibilities, they
wanted to use for settling transfers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are several systems for clearing interbank transfers. The
European Central Bank has established a new clearing system called
Target. But banks can also use a system set up by the European
Banking Association as well as a third system in Frankfurt that has
long been used by German banks and their counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg called these minor glitches ``teething troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question will be how the European Central Bank and
European governments come to grips with the divergent economic
problems around the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which accounts for about one-quarter of the euro-zone's
economic output, is getting more bad news every day. Germany's
double-digit unemployment, which had finally begun to decline
slightly, jumped from 10.2 to 10.9 in December.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many economists have slashed their forecasts for
economic growth from nearly 3 percent in 1998 to less than 2
percent in 1999. The Deutsche Institute fur Wirtschaft, one of the
independent economic research organizations that advise the German
government, cut its prediction this week to just 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under other circumstances, that might prompt central bankers to
cut interest rates and inject more money into the economy. But
countries such as Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Finland are all
growing at much faster rates. For those countries, an additional
rate cut could re-ignite inflationary pressures.

 &HT;    Senate agreement to advance trial relays `sense of relief,'
camaraderie
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators hailed their unanimous agreement Friday to
move ahead with President Clinton's impeachment trial as the latest
example of the camaraderie that distinguishes the Senate from the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   They generously ladled out praise for their colleagues in the
other party, spoke of mutual trust and talked about the importance
of acting in the nation's interest on this grave matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the hurdle that they surmounted Friday was not terribly
high. And the roll call vote Friday afternoon that drew 100
``ayes'' does not preclude a furious fight in two weeks time over
the same issue that has continued to elude resolution, the calling
of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Senate decided, as it often does, that there is no
reason to argue today over what can be argued tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we've got 100 happy campers,'' Sen. Slade Gorton
(R-Wash.) said. ``We probably won't after we start the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), a new senator and a veteran of
the partisan wars in the House, said he was pleased with the
outcome. But he was less certain that it represented a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sort of timetable agreement that puts off the major
confrontation. We'll start the process and see if there can be some
kind of arrangement,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that emerged from Friday's closed-door session in the
old Senate chamber grew out of a realization that Senate rules
would not allow Democrats to foreclose the possibility that
witnesses could be called to testify in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats will retain the right to move to dismiss the
charges against Clinton after just a handful of days of
presentation by Republican House prosecutors and the president's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, many Republicans in the Senate are not eager to
have Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie, Vernon Jordan and Kathleen
Willey, among other potential witnesses identified by House
Republicans, troop through their work place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big concern on everyone's part is that there is no need to
turn this into a circus, that we not have evidence that refers to
the sexual materials,'' Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) said.
</P>
<P>
   What made the agreement so unusual is that it came during a rare
meeting of all 100 senators in the chamber that was the Senate's
home until 1858, not as a result of an impromptu huddle of a few
key senators or an exchange of telephone calls by senior aides.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said the consecutive presentations by one of
the Senate's most conservative members, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas),
and one of its most liberal, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), made
them take note that, other than the witness dispute, there was
little that separated Democrats from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the document that was read on the Senate floor gives
each side three days to present its case, rather than the two days
a piece that the Democrats proposed.
</P>
<P>
   After Gramm and Kennedy spoke, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)
said, ``Everyone sort of smiled and said, 'What are arguing
over?'''
</P>
<P>
   More important than the details, senators said, were the candid,
respectful exchanges that made compromise more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is the body language in people and the
sincerity of what they're saying. That's what this kind of thing
allowed us to do,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) spoke about the Senate's history of
consensus, particularly at difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded us that on certain occasions that people are
required to rise above the ordinary course of conduct ... and this
is one of those moments. He set the tone,'' Sen. Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.) said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, several senators expressed a growing concern
that they were beginning to look like House members who engaged in
openly hostile, sometimes insulting public exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   They feared the public would view the Senate's proceedings with
the same distaste. Their concerns flowed as much from the potential
public reaction as from the belief that is universal in the Senate
that it is a less confrontational body than the House and better
able to keep partisan politics and emotions in check.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Friday's meeting produced a ``sense of relief,''
Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like the top of a boiling pot coming off and all
the little bubbles simmering down,'' Frist said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.) said he and his colleagues recoiled
at ``the idea that the Senate would degenerate into a pit bull
ring.''

MIDSEASON OFFERS FROM THE WB AND UPN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel &AMP; Spa here
is again the setting for TV's ritual re-enactment of ``Crime and
Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime: An uninspiring fall season. The punishment: Two weeks
in a hotel with producers, stars and network executives who promise
to do better with their midseason replacements.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it beats having to undergo dental surgery. And what better
way to begin than with a tale of two networks going in opposite
directions?
</P>
<P>
   At The WB, smiles are broad and thumbs are up as critical
acclaim and rising viewership make it easy for CEO Jamie Kellner to
repeat something he said four years ago: ``Is there room for six
networks? The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that there are now seven, if you count Pax TV. At
UPN, where CEO Dean Valentine has watched viewership plummet by
almost half this season, the rebuttal to Kellner was defiant and
predictable: ``UPN will be here way past the time that these
conferences in Pasadena are here.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN is pinning its hopes on an animated version of the comic
strip ``Dilbert'' (premiering Jan. 25), even though another of its
animated entries, ``Home Movies'' (April 26), might be funnier.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a glut of prime-time animation projects is the most
noticeable trend this midseason as producers try to divine what it
is that viewers want. More on that in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some early observations from Pasadena:
</P>
<P>
   _ At The WB, where crossing over from TV to feature films is
standard procedure for the network's photogenic young hotties,
people still wonder about the private lives of movie stars. So,
sometime this spring, The WB will give a trial run to _ ta da! _
``Movie Stars,'' a comedy that claims to have an insider's view.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hamlin (``L.A. Law'') and Jennifer Grant (``Beverly Hills,
90210'') play Reese Hardin and Jacey Wyatt, a Hollywood power
couple whose Malibu property is also home to three kids, Reese's
Juilliard-trained but unemployed brother and Jacey's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had to audition for a part, Grant seems a natural:
She's the daughter of Dyan Cannon and the late Cary Grant. But the
idea of acting scared her at first _ still does _ so she went to
Stanford and planned to become a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing she had no passion for the bar, she tried other
avenues after graduation _ cooking at Spago, working for an
advocacy firm _ until a friend suggested she take acting lessons.
Acutely aware of her parents' genes, Grant said: ``I was afraid of
following in their footsteps.'' But after a few classes, she knew
she'd found herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally felt my whole body kind of settle,'' she said, ``and
I thought, `This is what I want to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Urich, Capt. Jim Kennedy III on UPN's ``Love Boat: The
Next Wave,'' says he's never had the good fortune to be on a
long-running series. Still, his face is one of the most familiar on
TV. His reason: ``I've taken just about everything I've been
offered.''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Urich added: ``I guess I have a certain ability
that works on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Urich, who survived a battle with a rare type of cancer, says
his health is excellent, aside from a lack of sleep since the birth
of a daughter eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ It started out as ``Zoe Bean,'' but now it's ``Zoe, Duncan,
Jack &AMP; Jane'' to reflect the ``ensemble'' nature. The WB would love
it if viewers think of it as ``Seinfeld, the Early Years'' or
``Friends, Before They Got Nice Apartments,'' and executives hope
it brings to a half-hour comedy the sensibility that critics have
admired in some of The WB's dramas, specifically, ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the ``ZDJ&AMP;J'' ensemble, while purporting to reflect
reality, skews it to fit the common TV network perception of same.
Thus, we have four white teens (real ages: 17, 24, 26 and 26)
living in melting-pot Manhattan where their encounters with people
of color set up the uncomfortable conclusion perpetuated for years
on ``Seinfeld'' and ``Friends,'' that is, that white people are
normal and non-whites aren't.
</P>
<P>
   The WB, already considered the little network that could, would
take a giant leap forward by flouting such a pernicious convention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heartthrob emeritus Greg Evigan (remember ``B.J. and the
Bear,'' ``My Two Dads''?) is another survivor who always seems to
get work. Evigan returns to the sitcom format in a UPN series
called ``Family Rules,'' in which he plays the single parent _
there's a unique concept _ of four teenage girls.
</P>
<P>
   Though a prime-time series (premiering March 9), ``Family
Rules'' has the juvenile look and feel of Saturday morning fare.
(Think ``Saved by the Bell'' without Screech.) Creator Russell
Marcus, who admits the premise isn't exactly original, is banking
on the different levels of maturity in males and females.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a study they've done where 40-year-old guys actually
think of themselves as 28 to 32, and 17-year-old girls think of
themselves as 25. So, essentially,'' he said, ``we have a household
run by 27-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   And people say TV is running out of fresh and funny ideas ...

SPY, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OPPOSED TO REDUCTION OF POLLARD
SENTENCE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement and intelligence officials said
Friday that they remain adamantly opposed to shortening the life
sentence of Jonathan Pollard, a former Navy intelligence analyst
convicted of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the White House asked the agencies to submit their
recommendations on whether Pollard should be granted clemency after
demands for his release were made by Israel in October at the
Middle East peace negotiations in Wye, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But the agencies' opposition to granting Pollard leniency, which
has never wavered during Clinton's presidency, may not end the
debate over the case, the officials said. The president has
exclusive power to grant clemency, and the officials said Clinton's
aides could seek to reduce Pollard's sentence or give him a release
date from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and the Justice Department have yet to
submit their views, and officials said that Clinton and his aides
are not likely to make a decision soon. The officials said that
while they agree that Pollard's crimes are ``reprehensible,'' as
several described them, not all are convinced that Pollard should
never be released.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies have until Monday to provide their evaluations to
Charles Ruff, the White House counsel. Last month the White House
sent letters to Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, asking for their
views on the Pollard case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have begun to receive recommendations from the president's
advisers,'' said David Leavy, a White House spokesman. ``The
president will review the information. He may want further
information. He may ask additional questions and will move forward
in a careful and timely manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy pressure from Israel and supporters of Pollard in
the United States, Clinton reviewed the case in 1993 and again in
1996. Each time, the president decided against clemency after
receiving recommendations from Cabinet officials and agencies
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the officials have long been on record as opposing
clemency for Pollard. During the peace talks in October, Tenet
bluntly told Clinton that he would resign if the president agreed
to turn over Pollard as part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the other U.S. intelligence agencies are known to be
strongly opposed to any consideration of leniency toward Pollard.
They have said in the past that his spying inflicted the gravest
damage to national security by revealing secret codes and
communications methods, endangering the ability of intelligence
officers to communicate and gather information in secret.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, conservatives have championed the release of Pollard
for years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has pressed
the administration for Pollard's release and the case became a
central issue in the peace talks. On the last of nine days of
negotiations, Netanyahu demanded Pollard's release in exchange for
his support for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton denied Netanyahu's demands, he did agree to
reconsider the case even though there was little likelihood that
any of the agencies involved would support a reduction in Pollard's
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was arrested in 1985 after spying for Israel for at
least 18 months. He turned over a huge quantity of classified
documents to the Israelis. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material Pollard sold to the Israelis involved
Soviet weapons systems, information that had been obtained at
enormous risk by spies working inside the former Soviet Union, who
were compromised as a result of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard argued that he was punished too severely because he was
spying for an ally that should have been given the information that
Washington had withheld. But U.S. officials said he had betrayed
vital secrets to the Israelis, who, they said, had never fully
cooperated with investigators or even returned all of the documents
Pollard supplied them.

   COLD WAR REEFER
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, CNN will begin broadcasting the second half of
its 24-part documentary series ``Cold War.'' The first half has
already brought several angry critiques from historians and

EX-SOVIET FOE OF US GIVEN ADVISORY ROLE AT UN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move that is likely to increase Russia's
influence in the United Nations, Secretary General Kofi Annan has
appointed a senior Russian official _ and former US Cold War
adversary _ to serve as his diplomatic troubleshooter.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Yuli M. Vorontsov, Russia's outgoing
ambassador to Washington, has generated anxiety among US officials,
already upset with Annan over leaks about US espionage in Iraq
under UN auspices.
</P>
<P>
   Vorontsov has been an adept diplomatic foe of Washington in
Afghanistan and during the end of the Cold War _ emerging later as
an adversary over conflicting US-Russian policies in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials sought to portray the appointment as one not
designed to rankle Washington, but US officials reacted
suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the consummate survivor in the old Soviet system,'' a
US official who has tracked Vorontsov said Friday. ``Whether that
is the sort of person we want in the United Nations Secretariat is
a fair question.''
</P>
<P>
   UN officals insisted Friday that there is nothing unusual in the
appointment. Secretary Generals have always enlisted the services
of prominent diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Former US secretaries of state Cyrus Vance and James Baker have
served as diplomatic envoys for the United Nations from the Balkans
to Western Sahara. Many of Annan's current diplomatic
troubleshooters, including the current UN-East Timor mediator,
Jamsheed Marker of Pakistan, have previously served as an
ambassador at UN headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Vorontsov, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations from 1990
to 1994 has accepted the post for a token annual salary of a
dollar. He will hold the rank of undersecretary general, carrying
out diplomatic missions for the UN chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an old pro and he was at the UN for many years.'' the
Amerian official said. ``So he is certanly qualified, but he's an
old Soviet.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian specialists say Vorontsov could actually be a
conciliatory influence for relations between the United States and
the United Nations, which have degenerated to their worst state
since Annan came to office two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vorontsov, a close ally of Russia's former spymaster, current
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, has headed key Russian embassies
in France, India, and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Vorontsov will place witin Annan's inner circle
another advocate of softening the UN's policy on Iraq. Annan's
closest closest advisers have already pressed the UN secratary
general to ease economic sanctions on Iraq and weaken the
international weapons inspection team responsible for ridding Iraq
of its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say that Vorontsov may prove useful to the United
States, which is seeking to smooth relations with Moscow over
Washington's disision to launch air strikes gainst Iraq without
Russian backing.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Laurenti, an analyst at the United Nations Association,
said while Vorontsov often has clashed with the Americans in the
past he has also worked with the United Nations during the most
cooperative period of US-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it may advantageous to have Russia play a more
active role in conflict resolution, as long as it doesn't involve a
part of the world where Washington and Moscow are at loggerheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving him an assignment in Iraq or Yugoslavia would be
damaging to Washington's trust,'' he said. ``But it is not an
inherently bad thing to keep the Russians engaged in a constructive
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cohen, a Russian Studies professor at New York
University, said Verontsov is among the more pro-Western diplomats
in the Russian foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian Foreign Ministry is divided between those who are
suspicious of the West,'' Cohen said. `` And there are those
Russians who feel Russia's destiny is in the West. Vorontsov would
be among those people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is going to be a Russian in that position,'' he
added, ``It's hard to imagine anyone we would prefer over him.''

CHINA'S PIGEONS PERCH ON PEDESTAL, NOT JUST STATUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In New York it might have seemed like a mysterious
blessing, but here it was regarded as a most malignant curse.
</P>
<P>
   Recently 118 pigeons that made their home in a public plaza
outside a gleaming glass shopping mall suddenly became listless and
died.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy and later investigation concluded that the victims
had been killed with rat poison. Pellets of the stuff were found in
the grassy plot where the birds once pecked and cooed, although the
killer and his motive remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The shocking news was instant grist for front-page headlines in
Beijing's major newspapers and trumpeted on the evening news. Ever
since, generally fractious Beijingers _ not known for their
kindness to one another _ have selflessly rallied in support of the
birds in a period of outraged mourning.
</P>
<P>
   High school students have biked into town to give their pocket
money to a memorial fund. Old men have offered their pet pigeons as
replacements. The owner of a feed company turned up at the shopping
center with two bags of seeds for the 600 surviving birds. The
deputy general manager of an environmental engineering company
offered free ``environmentally friendly'' cremation for the
deceased, including a large cake frosted with the image of a
pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Modern Plaza, the shopping mall, have been besieged
by so many offers of memorial plaques and statuettes that they are
still deliberating how to commemorate the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about Beijingers and their birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have come to express their concern and offer help,
which has been a great source of moral support to me,'' said Wei
Guangsheng, owner of Beijing Happy Wings Co., Pigeon Technology and
Service Center, which specializes in providing birds for public
places and had originally placed the birds that died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very hard time,'' he said, tossing mung beans
to the remaining strutting, whirring members of the flock,
indistinguishable from their reviled brethren in New York's Central
Park. ``But on the bright side, this whole weird incident shows how
much Beijing people love these little creatures and how far they
are willing to go for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to capture what Wei called the ``intimate''
relationship between Beijingers and their feathered friends. The
pets of choice in urban China, birds are to Beijing people what lap
dogs are to French matriarchs, at once an extension of persona and
an object of lavish attention. But it is more mystical than that.
Birds are to Beijingers what cows are to Hindus _ creatures that
command near godlike respect.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's parks are filled with old men carefully carrying blue
covered cages _ out for a walk with their birds. The city's old
neighborhoods seem to reverberate with an odd humming sound, made
by tiny whistles tied to pet pigeon's legs. High-rise apartment
balconies are given over to pigeon cages. New Yorkers may call them
rats with wings, but here they are treasured friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pigeons are the animals closest to human,'' Shao Hean, general
director of the An Shi pigeon breeding farm, told Beijing Evening
News as he announced that he would replace the 118 dead birds free
of charge. ``They are an expression of the bond and harmony between
nature and civilization and humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wei Hongbin, a trendy 20-year-old in a red ski jacket, jeans and
cowboy boots, shook his head in disbelief at the killings as he
parked his mountain bike alongside Modern Plaza to contemplate the
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese have a good feeling toward birds, and in some of
the old courtyard neighborhoods half of the households raise them _
it's part of Beijing tradition,'' he said, noting that he himself
had 12. ``These birds deserve a memorial. I can't imagine what kind
of person would have hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is easier to get sentimental about pigeons in a
city where few roam free and where the only ``public pigeons,'' as
they are called, are the result of meticulously planned releases
into a handful of parks and malls over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The pigeons at Modern Plaza, for example, each receive three to
six months of training. And special workers have been appointed to
deal with guano.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to become like Trafalgar Square,'' said Wei,
owner of Happy Wings. ``In America, they are dirty. Here it is
different: They are a symbol of peace.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although raising birds has long been popular in China, it was
banned for many years as a bourgeois pastime, decadent and
wasteful. But in the last two decades, bird breeding has rapidly
re-emerged, reinforced by the fact that urban Chinese generally
have neither the space nor the money to support larger pets.
Anyway, in Beijing, all but tiny dogs are still illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pigeon raising is becoming more popular every year since it is
so good for you and Chinese are becoming more conscious of their
emotional selves,'' said Zhou Zujie, 66, a former president of the
Chinese Homing Pigeon Association.
</P>
<P>
   But public pigeons have been slower to catch on, often meeting
with a ``not in my back yard'' attitude. In the late 1980s, the
city government proposed releasing pigeons in Tiananmen Square. The
plan was shot down by the central government for fear the birds
would defile nearby structures, from the Great Hall of the People
to the Mao Mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
   When Wei, a former advertising man, introduced pigeons to Modern
Plaza in 1996, there were other glitches. In this country rife with
contradictions, pigeons are at once revered _ and eaten. Several
dozen of Wei's earliest releasees were captured and ended up as
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the square first opened people didn't understand the
value and importance of the little creatures,'' he said with a sad
shrug.
</P>
<P>
   The birds at Modern Plaza are carefully trained not to stray
from the grounds of the shopping mall. By means of secret methods
that incorporate a whirring call and pigeon food, they learn to fly
in spirals from the top of the shopping center to a fenced-in area
of the parking lot and back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while you develop a close personal relationship with
the birds and they obey your commands,'' Wei said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact these birds have established a close personal
relationship with all people, as you see here,'' he added, pointing
to the perpetual crowd of bystanders who were cementing the
relationship with mung beans and seeds. ``So they are not likely to
stray.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent frigid afternoon, the crowd included Dong Zhenli, a
30-year-old kindergarten teacher who had brought her 3-year-old
daughter all the way across Beijing to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very sad that the birds died,'' Ms. Dong said. ``The
poisoning was totally disgusting and immoral.''

PENTAGON SAYS IRAQ BOMBINGS CAUSED MORE DAMAGE THAN REPORTED
EARLIER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost three weeks after the bombing stopped, the
Pentagon's senior commanders said Friday that the U.S. and British
raids on Iraq had caused more damage than initially reported.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
and the commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen. Anthony
Zinni, described President Saddam Hussein as isolated and
desperate, and less able to build missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The generals said they based their assessments on intelligence
information that went beyond aerial or satellite photographs of the
damage done in four nights of air and missile strikes. But they
offered little detail and even less evidence to support their
conclusions, which, they conceded, were based on incomplete and, in
some cases, unverifiable reports.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, the senior military adviser to President Clinton and
Defense Secretary William Cohen, said for the first time Friday
that the raids had killed ``several key individuals'' in the Iraqi
military hierarchy. He declined to elaborate or name the officials.
</P>
<P>
   He also said unconfirmed intelligence reports suggested that the
raids had killed 600 to 1,600 members of the Republican Guard,
troops that Saddam uses to maintain internal control. Although the
guard has 30,000 troops, Shelton said, the casualties would
undercut Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost a lot,'' Shelton said at a breakfast meeting with
reporters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In separate briefings, they also cited reports of summary
executions in Iraq as signs that Saddam's control had been shaken.
</P>
<P>
   The updated and upbeat assessments came in the wake of Iraq's
renewed defiance of the United Nations and the U.S. and British
enforcement of ``no flight'' zones over much of Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
   Four times in the last two weeks Iraqi warplanes or
anti-aircraft have challenged U.S. or British planes, proving that
four nights of strikes had not stopped Saddam from being an
irritant, at the least, to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, said
in an interview Friday that Saddam was ``flailing,'' having counted
on but not received support from the Arab world. He cited Saddam's
vitriolic attacks on Arab leaders in a speech Tuesday and the
equally pointed reaction since then from those leaders, including
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military purpose of the strike was not to bring down his
government,'' Berger said, ``but I think it has weakened it,
politically as well as militarily.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Friday, Zinni said new information now showed
that the attacks on Iraq's military and industrial infrastructure
had caused ``far more severe'' damage than first thought. He and
other officials had initially estimated that Iraq's missile
development had been set back one year by the strikes; Friday he
said it might be two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to sketchy new reports on damage inflicted inside the
buildings struck, he said ``unique pieces of equipment'' involved
in making missiles, like metal presses and test stands, had been
destroyed. He said that Iraq may not have been able to protect as
much equipment as he and other commanders expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look deeper and we have more detail, reports on our
intelligence and other means that verify this, we're seeing that
the effectiveness was even greater than we first thought,'' Zinni
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and Zinni also cited unconfirmed reports suggesting
internal dissent inside Iraq, if not rebellion. That suggested,
they said, an erosion of Saddam's control. They said Saddam had
reportedly ordered the execution of army officers and civilians in
the south, where Shiite Muslims have long chafed under Saddam's
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a number of unusual things internally that I think
clearly demonstrate that he was shaken and the regime was shaken,''
Zinni said. ``We have seen executions in the South; one division in
particular lost its commander and several others.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these signs, there has been no reports of significant
dissent since the bombing. Nor have there been any uprisings on the
level of those that followed Saddam's rout in the Persian Gulf war.
Back then Saddam, though reeling, crushed rebellions by Kurds in
the north and Shiites in the south. The United States and its
allies created the ``no flight'' zones afterwards to help protect
the ethnic populations in those regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to assume the house of cards is about to
crumble,'' an intelligence official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also increased its forces in the gulf for the
first time since last month's raids. Zinni announced that eight
more F-16 fighters would go to the region. The jets, along with
four aerial tankers, will joint 182 aircraft jets already there,
mostly in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and aboard the aircraft carrier
Carl Vinson.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 jets carry radar-seeking missiles, called HARMs, which
are designed to attack surface-to-air missile launchers and other
anti-aircraft weapons, like those that have threatened U.S. and
British jets patroling the ``no flight'' zones over southern and
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Britain also announced that it would dispatch an aircraft
carrier, the Invincible, and it would set sail for the gulf on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have not ruled out launching new
attacks.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although prices of junk bonds, have risen since their tumble
late last summer, it still costs less to buy mutual funds that hold
this high-risk, high-return corporate debt than at any time since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   With junk bonds yielding surpassing 10 percent, Martin Fridson,
chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch, reported that as of
Dec. 31, yields were a stunning 5.55 percentage points higher for
junk bonds than for comparable 10-year Treasury notes. That is down
from a spread of 6.2 percentage points on Oct. 31, but still far
above the 3.73-point spread of late July.
</P>
<P>
   Junk bonds can give a portfolio diversity and extra income, but
they are riskier than other commonly traded securities _ and that
makes picking the right fund paramount. And given the typical
$25,000 price tag for an individual holding, as well as the
difficulties in assessing credit quality, funds are the way to go
for most individual investors who are interested in junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a fund, an investor should look first at how long it
has been around. The relatively strong performance of high-yield
securities for much of this decade has prompted a host of new
funds: Nearly 40 percent of the high-yield funds tracked by
Morningstar are no more than three years old.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. Barnes, a certified financial planner in Phoenix,
prefers funds with track records of at least five years so he can
gauge whether a fund's management team has been true to its stated
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   He steers a lot of clients, all of them affluent, into Northeast
Investors, which began in 1950. Northeast, which has returned 10.35
percent over the last five years, did not have a superb 1998 _ it
lost 0.24 percent _ but Barnes is not concerned. ``They've been
around forever with the same basic philosophy,'' he said. ``We are
comfortable there are not going to be any surprises with their
investment style.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Chung, a Morningstar analyst, recommends that investors
buy a fund only if it has a good long-term record and has had the
same manager or management team in place for more than six months.
If management has changed recently, the fund may no longer be
operating in the way ``that created the good long-term record,''
Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to test a manager is to see how he or she has done
when the market goes awry, he added. Last year afforded a perfect
opportunity: In the first half, the average junk fund was up 4.62
percent. Then in summer and fall, Russia went into default, the
Long Term Capital Management hedge fund had to be rescued and
President Clinton's troubles deepened; institutional investors
quickly shed risky assets and fled to the safety of Treasuries. The
high-yield market tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Funds that did relatively well in this bearish period are worth
a look. The average high-yield fund lost 10.07 percent from Aug. 1
to Oct. 31, according to Morningstar. But Columbia High-Yield, for
example, a five-year-old fund with about $57 million in assets,
lost 2.73 percent in that period and ended 1998 with a return of
6.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Credit quality is another factor. Dreyfus High Yield, which
ended 1997 in the top 6 percent of all high-yield funds, stumbled
badly, losing 23.89 percent, from Aug. 1 until Oct. 31, 1998, and
ended the year down 15.84 percent. More than a third of Dreyfus
High Yield's assets were in securities with credit ratings of B or
below, said Sarah Bush, a Morningstar analyst. That contrasts with
about 7 percent for the average high-yield fund, Ms. Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, a fund with higher-quality junk bonds will have an
average credit rating of BB; a fund with lower-quality junk bonds
will have an average rating of B. In choosing a fund, investors
should consider how much risk they are willing to assume. A fund
like Vanguard High-Yield Corporate, with an average credit rating
of BB, tends not to be hit as hard when the high-yield market
stumbles, Chung said. It lost only 1.54 percent in the
third-quarter down market. On the other hand, ``they don't capture
as much of the up side as some of the more aggressively positioned
funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is how much the fund holds in other types
of securities, like convertible bonds or emerging-markets debt. An
investor who already owns an emerging-markets debt fund would
probably want to steer clear of a junk-bond fund heavily invested
in these securities.
</P>
<P>
   Most junk-bond funds are allowed to invest up to 25 percent of
their assets in emerging-markets debt. One clue as to whether a
fund has such holdings can be performance: Funds that did badly in
the late summer may have been holding more than the average amount
of emerging-markets debt, Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds complicated, it is, but making the effort to
sort it out can pay off. ``A high-yield subportfolio will typically
add value over time,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   If economic growth is moderate this year, investors in junk
bonds can at the very least count on receiving interest payments
from their investments, which would leave them with a total return
of about 10 percent to 12 percent, says Peter Anderson, manager of
Conseco High Yield, a year-old $45 million mutual fund based in
Carmel, Ind. The fund returned 6.55 percent in 1998.

GOP SENATORS WALK A TRICKY POLITICAL TIGHTROPE DURING IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Senate Republicans are trying to avoid the
partisan slugfest that characterized the House impeachment
proceedings against President Clinton, it may be because they
understand political math.
</P>
<P>
   The risks of proceeding with a lengthy and messy impeachment
trial are particularly great for the Republicans in the Senate
because they must defend 19 seats in the 2000 election as compared
to 14 for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Further exacerbating matters for the GOP, 13 of the seats they
must defend are in states that Clinton carried in 1996, including
Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 55-45 margin majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP senators walk a trickier political tightrope than their
House counterparts, who represent districts that are often
overwhelmingly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   To retain the seats in Democrat-leaning states, Republican
senators must carry the bulk of the independent swing voters who
polls have consistently shown do not want the president ousted.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the lawmakers must be careful not to offend
the party's increasingly conservative base, which is clamoring for
the president's ouster and could make trouble for Republican
candidates in a primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do let the guy off too easy, their base just goes
ballistic,'' said Charles Cook, a Washington-based political
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others added that a prolonged Senate trial could
merely reinforce increasingly negative perceptions of the GOP among
independent voters and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Polls found that during the rancorous House proceedings, voter
approval ratings of congressional Republicans plummeted to their
lowest levels in years.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that if the Senate repeats the House
experience, voters may conclude that the party has no other agenda
than ousting the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem the party has, it is perceived with a negative
agenda. It is not perceived as a party that comes up with solutions
that confront the problems of the nation,`` said Terry Madonna, a
political science professor at Millersville University in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna said Pennsylvanians will be watching Sen. Rick Santorum,
who was elected in the Republican tidal wave of 1994 but who is
considered more conservative than most of the state's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna said the risk for Santorum is that a vote to convict
Clinton would make it easier for Democrats to portray the senator
as an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   He said Santorum could survive even if he votes to convict
Clinton if the senator comes across as ``judicious, fair,
senatorial.'' Although he is a persistent Clinton critic, Santorum
has not yet said if he will vote to convict the president.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna also noted that Santorum has in recent years moved to
the center of the political spectrum and has embraced issues such
as Social Security reform that resonate with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is also up for
re-election in two years, has steered a cautious approach in the
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   She has been reluctant to embrace House Republicans' demands
that witnesses, including former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, be summoned to testify before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison is not in as difficult predicament as some of her
colleagues. State voting trends have favored Republicans in recent
years; Clinton was unable to carry the state in his two
presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a weakened state Democratic organization has yet to
field an opponent who could give Hutchison trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she still must cope with the competing political
forces. While the senator said that overwhelming majority of the
42,000 calls and e-mail messages to her office have favored
conviction of the president, statewide polls have consistently
shown that Texans do not want the president removed.
</P>
<P>
   If Hutchison were to vote against conviction, she could stir up
religious conservatives in the state who have never viewed her as
an ally.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Belforte, the acting executive director of the American
Family Association of Texas, an Austin-based conservative group,
warned that ``virtually all conservatives here in Texas expect her
to vote for his removal from office. There would be repercussions
if she were to vote against.''
</P>
<P>
   Belforte said his group had hoped that Hutchison would take a
``much more outspoken, committed position'' on impeachment, much as
they believe the state's other GOP senator, Phil Gramm, has done.
Gramm has pushed for a full trial and said he would accept
witnesses if that is what the House managers want.
</P>
<P>
   If Hutchison were to vote for conviction after a long, messy
trial, she could also energize now-dormant Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm said
impeachment could be an issue in the next Senate election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans, just like all other Americans, are sick and tired of
partisan Republican attempts to drive the president from office,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, however, said she is not factoring her next election
into impeachment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not worried about the politics of it at all,'' she said.
``I believe I will be judged by how we conducted this trial, if the
Constitutional precedents were set that were responsible, and if we
are fair to both sides.''

 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although most mutual fund investors closed out 1998 with gains,
the road was rocky, with their climb hampered by sharp dips and the
summer selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The five professional money managers who have built hypothetical
retirement portfolios over the last five years for The New York
Times expect volatility to increase in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting a very rugged year,'' said Jack A. Brill, a San
Diego adviser who hews a ``socially responsible'' course. ``My
guess is that the market will break 10,000, with a 15 percent
meltdown during the year,'' he said. ``I'd expect 10 to 15 percent
growth at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill tied for first place among the five advisers in the fourth
quarter. His portfolio rose 20.34 percent, lifted by its bias
toward large- and mid-capitalization stocks. It was handicapped
only by an investment in Vanguard GNMA, which rose less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He is whittling some holdings to make room for the Citizens
Index fund, but is otherwise sitting tight. He figures _ as do the
other four advisers _ that a diverse portfolio is the best weapon
against market volatility. That, and a stiff upper lip. ``I think
individual investors should play the market for the long term,
looking past the daily hype and focusing on solid growth,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What, of course, is not always easy to do. Susan Dziubinski,
editor of Morningstar Fund Investor, a newsletter, noted wryly that
while diversification remained her touchstone, it did not pay off
in 1998. ``This certainly wasn't a good year for a contrarian
portfolio like mine,'' she said. ``Small value continued to lag,
and so did emerging markets. And nearly nonexistent inflation
hammered Oppenheimer Real Asset, my portfolio hedge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dziubinski came in right behind the two leaders for the
quarter, with a gain of 17.01 percent, and has tinkered only a bit
with her portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Among the minor adjustments, she is condensing her large-cap
international funds by scuttling Ivy International in favor of
EuroPacific Growth, which has lower expenses. Similarly, she is
jettisoning Small Cap World, a global fund with a large chunk of
small domestic stocks, and buying Founders Passport, a small-cap
fund with less than 3 percent of assets invested in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   She is also selling the Fidelity Fund, which she concedes is a
top performer, and buying TIAA-CREF Growth and Income. About 80
percent of the TIAA-CREF fund tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. ``Over the long term,'' she added, ``I question
the ability of active managers to really add value when it comes to
large-cap investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-load Fund Investor in
Irvington, N.Y., was tied with Brill for first place in the quarter
and retains the lead among the five managers over all, with a
cumulative gain of 129.69 percent since July 7, 1993, when the
contest began.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, the five portfolios have risen an average of
107.09 percent, compared with a 212.16 percent return for the
Vanguard 500 Index fund, which mimics the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each
quarter by Lipper Inc. of Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges,
transaction costs and taxes because most retirement money is held
in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any fund
open to new investors and can shift money quarterly. They were
asked to pick portfolios intended to grow for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   All the portfolios earned double-digit returns in the quarter _
a period in which Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher,
calculates that diversified domestic equity funds rose an average
of 18.73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs is adding to his holdings in Vanguard 500 Index formerly
called Vanguard Index Trust 500, bringing it to 15 percent of
assets from 12.5 percent. This change, plus the 35 percent
weighting in Vanguard Total Stock Market, enables him to reach his
goal of being 50 percent invested in index funds. The extra money
for the Index 500 fund comes from selling a small chunk of Baron
Growth and Income, lowering it to 10 percent of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   He is also replacing American Century/20th Century International
Discovery, a small-cap fund, with Montgomery International Growth,
a large-cap blend fund, because he thinks big stocks will
outperform smaller ones overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Eric M. Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of
Fidelity Insight in Wellesley, Mass., finished next to last in the
quarter, with a gain of 15.68 percent. His portfolio, made up
entirely of Fidelity funds, was held back by a 20 percent
investment in Fidelity Spartan Government Income, which slipped
0.23 percent. Even so, he is increasing his position in the fund to
25 percent from 20 percent. He is adding to the bond holdings, he
said, ``because strong corporate earnings growth will remain hard
to achieve in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobren is doubling his position, to 20 percent, in Fidelity
Contrafund II, which he calls ``a fund with the flexibility to go
anywhere in the market in search of good stocks.'' He is reducing
his position in Fidelity Small-Cap Stock to 15 percent from 20
percent. And he sold his entire 10 percent holding in Fidelity Real
Estate, because, he said, the bond fund provides sufficient
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Harold R. Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla.,
finished last in the quarter, with a portfolio gain of 14.44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from his usual practice of making few changes,
Evensky is giving his portfolio a new look this quarter. He is
selling his position in Cohen &AMP; Steers Realty Shares and using that
money to start an 8 percent position in Vanguard Extended Market
Index, to give added exposure to smaller stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He is replacing Warburg Pincus International Equity, which
gained 12.88 percent in the last quarter, with Montgomery
International Growth. He is also exchanging Blackrock Small Cap
Growth for Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains tough,'' he said, ``to preach intelligent
diversification in long-term investing in an environment like
this.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mellody Hobson was growing up in Chicago, a month without
Ebony magazine or a week without Jet signaled a possible mail
problem. ``It's just a way of life for every African-American
household I've come in contact with, no matter what their
socioeconomic status, to have an Ebony and Jet subscription,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, inspired by that, Ms. Hobson, 31, a senior vice president
and director of marketing at Ariel Capital Management in Chicago,
says, ``We want to incite a change of attitude in investing and
make mutual funds a way of life for African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariel, a pioneer of black-advised funds, got its start in 1986
in partnership with the Calvert Group, a fund company in Bethesda,
Md. Independent now for four years, Ariel has more than $2 billion
in assets under management _ $600 million in its three mutual
funds: Appreciation, which gained 19.55 percent last year, putting
it in the 15th percentile among mid-capitalization blend funds
followed by Morningstar Inc.; Growth, which rose 9.89 percent and
was in the 47th percentile of the same group, and Premier Bond,
which gained 7.30 percent, ranking in the 57th percentile of
intermediate bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Ariel is confronting a problem that the two magazines did
not face a generation ago: intense competition for the target
audience. More than ever, major brokers are courting the expanding
black middle-class market, and there are 16 black-managed funds,
according to Black Enterprise magazine _ about half founded in the
last two years _ not to mention thousands of general-purpose funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest way for a new fund to compete in this very dense
universe is to have some kind of niche or hook,'' said Laura
Lallos, a senior analyst with Morningstar, the Chicago financial
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The hook for a lot of black-advised funds is familiarity. ``Many
African-Americans will feel more comfortable in dealing with
African-Americans or people they know and trust when it comes down
to investing,'' said Alden J. McDonald Jr., president and chief
executive of Liberty Bank and Trust in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Liberty, the nation's fifth-largest black-owned bank,
started Liberty Freedom, a mutual fund investing in large-cap
stocks and aimed at first-time fund investors. The bank joined with
Jackson, Shanklin &AMP; Sonia, one of the South's largest
minority-owned brokerage firms, to market the fund, and it hired
Randall Eley, an African-American money manager, to be the fund's
subadviser. Even so, the team is well aware that money is neither
black nor white, but green.
</P>
<P>
   ``While African-Americans are the target audience, the fund will
go after all investors,'' said Eley, chief executive of the Edgar
Lomax Co., a Springfield, Va., firm with $1 billion in assets under
management, including a fund, Edgar Lomax Value. ``A fund cannot
grow with just one population.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm's fund gained 10.84 percent last year, ranking in the
59th percentile among large value funds, according to Morningstar.
The new Liberty fund is not yet tracked.
</P>
<P>
   Some seasoned Wall Street professionals question the financial
sense of small funds' aiming at black investors without a niche
that is stronger than race. Harold E. Doley Jr., owner of Doley
Securities and the first African-American to buy a seat on the New
York Stock Exchange, more than 25 years ago, said: ``To merely have
a black-owned fund doing what everyone else does in a crowded arena
is not necessary. To market as a socially conscious fund is
promising, because there are still needs for good socially
conscious funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan A. Chapman, chief executive of Chapman Capital Management
Holdings in Baltimore, says filling such a niche is secondary to
creating a profitable fund. Last fall he founded the DEM Equity
Mutual fund. The initials stand for domestic emerging markets _ the
fund invests in publicly traded companies owned or led by blacks,
Asian-Americans, Latinos and women. Morningstar does not yet track
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to marketing the fund, ``We are interested in
everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the underrepresentation of blacks among the
nation's investors, many of the new black portfolio managers are
eager to win them over. Fifty-seven percent of black households
with incomes of $50,000 or more a year invest in stocks or mutual
funds, compared with 81 percent of their white counterparts,
according to a study last year by Yankelovich Partners for Charles
Schwab, the big discount brokerage house, and Ariel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a classic business case,'' says Duane Davis, president
of the Coalition of Black Investors, based in Winston-Salem, N.C.
``It's a huge $5 billion market right in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the number of black-advised mutual funds has grown, the
involvement of blacks in that arena is still low relative to their
population, said John W. Rogers Jr., founder and chief executive of
Ariel.
</P>
<P>
   Because African-Americans seldom had large family fortunes,
Rogers said, ``we never had to learn a lot about the investment
advisory and mutual fund business, and those folks who run those
companies didn't have to learn much about us.''
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the standing-room-only attendance at seminars for
black investors, that may be changing. Some 1,100 people attended
one such seminar, held in October at Hunter College in New York and
sponsored by the New York State Comptroller's office and Network
Journal, a business publication.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, as part of a 10-year campaign to triple its
share of the financial planning market, has waged one of the most
aggressive drives to attract black investors. In New York alone,
the company has 80 financial planners recruiting black clients, and
it is holding a series of seminars and large dinner parties in
African-American communities.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Chapelle, editor of Securities Pro, a newsletter covering
blacks in the securities industry, said, ``There are a growing
number of black folks who want to invest with black folks, which
the Ariel study showed.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this, however, does not necessarily give black-advised
mutual funds an edge. Brokers recommend funds from their firms'
list of approved choices, which are based on such factors as
longevity, performance and fees. Few black-advised funds _ nearly
all of them small and most relatively new _ few have appeared on
those lists. Ariel has made the most headway, and is included in
the fund supermarkets of Charles Schwab, Jack White and Fidelity
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty is waging a campaign for inclusion, but, McDonald said,
``we are not depending on being listed with those funds.'' Rather,
the Liberty Freedom fund has ``gone directly to our market niche,''
he said, with representatives ``at every major African-American
national convention this year _ the black lawyers, doctors,
bankers, mayors, fraternities, sororities; you name it, we were
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberty's grass-roots marketing strategy is common to
black-advised mutual funds. Eugene Profit, who started Profit
Value, a top-ranked large-cap fund based in Silver Spring, Md., two
years ago, says he tries to attract investors primarily through
seminars and booths at major conventions. The fund returned 31.67
percent, placing in the first percentile of large value funds,
according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of myself like Charlie Merrill some 80 years ago, who
brought investing to the common man door to door,'' Profit said.
``We really get the bulk of our assets through word of mouth and
door-to-door pounding.'' Those assets now total $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of race, Profit said, once the investor is in the
fold, ``at the end of the day, they want to know the same thing
that everyone else wants to know: `How did you do?' ''

 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mutual funds used to be sold as one-decision investments. If
they weren't held for a lifetime, at least they were held for many
years. And because they were so diversified, in theory you needed
only one fund. Life was simple.
</P>
<P>
   Today's fund arena could hardly be more different. Many
supposedly diversified funds are so narrowly focused that some
investors could achieve greater diversification by buying the stock
of a single multinational, multiline corporation, like General
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   And almost no one these days considers mutual funds to be
lifetime holdings. Instead, they chase short-term performance,
switching in and out of funds with about as much abandon as they
show for individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, an entire industry has sprung up to respond to
investors' needs in this brave new hyperkinetic world: mutual fund
advisory newsletters. These publication often advise subscribers
about when to jump in or out of the market, as well as which funds
to buy when it's time to be invested.
</P>
<P>
   This industry has grown rapidly. As recently as 20 years ago, no
more than one or two newsletters even mentioned mutual funds.
Today, at least half of the 160 newsletters monitored by the
Hulbert Financial Digest focus on funds.
</P>
<P>
   How have these fund newsletters performed? It depends on how you
look at it.
</P>
<P>
   I calculated their returns for the last 10 years through Nov. 30
by following their model portfolio advice exactly, executing
transactions on the very day that subscribers could act upon it.
Fund loads, redemption fees and distributions were all taken into
account. Only three of the 47 portfolios with sufficient records in
my database, Fundline's $100,000 Aggressive Portfolio and two from
Fidelity Monitor _ Select System and Growth Model _ outperformed
the 17.6 percent annualized gain of the Wilshire 5000 index on an
absolute basis, returning 18.7 percent, 21.8 percent, and 18.4
percent, respectively. All three portfolios use aggressive-growth
or growth strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But while pure performance may be all that many fund
shareholders care about, it is an overly simplistic way to look at
investing. Smart investors will also look at the risk entailed in
achieving their returns. To adjust performance for risk, I
calculated what a newsletter portfolio's return would have been if
its volatility had matched the market's. This meant adding cash to
portfolios that were riskier than the market, and buying on margin
_ using leverage _ when it came to portfolios that were less risky.
</P>
<P>
   On a risk-adjusted basis, the newsletters did better; 10
portfolios outperformed the market. And by examining what these top
performers have in common, you can learn a lot about how to invest
in funds.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising pattern is that the majority of the top
portfolios pursued conservative strategies. In fact, of the last
decade's top 10 newsletter portfolios, five are best characterized
as income oriented, and two more are best described as being of the
growth-and-income variety. (The three more aggressive portfolios
that beat the index before risk adjustment also made the cut.)
</P>
<P>
   This pattern is nothing short of remarkable. We might have
expected it had the market declined over the last decade _ but not
during the strong bull market we have witnessed. The last 10 years
should have been tailor-made for higher-risk approaches; even after
adjusting for risk, more aggressive strategies should have worked
better. Nevertheless, the newsletters that used them didn't lead
the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern has profound implications. It means that you should
increase exposure to more conservative portfolios of funds that are
intended to produce income or a combination of growth and income.
This recommendation holds regardless which way you think the market
is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Following this tack will lower your overall portfolio's risk,
not a bad thing per se, but something you may not have intended.
You can easily counteract this by increasing the allocation of
money you make to the market through your fund portfolios, but
using conservative strategies rather than aggressive ones.
</P>
<P>
   Say you allocate 50 percent of your money to relatively more
aggressive fund portfolios that equal the market's risk, putting
the rest into cash. To duplicate that overall risk exposure while
seeking a better risk-adjusted return, you can simply allocate 75
percent of your money to the more conservative strategy. If history
is any guide, you will make more money than you would by pursuing
the more aggressive approach.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another important pattern emerges from the ranks of the top
performers: Asset allocation is a better bet than market timing for
getting the optimal mix of risk and performance. (By asset
allocation, I mean the division of one's portfolio among the
various asset classes, like stocks, bonds, gold and cash. By market
timing, I mean the attempt to time a single market's gyrations so
as to be invested during rallies and in cash during declines.)
</P>
<P>
   Five of the last decade's top 10 fund newsletter portfolios
follow asset-allocation approaches. The others follow a variety of
strategies, from buy and hold to moving in and out of industry
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Why is asset allocation a better risk reducer? Consider the
country's best-known market timing newsletter: the Fabian Premium
Investment Resource, edited by Douglas Fabian. That newsletter has
had moderate success with its market timing over the last decade,
reducing by 12 percent the risks otherwise associated with the
stock market itself.
</P>
<P>
   However, it has paid a price in the process. While the Wilshire
5000 returned an annualized 17.6 percent over the 10 years,
Fabian's model portfolio of United States equity funds gained just
13.6 percent a year, on average. After adjusting this return for
its below-market risk, it did not beat the market, which explains
its absence from the table accompanying this article.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast Fabian's portfolio with another that did not use market
timing and instead focused on asset allocation: the so-called
Master Retirement portfolio of the No-Load Fund Investor, edited by
Sheldon Jacobs. Although this portfolio was 40 percent less risky
than Fabian's, it produced almost as much profit: 12.5 percent
annualized. On a risk-adjusted basis, though, Jacob's was good
enough to beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these two portfolios is more likely to repeat? I
believe that the probabilities favor Jacobs'. After all, Fabian's
portfolio must successfully anticipate the stock market's swings in
order to duplicate its achievement, getting subscribers out of
stocks before extended declines and getting them back in before
rallies. That's no mean feat _ even without considering tax or
expense issues.
</P>
<P>
   But investors who follow the Jacobs portfolio need only to keep
following the asset-allocation strategy. This will automatically
lead to reduced risk so long as the various asset classes do not
move in lock step with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson from this is that successful market timing requires a
lot of fancy footwork. It is impressive that any advisers are
capable of it. Asset allocation, however, requires no fancy steps;
it is the lazy person's path to similar results.
</P>
<P>
   That explains how the top-performer list is dominated by asset
allocaters. It's not that the editors of these letters have higher
IQs; the point is that they don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't fall into the trap of thinking that stocks
are the only game in town. The incredible strength of the bull
market has led many people to think that it is. But by ignoring
bonds, gold and other asset classes, you take away tools that could
help you reduce risk without forfeiting return. Why make investing
any harder than it already is? &QL;

 &HT;    UGA's old race-based admission policy was unconstitutional,
judge rules
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge has ruled that a racial dual-track
admission policy at the University of Georgia in 1995 was
unconstitutional and resulted in the illegal rejection of a white
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling covers only part of a major reverse-discrimination
lawsuit against the Board of Regents. It does not address the
suit's attack on policies that shape enrollment in the University
System's three historically black colleges, nor does it say
anything about UGA's admission policy since 1995, which uses race
as a factor but does not use separate admission standards for
blacks applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ruling is the first indication of how the U.S.
District Judge B. Avant Edenfield of Savannah frames important
questions about race-conscious admission policies raised in this
case. Edenfield rejected all arguments justifying UGA's previous
admission policy that had lower admission standards for blacks. He
ruled that just because UGA no longer has that policy, it is not
moot, because UGA could revert to it in the future. He cited
Chancellor Stephen Portch's intention ``to continue using race as a
factor in admissions until otherwise directed by a court order.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Portch said because the case is still pending,
the chancellor could not comment. But UGA President Michael Adams
said the ruling, issued Wednesday, reflects a decision on policies
the university abandoned about five years ago. ``We have respect
for the law and the courts and believe that our current policies
are legal and reflect a desire to continue to aggressively recruit
qualified African-American students,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The current admission policy at UGA, the only public campus in
Georgia that admits to using race as an admissions factor, is to
accept most freshmen applicants strictly on academic record. Last
year, 90 percent were accepted that way, said UGA spokesman Tom
Jackson. The remaining 10 percent were accepted on a combination of
academic factors plus any of 12 characteristics, including race,
being male or being related to a UGA alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is far from over, but the judge's order validates
our claim that an unconstitutional race-based admissions policy was
in place at UGA,'' said Atlanta attorney Lee Parks, who represents
the seven white and black plaintiffs in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield must now decide how much, if any, damages must be paid
to Kirby Tracy, who filed suit after being denied admission to UGA.
From 1990 to 1995, UGA held black applicants to lower minimums,
including a score of 800 on the SAT and a grade-point average of
2.0. Non-black applicants needed a minimum SAT score of 980 and a
minimum GPA of 2.5 grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy had a 3.47 grade point average and scored 830 on the SAT
when he applied to UGA in the fall of 1995. Tracy was prevented
``solely on the basis of his skin color from competing on equal
footing for a spot in UGA's 1995 freshman class,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy then applied to and was admitted at Georgia College and
State University in Milledgeville, which he attended for two years
before being accepted in 1997 as a transfer student at UGA, where
he remains enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield also threw out claims by a white female plaintiff who
was denied admission to UGA in 1996 and sued on reverse
discrimination grounds. He noted the plaintiff did not meet minimum
academic standards and race played no role in UGA's denial of her
application.
</P>
<P>
   Parks expressed confidence that the remaining plaintiffs will
prevail on the rest of the claims. Parks said that for the 1997-98
freshman class, about 30 African-American applicants were granted
admission at UGA almost solely on the basis of their race.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity that race-conscious admission seeks to promote is
also threatened by fierce competition, fueled in recent years by
the fact that the lottery-funded HOPE scholarship covers tuition
for 95 percent of the in-state freshmen. Stiff competition has
dramatically driven up the academic standards for admitted
students, regardless of these nonacademic factors. The percentage
of black enrollment, now down to about 6 percent, has also been
falling in recent years, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents did not try to defend the dual-track
admissions policy, which it had abandoned at the recommendation of
the state attorney general. Instead, it argued that Kirby had no
standing to sue since the policy was no longer in effect and
because Kirby was later admitted. Edenfield rejected those
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also rejected arguments by the NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund, which was allowed to become a party in the lawsuit,
that the 1990-95 admission policy promoted diversity at UGA and was
targeted to remedy the effects of past discrimination in UGA
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``However noble this general goal is, a court must scrutinize
the specific policies which seek to achieve diversity,'' Edenfield
wrote. ``Abstractions aimed at marginally increasing diversity
simply cannot carry the day because such benefit is far outweighed
by the stigmatizing, polarizing costs imposed by racial
classifications.

LOUIS J. WEST, 74, PSYCHIATRIST WHO STUDIED EXTREMES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Okla., Wash., Wis., MEXICO)   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Louis Jolyon West, a charismatic leader in psychiatry whose
work centered on people who have been taken to the limits of human
experience, like ``brainwashed'' prisoners of war, kidnapping
victims and abused children, died last Saturday in his home in Los
Angeles. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was metastatic cancer, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   West's life and career were punctuated with events that
suggested his broad range of work. He examined Jack Ruby, the
killer of Lee Harvey Oswald, and helped convince the court that
Ruby should not be sentenced to death. West once saw a gruesome
execution in Wisconsin and for years led a movement of doctors
against the death penalty. He was a court-appointed witness in the
defense of Patricia Hearst after her kidnapping and what appeared
to be conversion to the outlaw life.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and early 1960s, he aided civil rights workers who
led lunch-counter sit-ins, and later he traveled to South Africa to
testify on behalf of prisoners during Apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Milton H. Miller, a longtime colleague of West and the
chairman of psychiatry at the Harbor-University of California at
Los Angeles Medical Center, described West, nicknamed Jolly, as
``above all, a colorful figure, an alive person who loved being on
the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   An experiment of West's in the 1950s was a national event. A
disc jockey, Peter Tripp, was subjected to sleep deprivation,
broadcasting live for 200 hours without stopping. He suffered
temporary physical and mental illness in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent study, also in the 1950s, came about when West
was part of a panel appointed to find out why 36 of 59 United
States airmen captured in Korea confessed or cooperated in charges
of war crimes against the United States. What seemed to be a
collapse of will led some to call the airmen cowards, and others
raised the fear that the Communists had found drugs or mysterious
methods to induce ``brainwashing.''
</P>
<P>
   West's work, which included interviews with the servicemen,
showed that the explanation was both simpler and more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found enabled us to rule out drugs, hypnosis or other
mysterious trickery,'' he once said in an interview. ``It was just
one device used to confuse, bewilder and torment our men until they
were ready to confess to anything. That device was prolonged,
chronic loss of sleep.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  That, combined with the constant fear of harm and the total
dependency on their captors, led the airmen into startling and
fairly long-lasting personality changes.
</P>
<P>
   West's work saved the airmen from court-martial. It also
demonstrated the vulnerability of people in general.
</P>
<P>
   The principle is also at work in families, he said, where
children may become violent when they are exposed to coercion and
violence. West was among the first in psychiatry to demonstrate in
scientific papers that inflicting painful punishment was not a
necessary part of good child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   He illustrated the point with his usual flair by publishing a
study of a very unusual people, the Tarahumara of the Sierra Madre
in southwestern Chihuahua, Mexico, describing how they maintained
nonviolence as one of the highest principles of society and never
physically punished their children. The children grew up learning
no expressions of anger or rage, and violent crimes were
practically unknown among them.
</P>
<P>
   West's efforts to study violence caused a public confrontation
in the early 1970s. He proposed a center, which he called the
``world's first and only center for the study of interpersonal
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But early drafts of the proposal included descriptions of human
experiments, including psychosurgery, or brain surgery to change
behavior. Protest was quick and vehement. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In one effort to confront the objections, he met with the Black
Panther leader Huey Newton in Newton's Oakland apartment; the
ethics of human experiments were debated, but neither budged.
Although West drew enthusiastic support from the governor of
California, Ronald Reagan, the proposal finally failed.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Jolyon West was born on Oct. 6, 1924, in Brooklyn to an
immigrant from Ukraine, Albert Jerome West, and a Brooklyn piano
teacher, Anna Rosenberg. He received his medical degree from the
University of Minnesota and did his psychiatric residency at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   At 29 he became chairman of the psychiatry department at the
University of Oklahoma School of Medicine. He remained at Oklahoma
until 1969, when he became chairman of psychiatry and head of the
Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of California at Los
Angeles. He stayed there until he retired in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   West is survived by his wife, Kathryn, of Los Angeles; two
daughters, Anne Kathryn, of New York, and Mary Elizabeth Hawkins,
of Sacramento; one son, John Stuart, of Seattle, and a sister,
Nancy Wheeler of St. Paul.

TEXAS REVENUE WINDFALL HITS $5.6 BILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander gave
policy-makers a silver cloud with a dark lining Friday _ a record
state revenue windfall that is smaller than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said legislators and Gov. George W. Bush will have an
additional $5.6 billion to spend for the two-year budget cycle that
begins Aug. 1. Deputy Comptroller Billy Hamilton said that is the
biggest pot of new money the state has seen since he began working
on revenue estimates in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But the estimated increase is also $700 million less than what
former Comptroller John Sharp projected last July.
</P>
<P>
   When that revenue drop is combined with about $3.3 billion in
additional spending that will be required to cover such basics as
increased student enrollment, the amount of increased discretionary
money left available to Bush and legislators will be somewhere in
the ballpark of $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That left politicians like Bush _ who promised $4.6 billion in
tax cuts and new spending programs during his re-election campaign
last year _ scrambling Friday to figure out ways to pay for their
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less money is available and the only conservative, fiscally
responsible response is for all of us to adjust our budget
proposals accordingly,'' Bush said. ``The reduction in the amount
of money available may require some changes in the specific dollar
amounts of everyone's proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he still plans to increase funds for public schools,
give school property taxpayers a major break, and cut consumer
sales taxes and business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he will not be able to say whether he can fulfill
his promise of delivering a $2 billion property tax cut until
shortly before he gives his proposed budget to state lawmakers at
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am committed to significant tax cuts,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Budget Director Albert Hawkins said some of the governor's
proposals will fit in with the required spending increases. For
instance, he said almost $1.1 billion in new spending for public
school equalization programs can be used in part to trigger local
property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said Bush should still be able to come close to
fulfilling his campaign promises in a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry said the drop in the revenue
projection should act as a cautionary note to legislators as they
draw up the next state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estimate underscores the need for state leaders to set
clear priorities, look for efficiencies in state programs and work
together in a bipartisan, fiscally conservative way,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said the record revenue increase has resulted from a
generally strong state economy that is largely tracking the
national economy. She said Texas also has enjoyed economic strength
because the local economy is more tied to trade with Latin America
than with the Far East, which has been suffering an economic
downturn this year.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the major economic indicators that represent gross
state product _ while continuing an upward trend _ are down
slightly from where they were when the July estimate was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being at a dizzying pace, we're now at a moderate
pace,'' Rylander said.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said the July estimate done by Sharp projected that
sales tax revenues for the state would increase 10.3 percent, but
the projection now is for an increase of 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander estimated that total money available to the state from
all sources, including federal funds, during the next budget cycle
will be $94 billion, up from the current $90.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller said her estimate of increased general revenues
does not include $1.1 billion the state will receive as the first
installment of its $15.3 billion settlement with the tobacco
industry. Key legislators have agreed to urge the Legislature to
spend that money on health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said she set aside $471 million of the budget surplus
for a transfer to the state's Economic Stabilization Fund, more
commonly known as the ``rainy day fund.'' She said if legislators
do not take action to spend that money, it will be automatically
transferred into the fund next September.
</P>
<P>
   Once money is in the fund, she said, it would require a
two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature to spend the
money. At present, there is $60 million in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like any Texas family knows, it's not prudent to spend
for today without preparing for tomorrow,'' Rylander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate good times and prosperity. That's why I am
pleased to take these steps to make sure today's harvest of plenty
continues well into the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rainy day fund was set up during the 1980s in a period of
economic downturn. Lawmakers had wanted the fund to grow to cover
shortages without tax increases like the one they were forced to
pass in 1986 when oil prices suddenly dropped dramatically and left
the state with a deficit of more than $1 billion.

JAMES HAMMERSTEIN, PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR OF HIS FATHER'S MUSICALS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., U.K.)   By JESSE McKINLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Hammerstein, a producer and a frequent director
of the musicals of his father, Oscar Hammerstein II, died on
Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Dena.
</P>
<P>
   In more than four decades in show business, Hammerstein was a
common presence in the wings in theaters throughout New York and
beyond, in jobs from the menial to the executive.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career behind the scenes as an assistant stage
manager but eventually formed his own production company.
</P>
<P>
   His Broadway debut as a producer came in 1958 with ``Blue
Denim,'' which received respectable reviews but had a short run.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerstein's producing career continued, but he had found
another calling. In 1957 he directed the first production of ``Damn
Yankees'' in London and later directed the show in over 30
productions around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After his father's death in 1960, Hammerstein turned his
attention to revivals of the work of his father and his
collaborator, Richard Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   His 1965 production of ``South Pacific'' at City Center was a
critical and popular hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s and early '70s, Hammerstein directed the New

``Butley'' and ``Wise Child'' and Israel Horowitz's ``Indian Wants
the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammerstein also continued to stage revivals of Rodgers and
Hammerstein musicals, including a 1981 production of ``Oklahoma!''
in London, a national tour of ``The King and I'' in 1989 and a 1990
production of ``The Sound of Music'' at the New York City Opera.

UPN DECLARES IT WILL SURVIVE `PFEIFFER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Dean Valentine, president of the UPN network,
donned a stovepipe hat Friday and intoned a parody of the
Gettysburg Address in an attempt to find the humor that was missing
in the widely reviled sitcom that has come to symbolize his
network's struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a Lincoln-era comedy
that ignited charges of racial insensitivity by African-American
groups, was swiftly canceled last fall when it cratered in the
ratings. It was far from the only UPN show to do so, which is why
most of the questions Valentine faced Friday from TV critics boiled
down to: How long can UPN survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors of any imminent demise, to quote Mark Twain, would be
greatly exaggerated,'' Valentine said. ``We will not get off the
stage till our hour has come, and I think that hour is far, far
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The embattled executive acknowledged, however, that ``we have to
build this network piece by piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the key pieces of UPN's turnaround strategy are a pair of
promising new animated shows: ``Dilbert,'' which is based on the
popular comic strip about the corporate Everyman and premieres on
Jan. 25, and ``Home Movies,'' the latest effort by Watertown-based
Tom Snyder Productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Movies,'' whose premiere has not been set, features the
same animation style and quirky wit as Snyder's ``Dr. Katz:
Professional Therapist'' and ``Squigglevision.'' Revolving around
the adventures of a single mother, her fourth-grade son (a wannabe
filmmaker), and a bumptious soccer coach, ``Home Movies'' is
largely unscripted. Instead, it relies on improvisation by the
voice cast, which includes Paula Poundstone (the judge in
``Squigglevision''), H. Jon Benjamin (the voice of Ben in ``Dr.
Katz''), and Boston stand-up comic Brendan Small. The lengthy clip
of ``Home Movies'' screened for critics Friday was enthusiastically
received.
</P>
<P>
   But the weak standing and unclear identity of UPN (seen in
Boston on WSBK-Ch. 38) was the subtext of even the most upbeat
events during a day designed to promote the network's midseason
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Poundstone, in a press conference with Benjamin, Small, and
executive producer Loren Bouchard, said that when she got involved
in ``Home Movies,'' she had to ask: ``What does UPN stand for?''
Robert Urich, star of UPN's ``Love Boat: The Next Wave,'' said he
is ``glad to be on UPN'' but admitted the fact that UPN ``can't
compete with the (other) networks'' in terms of audience size is
``a bit of a bruise to the ego.'' Markus Redmond, a cast member of
a new midseason sitcom called ``Family Rules,'' joked that he is
``waiting for this thing to fall'' so he can return to working with
producer Steven Bochco of ABC's ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   So for UPN chief Valentine and UPN's entertainment president Tom
Nunan, Friday was spent largely on the defensive. Four years after
UPN was launched as the sixth broadcast network, it continues to
lose money for its corporate parents, Chris-Craft Industries and
Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Television Group.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine bridled at a claim made Thursday by Jamie Kellner,
head of the rival WB network, that UPN will lose $300 million this
year. ``Jamie hasn't met a nasty remark or a half-truth he didn't
like,'' Valentine said. In a later interview, Valentine rejected
the $300 million estimate as ``way, way wrong,'' but declined to
say how much money UPN is losing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that UPN's image has grown murky since it
moved away from its early emphasis on shows that appealed to urban,
African-American audiences. (By contrast, the WB network, formed
around the same time as UPN, has developed a strong, clear identity
with a consistent slate of youth-oriented programs.) Some black
viewers and activist groups were outraged by ``Desmond Pfeiffer,''
saying the show, which depicted a black British nobleman acting as
President Lincoln's servant and confidant, made light of slavery.
Valentine Friday acknowledged that scheduling ``Desmond Pfeiffer''
was an error. ``We were wrong. You guys were right,'' he told TV
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who said he wants to attract more young male viewers
to UPN, contended it is just one or two hit shows away from
becoming a healthy network. Nunan, the chief programmer, said that
producers are not shying away from UPN because of its ratings woes.
He said the network has production deals lined up with Meg Ryan,
for an animated show that has been called ``a female version of
`South Park,' '' and with ``Homicide'' executive producer Tom
Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be a little bit more scrappy and more outrageous
with our programming,'' said Nunan. ``We need to make more noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, presumably, the sort of ``splat!'' noise ``Desmond
Pfeiffer'' made.

JAMES HOLMES, COMPOSER, CHOIR DIRECTOR AND ORGANIST, DIES AT 59. 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Kan., Ore., N.C.)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Holmes, an organist and choir director long
associated with the Episcopal Church of St. Matthew and St. Timothy
in Manhattan, and a sometime composer of considerable skill, died
on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, which he had had for several years, said
his longtime companion, the composer Ned Rorem.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes was born on April 2, 1939, in Pittsburg, Kan., and
brought up in a musical environment. As a boy he studied violin and
piano and later continued his studies at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he moved to New York City. Late that year he met Rorem.
Inevitably, he lived in the shadow of his older (by 16 years) and
celebrated partner. But he won admiration in his own right for his
professional services and achievements.
</P>
<P>
   His first major post as an organist and choir director was at
the Chapel (now Church) of the Intercession in the Washington
Heights neighborhood. There, in 1972, he presented a well-received
series of organ recitals, each devoted to a modern composer,
including Messiaen, Poulenc, Satie and Virgil Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 he became the organist and choir director at the Church
of St. Matthew and St. Timothy, where until his illness intervened
he never missed a Sunday or feast day service. It was his custom to
feature a 20th-century work in his musical selections. His own
``Stabat Mater,'' an unaccompanied choral work of austere beauty,
is published by Boosey &AMP; Hawkes. In September the church unveiled a
plaque honoring him with ``thanksgiving for 25 years of devoted
service.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Rorem, he is survived by his mother, Lora
Eastwood Holmes of Corvallis, Ore., two brothers and two sisters.

SAYING NO TO SUMMER PANIC BRINGS A WINTER OF CONTENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 10) 
(bl)  
By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a dramatic comeback that cheered the holders of more than 100
million mutual fund accounts, the fund industry turned in a
rollicking performance in the final quarter of 1998. The average
U.S. diversified stock fund returned 18.8 percent, the fattest gain
for any quarter since 1982, when the business was less than 1/8 its
present size.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a Federal Reserve whose interest-rate cuts clearly
reflected more concern about heading off world recession than about
fueling stock prices, the market rewarded the overwhelming majority
of fund investors who, rather than running for cover, either sat
tight during the midyear turbulence or used it to pick up bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Their persistence allowed their fund managers to avoid the
necessity of selling shares or husbanding cash. And the rewards in
many cases were fourth-quarter returns that exceeded the gain in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, a leading benchmark that has
traditionally been hard for stock fund managers to beat.
</P>
<P>
   But while a half-dozen categories of actively managed stock
funds surpassed the 20.9 percent gain in the S&AMP;P, it was growth
funds that really excelled _ a trend that embraced companies of all
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Growth funds that invest in stocks with large capitalizations _
capitalization is the total market value of all of a company's
shares _ jumped an average of 26.3 percent in the
October-through-December period and 36.5 percent for all of 1998.
Mid-cap funds also rallied and came in a close second, up 26.1
percent for the quarter and 18.3 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   In an even sharper recovery, beaten-down small-cap growth funds
racked up a 24 percent fourth-quarter advance that hoisted their
full-year return from negative territory to a 4.3 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   For the growth funds, the chief advantage was economic turmoil
abroad, which caused fears of a recession at home. Companies that
are not closely tied to the business cycle were at a premium, and
many investors sought quality within the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, many growth funds had a high representation of
telecommunications and technology stocks, which rebounded with a
vengeance. Some fund managers have even ventured into Internet
rockets like Amazon.com, the bookseller, and Ebay, an auctioneer,
which rose 187.8 percent and 435.4 percent, respectively, in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty funds that hold the stocks of technology companies did
best of all, surging 41.7 percent, according to Morningstar Inc.,
the Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   But bond funds, to the surprise of some people, were flat by
comparison. Indeed, 15 of 21 classifications eked out gains of less
than 1 percent. Long-Term government funds lost 1.2 percent, on
average. Emerging-markets bond funds returned 12.3 percent, in
contrast to disastrous quarters earlier in the year. This
disappointing fate for the bond funds, analysts said, showed that
investors had anticipated the Fed's rate cuts, the first of which
came during September.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors seeking refuge from foreign turmoil moved to
Treasuries, largely ignoring corporate and tax-exempt municipal
issues. Funds investing in convertible bonds, sometimes a
substitute for stocks, were high performers for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Asia remains in recession, markets there
rebounded smartly on anticipations of recovery. Stock funds
investing in Pacific Rim countries and Asia, but excluding Japan,
rose an average of 27.6 percent in the fourth quarter. But these
funds still suffered a loss of 10.4 percent for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews Korea and Matthews Pacific Tiger were the biggest
international winners in the quarter, soaring 102 percent and 40.5
percent, respectively. Fidelity's Japan Small Company fund surged
34.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable stock-market comeback in the United States and
elsewhere followed one of the worst selloffs in years, producing a
sharp whipsaw for some investors who played the game of trying to
time the market's ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation of 1998 may well be the steadfastness of the
nation's 67 million fund investors, about half of whom also own
stocks directly, when confronted with a mid-July to early-October
plunge that many argue was a genuine, if compressed, bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Despite industry assurances that an overwhelming majority of
shareholders would stand fast, there were skeptics. When the sun is
shining, they argued, it is easy for investors to say they'll hang
in there _ especially if they have never suffered through such a
slump before. But when the storm comes, they added, many people
change their tune.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investors were resilient. ``The selloff was fairly steep,
and the reaction was very mild,'' said John Rea, chief economist at
the Investment Company Institute. For the first time since 1990,
equity fund investors in August sold more than they bought, but the
outflow was a mere four-tenths of 1 percent of assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And while the effects of the plunge lingered into the fourth
quarter, when inflows lagged behind, Rea contended that one thing
had become clear: ``Long-term investors are willing to accept some
short-term volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few months' decline _ and even the considerably longer
slump for small-company stocks _ is not as brutal or disheartening
as a more traditional bear market, like the one that lasted for
most of 1973 and 1974 and slashed the value of blue-chip stocks by
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as big as the market's emphasis on growth during the
latest quarter was its preference for larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in big growth companies, you were in fat city,''
said Robert Doll, chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds in
New York, which has 50 funds with a total of $100 billion in
assets. ``But if you were small and value-oriented, you got taken
to the cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheer size is increasingly important, agreed Beth Terrana,
portfolio manager of the Fidelity Fund, a $9.7 billion member of
the giant Fidelity Investment group, which has been generally
shedding a reluctance to pay premium prices for the most popular
large-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very strongly in favor of big-cap stocks,'' she
said. ``The world has become excruciatingly competitive,'' she
added, and in a slow-growth environment ``he who spends the most
normally wins.'' Large-cap companies have the financial heft to
spend with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest stocks tend to be bought by the biggest funds, since
managers can take meaningful positions in them without unduly
affecting prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest fund of all, Fidelity Magellan, with $83.6
billion in assets, not only outperformed the S&AMP;P 500 last year for
the first time since 1993, but recorded a fourth-quarter gain of
27.2 percent, second-highest among the nation's largest 25 funds.
First was the Janus Fund, at 28.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stansky, Magellan's manager repositioned the fund, which
is closed to most new investors, late in the summer; he piled into
growth stocks and beaten down high-technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, Magellan's 33.6 percent advance was surpassed
among giant funds only by the Janus Fund, at 38.9 percent; Fidelity
Blue Chip Growth, up 34.8 percent, and American Century Twentieth
Century Ultra, up 34.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent successes by portfolio managers, passive
investment continues to grow. Money is pouring into Vanguard 500
Index, now the second-biggest fund, at $74 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A rising proportion of fund buyers, newly sensitive to advisory
fees, trading costs and tax issues, are willing to settle for
returns that come close to matching market averages rather than
chasing the hot-shot manager of the day, said Kurt Cerulli,
principal of Cerulli Associates, a research and investment
counseling firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument for indexing is pretty compelling,'' Cerulli
said, noting that management fees for index funds run as little as
one-fifth of a percentage point a year, compared with three or four
times as much for the typical fund. Fees can exceed 1.5 percent
when other expenses, like marketing charges, are included.
</P>
<P>
   While the market was showering large and growth-oriented funds
with outsized gains, managers bent on sniffing out value in
undiscovered or beaten-down or cyclically depressed shares remain
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful'' being out of fashion, said Ronald Spaulding,
the value-oriented chief investment officer for eight stock funds
and five bond funds advised by Safeco Corp. of Seattle. ``The
market always returns to value, to fundamentals, at some point. The
question is timing.''
</P>
<P>
   The underperformance of value managers persisted throughout the
year; particularly striking was the chasm that developed between
investment extremes, noted John Rekenthaler, research director at
Morningstar. Investors in the average small-cap value fund suffered
a 7 percent loss during 1998, while large-cap growth funds climbed
36.5 percent, on average, a difference of 43.5 percent. ``I haven't
seen the like of it,'' Rekenthaler said. ``I'd be surprised if
we've ever had a number that large.''
</P>
<P>
   One lesson may be that fund performance, at least in the short
term, often depends more on investment fashion than on the skills
of portfolio managers. In practice, this means that because fashion
is as fickle in markets as in clothes, it makes no sense to chase
after last year's winners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet choice in mutual funds _ by some counts there are now more
funds than stocks _ continues to expand. The proliferation is
prompting many investors who once regarded funds as simplifying
their investment life to seek professional help with complexity.
</P>
<P>
   One new fund is a closed-end offering called Value Line No. 1
Strategy Trust. It will invest in the 100 stocks given a top
ranking for timeliness _ defined as a likelihood to rise more
quickly than other stocks _ by the Value Line Investment Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Some new products border on the eccentric. Trying a different
take on the indexing phenomenon, the new Guinness Flight Wired
Index fund will invest in 40 so-called new blue chips, as
designated by Wired Magazine. The Wired list is intended to track
the information economy of the next century, much as the Dow Jones
industrial average, started in 1896, was intended to track the
industrial economy of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The companies it chose, Wired said, display ``not just
intelligent use of technology, but also more abstract notions,
including globalism, innovation and strategic vision.''

 &HT;    2 top Olympic officials step down amid bribery charges
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gaining momentum like an avalanche, charges of Olympic
bribery brought down two top Salt Lake City officials Friday and
continued to undermine the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, which erupted from the city's winning campaign for
the 2002 Winter Games, began in November with the revelation of
scholarship payments to six relatives of International Olympic
Committee members. Now, it involves cash payments of as much as
$70,000 to voting members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deplore it,'' Utah governor Mike Leavitt said. ``This
corner of Olympic corruption did not begin in Salt Lake City. But
let it end here.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one sponsor has expressed public disapproval, telephone
company U.S. West, which withheld a $5 million payment until it is
satisfied with answers from the committee. The company had pledged
$50 million for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Salt Lake companies hired at
least three relatives of IOC members during the bid, with the bid
commitee paying most of the the salary of one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Four investigations into the bribery allegations are proceeding.
In additon to an ethics panel convened by the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the U.S. Justice Department
and the IOC are conducting their own probes. The IOC is focusing on
wrongdoing by its own members.
</P>
<P>
   However, the IOC repeated that it has no intentions of moving
the 2002 Winter Games and that it believes they will be a ``total
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the Games will proceed without Frank Joklik,
president of SLOC and the volunteer chairman of the bid committee,
and Dave Johnson, a senior vice president who was the point man
determining IOC members' likes and dislikes during the bid process.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik, 70, said the actions ``besmirch our reputation break my
heart.'' He denied any knowledge of improper payments but resigned
because ``changes must be made for the Games to proceed.'' Joklik,
a retired copper-company executive, will stay on his
$280,000-a-year job until a replacement is found. SLOC said it is
planning an international search.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these disturbing actions were taken in an
effort to win friends for the bid,'' Joklik said, but he added that
he didn't believe that bid votes were promised in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``A handful of IOC members seem to have seriously abused our
generous impulses and expected _ and received _ more than they
should have been given,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 40, was the No. 2 man on the organizing committee who
was responsible for coordinating and managing functional aspects of
the Games. Joklik asked Johnson, a former car salesman, to resign
from his $200,000 a year job.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing committee also will stop paying a $10,000-a-month
consulting fee to Tom Welch, who resigned as SLOC president in 1997
after allegations against him of spouse abuse. Welch was the head
of Salt Lake's Olympic bids for both 1998 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Two other senior SLOC employees who were part of Salt Lake's
winning bid _ Kelly Flint, senior vice president of marketing and
legal affairs, and licensing director Rod Hamson _ were placed on
paid leave pending the outcome of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Salt Lake committee, Ken Bullock, called on
Samaranch to resign because bribery apparently occurred ``on his
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until president Samaranch follows Frank's example, the Olympic
movement will not be able to move forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has admitted receiving from Salt Lake two expensive
shotguns that exceeded the $150 limit on gifts to IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch, who has claimed that the rule does not apply to
him because he doesn't actually vote on bid cities, said that
refusing the gifts ``would have been a real insult.''
</P>
<P>
   About Friday's resignations, Samaranch said, ``They had to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joklik declined to call the misdeeds ``bribes,'' but he told
reporters that IOC members received cash payments; payments for
housing, travel, and education expenses for their relatives;
expensive gifts and free health care to IOC members and their
families; and assistance in making a Utah land deal that afforded
influential IOC memberJean Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of
Congo a $60,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 89 voting IOC members in 1995, 18 were from Africa and
12 were from South America, the areas to which payments were made.
Salt Lake received 54 votes to win on the first ballot. Ostersund,
Sweden and Sion, Switzerland _ the 2006 front-runner _ garnered 14
votes apiece and Quebec had 7.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik said that some of the payments might have legitimate
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC probably will change its voting procedures, which now
involve all of the more than 100 members. Samaranch has forbidden
IOC members from visiting the candidates for the 2006 Winter Games,
which will be awarded later this year.
</P>
<P>
   IOC director general Francois Carrard told Swiss television
Friday that the IOC had heard rumors of corruption for years but
had not been able to get hard proof until now. ``We have to clean
up our act,'' Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he would visit Salt Lake City this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want things to return to normal as soon as possible,''
Samaranch told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Carrard said Salt Lake's bid was ``of exceptional quality'' and
the city would have won the games on merit anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely certain that Salt Lake City didn't need to do
this sort of thing to win. The value of the bid was absolutely
incontestable.

THE NEXT 25 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, January 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been more than 25 years since, entering upon the vast sea
of discontent that was the 1970s, a group of graduate students at
Yale University set in motion the events that led to the formation
of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession
of the American Economic Association _ and so began to infiltrate
one of the last untroubled shores of male dominance.
</P>
<P>
   There had been women in economics in the 1950s and 1960s, but
they were discouraged from entering a field that was thought to be
too difficult for them. They didn't teach ordinarily at research
universities, perform research, or hold down leadership positions
in their professional associations.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they tended to undergraduate education in women's
colleges, and endured such gibes as the memorable one recorded by
Caroline Shaw Bell: ``An economics department at Wellesley? What do
you do? Teach the girls how to balance their checkbooks?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1970s, the trend has been encouraging. Colleges
and universities _ none more than Wellesley under the leadership of
the now-retired Bell _ have turned out a steady steam of talented
professionals for the business world: MBAs, lawyers, and PhD
economists. During the 1990s in particular, a large new cohort of
women economists ascended to top jobs, especially in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Rivlin (director of the Office of Management and Budget),
Anne Krueger (World Bank chief economist), Laura D'Andrea Tyson
(chairman of both the Council of Economic Advisers and the National
Economic Council), Janet Yellen (chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers), Alicia Munnell and Rebecca Blank (Council of
Economic Advisers members), June O'Neill (director of the
Congressional Budget Office), Janet Norwood and Katharine Abraham
(successive commissioners of the Bureau of Labor Statistics), and
Barbara Fraumeni (director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis): all
have served and made headlines during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Marina Von Neumann Whitman, who served for
a time on the Council of Economic Advisers under Richard Nixon, no
woman before had broken through to the top ranks of Washington
policy advisers. And when the first Caroline Shaw Bell Award to a
high-achieving woman was announced last week in New York, it went
to Alice Rivlin, the first woman to have served as president of the
AEA (in 1986!)
</P>
<P>
   She was too busy overseeing the city government of the District
of Columbia as chairman of its financial control board _ and
serving as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in her day
job _ to accept the plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Progress? There can be no doubt about it. Yet the situation may
not yet be as the arch-conservative Milton Friedman described it
the other day in a comment on the history of the Committee on the
Status of Women: ``The pendulum has probably swung too far so that
men are the ones currently being discriminated against.'' At least
not in the aggregate. The 118 American PhD-granting institutions
boast a total of only 116 female professors, compared with a couple
of thousand men.
</P>
<P>
   The membership list of the Econometric Society is especially
revealing of the problems of the next frontier. Of the 545 fellows
of this elite organization, only 10 are women. None of the women
who gained their fame in Washington are fellows. And only a couple
of the fellows _ Krueger of Stanford and Claudia Goldin of Harvard
_ are even slightly famous.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger and Goldin were recognized by their peers entirely for
their contributions to the formal body of economic knowledge, not
for policy work. The same goes for the other female members of the
Econometric Society _ Beth Allen of the University of Minnesota,
Anne Carter of Brandeis University, Gabrielle Demange of the
University of Paris, Birgit Grodal of the University of Copenhagen,
Rosa Matzkin of Northwestern University, Margaret Meyer of Oxford,
Jennifer Reinganum of Vanderbilt, and Nancy Stokey of the
University of Chicago _
</P>
<P>
   Special attention, therefore, is being paid to the cultivation
of today's brightest young female minds. Economics is a science,
after all. Its theorists, pure and applied, are its most
conspicuous citizens, and economics won't be more equal until more
of its top thinkers (as opposed to do-ers) are women. Here, too,
the numbers are changing, though not quickly. The National Bureau
of Economic Research is considered the cutting edge of applied
research. Among its 582 research associates _ virtually all of them
university professors _ 81 are women, or 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And coming up for tenure at the nation's leading universities is
a something new to the profession: a class of divas in their early
30s and late 20s, scholars whose voices can be expected to be among
those dominating the professional chorus in the coming years. A
short alphabetical list of the most prominent includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Susan Athey of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A
Stanford PhD, Athey works on problems in the economics of
organizations: the logic of mentoring, the preconditions for price
collusion among competitors; the allocation of decision-making
authority within firms. The mechanics of timber auctions is a
specialty; so is the culture of risk-averse firms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judith Chevalier of the University of Chicago's Graduate
School of Business. An MIT PhD, Chevalier studies aspects of the
relationships between corporate finance and product markets. How do
mutual fund managers sort themselves out? Do supermarkets taken
private in leveraged buyouts charge higher prices than other
chains? Why do managers undertake acquisitions? Chevalier last week
won CSWEPS' first Elaine Bennett Research Prize.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dora Costa of MIT. A University of Chicago PhD, Costa has been
working as an economic historian. Her first book, ``The Evolution
of Retirement: an American Economic History 1880-1990,'' won a
prize for outstanding writing on lifelong financial security given
by the huge university professors' pension fund. With her mentor,
Robert Fogel, Costa has been propounding a theory of ``technophysio
evolution,'' which is parallel but quite distinct from genetic
change..
</P>
<P>
   _ Caroline Hoxby of Harvard. An MIT PhD, Hoxby went to Oxford as
a Rhodes scholar out of Harvard College. As an applied theorist she
has been studying education _ vouchers, the competition between
public and private schools, and the effect of teachers' unions on
public education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Shannon of the University of California at Berkeley. A
Stanford PhD, Shannon is a high-brow general equilibrium theorist.
already tenured at the age of 31, she operates in a realm far
removed from economic policy, dealing with the sensitivies of
individual decisions and market equilibria to the institutional
settings in which they occur.
</P>
<P>
   The problem continues to be what those who have studied the
problem know as ``the rule of two.'' That is, only half of all
women who receive PhDs get university teaching jobs. Only half of
these get tenure, and only half of them rise to real distinction.
There are papers to be finished, children to be had, dual-career
decisions with husbands to be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Thus to produce one Beth Allen, Glaudia Goldin, Christina Romer,
Nancy Stokey, or Myrna Wooders _ all figures of well-established
standing in economics in their 40s and 50s _ it ordinarily takes
two highly promising young professors. Or at least it has in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trouble is that there is no dominant pattern,'' says Susan
Poso, a Western Michigan University professor who helped judge the
Bennett Prize contest. ``Women are going to graduate school a
little later these days. She comes up for tenure in her 30s. Each
one must keep an eye on her biological clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are continuing to smooth the path of women into
economics. The National Science Foundation, mindful that for many
years economics was thought to be as ``inappropriate'' for women as
mechanical engineering, has several projects underway. The
Committee on the Status of Women has begun its second 25 years with
a series of mentoring workshops designed to put one senior figure
together with five younger women for two days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it is the work of several generations _ but the future
is promising. Avinash Dixit of Princeton University notes: ``I
teach a very hard mathematical course in microeconomics to
undergraduates. It used to be thought that women shied away from
the harder subjects....But the composition of the class is 30-40
percent women now, and they do at least as well in the grade
distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 25 years in which women were encouraged to enter
technical economics were good, in other words. The next 25 years
should be better.

SENATE SEEKS TO MAINTAIN DIGNITY AS TRIAL LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Down the corridors the lawmakers fairly danced,
their mood approaching giddiness, as the Senate rallied on Friday
around its own need for dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Having sought sanctuary from the maddening politics of
impeachment in a hallowed gaslight-era chamber of the Capitol, the
senators emerged three hours later exulting in the rarest of news:
The clash of President Clinton and his House Republican accusers
was far from settled, but at least the nation would be treated to a
moment of bipartisan unanimity _ an armistice day of sorts _ in the
yearlong battering from the president's scandal over truth telling
and sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ayes are 100 and the nays are zero,'' the clerk read out
firmly in confirmation of this exceptional day, as if the issue
were the annual Mother's Day resolution and not the momentous trial
procedure for deciding whether Clinton should be banished from the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate sat silent at the unanimous result, unanimously
pleased that in their very first impeachment struggle they avoided
a nakedly partisan vote count that would have signaled the nation
that the bitterness of the House impeachment clash was leaching
into the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we went to the rancor of the House, we'd have totally
failed,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont before the vote. ``I
think most of us, Republicans and Democrats, know the House failed
miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the agreement was clearly tinged with procrastination, with
the most sensitive issue of calling witnesses to be put off until
the first showdown test of whether there are 67 votes to convict
and remove the president. For all the procrastination, at least it
is dignified procrastination, both sides emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are interested in is dignity in the Senate,'' said
Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama as the senators broke from their
meeting and headed for the vote in a mood of high hope. ``We are
not interested in a pornographic movie,'' he added, delighted that
the Senate's opening image offered no repeat of the House's
ceremonial caravan delivery of boxes of salacious evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Far from indulging an early rereading of the accusatory
``narrative'' of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the
Senate found inspiration in its private morning gathering from a
cautionary allusion to Chaucer's Pardoner's Tale of ruination among
schemers.
</P>
<P>
   Across a corridor milling with senators upbeat in their
fellowship, Charles Schumer of New York gave a cautious read-out to
the agreement but concluded, ``There is a genuine feeling at this
point in time, at least, on each side, that the Senate loses and
the country loses by a partisan donnybrook.'' So the senators
decided to agree not to disagree right now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, the beginning happened,'' he said, trying to
outline the political finesse of the day, in which plans were
firmly set for hearing the opening arguments and motions. ``And
then after that happens, we see what happens,'' the senator added
with a smile and a shrug of hope.
</P>
<P>
   On this day of Senate unanimity, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
was resummoned from the judiciary branch to take up the Senate
trial gavel. As if in checks-and-balances payback, he had to
journey for the second day from a court that once unanimously ruled
that the president's troubles in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
civil suit could go forward with no great disruption of the
operations of the federal government likely. Now all three branches
find themselves deeply involved in the aftermath of the Jones suit.
</P>
<P>
   With the unanimous vote, the Senate gravely set the calendar and
procedures in place for the trial of the president. Rehnquist was
free to head back across the Capitol grounds to his own court to
await the trial next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The House Republican members prosecuting the impeachment were
put on notice to begin addressing the Senate promptly on Thursday.
``A compelling case'' was promised by Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois,
the chief prosecutor, who took care in a statement to allude to the
unsettled issue in the Senate agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prosecutors, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., had openly
questioned the Senate's impeachment resolve last October. ``How
little interest, how little backbone they have to really take on
tough issues,'' declared Barr of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But senators seemed unanimous in the positive pleasure of
letting House, White House and nation know that, on Friday at
least, they had the backbone to go on record against partisanship
in deciding the fate of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate itself was on trial,'' explained Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky. His fellow Republican, Phil Gramm of Texas,
saw the day's meaning as a moment of deliverance from the grueling
past year. ``Democracy is not a zero-sum game,'' he insisted.

 (ATTN: W.Va., Conn., Texas, Mass., Kan., N.J., Mich., Va., Miss.)   (See related IMPEACH, IMPEACH-CLINTON, IMPEACH-ASSESS,

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., guardian of dignity and
decorum, warned ominously that the Senate was on the verge of
tumbling into a ``black pit of partisan self-indulgence.'' Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., recalling the brutal caning of a senator
by a House member, raised the emotional stakes. And then the
unlikely political duo of Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., joined the 100 separate egos of the Senate in
what many called the Gramm-Kennedy Miracle, a pragmatic agreement
on how the Senate should proceed, at least for now, with the
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary session held in secret in the crimson and
gold-swathed amphitheater of the Old Senate Chamber, the nation's
100 senators were stirred by the ghosts of history Friday as they
sought to rise above the food fight over impeachment in which their
House counterparts had engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit of providence entered the old chamber, and we
achieved a nonpartisan spirit and accommodation,'' said Sen. Pat
Roberts, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said, ``We had a chance to allow the spirits of the
Websters, Calhouns and Clays to maybe infect us a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   They met in the ornate room last used as the Senate chamber in
1859, when the nation sat on the brink of a civil war brought on in
large measure by a conflict left unresolved for more than a
generation _ the place where the Missouri Compromise and a series
of famous side steps were sealed. And in that chamber the senators
agreed Friday to preserve bipartisan comity by leaving unresolved
their central conflict of whether witnesses would be allowed to
testify in the impeachment trial of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The historical resonance was so vivid, it overshadowed a concern
by some Democrats that they had left open the possibility for
witnesses, something the White House adamantly opposes. ``There was
some disappointment at the quick resolution,'' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J. ``No witnesses would have been the best for most
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed and said Kennedy had moved too fast. ``Some were
surprised he jumped in so quickly to agree with Gramm on that,''
said one Democrat. ``We perhaps gave up a tactical advantage.
Republicans had more to lose than we did. If we had held firm on
witnesses, they would have looked like partisan movers.''
</P>
<P>
   But agreement came when both sides, illuminated by Gramm and
Kennedy, decided they could at least start the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing that there was very little difference between the
two positions,'' Kennedy said, recalling the moment. ``The idea
gets us on first base and second base.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., said there was some concern on
his side too about not definitely providing for witnesses. He said
some Republicans were worried that ``we would be asked to
administer impartial justice without having adequate evidence to
make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed Friday to decide by Jan. 26 whether to call
witnesses, but that seemed a fluid goal. ``On the basis of today's
discussion, I find it very difficult to believe that by Jan. 26
there will be agreement'' on whether to call witnesses, said Sen.
Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   While Wellstone predicted an outbreak of acrimony when the
Senate is forced to resolve the witness issue, he said he was
encouraged by the tone set by Friday's two-and-a-half-hour
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still rather start out with positive atmospherics than
with a straight party vote,'' Wellstone said.
</P>

   Many senators attributed their accord, however temporary, to a
desire to rise to the dignity imposed by the Old Senate Chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all, in a minor way, products of history,'' said Sen.
John Warner, R-Va. ``When you stop to think of how many great
decisions that were before this nation were resolved in that
chamber, it definitely had something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber, built in 1819 and home to the Senate for the next
40 years, was the scene of sweeping debates of the 19th Century,
including those over slavery, the Missouri Compromise and states'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   As the size of the republic expanded, so did the size of the
Senate, and in 1859, the Senate moved to its current, more spacious
setting. The Old Senate Chamber was given over to the Supreme
Court, which met there until 1935.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Senate Chamber has been used periodically since then for
ceremonial functions and private discussions that senators want to
hold without the probing eye of the media. The Senate last convened
in the room on April 24, 1997, to discuss the chemical weapons
convention, which was secret for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Republican leader, chose the old
chamber for Friday's meeting for both privacy and decorum. And
leaders of both parties asked Byrd, the foremost expert on Senate
rules, to prepare opening remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd set a tone that many senators credited with uniting them in
the common goal of preserving the dignity of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He said, according to a transcript from his office: ``The White
House has sullied itself. The House has fallen into the black pit
of partisan self-indulgence. The Senate is teetering on the brink
of that same black pit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed the Senate ``can restore some order to the
anger which has overtaken this country and the chaos which
threatens this city,'' but added: ``At this moment, we look very
bad. We appear to be dithering and posturing and slowly
disintegrating into the political quicksand.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd then told the story of the Pardoner's Tale from Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales. It involves three men who find a pot of gold and
in their selfish zeal to grab the gold each for themselves, end up
killing each other.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd recalled some of the more dramatic moments that had taken
place in the old chamber, including the 1856 caning of a senator,
an event that he said signaled the end of an era of comity. He
evoked his awe for the institution, recalling that as a boy, he
watched his father, Sen. Thomas Dodd of Connecticut, sworn into
office. The elder Dodd was censured in 1967 by the Senate for
spending campaign contributions for personal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's turning point came when Gramm stood and asked his
colleagues if anyone would deny the president the right to call
witnesses. There was silence. He then said the House prosecutors
should not be denied the same right.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy then jumped in, proposing that the Senate delay for
another day the thorny question of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The others yelled out: ``So moved! Here! Here! Seal the deal!''
Several senators pounded their desks.

 &HT;    Around the corners: Ends key to both teams
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ From the Miami Dolphins' first defensive play of
today's AFC divisional-round matchup here, cornerback Sam Madison
will be in the faces of Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey. It's only when
Madison can get inside the heads of the Denver Broncos wide
receivers that he will be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   In just his second season, Madison finished second in the NFL
with eight interceptions and unofficially led the league in verbal
assault. The two, he insists, go hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``No malice intended, but I have taken trash-talk to new
heights,'' an unabashed Madison said earlier this week. ``When I
was a kid, my mouth was my equalizer against bigger guys in the
neighborhood. It's just something I've always done. It's not
personal, but it has a purpose. The way I see it, if I can disrupt
a receiver's concentration, get him worried more about my yappin'
than a route he's supposed to be running, I've already won half the
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison and cornerback partner Terrell Buckley comprise a
filibuster duo unmatched in the league. But they might require
megaphones to deliver their sharp-tongued jabs to the Broncos
receivers, who have significant height and weight.
</P>
<P>
   Smith (6 foot, 195 pounds) and McCaffrey (6-5, 215) will attempt
to outmuscle Madison (5-11, 180) and Buckley (5-9, 182). And when
the Broncos run tailback Terrell Davis, the wide receivers
typically provide effective downfield blocking.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dolphins defeated the Broncos 31-21 Dec. 21, they held
Davis to 29 yards on 16 carries. Defensive coordinator George Hill
used some unusual defenses in that game, but mostly the Dolphins
relied on penetration from the line and middle linebacker Zach
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan has been candid about the urgency to
get Davis started quickly today. Against a Miami defense that
arguably ranks as the quickest in the league _ but is playing
without tackle Tim Bowens and end Jason Taylor _ the Broncos want
to set a physical tone.
</P>
<P>
   That plan includes the wideouts being aggressive with the
Dolphins cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to run to be effective,'' McCaffrey said. ``And to be
effective, Rod and (I) have to block well on the edge. Their
corners want to come up on us and get into our bodies in the
passing game. In the running game, we want to get into them. If we
can toss 'em around some in the running game, those corners will
wear down.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Broncos aren't likely to erode, though, is Madison's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who haven't seen me all year,'' Madison said, ``are
going to be saying, `Who is that No. 29 playing for Miami?' And
I'll be only too happy to tell them.

HUBBLE DISCOVERS PLANETS CIRCLING A STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Spectacular new pictures taken by the Hubble
Space Telescope reveal strong evidence of two planets circling a
nearby star, which would make it the first multiple-planet system
discovered beyond our own.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow dust ring that photographs show around a star in the
constellation Libra is, astronomers believe, kept in place by two
``shepherding'' planets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 17 other stars have been found to have planets, but only
one planet has been detected in each case. Astronomers have long
hoped to find a multiple-planet system other than our own, because
studying such systems could help to reveal more about the process
of how planets form, and show that our sun's family is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   The only multiple planets found before were orbiting the
burned-out remnants of dead stars, called pulsars, and are thought
to have been formed by completely different processes than normal
planets. Furthermore, they are in hellish environments of high
temperature and radiation that preclude any possibility of life _
one of the main reasons astronomers are interested in finding other
planets in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The ring gives the star in Libra an appearance very much like
that of the ringed planet Saturn in our own solar system, and
astronomer Bradley Smith of the University of Hawaii said at a
meeting of the American Astronomical Society that the ring around
the star HR4796A almost certainly formed in the same way as one of
Saturn's narrow outer rings.
</P>
<P>
   Those rings are held in place by two moons orbiting very close
to them, one just inside the ring and one just outside. Without
these ``shepherding'' moons, the rings would quickly spread out
into a broad disk.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Smith said Friday, there is no known way a
narrow ring of small particles around another star could exist
without the presence of a pair of sheperding planets _ even though
the planets themselves cannot yet be seen in these Hubble images.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Marcy, the University of California at San Francisco
astronomer who has discovered or co-discovered most of the planets
beyond the sun that have been found so far, agreed Friday that
``when you see rings, something has to confine those rings.'' That
something, according to the Hubble team, must be planets, because
anything larger would certainly have been visible in the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Several other stars have been found in recent years to be
surrounded by disks of dust and gas, but this is the first case of
a ring around another sun _ and thus the first clear evidence for
planets ever found in this way.
</P>
<P>
   Other planets of nearby stars have been discovered by analyzing
the motions of the stars themselves to see the telltale wobbles in
their motions caused by the gravitational pull of planets. And the
existence of one planet was inferred around a star called Beta
Pictoris because of a warping seen in a disk of gas that surrounds
that star.
</P>
<P>
   The new pictures were taken by a camera called NICMOS, or
Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer, installed on
the Hubble telescope during its last servicing mission by space
shuttle astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Another picture taken by NICMOS as part of the same series of
images of stars in search of dust disks also provides evidence for
a planet. In this case, the planet is revealed by the presence of a
dark gap in an otherwise continuous disk of dust surrounding the
star, suggesting that a planet has swept clean a path through the
disk. This apparent planet was found by a team of astronomers at
the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And four other stars whose pictures were taken by NICMOS also
show signs of the influence of planets, but the astronomers have
not yet had time to study these closely and could not yet provide
any details.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that astronomers had known that it might be possible
for such a narrow ring of debris to be found around another star,
but he said that ``we knew it could exist, but we didn't really
expect to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The star in question is about twice as massive as our sun, and
is believed to be very young _ only about 10 million years old,
compared to the sun's age of nearly 5 billion years. The star is
about 220 light years away from the sun (or about 1,300 trillion
miles). And the ring is very far out from the star, far beyond the
distance of the sun's outermost planets. It orbits the star at
about 70 times the Earth's distance from the sun, while Pluto, the
sun's outermost planet, is only about half that distance.
</P>
<P>
   Planets are believed to form by the gradual buildup of matter in
a ring of dust surrounding a star, as particles collide and stick
together over time. But ``this is going to be a challenge to those
who study planet formation,'' Smith said. ``As you go farther and
farther out, the amount of matter keeps decreasing... Collisions
occur far less frequently, and it takes a longer period of time for
a planet to build up.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Eric Becklin of UCLA pointed out, the opposite problem
came up when several giant planets were discovered in recent years
orbiting much closer to their stars than the solar system's giant
planet Jupiter. ``No respectable theorist would have predicted that
a Jupiter-sized planet could form at such close distances,'' he
said. But once they were found, theorists quickly came up with
explanations for their existence so close to the star, suggesting
that they might have formed further out and then migrated inward.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, explanations for such distant planets will likely be
devised now that evidence for them has been found; in fact, the
same kind of migration might account for the far-out planets as
well as the far-in ones. The other planet found by the NICMOS
images, the one responsible for producing a dark gap in the disk of
dust, is even farther out _ about 245 times the Earth's distance
from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Beckwith, newly named as director of the Space Telescope
Science Institute in Baltimore, said that such pictures would never
have been possible without the power of the refurbished Hubble
telescope. ``This is very important work,'' he said, and ``10 years
ago this kind of picture was not even a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that when the pictures of the Saturn-like dust ring
first were received from the Hubble telescope, the astronomers
immediately ``looked at that and said `Wow!' It kind of blew us
away.''

<P>
   Selling Ferraris to Americans is no longer just a matter of
flattering the customers and wearing Armani suits really well.
While the current models are knock-down gorgeous, they are also far
more expensive than the Porsches, BMWs and Jaguars that can be
nearly as alluring.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ferraris have a reputation for being difficult to drive
and needing service every third time they circle the block.
</P>
<P>
   The latter criticism is simply unfair. Though expensive to
maintain, Ferraris are hardy, well-built cars. And while the most
famous Ferrari of the modern era _ the Testarossa _ was dangerously
overpowered, the road manners of the current lineup have been
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ferrari began offering a Formula One-style transmission
on its entry-level eight-cylinder, 375-horsepower, rear-engine
355s. And it is now available on all three 355 models _ the Spider
convertible, the TS targa top and the B coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists may dismiss the new technology as a $9,500
gimmick. But I expect that just about everyone else will be
delighted with this hybrid that combines the best features of
manuals and automatics.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who crave control _ not to mention maximum acceleration
_ overwhelmingly opt for manual transmissions. The catch, of
course, is that stick shifts require some skill to use well, and
they are a pain to operate in heavy urban traffic.
</P>
<P>
   With the large majority of car buyers preferring automatics,
many manufacturers are making theirs smoother and more versatile.
The current flavor of the month is the Tiptronic-style automatic
transmission, which can be shifted at the touch of a lever or
button. This simulates a manual without the bother of a clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari first tried its hybrid transmission on race cars in
1989, and competing Formula One teams all subsequently adopted
similar technology. The idea is simple: Electrically driven
hydraulic pumps, controlled by a computer, operate an otherwise
conventional clutch and gearbox. To shift gears, the driver simply
flicks either of two paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   This eliminates the need to take one hand off the wheel to
change gears, and it reduces the time engine power is denied to the
axle. And the computer eliminates the risk that the driver will
accidentally skip a gear when downshifting, which can destroy an
engine.
</P>
<P>
   What works so well on the track also works on the street.
Steering wheel-mounted paddles run the 355F1 up and down through
all six gears at the driver's discretion. But the transmission is
fail-safe, automatically opting for a lower gear when the engine
speed goes below 1,300 revolutions per minute, or a higher gear
when the engine exceeds the red line at 8,600 rpm. If the clutch
overheats from excessive use, a warning buzzer sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Touch both paddles simultaneously and the engine goes into
neutral. A separate, console-mounted lever shifts gears from
neutral to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   In ``normal'' mode, the computer eases out the clutch slowly to
minimize the jerk. In ``sport'' mode, the clutch engages very
rapidly, reducing the shift time to a quarter-second _ roughly half
what professionals need to change gears manually. Drivers always
have the option of ``automatic'' mode, in which the computer
chooses the shift points as well as operating the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who generally use their Ferraris to see and be seen
around town won't get much from the F1 transmission. The throttle
seems oddly leaden from a slow start as the computer engages the
clutch. And while downshifting is improved at any speed _ you
barely feel the gears change _ upshifting comes with a bit of a
thud.
</P>
<P>
   In aggressive driving, though, the new transmission is a
delight. The most pronounced difference is the ease and speed of
shifting under full throttle: no missed gears, no flirting with
damage to the engine at the red line, no-brainer acceleration from
zero to 60 in an astonishing 4.6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   More important virtues include seamless downshifting at very
high engine speeds, along with the better control that comes with
keeping both hands on the wheel at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Is the F3551 Spider worth $147,615? (Or $144,265 for the TS
version, $137,725 for the B version?) Only your psychiatrist and
your stockbroker can say for sure. What is clear is that the F1
transmission is a major innovation, one that gives Ferrari a real
performance edge in the rarefied world of street-legal supercars. &QL;

   Rebounding from the nasty summer selloff, managers of United
States diversified stock funds breathed a sigh of relief in the
fourth quarter. On average, their funds returned a gratifying 18.8
percent. The strong close pulled their average returns up to 15.1
percent for 1998, though that was still far behind the 24 percent
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the top-performing equity managers whistled an even happier
tune, with quarterly returns of up to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Here, four winners for the quarter look back at what made them
such standouts _ and offer a glance ahead. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a double whammy this year,'' said Douglas S. Foreman,
who manages the $256.6 million Morgan Stanley Dean Witter TCW
Mid-Cap Equity Trust from Los Angeles. The fund returned 49.2
percent in the fourth quarter, landing in third place among United
States diversified stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had companies that met or beat earnings expectations when
many companies were falling short, so the value of our predictable
growth went up measurably during the year,'' Foreman said. ``Also,
falling interest rates boost stock prices for companies which are
exceeding earnings expectations, because the earnings are worth
more as investment alternatives become less attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, at 6.1 percent of assets, was his biggest hit for the
quarter and for the year, up 584.3 percent in 1998. ``We think the
company is unbelievably well positioned to capitalize on the
Internet, which is a paradigm shift in technology and in the way
people communicate,'' he said. He sees annual earnings gains
topping 50 percent for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Another good performer was Best Buy, a consumer electronics
chain, at 3.2 percent of the fund. It rose 231.8 percent. ``New
management has engineered a terrific turnaround,'' Foreman said. He
expects the company to exceed consensus earnings forecasts of $2.25
a share for its fiscal year ending in February 2000, up from $1.98
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman does not expect the economic troubles of Southeast Asia
to end until late 1999. But he does not see further interest-rate
cuts in the United States. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Jim D. Oelschlager, who manages the $57 million Pin Oak
Aggressive Stock fund, technology is the bellwether sector for his
fund _ and for the nation. Pin Oak returned 44 percent in the
quarter, capturing eighth place among United States diversified
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that what's occurring in technology today is
equivalent to the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that the 24 stocks in Pin Oak are mostly
technology companies. One of his biggest fourth-quarter winners, up
69.1 percent, was Applied Materials, which makes semiconductor
manufacturing equipment. ``When the Asian contagion started in late
1997, no one thought anybody would build another plant,''
Oelschlager said. That pessimism has faded. He expects earnings
growth of 20 percent to 30 percent a year for the next three to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   He also made money in Cisco Systems, the networking hardware
giant, which rose 50.2 percent in the quarter. ``There's a lot of
questions as to who will be the big Internet winners, but we know
Cisco will, because they're building the infrastructure used by the
Amazon.coms and other Internet companies,'' he said. He expects
earnings to grow more than 30 percent annually over three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   As for 1999? ``I'm a raging bull,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter turmoil spelled fourth-quarter opportunity for
Frederick R. Kobrick, who runs the $41.4 million Kobrick Capital
fund, formerly Kobrick-Cendant Capital. He found much value in
1998, the fund's first year of operation, as stocks were
periodically beaten down.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which owns 65 stocks, returned 40.3 percent for the
quarter, placing 13th among United States diversified stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When financials were chewed up in late summer, we bought a lot
of banks and brokerages,'' which accounted for about 20 percent of
the fund at the peak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick made money with Chase Manhattan, which he bought in
early October at $40 a share. It finished the year at $71. He likes
the company for its diversified income sources. ``Chase does
banking around the world and is expanding rapidly in Europe as it
embraces the euro,'' Kobrick said. He expects per-share earnings
growth of 30 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other fourth-quarter winners was the EMC Corp., which
he called the leader in mass data storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management is brilliant, and the company is run
conservatively, so they usually beat earnings estimates,'' Kobrick
said. He called EMC ``a great long-term growth company'' and
expects EMC's stock price and sales to double in the next two and a
half years. He sees a 40 percent increase in per-share earnings in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick said he was optimistic about 1999. ``Profits will be
better than the consensus thinks,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sandra K. Durn, who runs the $265.5 million Nicholas-Applegate
Convertible Income Shares from San Diego, returned 19.9 percent in
the fourth quarter, finishing in first place among taxable bond
funds. She attributes the strong finish to the equity-type analysis
she uses to buy convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own convertibles where the underlying company has strong
fundamentals and a positive outlook, which makes us different from
other convertible managers, who focus more on yield than company
prospects,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, she expects convertible bonds in her portfolio to
give her 80 percent of any upward movement of the common stock, but
50 percent or less of any downward movements. That is what kept her
out of trouble in 1998, she said: ``By focusing on these criteria,
we've missed the big blow-ups in convertibles this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her top money makers were convertible preferred shares in
Cox Communications, a cable company. ``They have a growing
subscriber base and are adding new services,'' Ms. Durn said. She
projects a 15 percent annual earnings growth rate over five years.
</P>
<P>
   She also made money with the convertibles of Costco, the
warehouse retailer. The chain has posted what she described as
``very impressive'' sales growth of about 12 percent. ``And they
recently launched a new regional store in Chicago which is doing
very well,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Ms. Durn is optimistic. ``We feel that the market
will continue to be strong, at least for the first part of 1999,''
she said. ``Interest rates should stay low, which should prevent a
slump in corporate profits.''

 &HT;    Lewis plays big _ but not too big
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the two first met in the spring of 1997, New York
Jets linebacker Mo Lewis made a weighty impression on his new
coach. Nearly two years later, and with Lewis 30 pounds leaner than
at that forgettable minicamp, the impression Bill Parcells has now
is that he inherited one of the top linebackers in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him, I thought, `This can't be the guy
everyone has been telling me about,''' Parcells said. ``He looked
like a walrus. I thought he was a lineman and not a linebacker. He
looked like he had the mumps or something. But now he looks like a
Pro Bowl linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what the long-deserving Lewis officially has
become.
</P>
<P>
   For eight seasons, Lewis, who played at J.C. Murphy High in
Atlanta and the University of Georgia, has been one of the NFL's
best-kept secrets. His teammates twice voted him the Jets most
valuable player. Similar recognition, however, eluded Lewis when it
came to the league-wide Pro Bowl and All-Pro balloting. In both
1994 and 1997, Lewis' play was superior to the linebackers in the
Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That oversight ended last month when Lewis, 29, was chosen as a
starter on the AFC squad for the first time and also was selected
first-team All-Pro.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the honors came as Lewis was becoming less
interested in individual trappings and more determined to help the
Jets reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing I could do about the Pro Bowl voting,''
Lewis said. ``But I had control over how this team performed. There
are a lot of of guys who would trade in all their Pro Bowl trips
for one Super Bowl ring. I can buy me and my family a trip to
Hawaii, but I can't buy a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory against Jacksonville Sunday will move Lewis and the
Jets one step closer to a Super Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising New York defense under Bill Belichick features a
distinctly Georgia flavor. End Anthony Pleasant was a backup with
the Falcons in 1997. One tackle, Ernie Logan, is a former Atlanta
draft pick; the other, Jason Ferguson, was a standout at Georgia.
Hard-hitting strong safety Victor Green is a native of Americus.
Dwayne Gordon, a key backup linebacker, played his first two NFL
seasons in Atlanta. Although he has played the strong side during
Parcells' two seasons, Lewis has been a model of versatility since
joining the Jets as a third-round choice in 1991. Early in his
career, he lined up on the weak side. On occasions, when injuries
forced it, he played in the middle. And Lewis also has played end
in nickel situations.
</P>
<P>
   This season was testimony to his all-around abilities. Lewis was
second on the team in tackles (81), led in sacks (seven) and had
two interceptions, nine deflections and a fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a lot of linebackers, he doesn't come off the field,''
linebackers coach Al Groh said. ``The guy is a legitimate
playmaker. Really, he's our 'glue' guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were times during the regime of Rich Kotite that Lewis
became a 'goo' guy, letting his weight get into the 270s, looking
sluggish and playing hard only when the spirit moved him. At 258
pounds, he remains one of the NFL's bigger linebackers, but he
carries the weight well. He can run through running backs when they
are in pass protection and run with them when they swing out of the
backfield as receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a smarter player now, too, in every way,'' said Lewis, who
comes home during the offseason and spends much of his time here
bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Groh, while agreeing that Lewis has become more analytical, said
he thinks a bigger reason for Lewis' ascent is his emotional
maturity. Too often in the past, Lewis and Groh said, he would play
out of control and free-lance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question Mo had to answer was, 'How can I keep my cool
but still keep the heat up?''' Groh said. ``There were times he
just let his anger override his brain. Now, he'll still get steamed
about something, but it won't boil over and affect his performance.

SHORT ITEMS ON PERSONAL BUSINESS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, CREDIT CARDS ARE HANDY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is almost a rite of passage for struggling independent film
makers, six months out of school and a week away from bagging
groceries for a living, to finance a movie on a credit card. Well,
perhaps their example has helped inspire a generation of business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of 504 small and midsized businesses by
Arthur Andersen's Enterprise Group and National Small Business
United, a trade group, 47 percent of the owners said they had used
credit cards to finance their businesses in the previous 12 months.
That was up from 34 percent in 1997 and 17.3 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards are now the leading financing instrument used by
these businesses, the survey said; commercial loans were second, at
45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of owners who used their cards only occasionally
to make ends meet dropped to just 10 percent of respondents,
compared with 24 percent in 1997. Moreover, the number who paid off
card balances each month fell sharply, to 38 percent from nearly 60
percent. &QL;

   ROOM IN THE BOARDROOM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Got time on your hands? Looking for a part-time job? You could
always follow the example of Newt Gingrich and consider membership
on a corporate board.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find these spots in the want ads, but they're out
there. According to Craig L. Fuller, chairman of global board
services for Korn/Ferry International, the executive recruiting
firm, more than 75 percent of the nation's 500 largest companies
will have at least one board vacancy in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a chief executive might have served on four or
five boards. Now, many chiefs are cutting back on board
memberships, usually limiting themselves to their own boards and
one other.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their prestige in the business world, some of these
spots may not be easy to fill. For one thing, Fuller said,
Korn/Ferry's annual directors study showed that the average outside
director spent 159 hours a year on board meetings and preparation.
No wonder that lack of time is the main reason people give for
turning down board positions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you join a corporate board, prepare for real work.
``It used to be a private club, but those days are history,''
Fuller said. Many chief executives are looking for candidates with
a knowledge of technology to help companies keep current. Members
from abroad are also sought, Fuller said, because they have
networks of relationships overseas. &QL;

FACING THE MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``What's going on?''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Gaye's famous '70s refrain is being sung all over again
throughout the music industry as artists, managers and label
employees try to figure out what Seagram's $10.4 billion takeover
of Polygram means to them.
</P>
<P>
   For the fan on the street, the New World Order _ which puts the
new Universal Music Group (UMG) at No. 1 as the largest and most
powerful record conglomerate in the industry _ means artist rosters
will be pared down and familiar labels such as Island, Mercury,
Motown, Geffen, London and A&AMP;M cut back to mere skeleton crews in
order to save millions in worldwide costs.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible those famous imprints _ embossed on albums by
artists ranging from Billie Holiday to Bob Marley &AMP; the Wailers to
Nirvana _ eventually may disappear entirely, replaced by a single
company logo: the spinning globe of Universal.
</P>
<P>
   The roster of the new conglomerate embraces acts in virtually
every genre. They include global sellers Cecilia Bartoli, Beck,
Andrea Bocelli, Counting Crows, the Cranberries, Jay-Z, Sheryl
Crow, DMX (who has the first No. 1 album debut of the new year),
Elton John, Hole, No Doubt, Shania Twain, U2, the Wallflowers,
Sting, Hanson, George Strait, Stevie Wonder and Luciano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   But lesser-known artists with moderate sales are in a holding
pattern. Acts such as rockers Girls Against Boys and former 'Til
Tuesday singer Aimee Mann are said to be cutting new records
financed by Geffen. If acts such as these end up getting dropped _
and it's expected two-thirds of the rosters at each label will be
cut outright _ the parent company owns the master tapes, but
probably would offer most artists the option of buying back their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, well-known acts such as Melissa Etheridge and the
Cranberries have been forced to delay release of their latest
albums as the dust clears. And superstars Sting and U2 reportedly
are exploring options at other labels.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the new superpower decides what to do about its new
acquisitions, it was announced that 1998 musical sales were up
almost 10 percent over the previous year. Leading the breakdown in
genres was r&AMP;b, followed by alternative rock, rap, country and
soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram is placing enormous stock in its latest entry into the
entertainment field. In fact, the day before the announcement of
the Polygram purchase last month, the liquor giant announced that
Universal Studios had a loss of $65 million for the fiscal second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UMG _ which shrinks the number of major record companies from
six to five _ may not be the only new conglomerate of the new year.
Insiders predict that BMG is looking into the purchase of EMI
Group, thus further shrinking the field to four.
</P>
<P>
   To find out how the merger will affect the music we hear, who
gets signed and how it's marketed, we asked a range of music
professionals. To see what it could mean to the consumer, we hit
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is rampant that acts will be dropped in the next few
weeks if it's found that they sold less than 200,000 copies of
their most recent album.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, UMG officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Labels constantly re-evaluate their roster, a company spokesman
said, adding that there are numerous factors that must be
considered before letting an act go, including how much was spent
in terms of recording, promotion and tour support.
</P>
<P>
   However, UMG officials confirmed that many acts will be given
pink slips, even while ironically insisting that artist development
still would be a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as concerned as many others,'' said the manager of a
well-known band signed to a label expected to be among the hardest
hit. ``It's younger artists just starting a career or who've made a
record that's not out yet who are the most worried. Chances are
they won't have a record label anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer-songwriter Robbie Fulks has said he used to talk to
executives at Geffen every day. These days, he told The New York
Times, it's gone silent, with ``secretaries over there giving me
the impression that it's like Dresden after the war.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of label support, Fulks and other acts caught in a
holding pattern because of the merger have been promoting their
records themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing as many shows as I'd like to now, just what I
can afford,'' Fulks said. ``There are some places where I can make
money, other places where if I play without a band I can make some
money. It's not nearly as much as I'd like to be performing, but
I'm not going to just wait around and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up has allowed some acts to sit back and re-evaluate
their careers at a time when the Internet and other means of
distribution could mean much higher royalty rates, even as high as
$5 per album compared to $1.50 per record at the major labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``A band with a name and a reputation will have a place,'' the
manager said. ``But the question is, do those kind of bands want to
remain with the majors or are they now looking for alternative ways
to get their records out? There are a lot of options out there for
proven acts. If a major label isn't going to help a band increase
their sales base, then this is a good time to completely
reassess.''
</P>
<P>
   While competing labels large and small almost certainly will
cherry pick some of the discarded acts, not every label plans to go
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll be going after the major label acts unless
we already have a relationship with that band,'' said Scott
Giampino of Touch and Go, a 20-year-old Chicago indie that worked
alternative acts such as Girls Against Boys, the Jesus Lizard and
the B.H. Surfers years before they signed with major labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just how we are,'' he said. ``But it's like free agency
in basketball _ it's going to be a huge free market. It won't
affect us because we try and work acts from the ground up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the retail counter, at least, the song remains the same,
although the number of new releases has dwindled since last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point nothing's changed in terms of how we deal with
the company,'' said Bob Say, vice president of the Valley-based
Moby Disc chain. ``They say it'll be six months before they're able
to consolidate warehousing. So, at this point anyway, the product
keeps arriving the same way. I don't see any effect at all for at
least six months. The first effect will be people getting laid
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The new music group will be led by a mixture of industry
veterans and new executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the top is longtime record man Doug Morris, chairman and CEO
of Universal Music Group. Morris started in the industry in the
early '60s at indie Laurie Records, eventually becoming chairman of
the Atlantic and Warner Bros. labels before moving to the executive
suite at MCA.
</P>
<P>
   Morris describes the new organization as ``lean, flexible'' with
a ``strong entrepreneurial spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Two label groups will be based in Los Angeles _ Interscope Music
Group, consisting of Interscope, Geffen and A&AMP;M, and MCA Records
Group, which includes MCA Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   UMG expects to purchase the half of Interscope it doesn't
presently own, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Island and Mercury will be merged to form the
Island/Mercury Group, while Universal Records will include Motown,
Polydor and Def Jam.
</P>
<P>
   Verve, GRP and Impulse! also in New York, will cover jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The company also leads the classical music business with control
of Deutsche Grammophon, Decca and Philips.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan, labels specializing in urban and country
music, including Motown, red hot Def Jam and Mercury Nashville will
not undergo major changes, illustrating the strength of the rap,
r&AMP;b and country genres in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Losses at other rock-based labels were said to be largely the
fault of a glut of unproven alternative rock signings that received
little radio play and sold few copies.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four main record groups is expected to be pared down
to around 100 acts and less than 200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The integration of the label operations means warehouses and
plants will be closed and jobs in all departments shed, some
beginning in the next few weeks, it's predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Scott Davis of the Schroder &AMP; Co. investment firm told
Bloomberg News as many as 20 percent of the labels' 15,500
employees could be fired in a restructuring process that will last
until summer.
</P>
<P>
   The date mentioned most frequently as D-Day for label employees
is Friday, but in fact that's supposedly when the heads of
Interscope and Island/Mercury will meet with Seagram president
Edgar Bronfman Jr. to present plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rank and file UMG employees are under strict orders not to
comment on the downsizing, but some said under condition of
anonymity that waiting was the hardest part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to pretend there's nothing going on because
there's nothing we can do about it,'' said a staffer at a label
expected to be among the hardest hit. ``We just wish they'd get on
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added another: ``There's nothing to do around here except
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Insiders reported Friday that Interscope now officially was
working all A&AMP;M and Geffen records, leaving many staffers at the
latter two companies essentially free to search for new employment.
</P>
<P>
   Some have been lobbying artist management companies and
competing labels for jobs since before Christmas even as longtime
acts drop by the offices for goodbyes. Influential industry weekly
HITS magazine recently joined music trade groups in compiling lists
of music pros who've been displaced in the ongoing consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the feeling if we'd been selling as many records today
as we were in the '80s, none of this would be happening, at least
at Geffen,'' Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan said at Geffen
offices that soon will be put on the block. ``I've known a lot of
these people for years, and pretty soon they're going to be looking
for new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   McKagan said he wasn't even sure if and when his new album,
delivered to the label late last year, would be issued.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear a music biz monopoly as a result of the Polygram
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good for the music scene,'' said Los Angeles radio
personality Jim Ladd. ``Some of the best music we had came out of
start-ups that had a vision, like A&AMP;M and Island. They saw a band
that inspired them, that wouldn't have been signed to a major, and
took a chance. I'm a real old-time capitalist, meaning the more
freedom in the marketplace, the better. But these entertainment
monoliths ... it's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Universal's plan, Geffen and A&AMP;M _ two labels sold
by their previous owners during the past decade _ will be folded
into Interscope, one of the world's most successful recording
companies thanks to hits from controversial acts such as Tupac
Shakur, Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If UMG controls the industry, it control the prices,'' said
longtime rock fan Simon Romero, a West Los Angeles resident who
says he buys hundreds of CDs each year. ``Money has to go to the
artist, but a lot of money is probably going places it shouldn't
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero, who recalls as a teen seeing blues great Muddy Waters at
the Troubadour more than 30 years ago, fears the disappearance of
beloved label imprints _ like the familiar palm tree that adorned
releases from the Island label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of buying a CD and seeing the band's original
label on there,'' he said. ``But I know how it works _ the big fish
eat the little fish. Bands use indies as a springboard to the
majors or else the majors just buy the indies.'' &QL;

   Direct-marketed, or no-load, fund firms have made a striking
success story in 401(k) and defined-contribution retirement plans.
Assets quadrupled to $52.9 billion in 1997, from $13.6 billion in
1996, and accounted for 49.4 percent of all money flowing into such
funds, according to a study by Cerulli Associates, a research and
consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Although 1998 numbers are not yet available, the trend is likely
to continue, said Kurt Cerulli, a principal of the firm. He expects
total assets in 401(k) and defined-contribution retirement plans to
reach $850 billion by the end of 2000, from $554 billion at the end
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Cerulli projects that assets of no-load funds in
distribution channels like mutual fund marketplaces and sales by
investment advisers will account for 23 percent of the market by
2002, up from 15 percent in 1995.

 &HT;    Jackets making the grade
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Counting the opening game of the ACC Tournament,
Georgia Tech will play at least 30 games this season, and with a
10-5 record at midseason, the Yellow Jackets have surprised some
people.
</P>
<P>
   Tech suffered through three ``character builders'' _ a 41-point
embarrassment vs. Kentucky, a 61-42 debacle against Hofstra and a
41-point defeat at Duke _ but it also has shown that it can play.
The Jackets beat a decent West Virginia team, surprised Georgia and
North Carolina in Atlanta and beat Iona, a team that could make it
to the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cremins' team also was in position to beat N.C. State, but
lost in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   After half of the season, here's how the Jackets stand, with
most of their conference schedule in front of them, including
Florida State at home at noon today.
</P>
<P>
   Backcourt: C-minus. Cremins is trying to teach his fifth point
guard in five years. Tony Akins will be an adequate point guard
before it's all over, but he's going through growing pains now.
Akins has 74 turnovers and 76 assists, an unacceptable ratio.
Off-guard Jason Floyd, despite two games of more than 30 points and
three others in the 20s, is the weak link. Floyd has trouble
creating his own shot and disappeared in big games.
</P>
<P>
   Frontcourt: B. In nine games, Indiana transfer Jason Collier
leads Tech in scoring and rebounding, averaging 17.2 points and 6.1
rebounds. Jon Babul grabs 7.5 rebounds a game, is the team's best
defender, takes the charge, goes to the floor for loose balls and
makes the extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   Center: B-plus. Alvin Jones can score _ he had 23 against N.C.
State _ averages 10.6 rebounds a game and is second in the nation
in blocks with 68.
</P>
<P>
   Bench: B. T.J. Vines has given the Jackets a lift, averaging 6.6
points. Darryl LaBarrie, the Florida A&AMP;M transfer, has been a
pleasant surprise, scoring 4.5 and handling the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Other: C. Cremins might be doing one of his better jobs with
this group, which has little experience and no senior leadership.
Injuries have hurt the Jackets. Star Dion Glover is missing the
season with a knee injury. Babul lost four games to an ankle
injury, Akins has a strained ACL, Collier lost 18 pounds because of
a bleeding ulcer and Jones has been hobbled by ankle and knee
problems. This team is not a tough one, either mentally or
physically, but it could get better in both areas.
</P>
<P>
   Overall: B-minus. With a 10-5 record, Tech already has surprised
some critics. If Collier, Jones and Akins continue to improve, and
with the ACC somewhat down this season, Tech could finish in the
middle of the pack.

 &HT;    Turnovers are Driesell's main concern now
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia State coach Lefty Driesell saw enough in an
86-70 loss to Central Florida in Orlando five days ago to know that
his Panthers will have a tough game at home today against the
Golden Knights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They led us by 23 points in the second half,'' Driesell said.
``They're a talented team that's big and deep. It's going be a
tremendous challenge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State avenged a seven-point loss to Florida Atlantic by
knocking off the Owls 87-70 Thursday night and will try to do the
same against the Knights, who have won three straight Trans America
Athletic Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Traina, a 6-foot-5 senior forward who scored a game-high 25
points in Central Florida's 16-point victory over the Panthers,
scored 33 Thursday night in a 90-79 win over Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Driesell is concerned about Traina, but not as much as he is
about his team taking care of the ball. Against Florida Atlantic,
the Panthers had 23 turnovers. Point guard Kevin Morris, who scored
a game-high 31 points, had 11 of the turnovers, including 10 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we've got to do a better job of
limiting our number of turnovers,'' Driesell said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Atlantic apparently realized that Morris, who played 37
minutes, was the only Panther who would put the ball on the floor.
The Owls constantly tried to trap the 6-foot sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, when off-guard Anton Reese returned after
sitting for 14 minutes because of foul trouble, Morris was
effective running the offense and scoring.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, Clark Atlanta (5-6) and struggling AU Center
rival Morris Brown (1-7) play in the first of two regular-season
meetings, at 8 p.m. today in CAU's gym. The women play at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   West Georgia (11-2, 2-0), sitting atop the East Division of the
Gulf South Conference, will battle state rival Valdosta State (5-8,
0-2) on the road at 7:30 p.m. today in the first of their two
regular-season meetings.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at the Centerplex in Macon, Fort Valley State's women
and men play rival Albany State, at 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: GA. STATE VS. CENTRAL FLORIDA

   Records: Central Florida 7-6 (3-0); Georgia State 6-8 (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Series: Central Florida leads 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida update: Against Georgia State five days ago,
senior forward Brad Traina was hot, going 8-for-12 from 3-point
range and finishing with 25 points in an 86-70 victory. Traina had
33 points in a 90-79 win at Campbell on Thursday night. The Golden
Knights feature former Georgia Tech post player Bucky Hodge, who
fouled out of Monday night's game against GSU after scoring only
four points and getting three rebounds.
</P>

ROAD-WEARY WILD CARDS HAVE SLIM SUPER BOWL HOPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following is wisdom from The Official NFL Column Of The New
Millennium (yes, I've filed for trademark rights) concerning a
major issue for this second weekend of the NFL playoffs:
</P>
<P>
   Can a wild-card win another Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A nondivision winner capturing the Vince Lombardi Trophy has
only happened three times. The 1969 Chiefs and the 1980 Raiders
made the leap from regular-season also-ran to postseason titlist.
And then, most recent, the Broncos turned the trick last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you do it?'' asks cornerback Ray Crockett, who hopes
his Broncos eliminate wild card Miami, from the postseason today in
a second-round meeting at Mile High Stadium. ``For starters, you
can't be the inferior team.''
</P>
<P>
   But wild-cards face an uphill battle that goes beyond supposed
inferiority. It certainly can be argued now that surviving wild
cards Arizona, Miami and San Francisco are in the same class with
division titlist Dallas, right? And because the 49ers beat the
Falcons and the Jets in the regular season, and because
Jacksonville had its ups and downs, the wild cards might even be on
par with those two regular-season divisional champs.
</P>
<P>
   No, the challenge comes in playing three games rather than the
two appearances required by each of the conferences' top two seeds
in order to get to the Super Bowl. And the challenge comes in
playing predominantly road games.
</P>
<P>
   Two trends to consider:
</P>
<P>
   1) Playing at home isn't the huge factor it once was, but it
remains an important edge. From 1980 to 1989, home teams won 16 of
the 20 AFC/NFC Championship Games. Since 1990, home teams have won
just 10 of 16 AFC/NFC Championship Games.
</P>
<P>
   The four home teams featured this weekend, the Jets, Falcons,
Vikings and especially the Broncos, have created daunting
home-field histories. The Broncos, for instance, have won 24
consecutive home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really take the approach,'' says Vikings coach Denny
Green, ``that somebody is breaking into your house trying to take
something that's yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Also notable here: Minnesota won its eight home games by an
average score of 35-12; Denver won its eight home games by an
average score of 35-23.
</P>
<P>
   2) Entering this season, since 1990, when the NFL playoffs were
expanded to 12 teams, a total of 64 clubs played on the first
weekend. Of those teams, only the Broncos won the Super Bowl. And
only one other team, the 1992 Bills, qualified for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys get worn down,'' says 49ers guard Kevin Gogan. ``When I
was with the Cowboys, it was like an annual event to play five
preseason games, then 16 regular-season games, then three
postseason games, counting the Super Bowl. Skipping one game in
there somewhere would've helped, I guarantee you.''
</P>
<P>
   And, it seems, the game most advantageous to skip would be the
first-rounder. Again, start with that total of 64 clubs. Note the
Broncos and Bills, who went to the Super Bowl. That leaves 30 other
first-round winners, and what happened to them?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's bad news for Arizona, Jacksonville, Miami and San
Francisco, the four clubs with a game already under their belts: 26
of the 30 lost in the second round.
TRIVIAL PURSUIT
Maybe it's parity, maybe it's luck of the draw, or maybe it's just
plain good football. But did you know that never before have teams
with records as great as Minnesota's 15-1, Atlanta's 14-2 and
Denver's 14-2 qualified for the playoffs in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Since the merger, the only comparable seasons were 1973 and
1975, when trios of 12-2 teams made the playoffs.
NUMBERS GAME
1972 _ That, of course, is the season the Miami Dolphins completed
their undefeated season. Don't tell this to Jimmy Johnson, trying
to top legendary predecessor Don Shula in so many ways but today a
two-touchdown underdog at Denver, but guess what else 1972 is?
That's the last time Miami's won a road playoff game.
QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren on Packers offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis, the
bridesmaid of NFL head coaching candidates: ``I would tell any
owner that he is the most qualified assistant in the league right
now, bar none, to be a head coach.''
CHECK OUT ...
</P>
<P>
   Ex-NFL referee Ben Dreith's pithy comments about the state of
officiating this season. The remarks received big exposure; you
can't suggest some refs aren't able to help old ladies cross the
street, as Dreith does, and go unnoticed. But anti-ref types play
up the comment without asking Dreith the tougher question: Is he
saying that 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, there did not
exist less-than-competent officials? Baloney.
</P>
<P>
   NFC BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham's new five-year contract extension would seem
to create a logjam at quarterback for the Vikings. But while coach
Denny Green is keen on the idea of having the quality depth the
combination of Cunningham and Brad Johnson offers, don't be
surprised if, this off-season, Minnesota listens to offers for
either QB if a deal can move the Vikings into the top 10 spots in
the April draft. ... In the last nine months, eight Saints players
have been arrested for various offenses ranging from DUI to assault
to heroin possession. Where is the national outrage? Why isn't Tom
Benson being held accountable? Why aren't the Saints being derided
for failing to fulfill their role-modeling obligations? ... 49ers
at Falcons: Atlanta was having trouble selling tickets to Georgia
Dome games earlier this year, but have now won 10 consecutive games
at home. ... The Vikings can become the first team to ever win 22
games in a season. They were 4-0 in the preseason, 15-1 in the
regular season and will need to go 3-0 in the postseason to do it.
The 1976 Raiders won 21 games. ... Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie still
doesn't get it. Officially, operations director Tom Modrak's
contract gives him the power to choose the head coach.
Unofficially, Lurie has veto power. Which means officially, Modrak
has no authority to fix anything. ... Looking for an unusual place
for an unusually hot player? Try Minnesota punter Mitch Berger,
good in the first eight games of the year (42.3 yard average),
great in the next eight (47.2 average) and a career-long 67-yard
punt in the regular season's final week against the Oilers. ... If
the playoffs are about playmakers, it's tough to rule out the
49ers. They had two 1,000-yard receivers, a running back with four
touchdowns of 70 yards or more, a quarterback who threw for a
franchise-record 36 touchdowns, a defensive end with 15 sacks, and
a defense that led the NFC in interceptions, featuring four guys
with four apiece. ... ... Every team believes if it keeps it close,
it can win in the end. But the Cardinals have evidence: Their 7-1
record this year in games decided by three points or fewer is an
NFL record. ... Ex-Eagles coach Ray Rhodes' explanation of what
happens when players go down the drain: ``All of the sudden a guy
reverts to how he was coached at Savannah State.''
AFC BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   When Bills owner Ralph Wilson learned his club had renegotiated
a deal with QB Doug Flutie to give him a $500,000 raise, Wilson
threw in another $250,000. Combine that with Flutie's selection to
the Pro Bowl, and no wonder he's feeling loved. ``It means I'm
accepted,'' says Flutie, long notable mostly for his lack of size
and viewed as a keeper despite Buffalo's first-round playoff loss
in Miami. ``I'm no longer a novelty.'' ... Mike Riley is the
Chargers' new coach. Mike who? He's a former USC offensive
coordinator and CFL coach who was 8-14 in two seasons at Oregon
State. ... The Chiefs are apparently committed to quarterback Elvis
Grbac (they aren't negotiating with free-agent-to-be Rich Gannon),
but there are those in Kansas City who still wonder if Grbac is
committed to the program. ... Ray Sherman is out as Steelers'
offensive coordinator. Pittsburgh tight ends coach Mike Mularkey
was a candidate to replace him before this week's hiring of
ex-Chargers coach Kevin Gilbride as the offensive boss. So now,
would Chan Gailey like to be in the market to hire Mularkey, a pal
of his, to help out in Dallas? ... The Jaguars have been in
existence for just four seasons, with a 3-2 playoff record. Their
opponent today, the Jets, have been in existence since 1960, yet
have a playoff record of just 5-6. ... The 8-8 Seahawks haven't had
a winning year since 1990; the Oilers have finished 8-8 for three
straight years. ... How the mighty have fallen: Chiefs pass-rush
great Derrick Thomas had six sacks in Week 1 of this season. Now,
Kansas City finds itself having to fend off rumors of wanting to
trade Thomas or even expose him in the Feb. 9 expansion draft.
Could the Cowboys picture Thomas, a crony of Deion Sanders', in a
Dallas uniform? ... The Dolphins are the only playoff team still
alive without a 1,000-yard rusher. ... If the Jets get ahead today
against Jacksonville, history says they'll stay ahead. Bill
Parcells-coached teams are 48-0 when leading entering the fourth
quarter. ... Miami at Denver: This pits the two active coaches with
the highest winning perentages in the playoffs, Dolphins boss Jimmy
Johnson (8-2, .800) and Broncos boss Mike Shanahan (4-1, .800). ...
The Patriots' proposed site for a new stadium in Hartford is
contaminated with toxic materials. Oops.

U.S. JOBS GROWTH CONTINUED IN DECEMBER; UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN TO 4.3
PERCENT

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite an unsettled global economy, lower corporate profits and
a new round of layoffs, the U.S. economy keeps creating jobs at an
astonishing pace.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the number of workers on U.S. payrolls grew by
378,000, the biggest gain in more than a year, the Labor Department
reported Friday. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.3 percent,
matching last April's 28-year low. The unemployment rate for all of
1998 was 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other than during 1969, the height of the Vietnam War, the last
time unemployment was this low for any significant period was 1957,
when the first baby boomers were in fifth grade and Dwight
Eisenhower was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some of December's increase was helped by balmy weather in the
North and East, which postponed the construction layoffs usual for
that time of year. Further, a few statistical flukes probably
inflated the figures a bit. But signs of strength were impressive
and widespread, reflecting robust spending by consumers and
homebuyers who account for nearly three-fourths of economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the economy is an eight-cylinder car, it's running on
nine,' said David Blitzer, chief economist at the Standard &AMP; Poors
Corp. ``A little may be special factors like weather, but there's a
lot of strength there.''
</P>
<P>
   The job market's strength, which shows that the widely
anticipated economic slowdown has yet to happen, caught forecasters
off guard. After a wave of corporate layoff announcements and a
surge in first-time claims for unemployment insurance in the last
half of December, economists had expected job growth to weaken and
unemployment to edge up. Even President Clinton's chief economic
adviser, Janet Yellin, admitted she is amazed by the economy's
momentum. ``I'm surprised. It's great. It's just extraordinary,''
she said. ``There's no obvious reason we can't continue down this
path.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, speaking in Detroit, took credit for the
economy's performance and for the 93-month old expansion, now the
longest in peacetime though still more than a year shy of the
record set by the 1960s expansion. Clinton called this a time ``of
American renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors celebrated with a market rally that pushed the
Dow Jones average and other key measures to records.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The December jobs report capped a year in which, contrary to
predictions, net job growth was nearly 3 million, unemployment
hovered between 4.3 and 4.5 percent, wage gains adjusted for
inflation were the best in a generation, and productivity growth
picked up instead of slowing as it usually does as economic
expansions age.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some of the most disadvantaged workers have enjoyed
substantial job and pay gains in the past two years. In December,
for example, while the jobless rate for most major demographic
groups was largely unchanged, the unemployment rates for black
workers and teen-agers, typically multiples of the white and adult
rates, dropped sharply. ``We're finally back to the kind of tide
that lifts all boats,'' said Dr. Yellin.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are still predicting a sharp slowdown in 1999,
starting in the current quarter, although at least one admitted
Friday that there is scant evidence so far. Along with recent data
showing that retail sales, homebuying and car purchases remained
strong through year-end, Friday's jobs report suggests that the
economy may have been expanding at a 4 percent rate in the final
quarter of 1998, which is considered exceptionally strong.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a private
research organization, said, ``We're going into 1999 with
fundamentals better than in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for expecting some moderation of growth,
though. Much of the rest of the world is either in recession or
slowing down. Consumers have been spending much of their income at
an unsustainable rate. Homebuying is at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists say job growth would have to fall below the
rate of 100,000 or so a month for unemployment to start rising.
</P>
<P>
   Factory employment, which fell during most of last year,
declined by another 13,000 jobs. But that's a fraction of the
losses in recent months. Factory employment has fallen by 272,000
jobs since last March, as recessions in Asia and Latin America have
hurt U.S. exports. Despite record car sales, employment in Detroit
is down 12,000 from a year ago. On the other hand, manufacturers of
anything related to the housing market _ from bricks and glass to
furniture and hardware _ continue to thrive and did lots hiring
last month, as they've done all year.
</P>
<P>
   Weather was partly responsible for construction jobs surging by
104,000 last month, the biggest monthly gain since February 1984.
Most of the gains were in outdoor work like highway construction
and roofing as contractors were able to continue working longer
than usual. But construction hiring has been strong all year. With
state treasuries bulging and mortgage rates down to the lowest
level in 30 years, public works and housing are both booming.
</P>
<P>
   The main engine of job growth remained the service economy _
everything from fast food chains to schools _ which added 290,000
jobs. Business services like public relations, consulting and
computing did extensive hiring. Temporary help firms saw the
biggest jump in headcounts since August. With companies and
government agencies scrambling to fix their year 2000
computer-clock problems, hiring by computer services firms was
brisk; jobs in that industry swelled by more than 13 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in the retail industry rose by 53,000 in December, bringing
total job gains for the year to nearly one half million.
Restaurants added 33,000 workers. Department stores hired a lot of
extra holiday help. A surge in renovation, building material and
garden supply stores added 9,000 jobs, the biggest increase of the
year. Most services related to the building business expanded
payrolls last year.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for workers is fattening paychecks. Hourly earnings
jumped 5 cents, to $12.98. That is a 3.8 percent gain for the past
year, about the same as in each of the two previous years. Pay is
growing fastest in financial services, mining, services and retail
trade, where workers are in especially short supply.

 GORTON CLEBRATES ROLE IN SENATE COMPROMISEx  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton would have spent Friday
celebrating anyway _ it was his 71st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton, R-Wash., was also celebrating what he called ``one
of the most rewarding experiences I've had in the Senate,'' his
central role in developing the bipartisan plan for proceeding with
the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was one of four senators who drafted the final compromise
plan approved unanimously by the Senate Friday. Senators from both
parties said it was his month-long effort to hammer out a proposal
with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., that made the deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Joe Lieberman, in a bipartisan way, put their heads
together, they started thinking about it, they started coming up
with ideas, and we moved forward and it led to what we have here
before us,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he talked to Gorton daily over the past few weeks.
``So I want to thank Slade for being willing to do that and for
enduring praise and criticism that he has had to live with over the
past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gorton and Lieberman failed to sell their own plan,
which might have led to an abbreviated trial proceeding, to the
full Senate. It was one of the plan's most vocal critics, Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, along with Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who found a
way to alter the plan to win approval by allowing senators to vote
on each proposal to bring in a witness or discuss new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But senators said Gorton and Lieberman played a critical role
both in laying the groundwork for a bipartisan plan and in writing
the final agreement. After a closed-door meeting at which Gramm and
Kennedy verbalized the final compromise, Gorton and Lieberman, both
former state attorneys general, joined them in Lott's office to
write the language that was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enjoyed cussing and discussing him (Gorton) and his
proposals for the last week,'' said assistant majority leader Don
Nickles, R-Okla. ``He has shown great courage and leadership, and
he has worked with all of us ... Republicans and Democrats, to try
to forge a bipartisan resolution to this challenge. And I
compliment him for his legislative skills in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has been working with Lieberman to come up with a plan
for a Senate trial after the House impeached Clinton on perjury and
obstruction of justice charges for his alleged effort to conceal
his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a formal plan, it became outmoded fairly quickly, but it
triggered a wide range of conversations among Republicans and among
Democrats and most importantly between members of the two
parties,'' Gorton said. ``All of us are elated that we did not
start out with a partisan vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that he wound up at the center of the firestorm
because of his close relationships with Lieberman, which dates back
two decades, and with Lott, for whom Gorton is counselor and
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a great sense of gratification that we started the
procedures that brought members together on both sides of the
political aisle and ended in this result,'' Gorton said. ``My
colleagues are delighted with me, and it's hard to get a better
feeling than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment issue carries risks for Gorton, who says he
plans to run for re-election to a fourth term in the Senate next
year. Removing Clinton from office _ a step Gorton says he is
inclined to support _ is likely to be unpopular in Washington,
where a plurality of voters supported Clinton in 1992 and 1996. And
his work for a bipartisan handling of the trial is alienating some
conservatives in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton said he had no choice but to take a position on
impeachment, and as a lawyer who delights in nitty-gritty legal
debates, he jumped into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a United States senator, (and) even if I sat still like
the bump on a log, I'm going to have to vote at some point or
another on it,'' he said. ``But more importantly than that, I'm a
United states Senator under the Constitution of the United States,
and the Constitution calls for these procedures, and to me it is
the inevitable duty that one do the best that one can. ... I think
it's my duty to try to see to it to the best of my ability that the
Senate does do impartial justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the Senate trial is a political process, not a
judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a tremendous burden, and I guess part of the reason
that I feel that burden is that this is only the second time this
has ever taken place in our history,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the burden is more the importance of the issue
and the weight of the oath (of impartiality) than it is some
abstract conception of history. ... Will it be a part of history?
Yes it will be. But the real burden is doing impartial justice.''

 &HT;    Hawks will have tough mini-camp
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's much fan fence-mending to do, free agents to
sign and tickets to sell, all in a relative nanosecond. Yet time
will be more critical once Hawks training camp opens, even more
come the abbreviated NBA season. Then what's a coach to do?
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens vows to get players in shape, not injured, in
training camp, then get off to a quick start in a short season. And
if key players need to rest less and play more, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about the short training camp,'' the Hawks
coach said Friday. ``I'm concerned about the short season.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the Hawks, after what Wilkens vows will be a
typically strenuous _ if barely two-week _ training camp, get off
to a strong start in a 50-game season. ``When you cram 50 games in
a short time, with four games in five nights, the key thing is for
us not to come out of the blocks slow,'' Wilkens said. ``If you do,
you're in trouble. The other thing that worries me is injuries. You
can't have guys come up lame.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, Hawks President Stan Kasten and general manager Pete
Babcock spoke at a news conference Friday, one day after the NBA
lockout ended. All three spoke about reconnecting with
``disaffected'' fans and about the free-agent mad scramble that
should ensue Jan. 18 when teams can begin negotiations and
signings. But Wilkens' concerns will be more practical that day, if
training camp opens then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't experiment as much,'' he said. ``You go to regular
training camp, you have 18, 20, 22 guys. You get to look at guys.
We don't have time to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with only four Hawks currently under contract and the rights
to two draft picks. Wilkens said the Hawks could open camp with as
few as those six players, while other teams might start with 12.
But the Hawks will sign more players quickly, and Wilkens expects
two other factors to enhance training camp: his team's veteran
nucleus and his own training-camp regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three or four starters (Steve Smith, Dikembe Mutombo and
Mookie Blaylock) help tremendously,'' Wilkens said. ``They know
what to expect in camp. They'll help us to get going''
</P>
<P>
   It will be ``a tough camp,'' he said. ``I plan to do the same
thing. I just have to be careful we don't get anyone hurt. I told
my staff there's going to be 10 pairs of eyes _ the coaches,
trainers, everyone _ on (players). At the same time, I have to get
them in shape. That'll help us get off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the short season begins, Wilkens isn't sure if his regular
substitution patterns will be affected. ``We'll see how it goes,''
he said. ``Because it is a short season, I don't think you have to
care about wearing guys out. You have to watch guys, make sure they
don't get hurt. And you probably won't be worrying about saving
guys for the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the facts
</P>
<P>
   The 50-game schedule, set to begin Feb. 5, will be split, Kasten
said, with 25 home games and 25 away. From 42 to 44 of the games
will be against Eastern Conference foes. The NBA might finish the
revamped shedule next week.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 25 home dates, Kasten estimates two-thirds will be
played at the Georgia Dome, with the rest at Georgia Tech. The
Hawks will hold at least one open-to-the-public scrimmage once camp
begins and will play one free exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   As for reduced ticket prices or new packages or promotions,
Kasten reiterated the NBA's intention to have a bloc of $10 tickets
available for every game. ``But that's nothing new in Atlanta,'' he
said. ``Part of our disadvantage is we're already at the bottom of
the pack in NBA ticket prices.''
</P>
<P>
   On time
</P>
<P>
   As eager as the Hawks are to re-sign some of their free agents
and sign new ones, Kasten stressed that Atlanta won't start that
process prematurely, or illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can promise you that's the way we'll be,'' he said. ``We
always are. I can't say that for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasten intends to cry foul on any team negotiating early with
free agents, or reaching agreements before the league sets a date _
probably Jan. 18 _ to open talks. ``I won't hesitate to blow the
whistle,'' he said. ``That stuff makes me nuts, and it's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled previous free-agent dealings in which other teams
jumped the gun in negotiations. An example was Mutombo, who had
been approached by other teams but who still signed with the Hawks.

 &HT;    '98 Dogs draw record crowds at Sanford
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ The Georgia Bulldogs set a single-season attendance
record at Sanford Stadium in the fall, good enough for the
fifth-best average attendance in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released by the NCAA show Georgia with an average
attendance of 85,618 in the 86,117 capacity stadium. The old mark
was 83,948 in 1995 when Alabama , Florida and Auburn played in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 14th time in the last 18 years that Georgia finished
among the top six teams in the nation in average home attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top 10: Michigan, 110,965; Tennessee, 106,914; Penn
State, 96,532; Ohio State, 93,502; Georgia, 85,618; Florida,
85,299; Alabama, 82,670; Auburn, 81,110; Florida State, 80,490; and

SPLIT HURTS SURVIVING WAC TEAMS MOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick, name the best NCAA Division I 16-team conference last
season. You're right, it's the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   Now name the best Division I 16-team conference going the way of
Ginger Spice. Two-for-two, the WAC again.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend marks the beginning of the end of the WAC's great
salvation of the abandoned Southwest Conference schools and some
Big West conference programs as league play begins for all 16
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This split does not benefit us,'' SMU coach Rhonda Rompola
said. ``This eight-team WAC isn't nearly as strong as the 16-team
WAC. And, in all honesty, I don't think there will be an eight-team
WAC beyond next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, New Mexico, Utah, Air Force, San Diego State, Wyoming,
Colorado State, Brigham Young and Nevada-Las Vegas will leave to
form the Mountain West Conference based in Colorado Springs, Colo.
That leaves TCU, SMU, Rice, Tulsa, UT-El Paso, San Jose State,
Fresno State and Hawaii in the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the focus is on finances and football, the breakup
has distinct effects on women's basketball, where the conference
was beginning to make large strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two years, our conference play has truly been helpful
to us and our RPI \RRatings Percentage Index\S for the first
time,'' Utah coach Elaine Elliot said. ``Now we will have to
re-establish that. Next year we'll need two or three other programs
to step up to get us to the level of national recognition where we
are now.''
</P>
<P>
   The RPI is a system that ranks teams by weighing records,
conferences and strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the WAC had a conference-record five NCAA
Tournament teams _ New Mexico, Hawaii, SMU, Colorado State and Utah
_ plus Rice in the Women's National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The schools forming the MWC have a combined record of 59-38,
with No. 8 Colorado State leading the way with a 16-1 mark. Next
season's WAC is 41-52 with Tulsa and San Jose State's combined
record of 4-21 dragging down what should be a decent conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of impacting our schedule and our RPI, this isn't
that big of a deal,'' TCU coach Mike Petersen said. ``We had four
or five tournament teams last year; now we'll have two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   What is left for the WAC is Hawaii, SMU and Rice trying to be
the standard bearers on a national level. Those three programs are
the only ones in the top 130 in the RPI among next year's WAC. What
will be the MWC has four teams ranked in the top 100 in the RPI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new WAC doesn't make sense financially or geographically.
Where is the common link for the schools?'' Rompola asked. ``We
don't even have a league schedule yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As the logistics are worked out, what will be left for most
schools are long trips to the West Coast and a 14-game conference
schedule, as there is now. What won't be there however, is the
quantity of quality teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't even hit recruiting really,'' Petersen said. ``We
still have Hawaii, and I don't ever recall selling to a kid that
great Fort Collins-Laramie trip.''
ABL NOMADS
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the American Basketall League, most of its
former players are now looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, you aren't likely to hear, ``Hi, this is Jennifer
Azzi, would you like to try one of our gorditas today?'' on your
next fast-food run.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the upper-echelon ABL stars such as Azzi, Katie Smith,
Jen Rizzotti and Kara Wolters will likely sign with WNBA teams
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ABL castoffs are waiting for their release from the
league and its bankruptcy proceedings. If players aren't approached
by the WNBA, most will try to sign with teams in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just came out of college, I might be devastated, but I
believe if I just keep working hard, I'll get an opportunity,'' New
England Blizzard forward Dale Hodges told ``The Boston Globe/.
NEW WAC TO HAWAII?
</P>
<P>
   What the WAC really lacks _ other than frequent flyer miles - is
more headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The WAC is seeking a waiver for next season on an NCAA bylaw
that states at least six of its members must be in the same
conference for five academic years to qualify for an automatic NCAA
Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   With the makeup of the WAC for next season, five of the eight
schools have not been together that long. If the rule is upheld,
both the men and women will be without an automatic berth until the
2001 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   As an additional kick to a down conference, the new Mountain
West Conference meets those guidelines and will likely have an
automatic berth.
</P>
<P>
   The league also must find a site for its annual basketball
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas is currently the site for the tournament but, with
UNLV jumping to the Mountain West, commissioner Karl Benson needs
another site.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week ``The Tulsa World/ reported that the
tournament will be likely be held in Hawaii. The WAC isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having discussions with the state of Hawaii about a
combo deal for our bowl site and our tournament,'' WAC associate
commissioner Jeff Hurd said. ``But it would be premature to say we
are going anywhere just yet.''
FREE BASKETBALL
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bowling Green and Ball State hooked up in a
statistician's worst nightmare. The Falcons defeated the Cardinals,
106-105, in four overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   It's the eighth time in NCAA Division I history that a game has
gone to four overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling Green won despite shooting 29 fewer free throws. Center
Jacki Raterman's 34 points and 12 rebounds overcame that disparity.
She played 58 of the game's 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just incredible that she could play that well for 58
minutes,'' Falcons coach Deanne Knoblauch said. ``We made some
miraculous plays just to keep the game alive.''
THERE ARE OTHER POLLS
</P>
<P>
   The latest Top 25 NAIA Division I poll features four Texas
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Wayland Baptist is fourth with a 13-2 record; East Texas Baptist
ranks 11th with a 10-1 record; Incarnate Word is 16th with a 12-3
mark; and St. Edward's is 18th at 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest NCAA Division II poll, Abilene Christian ranks
third in the South Central region. Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville is eighth
at 8-3.
POSTPONEMENT OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   With the recent snowstorms in the Midwest, several games were
postponed. Not to be outdone, New York Tech's game against American
International on Sunday was postponed due to ... flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend 4 inches of rain fell in two hours. NY Tech's
gymnasium is the lowest point on its campus, meaning much of the
excess water drained onto the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   The game was eventually played at C.W. Post College, where
American International defeated NY Tech, 86-41.
</P>
<P>
   It's not killer bees, but it's more interesting than snow.
SCORE OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Regis defeated Kansas Wesleyan, 80-41. Wonder if Regis could
defeat Kathy Lee?
GAMES TO WATCH
TODAY
</P>
<P>
   SMU (5-7) at TCU (8-4), 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the Metroplex nonrivalry, TCU hasn't defeated SMU since 1991,
and SMU has won 15 consecutive in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the records show, I don't want to see it
broken,'' SMU coach Rhonda Rompola said. ``And whenever you play
against \RTCU coach\S Mike Petersen, it's fun. He's entertaining to
watch.''
TOMORROW
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Tennessee (12-1) at No. 1 Connecticut (13-0), 3 p.m.,
KTVT/Channel 11
</P>
<P>
   UConn ranks first in the nation offense, Tennessee is third;
UConn is first in field-goal percentage, Tennessee is second; the
Huskies are first in scoring margin, the Lady Vols are fourth. What
this game really lacks is hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon (11-2, 2-0) at No. 10 UCLA (9-4, 1-0), 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' defense is second in the nation, and if they upset
the Bruins, they will have a web-foot up on the wide-open Pac-10.
TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern at No. 3 Purdue, 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the rugged Big Ten will upset the Boilers. Too bad it
won't be the Wildcats.
THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   Montana at Northern Arizona, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Cal State-Northridge can upset one of these two teams
away from the Matadome, the Big Sky champions will most likely be
either the Grizzlies or Ladyjacks. /

TWO OLYMPICS ORGANIZERS QUIT IN SALT LAKE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (lb) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The top two local organizers of the 2002 Winter
Olympics resigned Friday as new details continued to emerge in a
mushrooming bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The two, Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake City Olympic
Organizing Committee, and Dave Johnson, senior vice president of
the committee, resigned under pressure from Gov. Mike Leavitt of
Utah and U.S. Olympic officials. They were concerned about public
embarrassment and about wavering confidence by corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik, 70, has not been linked to the scandal and will remain
in his position until a successor is found.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the Salt Lake City bid committee had paid
housing, travel and education expenses to relatives of members of
the International Olympic Committee; had provided expensive gifts
to IOC members; had provided free health care to IOC members and
their families; had aided an IOC member in a profitable Utah land
deal; and had made direct cash payments _ apparently exceeding
$70,000 in one case _ to ``a number'' of IOC members and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Thursday that the payments had been made to
IOC members from Africa and Latin America. Speaking on the
condition of anonymity, investigators said Friday that Jean-Claude
Ganga, an IOC member from Congo Republic, had received a series of
payments totaling about $70,000, in a period leading up to the June
1995 vote in which Salt Lake City won the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that there did not appear to be any
justification for the payments, but that they were still being
examined. Efforts to reach Ganga on Friday and in recent weeks were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik also announced Friday that a monthly $10,000 consulting
fee paid to the former president of the Salt Lake City organizing
committee, Tom Welch, would be discontinued. Welch headed the bid
committee that secured the Games, but resigned his Olympic position
in 1997 after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge of
spousal battery.
</P>
<P>
   While an international search will be conducted for Joklik's
replacement, some of the potential candidates being mentioned here
include Dave Checketts, the chief executive officer of Madison
Square Garden and a native of Utah whose name surfaced as a
possible replacement for Welch in 1997; Jon Huntsman Jr., vice
chairman of Huntsman Chemical Corp.; Bill Marriott of Marriott
Corp.; Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser to
President Bush; David Gardner, former president of the University
of Utah; and Henry Marsh, a former Olympic steeplechaser.
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, one of two members of the IOC from the United
States, said here Friday that some IOC members involved in the Salt
Lake City scandal would be asked to resign at a meeting Jan. 23 and
24 at IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC also
reiterated Friday that it would not take the 2002 Winter Games away
from Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any IOC heads would roll, DeFrantz said, ``I don't
think we will have executions, but we will have fewer members.'' It
was the strongest indication yet from the IOC that some of its 114
members would be pressured to relinquish their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few individuals who have abused their privilege,''
DeFrantz said. ``We must have them removed from the Olympic
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   One who has come under scrutiny is Ganga, 64, who holds
influence as president of the national Olympic committees of
Africa. According to Olympic officials, the Salt Lake City bid
committee targeted African votes in their attempt to win the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga received free medical treatment for hepatitis in Salt Lake
City during the bid process, and profited in a land deal arranged
by Bennie Smith Jr., a member of the bid committee, several months
after the Games were awarded to Salt Lake City, investigators have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga has long been a controversial figure in the Olympic
movement as one of the organizers of the African boycott of the
1976 Summer Games in Montreal. A former ambassador to China, he is
currently Congo Republic's minister for tourism, sports and
leisure, as well as president of the country's Olympic Committee.
He was recently removed from the IOC's commission on new sources of
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless investigators can prove that Ganga received excessive
payments, gifts or services while acting in his official government
capacity, and not as an IOC member, it seems unlikely that Salt
Lake City officials would be subjected to charges of violating the
Corrupt Foreign Practices Act, said Jeffrey Weiner, a Miami
attorney who was formerly president of the national association of
criminal defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Four investigations, including those by an internal Salt Lake
City ethics panel, the USOC, the IOC and the U.S. Justice
Department, are examining vote-buying charges first leveled last
month by Marc Hodler, a senior IOC official from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as many as 25 of the 114 IOC members sold their
votes in recent elections to name Olympic sites. He has also said
that Salt Lake City was a victim of so-called agents who demanded
exorbitant fees for delivering blocs of votes. The report by the
Salt Lake City ethics panel could be made public as early as next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Leavitt said that he deplored the misdeeds of the
Salt Lake City bid committee ``and we revolt at being associated
with them.'' He also sternly criticized a ``sinister and dark
corner of corruption'' in the Olympic movement that exists because
of what the governor called a lack of accountability in the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, to
institute reforms in the bidding process and to restore the
integrity associated with the five interlocking Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the Olympics to move forward in an ethical, honest
way,'' Leavitt said. ``It is clear to us that the mistakes by a few
have very seriously damaged this movement and our Games, and for
that, we have deep regret.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, Salt Lake City Olympic officials had acknowledged
only that $400,000 had been spent on tuition assistance and
athletic training programs that benefited 13 people, including six
relatives of IOC members, most from Africa. Officials had defended
the programs as humanitarian assistance, not bribery. Welch had
also said that items such as shotguns and skis had been given to
IOC members, which exceeded a limit of $150 on gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to cash payments and other irregularities acknowledged
on Friday, Joklik said: ``It is clear that these disturbing actions
were taken in an effort to win friends for the bid. It is clear
that they were done in an atmosphere in which at least some IOC
members expected such gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Joklik said that as a member of the Salt Lake City bid committee
he had been unaware of any improper payments. He said the bid
committee's board of trustees had been screened from such
information and had been assured by auditors that all expenditures
were proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I do not believe that anyone promised us a vote in
exchange for our expenditures, nor that our actions influenced the
outcome of the bidding process, a handful of IOC members seem to
have seriously abused our generous impulses and expected _ and
received _ more than they should have been given,'' Joklik said,
reading from a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik said he was ``deeply dismayed'' by the revelations of
recent weeks and felt that it was necessary to resign to give the
organizing committee a chance to make a fresh start with the Games
only three years away.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation was welcomed by the USOC, which still must raise
more than $250 million in a joint marketing effort with Salt Lake
City to achieve the privately-financed budget of $1.45 billion for
the 2002 Winter Games. Corporate sponsors have become jittery in
recent weeks as details of the scandal became public, and US West
even withheld a $5 million sponsorship payment.
</P>
<P>
   Without Friday's resignations to signal to sponsors that the
scandal was being handled quickly and thoroughly, it would have
been ``extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, to raise funds
necessary for these Games,'' said John Krimsky Jr., the USOC's
chief fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   While the resignations of Joklik and Johnson, 40, may have
provided relief in a public relations sense, Salt Lake City is now
left without the two people who possess the greatest knowledge in
organizing the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Joklik's successor, most of the sports
facilities are completed or are well under construction. Major
projects remaining include enclosing the Olympic speed-skating oval
and constructing the 120K hill for ski jumping. All sports
facilities are expected to be completed by November 2000, so they
can be tested in competition long before the Games open on Feb. 8,
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reputation has been tarnished around the world,'' said
Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini. ``We will make it right
again.''

ANALYSIS: SENATE'S BIPARTISANSHIP WILL FACE SEVERE TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Texas., W.Va.)  (See related IMPEACH, IMPEACH-CLINTON, IMPEACH-CAUCUS,
IMPEACH-SCENE, IMPEACH-CANING) 
(JT) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate achieved bipartisanship _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats abandoned their diehard opposition to hearing any
witnesses in exchange for a schedule that defers the question until
the Senate may be nearly as tired of the Monica Lewinsky scandal as
is the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans avoided beginning a momentous impeachment proceeding
with a party-line victory that could have left them looking like
the House _ a concept that all senators find intrinsically
demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   The road to a result the country will consider adult, and fair,
still has some rickety passages ahead. Votes pretty much along
party lines can still come on motions by the White House and the
House next week. The unaccustomed tedium of sitting silently for
hours at a time can fray tempers as the trial proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, Republicans will cast all, or almost all, of the
votes to convict President Clinton and remove him from office,
while Democrats will cast most of the votes to acquit him and keep
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Friday's decision satisfied the Senate, it almost
certainly displeased the House managers and the White House. Each
of them would have been pleased if the Republicans had used their
majority to jam through, on a 55-45 vote, procedures and schedules
that would have allowed the prosecution to range far beyond the
evidence presented last month in the House and to call witness
after witness.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers would have liked the freedom that would have
given them.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would have preferred no possibility of
witnesses. But if it had to risk Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, it would
have liked to face it after a vote it could portray as the will of
a Republican Party consumed by partisan hatred, not as the result
of a two-party compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But the 100 jurors are not only Democrats and Republicans, they
are senators. Some, in each party, put loyalty to the Senate, its
history and its traditions, much higher than loyalty to party or
president.
</P>
<P>
   For all the time-wasting, disorder and endless quorum calls that
make the Senate seem silly on a television screen, the underlying
fact about the place is that the filibuster rule, and its
requirement of 60 votes to get to a decision, train successful
senators in bipartisanship. They simply cannot get things done
without help from the other party.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two senators who were instrumental in Friday's deal,
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has built a career on that
understanding, winning victories over three decades on civil
rights, election law, health care, crime and other subjects, in a
series of alliances with key Republicans from Howard Baker to Bob
Dole to Hugh Scott to Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's other key player, Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has less history
of working with the other party, although he came to Congress as a
Democrat. But Friday he seized on another dominant Senate strain, a
sense of history.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm spoke near the end of the morning caucus, affected as most
senators were by Robert Byrd's opening speech on the Old Senate
Chamber, where the trial is being held, and the Senate's place in
history. Byrd, D-W.Va., cited Daniel Webster's classic appeal to
national feeling, his March 7, 1850, speech on ``The Constitution
and the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to speak today,'' Webster said in debate over the
extension of slavery to the territories, ``not as a Massachusetts
man, nor as a northern man, but as an American, and a member of the
Senate of the United States ... I speak today for the preservation
of the Union. Hear me for my cause. ''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that the Senate had to meet that test again. He
argued that no senator would deny the president a chance to call a
witness, so it was equally unfair to deny the House any chance. And
he reminded senators that under the ``ancient rules of the
Senate,'' they could not avoid votes unles they could reach across
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who proudly holds Webster's seat, said later that the
room itself, where another Massachusetts senator, Charles Sumner,
was caned by Andrew Butler, a South Carolina representative, over
the issue of slavery, has a powerful impact on ``anyone that
respects history and anyone who holds a senator's seat from
Massachusetts.'' He said he felt that not just President Clinton
but the Senate, too, was on trial, and argued that many of the
differences between the parties' proposed procedures were trivial.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the areas of agreement and near-agreement
could get the Senate to first base and second base, and that if
senators sat down to talk, ``we could see later on how we're going
to get to third.''
</P>
<P>
   On most important issues, Gramm and Kennedy vote on opposite
sides. Gramm gets a zero rating from Americans for Democratic
Action; Kennedy gets the same grade from the American Conservative
Union. And they had disagreements as they and their respective
party leaders, Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, worked on the details of
the procedures Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But in an institution like the Senate, where everyone knows
everyone else, and, as Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at
the American Enterprise Institute, said, ``You have to view your
colleagues as people who will be adversaries one day and allies the
next,'' they managed, finally, to agree.
</P>
<P>
   And not just among themselves. In the Senate the rules
ordinarily make it easy for one senator to delay anything. So
almost every action, from ending a quorum call to taking a vote, is
achieved by unanimous consent.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Friday afternoon, before the roll call whose result
he anticipated, Lott spoke as if 100-0 was not quite good enough.
He asked unanimous consent ``that if the resolution is agreed to by
the Senate, it be considered to have the dignity of a unanimous
consent agreement.''

TEXAS OFFICIALS SEEK ANSWERS TO MYSTERY OF 31 UNEARTHED GRAVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ State highway officials are trying to track
down the descendants of 31 people whose graves were unearthed by
workers alongside a busy country road.
</P>
<P>
   The location is near the site of the first battle of the Mexican
War, but a prominent Brownsville historian said the graves are more
likely from one of the many, small private cemeteries maintained on
ranches along the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The graves were found next to and beneath Alton Gloor Boulevard,
a two-lane country road on the north side of Brownsville, which is
3 miles from the Palo Alto battlefield. Gen. Zachary Taylor, who
marched a federal army into South Texas to establish the Rio Grande
as the international boundary, first engaged defending Mexican
troops at Palo Alto in early 1846.
</P>
<P>
   Behrooz Badiozzamani, the deputy district engineer for the Texas
Department of Transportation, said a project to widen the road to
four lanes has been put on hold until the origin of the graves can
be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our archaeologists, from what they see on the ground, they
don't think they are graves related in any way to the Mexican
American War,'' Badiozzamani said. ``They haven't found any
evidence that would link them to the military _ medals, (uniform)
buttons, or rifles.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineer said the graves were not found by accident, but
located by highway department workers following up on a 1979
department memorandum that reported several apparent graves next to
the roadway. The first graves were found Dec. 18 as highway workers
prepared to bid out the job, Badiozzamani said, and the last seven
were found Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the graves has been excavated, and Badiozzamani said the
agency is searching country deed records and placing advertisements
in local newspapers seeking descendants of those interred along the
roadway. He said the graves were located because the soil above
them had become discolored. Several appear to be smaller graves,
perhaps of children.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville historian Bruce Aiken, a member of the Texas
Historical Commission, noted those buried in the roadside cemetery
were interred in some type of casket, and U.S. military forces in
1846 did not bring any with them on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a ranch cemetery on a ranch called the Lucero,''
Aiken said. ``I think when they (archaeologists) get in there
they're going to find some children, which would definitely rule it
(military cemetery) out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, they found a bottle near one of them (graves) from a
Brownsville bottling company, which would pretty much make it 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Chula Griffin, a Brownsville woman who has researched the area's
old cemeteries, agreed it is probably a small ranch cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, they're all over the place,'' she said. ``Just the known
ones _ and this one was unknown _ we have over 100 little ranch
cemeteries in Cameron County alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Highway department officials said the remains will be moved to
another location.
</P>
<P>
   Aiken said another unidentified cemetery was recently uncovered
a few miles away on U.S. 281, the so-called Military Highway that
runs next to the Rio Grande where many of the region's first
ranches were established.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this is just another mystery,'' Aiken said.

DEMOCRATS EXCITED BY IDEA OF HILLARY CLINTON IN N.Y. SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., wanted a
compelling figure to campaign with during the final hours of his
Senate race last year, he turned to a Democrat who has never even
lived in New York state: Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton flew
in for a clamorous reception at a Schumer rally in midtown. After
the votes were counted, Republicans and Democrats agreed that her
four visits here had a lot to do with why Schumer defeated Alfonse
D'Amato by nearly 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   All of which accounts for why an apparently unauthorized
political trial balloon floated by the chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee on television last weekend _ that
Mrs. Clinton might run for the Senate seat from New York in 2000 in
a bid to replace the retiring Daniel Patrick Moynihan _has stirred
such interest. Polls indicate there is virtually no public figure
who is as popular as the first lady among New York voters these
days, and Mrs. Clinton clearly demonstrated her skill at political
warfare with her relentless attacks on D'Amato through the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman is just an exceptional human being with a broad
breath of knowledge on national and international politics,'' Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and one of Mrs. Clinton's most enthusiastic
promoters, said Friday. ``I've seen her on the campaign trail and
as a witness in Congress. Her ability to do most anything well is
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the prospect of Mrs. Clinton seeking the
Senate nomination is, at this point, only the hopeful figment of
the imagination of Democrats contemplating the difficult task of
keeping Moynihan's seat under their party's control. The first
lady's associates say that Mrs. Clinton has shown little interest
in moving to New York and entering partisan politics, and that in
any case, she has other things on her mind these days besides a
Senate race two years away in a state where she has never lived.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably be months before Mrs. Clinton offers a final
word on her political plans. But the excitement stirred by these
whispers is evidence of something else: the underlying weakness of
New York's Democratic Party, notwithstanding the party's strong
showing in November when Democrats won the Senate seat and the
state attorney general and comptroller jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development and
son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, announced Friday that he is
skipping the contest. That, it would seem, has left the Democratic
Party with a weak bench of backup candidates to to replace Moynihan
in a race where the Republican candidate might be New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, an accomplished and well-financed politician.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat that Moynihan had hoped would run for his seat, H.
Carl McCall, the state comptroller, declined, calling the
fund-raising demands too exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's decision is sure to be interpreted, by some, as
testimony to Giuliani's strength, even though many Democrats were
skeptical of how the younger Cuomo, who has never before run for
public office, might do in a race against someone of Giuliani's
guile and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, while there are a number of lesser-known public
officials who are thinking about running _ like Rep. Nita Lowey of
Westchester and state Assemblyman Michael Bragman of Syracuse _
there does not appear to be another Schumer out there. Schumer, who
served nine terms in the House of Representatives, quietly devoted
years to raising money and building a case to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic leaders are concerned. When Judith Hope, the
state party chairwoman, said earlier this week that she doubted
Mrs. Clinton was going to run, she was scolded by Democrats,
including Rangel, not to say anything that might discourage the
first lady from running ``if there was the remotest possibility of
her making this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the prospect of the first lady considering a race
for Senate from New York is a very exciting one,'' Ms. Hope said
Friday. ``I know that certain political leaders from New York are
encouraging her to give it serious consideration. I know that six
months ago she suggested to me that such speculation was a
distraction for her at that period in time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who are looking to Mrs. Clinton to protect the
``Moynihan seat,'' as Ms. Hope called it, are taking solace from
the fact that Mrs. Clinton has declined to rule that out she might
run.
</P>
<P>
   The only requirements to run for the Senate is that a candidate
must be at least 30 years old and a citizen of the United States
for at least nine years, and have a residence in the state where
they intend to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there's a lot of speculation about what she would
do,'' said Marsha Berry, the first lady's press secretary. ``To the
question of elective politics, she says she has no plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said that Mrs. Clinton, in a conversation the other day,
said nothing to dissuade him from advancing her candidacy. ``The
first lady told me that we should put any discussion of this
subject on hold, until after the president is done with impeachment
proceedings in the Senate,'' Rangel said. ``Me being an optimist, I
consider that very favorable. Yes, I still have my hopes there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while such carefully parsed statements are often intended
to signal that a public official is thinking about running, some of
Ms. Clinton's associates say that is not the case here; the first
lady and her friends are simply trying to keep her options open,
for any possibility. This not is not a particularly good time, one
friend said, for Mrs. Clinton to contemplate her own career. She
told one friend that she would be more inclined to think about a
Senate race in 2002 than in 2000, when she expects she will be just
moving out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for certain: The longer she holds herself in
abeyance, the more potential she has to shape the field. And that
is not necessarily a good thing for the Democrats. Contributors are
not likely to begin giving money to some of the lesser-known
possible candidates and other candidates might decide to sit out
the race. And the specter of Mrs. Clinton as an outsized political
figure inevitably reduces the stature of the other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, she is going to come under more pressure to
declare her intentions _ all the more so now, with Cuomo out of the
race. ``I think it would be very exciting if she were a candidate;
she would be a very strong candidate,'' said John Marino, the
former state Democratic chairman who had pressed the younger Cuomo
to enter the race. ``But I would urge that if she were seriously
thinking about doing this, I would encourage her to do it sooner
rather than later.''

   As a holiday tribute to the late restaurateur Joseph Baum was
winding down at Town Hall, the Manhattan theater, David Rockefeller
invited everyone to the Rainbow Room, the nightclub at 30
Rockefeller Center that Baum had run for more than a decade. About
750 people showed up _ but it is probably just as well that
Rockefeller, who still owns 5 percent of Rockefeller Center,
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As they gazed out on a glittering city from the Rainbow Room's
65th-floor perch, guests like Edward I. Koch, the former mayor;
Hugh Hardy, the architect, and David Liederman, the restaurateur,
bewailed the fact that Baum had been turned out of the Rainbow Room
by Rockefeller Center's owners after a 25-year career at the
complex, operating The Forum of the 12 Caesars, Charlie O's, the
Power Suite, and, finally, the Rainbow Room.
</P>
<P>
   When Baum refused to pay a steep rent hike, the center turned
the space over to the Cipriani family, which plans to convert it
into a catering hall that will be mostly closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit creepy that Rockefeller invited everyone to say
goodbye to Joe, when they nearly threw him out of the Rainbow
Room,'' Liederman said. ``Most of us are skeptical that Cipriani
would capture the magic Joe brought to the place.''

   Twelve years ago, David A. Duffield, chairman of Peoplesoft, a
California software maker, ``fell in love'' with a miniature
Schnauzer named Maddie _ and as the result, millions of dogs and
cats can breathe easier today. The memory of Maddie's impish
personality inspired Duffield and his wife, Cheryl, to pledge $200
million in 1997 to the cause of finding homes for stray or
abandoned pets, though word of the donation is just now getting
out.
</P>
<P>
   Duffield, 58, says the couple acquired Maddie after realizing
they couldn't have children. At the time, he was going through a
rough patch in a former career, and their new companion ``became a
refuge,'' he says. He especially remembers her exploring the hills
outside their home, ``getting into the cow patties and burrs,'' and
her fearless assaults on larger dogs. ``I promised her that if we
ever made any money, we'd give it back to her kind,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He has made plenty: His 51 million Peoplesoft shares are worth
close to $1.22 billion. One-sixth of that will go to the Duffield
Family Foundation, soon to be renamed in honor of Maddie, and be
disbursed to humane societies and animal shelters to find homes for
dogs and cats that might otherwise be put to sleep. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   It was only by chance, he says, that he got 10 rows of seats to
himself and his date at the Sony Loews Theater at 67th and
Broadway. Donald Trump likes to think of himself as a man of the
people, and stands in line for tickets and popcorn at his favorite
movie haunt just like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   But when he popped in during the opening scene of ``Elizabeth''
recently and saw the front rows roped off _ apparently because of a
roof leak _ he took the manager up on an offer to let him and his
companion, Melania Kanauss, plop down in the forbidden zone. ``They
said, `Mr. Trump, if you'd like to sit up there, go ahead,' '' he
said. ``So I had about 200 seats to myself.'' Trump called the
film, about the English queen, ``excellent,'' adding: ``It's a
shame it didn't do better. I've never seen such a glut of bad
movies as I have in the last six months.'' &QL;

   If he doesn't watch out, Bill Gates could get a second serving.
All that Gerrit Zalm, the Dutch Finance Minister, could think to
say after getting hit in the face with two custard pies on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange on Monday was: ``This is
incomprehensible.'' One of the two attackers, who were protesting
the introduction of the euro, Europe's new currency, was grabbed by
George Moller, the exchange's president.
</P>
<P>
   The culprits apparently belonged to an offshoot of a movement
run by the Belgian anarchist Noel Godin, who has made a career out
of throwing pies at authority figures _ including Gates, the
Microsoft chief, during a visit to Brussels last February.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Financial Times, Godin has again put Gates at
the top of its list, followed by President Clinton and Tony Blair,
the British prime minister. Given that a Belgian court last week
fined two of Gates' pie throwers a mere 3,000 Belgian francs each _
$86 or, if you wish, 74 euros _ the world's richest man might want
to take his next trip to Asia.

FALLING DOLLAR IS MYSTERY IN SOARING U.S. ECONOMY

(bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even while the stock market hits new highs, a
crucial indicator of foreign confidence in the U.S. government and
its economy _ the dollar _ has been falling. No one can agree why.
</P>
<P>
   By all the normal measures, it should not be happening. The U.S.
economy remains remarkably strong _ President Clinton on Friday was
hailing the longest peacetime economic expansion in the 20th
century. The huge federal budget deficit that once was blamed for
undercutting the dollar has turned into a surplus that is estimated
to hit $76 billion this year. Inflation is practically nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investors are flocking to the Japanese yen. The dollar has
fallen nearly 25 percent against the yen since August even as every
indicator suggests Japan will remain the basket case of the world's
major economies in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the dollar was trading around 145 yen, and many U.S.
officials feared it would rise to 160, to the enormous detriment of
U.S. exporters. Instead, it was trading around 120 yen by
mid-December and bounced around 110 yen this week. What has changed
in the fundamentals that are supposed to govern currencies over the
long term? Very little.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar did better against European currencies, but it is
nonetheless down about 6 percent over the same period against the
German mark.
</P>
<P>
   So what is causing all this? It depends on who you ask, and
where they live. In the United States, some say the cause is the
swelling trade deficit. Others say it is the enthusiasm for the
euro, the single currency that was introduced this week by 11
European nations. Even though the euro has fallen slightly against
the dollar, it seems to be clearly on the way to establishing
itself as the world's No. 2 currency. Still others say the dollar's
decline is a byproduct of Japan's latest act of financial
desperation, an unexpected increase in interest rates that appears
to be drawing investors back to Japan, even if many fear the higher
rates will further slow Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ask foreigners, though, and many say the answer is being beamed
around the globe 24 hours a day: the impeachment trial of Clinton.
``It's what I hear from friends and clients all over the world,''
said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist at Norwest Corp. ``They see
the chief executive of the world's greatest power going on trial
and equate it to what would happen if that was occurring in their
own country. And they conclude, rightly or wrongly, that the U.S.
will not be able to provide leadership if things get dicey again.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, HSBC Securities, part of the HongKong &AMP; Shanghai
Bank group, warned investors in a report to keep an eye on
``political stability'' in Washington. It notes that the market
calculus is that Clinton will stay in office _ but of course the
market calculus is based on the conventional wisdom blaring from
television sets. And the conventional wisdom has been notably wrong
at almost every major turn in the last year of handicapping the
Washington scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quick fix is not likely to be so quick,'' HSBC concluded,
``and the odds could change as well.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Americans, an impeachment explanation for the dollar's
troubles seems outright ridiculous. But the fact of the matter,
says Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., is
that ``there is no wholly rational explanation for this.''
</P>
<P>
   As always when currencies lurch in one direction or another, the
effects are complex and unpredictable. Some of the decline may
simply be a feeling that the sharp rise in the dollar over the
previous couple of years had gone too far. American farmers,
steelmakers and some big manufacturers have been complaining for
over a year that a strong dollar, combined with the collapse of
most Asian economies, was killing their business abroad and
undermining their efforts to compete with cheap imports. For them,
a weakening of the dollar is welcome news _ and it perhaps partly
explains the stock market's recent surge.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the dollar settled at 110.93 yen, down from 111.04
Thursday. It was up slightly against the euro, which fell to
$1.15540 from $1.16700.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one seems to be celebrating at the U.S. Treasury.
There, sharp fluctuations in currencies are viewed as one of the
volatile fuels that have fired 18 months of global instability. The
countries that linked their currencies to the dollar _ chiefly
Thailand and South Korea _ could not sustain the connection as the
dollar strengthened, making their products less and less
competitive abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Just because a rising dollar was bad news in 1997, though, it
doesn't follow that a weakening dollar is necessarily good news in
1999. The world has changed a lot since then.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, the ground zero of the world's economic troubles
is Japan. A bad year for Japan could mean a bad year for the rest
of Asia, because there will be no engine of regional growth. And
the strengthening of the yen is grim news for Japan's exports _ the
best hope Japan has of limping back to growth by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   So in a strange way, the Clinton administration finds itself as
worried about what a weak dollar means for Japan as what it means
for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in this odd position,'' one senior administration
official said this week. ``What looks like good news for us could
in fact turn out to be pretty troublesome for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved question is whether the fall of the dollar and
the rise of the yen says more about what investors around the world
are thinking about America, or what they are thinking about Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sung noted that ``America is saving less and less, and that is
leading to some pessimism, and it doesn't look like the current
account will be turning around soon.'' The current account is the
broadest measure of financial flows.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the talk of declining profits later this year clearly has
many investors around the world spooked. These factors, combined
with the political uncertainties of impeachment, create nervousness
about the champion economy of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the more mystifying change of perception concerns
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The country's economic outlook is hardly improved; the best
prognosis calls for 1999 to be a lot like 1998. But in one of those
oddities that has peppered the Asian financial crisis, interest
rates in Japan, which have been at rock bottom, are going up. And
that may be luring money back into the country.
</P>
<P>
   The rates are going up because the Japanese government is
issuing bonds with unaccustomed abandon, to finance a growing
deficit as it tries to stimulate the economy. The higher rates _
combined with the cuts in American rates several months ago _ have
narrowed the previously huge gap between Treasury bonds and Japan's
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, Japanese officials seem to be encouraging the
rising yen. Earlier this week Eisuke Sakakibara, the Finance
Ministry official once known as Yen for his ability to move the
markets (an ability that has waned), referred to the U.S. stock
market as ``bubble-like.'' Sakakibara has expressed that view many
times before, making the argument that the United States today
looks like Japan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Japan's top motivation for tolerating a high yen, no
matter the damage it does, is political. The embrace of the euro
confirmed a Japanese nightmare _ that years of weakness have
undermined the yen's role as the world's second currency. So
Japan's politicians, led by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, are
circling the globe this week talking about a currency triumvirate _
the dollar, the euro, the yen. To make that stick, there needs to
be a strong yen, not a weak one.

WALKER RARING TO GO FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Antoine Walker will be in Boston Tuesday. The Celtics
forward is planning to stay in the area a while. Like, say, for the
next seven seasons. The NBA lockout is over, and, Walker hopes, so
are the questions about his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Celtic, man,'' he said Friday from his home in Chicago.
``Write it down. Boston is where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been plenty of post-lockout analysis of the winners
and losers in the NBA's six-month labor dispute. Most people
believe that owners, such as the Celtics' Paul Gaston, won. Most
also believe that young stars such as Walker, prevented from
earning $100 million multiyear contracts with the new collective
bargaining agreement, lost. But if you tell Walker that, he might
ask you to check your math as well as your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be playing, to be honest with you,'' he said.
``The new deal says I can make something like $85 million over
seven years. That's good enough for me. That's a lot of money. I
look at it like this: If you can't live off of $85 million, you
shouldn't be living. I just want to be in a position to take care
of my family. I'm not disappointed about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my thing is that we could have been playing basketball a
long time ago. We could have been playing in November. We held out
so we wouldn't have a hard salary cap, and now that's what we have,
so what were we holding out for? I'm just ready to play now. I was
kind of anxious in November, but now it's real bad. I can't wait to
get back on the court. I'm in good spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   When training camp opens in this abbreviated season, the Celtics
can then begin negotiating with Walker. The team can offer Walker a
maximum of $85 million over seven seasons. It looks as if that will
happen sooner than later. So it doesn't appear likely that the
Celtics will wait for Walker to play out the final year of his
current contract before deciding to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   All of Walker's contract questions could be answered as soon as
the end of this month. But that's later. Now the 6-foot-9-inch
forward is ready to play in an NBA game for the first time since
April 18, the last game of the 1997-98 season. Those with active
imaginations may envision bloated players, idle for six months,
wheezing up and down NBA courts across North America. That may
happen. But Walker will not be one of the severely winded ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some real good games here in Chicago,'' he said.
``Me, Scottie (Pippen), Ron Harper, Juwan (Howard), and Randy Brown
have been playing almost every day. Sometimes guys from out of town
will come in, so we've had some games with (Charles) Oakley, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not crazy enough to say that all the players around the
league have been playing during the lockout, because that ain't
true. But I think you'll see good ball played in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he remains locked at his playing weight, 245-250
pounds. He often worked out twice a day in Chicago. Fortunately for
him, he took care of his body and his finances during the lockout.
There are two reasons he didn't find himself in a bind during the
shutdown: He signed a 10-year contract with adidas over the summer
(the money from the shoe company began coming in November) and he
has saved his money from the first two years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not saying it didn't hurt to look up every two weeks
and be missing a paycheck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that basketball has been returned to the courts after
spending a summer and fall on negotiating tables, Walker likes the
idea of talking about the Celtics and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a real good chance of getting in there,'' he
said. ``I like our team. We've got everybody coming back. Compare
that to the team around here (the Bulls). They have nine spots to
fill. With us, we've had a year playing under Coach (Rick Pitino),
so we should know what to expect. We'll be ready. And I think
(rookie forward) Paul Pierce will pick things up fast, because
everybody can help him with the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans may remember Walker's comments from the summer
regarding Pierce. He said then that the Celtics may have been more
improved if they had drafted a big man. But that was before Walker
saw Pierce play. He likes the 6-7 forward's game.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is, will anyone be at the FleetCenter to watch
the young Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the fans come back,'' Walker said. ``I hope they
understand that we didn't call for the lockout. We didn't want the
game to be shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, arenas will host NBA games again. You will
be able to find Walker at the FleetCenter. Perhaps for the next
seven years.

IN FRANCE, IT'S ZONE EURO; OUI; EUROLAND, NON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everywhere else in the world, ``Euroland'' has caught on as a
brief and handy collective nickname for the 11 countries that are
phasing out their national currencies in favor of the euro.
Everywhere else in Europe, nobody much cares what people call the
single-currency area.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere else is not France. Besides an easily wounded
pride, France possesses a self-selected body called the Academie
Francaise that defends the French language against neologisms and
coinages that do not meet its standards for euphony, consistency
and, well, Frenchness.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the academy gave le veto to ``Euroland.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says ``Dollarland'' or ``Poundland,'' the academy said.
Besides, spoken with a French accent, that last syllable can come
out sounding like ``lande,'' which in French can connote a barren
wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   The academy said it ``declares therefore that it is the term
`zone euro' which must be employed in France and in French-speaking
countries'' (declared in French, naturally).
</P>
<P>
   Though the academy did not say so, its allergy to ``Euroland''
seems to arise from the term's having originated with American
investment banks. Any expression that imperialist America applies
to something connected with France must be meant as an insult, one
way or another &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With deregulation prompting a flood of new mutual fund offerings
in the Japanese market, fund managers anxious to stand out from the
crowd have abandoned the traditional nomenclature of fund names _
``equity,'' ``growth,'' ``global,'' ``strategic'' and so on _ in
favor of a new trend, naming funds after Italian classical and
Renaissance icons.
</P>
<P>
   Recent months have seen new funds named for Galileo, Marco Polo,
Christopher Columbus, Leonardo da Vinci and even Mona Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind what's in the fund's portfolio, the thinking goes.
Give it a name that conveys depth, wisdom, prestige, foresight,
searching intelligence. For example, a Goldman, Sachs spokesman in
Tokyo said the firm named its global equity fund Marco Polo to
convey the exploratory feeling of a vehicle that invests in various
instruments around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Mona Lisa? ``Some funds don't have exact meanings
but are meant to set off a noble sort of image,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, famous long-dead people have another great advantage:
they work cheap. Living celebrities and the estates of the lately
departed usually require payment for use of their names and
likenesses, but Leonardo et al. are in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   Not every historically named fund invokes a European personage.
The Daiwa Asset Management Co. named an equity fund for Musashi,
the 17th-century Japanese swordsman whose ``Book of Five Rings''
was (in English, naturally) a favorite of Western business
strategists in the 1980s. Keizo Mizude, a spokesman for Daiwa, said
Musashi, a two-sword fencer, lends the fund an air of versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Which of Japan's dead-Italian funds is closest to being the
country's Magellan? So far, it's Galileo, with 300 billion yen
($2.7 billion) in assets. &QL;

REPORT CALLS FOR CLOSING OF VULNERABLE EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EMBASSY-BOMBS) 
(JT) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Special panels set up by the State Department to
investigate the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa called on
the department Friday to consider closing a number of embassies
around the world that are vulnerable to terrorist attack and
replacing them with regional ``super-embassies.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint report to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
two panels harshly criticized the department for an ``institutional
failure'' to recognize the threats posed by international terrorist
groups and by truck bombs like those that destroyed the embassies
in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, last August.
</P>
<P>
   It also recommended that the department seek an extra $1.4
billion a year over the next decade to upgrade security at scores
of diplomatic posts _ a figure far higher than any discussed
publicly by the Clinton administration in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every likelihood that there will be further large
bombs and other kinds of attacks,'' the report said. ``We must face
this fact and do more to provide security or we will continue to
see our people killed, our embassies blown away, and the reputation
of the United States overseas eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was prepared by panels led by Adm. William
Crowe, the retired chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and a
former U.S. ambassador to Britain, provided new detail about the
chaos that followed the nearly simultaneous bombings in East
Africa, in which more than 220 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One panel investigated the attack in Nairobi, while the other
studied the bombing in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   Their joint report noted that the first government jet ferrying
relief supplies from the United States to Nairobi did not arrive
until nearly 40 hours after the bombing _ 15 hours late, because
the first plane broke down _ and that it took almost two days for
the Air Force to arrange the first medical evacuations, in part
because of a ``misunderstanding'' over how long the Air Force crew
needed to rest in Kenya before flying out again.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that in Kenya, many employees of the
embassy died because they had never been trained in how to react to
warnings of a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that after hearing grenades and gunshots fired by the
terrorists, many embassy employees went to the window to watch the
firefight instead of hitting the ground, as they should have known
to do; several were decapitated as a result of the subsequent
explosion of a truck bomb, which sent glass flying into the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   It also criticized the Kenyan government for having repeatedly
refused an embassy request before the bombing for a special radio
frequency dedicated to embassy security.
</P>
<P>
   Private guards hired by the State Department to protect the
embassy were never trained in how to detect car bombs or how to
raise an alarm if they were found. Even so, the report said, the
guards ``performed valiantly and their courageous refusal to permit
the terrorists access to the embassy's garage prevented an even
greater disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The report identified ``an institutional failure of the
Department of State and embassies under its direction to recognize
threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicles bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the department, it said, policy-making and operational
officers ``were remiss in not preparing more comprehensive
procedures to guard against massive truck bombs. This combined with
lack of resources for building more security facilities created the
ingredients for a deadly disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Crowe at a news conference at the State
Department, Albright did not directly address the report's detailed
criticism of the department, focusing instead on its other finding
that there was a ``collective failure'' by several agencies of
government over decades to provide adequate security to American
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report suggests that responsibility for this failure must
be shared broadly, including by the Secretary of State, and I
accept that,'' she said. ``It reminds us all that no matter how
much we care, no matter how much we do, we can always do more when
the lives of our people are on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that while she supported a much larger budget for
embassy security, the State Department had to be realistic about
how much money it could obtain from Congress, which has repeatedly
sought to cut the its budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``As secretary of state, I have a broader mandate to insure the
effective promotion of U.S. interests and values around the
world,'' she said. ``We will continually have to make difficult and
inherently subjective decisions about how best to use the resources
we have and how to reconcile security imperatives with our need to
do business overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior department officials are expected to resist a central
conclusion of the report, which found that the department should
``consider reducing the size and number of our embassies through
the use of modern technology and by moving, in some cases, to
regional posts in less threatened and vulnerable countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Under such a plan, regional embassies _ ``super-embassies,'' as
they are known within the department _ would take over management
of diplomatic affairs for several countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be very candid,'' Crowe said. ``That's a tender subject
at the State Department, because it has always been an American
principle that we will fly the flag in as many locations as
possible overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials noted that the embassy in Nairobi
served as just such a regional hub. The ambassador to the Sudan and
his staff had moved to Nairobi because the embassy building in
Sudan was thought to be vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
   The department provided new details of the extent of the
deficiencies, revealing Friday that a security review prompted by
the bombings in Africa had found that 88 percent of all U.S.
embassies did not meet architectural standards that require
diplomatic compounds to be set back at least 100 feet from the
street.
</P>
<P>
   David Carpenter, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic
security, said at the news conference with Crowe that the State
Department's headquarters in Washington is among the buildings that
do not meet the 100-foot standard.
</P>
<P>
   The department recently installed heavy concrete barriers around
the building, but he acknowledged that the State Department was
still vulnerable to attack. To increase security further, he said,
the department was considering closing the central public entrance
in Washington, on C Street, N.W.

 GORTON CLEBRATES ROLE IN SENATE COMPROMISEx  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton would have spent Friday
celebrating anyway _ it was his 71st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton, R-Wash., was also celebrating what he called ``one
of the most rewarding experiences I've had in the Senate,'' his
central role in developing the bipartisan plan for proceeding with
the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was one of four senators who drafted the final compromise
plan approved unanimously by the Senate Friday. Senators from both
parties said it was his month-long effort to hammer out a proposal
with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., that made the deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Joe Lieberman, in a bipartisan way, put their heads
together, they started thinking about it, they started coming up
with ideas, and we moved forward and it led to what we have here
before us,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he talked to Gorton daily over the past few weeks.
``So I want to thank Slade for being willing to do that and for
enduring praise and criticism that he has had to live with over the
past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gorton and Lieberman failed to sell their own plan,
which might have led to an abbreviated trial proceeding, to the
full Senate. It was one of the plan's most vocal critics, Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, along with Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who found a
way to alter the plan to win approval by allowing senators to vote
on each proposal to bring in a witness or discuss new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But senators said Gorton and Lieberman played a critical role
both in laying the groundwork for a bipartisan plan and in writing
the final agreement. After a closed-door meeting at which Gramm and
Kennedy verbalized the final compromise, Gorton and Lieberman, both
former state attorneys general, joined them in Lott's office to
write the language that was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enjoyed cussing and discussing him (Gorton) and his
proposals for the last week,'' said assistant majority leader Don
Nickles, R-Okla. ``He has shown great courage and leadership, and
he has worked with all of us ... Republicans and Democrats, to try
to forge a bipartisan resolution to this challenge. And I
compliment him for his legislative skills in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has been working with Lieberman to come up with a plan
for a Senate trial after the House impeached Clinton on perjury and
obstruction of justice charges for his alleged effort to conceal
his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a formal plan, it became outmoded fairly quickly, but it
triggered a wide range of conversations among Republicans and among
Democrats and most importantly between members of the two
parties,'' Gorton said. ``All of us are elated that we did not
start out with a partisan vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that he wound up at the center of the firestorm
because of his close relationships with Lieberman, which dates back
two decades, and with Lott, for whom Gorton is counselor and
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a great sense of gratification that we started the
procedures that brought members together on both sides of the
political aisle and ended in this result,'' Gorton said. ``My
colleagues are delighted with me, and it's hard to get a better
feeling than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment issue carries risks for Gorton, who says he
plans to run for re-election to a fourth term in the Senate next
year. Removing Clinton from office _ a step Gorton says he is
inclined to support _ is likely to be unpopular in Washington,
where a plurality of voters supported Clinton in 1992 and 1996. And
his work for a bipartisan handling of the trial is alienating some
conservatives in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton said he had no choice but to take a position on
impeachment, and as a lawyer who delights in nitty-gritty legal
debates, he jumped into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a United States senator, (and) even if I sat still like
the bump on a log, I'm going to have to vote at some point or
another on it,'' he said. ``But more importantly than that, I'm a
United states Senator under the Constitution of the United States,
and the Constitution calls for these procedures, and to me it is
the inevitable duty that one do the best that one can. ... I think
it's my duty to try to see to it to the best of my ability that the
Senate does do impartial justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the Senate trial is a political process, not a
judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a tremendous burden, and I guess part of the reason
that I feel that burden is that this is only the second time this
has ever taken place in our history,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the burden is more the importance of the issue
and the weight of the oath (of impartiality) than it is some
abstract conception of history. ... Will it be a part of history?
Yes it will be. But the real burden is doing impartial justice.''

MIDSEASON OFFERS FROM THE WB AND UPN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel &AMP; Spa here
is again the setting for TV's ritual re-enactment of ``Crime and
Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime: An uninspiring fall season. The punishment: Two weeks
in a hotel with producers, stars and network executives who promise
to do better with their midseason replacements.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it beats having to undergo dental surgery. And what better
way to begin than with a tale of two networks going in opposite
directions?
</P>
<P>
   At The WB, smiles are broad and thumbs are up as critical
acclaim and rising viewership make it easy for CEO Jamie Kellner to
repeat something he said four years ago: ``Is there room for six
networks? The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that there are now seven, if you count Pax TV. At
UPN, where CEO Dean Valentine has watched viewership plummet by
almost half this season, the rebuttal to Kellner was defiant and
predictable: ``UPN will be here way past the time that these
conferences in Pasadena are here.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN is pinning its hopes on an animated version of the comic
strip ``Dilbert'' (premiering Jan. 25), even though another of its
animated entries, ``Home Movies'' (April 26), might be funnier.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a glut of prime-time animation projects is the most
noticeable trend this midseason as producers try to divine what it
is that viewers want. More on that in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some early observations from Pasadena:
</P>
<P>
   _ At The WB, where crossing over from TV to feature films is
standard procedure for the network's photogenic young hotties,
people still wonder about the private lives of movie stars. So,
sometime this spring, The WB will give a trial run to _ ta da! _
``Movie Stars,'' a comedy that claims to have an insider's view.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hamlin (``L.A. Law'') and Jennifer Grant (``Beverly Hills,
90210'') play Reese Hardin and Jacey Wyatt, a Hollywood power
couple whose Malibu property is also home to three kids, Reese's
Juilliard-trained but unemployed brother and Jacey's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had to audition for a part, Grant seems a natural:
She's the daughter of Dyan Cannon and the late Cary Grant. But the
idea of acting scared her at first _ still does _ so she went to
Stanford and planned to become a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing she had no passion for the bar, she tried other
avenues after graduation _ cooking at Spago, working for an
advocacy firm _ until a friend suggested she take acting lessons.
Acutely aware of her parents' genes, Grant said: ``I was afraid of
following in their footsteps.'' But after a few classes, she knew
she'd found herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally felt my whole body kind of settle,'' she said, ``and
I thought, `This is what I want to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Urich, Capt. Jim Kennedy III on UPN's ``Love Boat: The
Next Wave,'' says he's never had the good fortune to be on a
long-running series. Still, his face is one of the most familiar on
TV. His reason: ``I've taken just about everything I've been
offered.''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Urich added: ``I guess I have a certain ability
that works on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Urich, who survived a battle with a rare type of cancer, says
his health is excellent, aside from a lack of sleep since the birth
of a daughter eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ It started out as ``Zoe Bean,'' but now it's ``Zoe, Duncan,
Jack &AMP; Jane'' to reflect the ``ensemble'' nature. The WB would love
it if viewers think of it as ``Seinfeld, the Early Years'' or
``Friends, Before They Got Nice Apartments,'' and executives hope
it brings to a half-hour comedy the sensibility that critics have
admired in some of The WB's dramas, specifically, ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the ``ZDJ&AMP;J'' ensemble, while purporting to reflect
reality, skews it to fit the common TV network perception of same.
Thus, we have four white teens (real ages: 17, 24, 26 and 26)
living in melting-pot Manhattan where their encounters with people
of color set up the uncomfortable conclusion perpetuated for years
on ``Seinfeld'' and ``Friends,'' that is, that white people are
normal and non-whites aren't.
</P>
<P>
   The WB, already considered the little network that could, would
take a giant leap forward by flouting such a pernicious convention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heartthrob emeritus Greg Evigan (remember ``B.J. and the
Bear,'' ``My Two Dads''?) is another survivor who always seems to
get work. Evigan returns to the sitcom format in a UPN series
called ``Family Rules,'' in which he plays the single parent _
there's a unique concept _ of four teenage girls.
</P>
<P>
   Though a prime-time series (premiering March 9), ``Family
Rules'' has the juvenile look and feel of Saturday morning fare.
(Think ``Saved by the Bell'' without Screech.) Creator Russell
Marcus, who admits the premise isn't exactly original, is banking
on the different levels of maturity in males and females.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a study they've done where 40-year-old guys actually
think of themselves as 28 to 32, and 17-year-old girls think of
themselves as 25. So, essentially,'' he said, ``we have a household
run by 27-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   And people say TV is running out of fresh and funny ideas ...

SENATORS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVE GUIDELINES IN IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF
CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators gave their unanimous approval Friday to
guidelines for the impeachment trial of President Clinton following
an extraordinary gathering in the Old Senate Chamber.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two hours of lofty and anxious debate they
struck a complicated deal to begin the case with opening arguments
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 100-0, the 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats also
agreed to limit the prosecution's opening presentation to the
evidence contained in the public record of the House impeachment
hearings. The House proceedings last month resulted in two articles
of impeachment, charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of
justice in his alleged cover up of an affair with White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, however, put off a crucial decision on whether to
allow the 13-member House prosecution team, made up of Republicans,
to call witnesses and present so-called ``new evidence'' in the
case that has not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today we have acted in the very best tradition of the
Senate, and it is an appropriate approach for this historic, very
solemn event,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. He
praised his colleagues for coming up with a bipartisan compromise
on rules to govern what is the first impeachment trial of a
president in nearly 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to the White House and the whole country is we
have a process that will be expeditious and fair,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the agreement, which took place with Chief Justice
William Rehnquist presiding over the Senate, also authorized
dispatch of a summons to the White House on Friday night informing
Clinton to ``abide by'' and ``obey'' the trial rules and asking him
to provide any pretrial motions to the Senate by 5 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Chicago, was not present when the summons
was hand-delivered by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms James W. Ziglar.
</P>
<P>
   But White House special counsel Greg Craig said Clinton's legal
team planned to mount a ``successful and complete defense'' that
would prove the charges against Clinton ``do not justify or warrant
conviction or removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who will
serve as the chief prosecutor in the case, expressed disappointment
that he and his colleagues would not be allowed to call witnesses
or offer new evidence to bolster their initial presentation. But he
said House prosecutors would still make ``a compelling case'' for
convicting Clinton and would likely make a motion as the trial
proceeds ``to call witnesses in support of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ended days of uncertainty over just what blueprint
would be used to guide the senators through their ``court of
impeachment,'' which will determine whether the 42nd president of
the United States should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was hammered out following an unprecedented closed-door
meeting of all senators in the historic Old Senate Chamber, where
they were reminded in a stirring speech by Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., of their grave responsibilities not only as lawmakers but
now as jurors sworn to deliver ``impartial justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a 41-year veteran of the Senate, appealed to his
colleagues not to allow partisan bickering to consume the
institution, which he described as hallowed ground. He called on
them to act like historical giants of the Senate _ Daniel Webster
and Henry Clay, to name two _ and consider ``higher things'' in
their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House has sullied itself,'' he said in his remarks,
which were released later by his office. ``The House has fallen
into the black pit of partisan self-indulgence. The Senate is
teetering on the brink of that same black pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who joined with Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to fashion the bipartisan compromise that was
eventually ratified by unanimous vote, said Byrd ``set the tenor
for what we have achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gramm-Kennedy trial plan the impeachment court will
convene Wednesday to hear any motions that the prosecution and
defense teams might offer. Opening arguments would begin the
following day, with the House prosecution team leading off. Both
sides will be given up to 24 hours each to make their case _ spread
out over a number of days.
</P>
<P>
   Once the presentations are over, the senators would then have up
to 16 hours _ again, spread out over a few days if necessary _ to
ask questions through Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   When the question phase of the trial ends, the prosecution and
defense teams would be given a chance to offer motions to present
witnesses or evidence not in the public record. But senators also
would be allowed to make motions of their own either to adjourn the
trial or censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   The motions would all be debated at the same time and then voted
on separately. A majority of 51 votes would be required for
approval. If a motion to hear from witnesses succeeds, then a
Senate panel of three Democrats and three Republicans would depose
them. The Senate then would vote again on allowing the appearance
of each witness.
</P>
<P>
   If a motion to adjourn or censure the president succeeds, then
the trial would end without a final vote on the impeachment
charges. If that final vote occurs, it would take a two-thirds vote
of the senators, 67, to either convict or acquit the president of
the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   If everything goes smoothly, the trial could be wrapped up by
the end of January or early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this is a very fair process,'' Gramm told
reporters after he and Kennedy had hammered out the final details.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting in the old chamber, which has not been used
for official Senate deliberations in 141 years, the Democrats and
Republicans were floating different plans. The Democrats, joined by
a few Republicans, were against the idea of testimony from
witnesses or evidence that had not been made part of the public
record. They argued that the Republicans had a chance to call
witnesses in the House hearing and chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House did a poor job,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
``It's like they flunked the high school exam and now they want to
make it up in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans for the most part were willing to concede to Hyde's
demand that he be allowed to present witnesses in his opening
presentation, beginning with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, one of the most conservative members of the Senate, and
Kennedy, one of the most liberal, are normally miles apart on
issues. But they were lauded for coming up with the plan that
appeared to satisfy all on the question of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stranger things have happened in politics, but the
Kennedy-Gramm alignment is one of the strangest. It was
remarkable,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the Gramm-Kennedy deal grew out of the fact that
members were beginning to feel an ``extreme discomfort'' about
``the way this thing was headed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime motivating factor was that we saw that we were not
going to be able to carry out our constitutional responsibilities
unless we carved out some kind of bipartisan agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain noted that despite the bipartisan rules, there
would likely be problems as the trial proceeds because ``we are
still feeling our way on this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a minefield. Things can blow up the whole process even
starting tomorrow. But the reality is that what we did today I
think was of ... great importance,'' he said.

   CARROLL COUNTY, Ga. _ A 15-year-old Carroll County girl was
killed and her boyfriend wounded Friday in a high school bathroom
shooting authorities describe as a suicide pact.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Garrett, 15, was prounced dead at a nearby hospital. Her
boyfriend, 17-year-old Jeff Miller, was airlifted to Crawford Long
Hospital in Atlanta where he was listed in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers were students at Central High School in
Carrollton, the county seat of Carroll County, 40 miles west of
Atlanta. They were shot in a girl's bathroom during first period
with a .22 caliber pistol that had been taken from a locked gun
safe at the girl's home, according to Carroll County Sheriff Tony
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, it seemed to be planned,'' Reeves said.
``We do know each of them intended on dying today. It was a suicide
pact.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said the shootings are still under investigation, and he
could not confirm whether the teens shot themselves, how the
shootings occurred or who brought the gun on campus. The sheriff
said investigators also are still looking into the possibility of a
suicide note. ``This is where they chose to do this for whatever
reason,'' Reeves said. ``There's nothing anybody could have done to
have stopped this.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy and girl were found by a janitor making a routine stop.
Student Tiffany O'Steen said the victims stayed to themselves.
Recently, Garrett had shown up in class crying, and Miller had made
statements to other students that he might not be around much
longer, said O'Steen, a 17-year-old senior who shared a class with
Garrett and a homeroom with Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always trying to get attention, so I guess nobody
really thought anything of that. He didn't have (many) friends,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he didn't know what motivated the couple but
students said the two were under parental pressure to break up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents didn't agree on the age difference,'' said Central
Carroll senior Kenon Parham, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's parents and other relatives in both families said
Friday they did not want to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Parham, who said he had known Miller for several years, said the
couple started dating last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett was a sophomore, a member of the school band, and made
good grades, he said. Miller, a senior, had the reputation of being
odd, Parham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was humorous,'' said Crystal Kelly, 17, a junior. ``He
always made weird noises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would see him as a weird person,'' Parham said.
``But from what I knew of him, he was one of the smartest people I
know. If he wanted good grades, he could have had them.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials said Miller was not at school Thursday. Friends
said the boy no longer lived at home, but the boy's grandparents
said he had been living with his parents and with friends. The
parents could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, the sheriff, said he had heard that Miller and Garrett
had each given away favorite possessions to friends before the
shooting _ Andrea, a CD collection, and Jeff, his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard those rumors, but we haven't been able to confirm
them yet,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the morning shootings, two dozen counselors and about
seven school psychologists brought in from across the school system
went to the school to help students and faculty cope with the
tragedy. Almost immediately, parents began picking up their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday we will attempt to have school as normal, providing
guidance and support as needed,'' Principal Scott Cowart said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's shootings marked the first time since school started in
the fall that a student had brought a weapon on campus.

BROKAW DRAWS RAVES FOR HIS HEARTFELT NOD TO A GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw is getting lots of fan mail these days, and it has
nothing to do with his anchorman gig on the ``NBC Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very gratifying,'' he said this week as he prepared for a
West Coast swing to promote a book that hardly needs more
tub-thumping. Brokaw already is atop The New York Times'
best-seller list, and anyone who watches even a tiny amount of TV
has probably seen him on a talk show _ talking excitedly about
``The Greatest Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he's got a publisher to please. But it's a subject
Brokaw doesn't seem to tire of, even when discussing it for the
umpteenth time. And now, as America embraces this paean to a
generation that emerged from an economic depression only to face a
world war, he hopes his first book might be a catalyst, an agent
for ``creating a dialogue between generations'' that could lead to
a sort of bonding over common ground.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't happen, Brokaw still is happy to have told the
stories of dozens of American heroes, some of whom did
extraordinary things on the battlefield and have the medals to
prove it, but most of whom did not what their country expected of
them but simply what they expected of themselves when the chips
were down.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw writes: ``This generation helped save the world from
fascism, returned home to marry and go to college in record
numbers, rebuild their former enemies, stand fast against
communism, give us great art, science, the interstate highway
system, Medicare, and the greatest economy the world has ever
known.''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point in an age when it's almost easier to play the
victim than to exercise personal responsibility, he adds: ``They
never whined or whimpered. I am in awe of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It shows. Though he is no spellbinder, Brokaw writes clearly and
with abiding reverence about the people who agreed to share their
``war stories'' with him _ men like Thomas Broderick, an American
paratrooper who was shot through the head during the World War II
Battle of Arnhem. Broderick survived; his eyesight didn't.
Embittered at first, he eventually accepted his blindness, married,
had seven kids and founded a successful business.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem few could match Broderick's story for sheer
courage and determination, but Brokaw's book is brimming with such
tales of personal heroism, whether it was overcoming serious
injury, watching a brother die on a bloody beach, or taking care of
business on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   It is these people who are now writing ``wonderful, handwritten
letters'' to Brokaw, appreciative of being appreciated for things
they did a half-century ago. It's hard to get through most chapters
of the book without wiping away a tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``These truly are people who never expected that other people
would take notice,'' said Brokaw, who, at 58 is old enough to
remember the final days of World War II. ``They simply lived by the
rules established early in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a code of honor that made no distinction as to class, sex
or race, even if society didn't always return the favor. As George
Bush, former president and naval aviator, points out in the book,
service in the war was more honor than duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we owed?'' Bush asks. ``Nothing. Not one damn
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It might sound suspect coming from a career politician, but one
gets the impression that each person Brokaw interviewed would utter
the same words. Indeed, a lesser-known Bush _ Bob Bush of Raymond,
Wash. _ is a genuine war hero who promised his mother that he would
enter the service to help people, not to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was an 18-year-old Navy medic on Okinawa when circumstances
forced him to hold off a band of attacking Japanese soldiers as he
administered plasma to a wounded Marine. He was hit several times,
lost an eye, and won the Congressional Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Would today's American teenager do the same? Brokaw says he's
optimistic, and several members of ``The Greatest Generation'' also
suspect today's young people would rally to a just cause. We might
never have to find out, which could very well be the greatest
legacy of the greatest generation.

DOW SOARS 105.56 TO CLOSE AT NEW RECORD: 9,643.32
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: in references to E(ASTERISK)Trade, replace the word,
including parentheses, with the symbol) 
(bl)  
By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market took a volatile ride to new highs
Friday, finishing a week marked by an Internet stock frenzy, a
surge in other technology stocks and new economic data that showed
the U.S. economy is refusing, so far, to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which seesawed all day,
rallied in the late afternoon to gain 105.56 points, or 1.1
percent, closing at a record 9,643.32.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.36 points, or 0.4
percent, to 1,275.09. The technology heavy Nasdaq index climbed
18.32 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,344.41. Both were also records.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the highfliers of the technology sector, including
Microsoft, Dell Computer, IBM and Netscape Communications, slipped
Friday, the overall sector rose, lead by Cisco Systems and its
promise of a new voice and data modem. The broader market was paced
by Alcoa, which accounted for about one-third of the Dow's surge,
after the company announced better than expected earnings, a stock
split and a dividend increase. The S&AMP;P 500's performance was held
back by declines in drug and consumer stocks, including Pfizer, Eli
Lilly, and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet frenzy cost some investors a lot of money Friday.
Amazon.com surged 40\, or 25.3 percent, to 199[, and then gave up
almost all its gains, finishing up 1] at 160\. E(ASTERISK)Trade,
was up 10 13/16, or 16.9 percent, to 74~, before giving back all
but 3 9/16 of the day's gain. Still, for the first week of the year
Amazon.com was up 49.7 percent and E(ASTERISK)Trade 44.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a good indication of why you have to be pretty
careful,'' said Henry Blodget, senior analyst at CBIC Oppenheimer.
``These stocks are incredibly volatile. They have spiked here
massively and if your time horizon is longer than five minutes you
are taking an inordinate amount of risk buying in at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the technology rally is creating a worrisome two-tier
market. Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities, is positive on technology stocks but concerned about
the rest of the market. ``We are getting real close to the levels
of overvaluation we had in July of last year,'' he said. ``While we
are real enthusiastic about tech, we are recommending caution about
the rest of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the tech rally, not including the Internet mania,
is powered by several credible forces. One is the improvement in
expected demand for computer products since last August. Another is
the billions of dollars of cash that portfolio managers and retail
investors have on hand to invest. The third is that technology
stocks seem to fit nicely into the two possible economic outlooks
for this year. In one, the economy slows and interest rates fall
but the key technology stocks still produce healthy earnings. In
the other, the economy fools most forecasters and does not slow.
Technology stocks are perfect here also, Cliggott said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase of 378,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in December
reported Friday by the Labor Department supports the idea that the
economy remains stubbornly strong, despite many forecasts of a
slowdown. The job growth was far stronger than the 200,000
consensus forecast.
</P>
<P>
   While the news was welcomed in the stock market, it contributed
to weakness in the bond market, where evidence of economic strength
often hurts prices. The Treasury's 30-year issue lost 21/32, to 99
24/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to
5.27 percent from 5.22 percent _ its highest in nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   For the week the Dow was up 5 percent. However, for the last
four weeks, the Dow was up 9.3 percent while the S&AMP;P 500 was up 9.3
percent. And the Nasdaq beat both, rising 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the real sign of the market's torrid pace _ and why a
breather may be in store _ was the surge since the lows in 1998.
The Nasdaq was up 65.2 percent since its Oct. 8 low, while the Dow
gained 27.9 percent since Aug. 31 and the S&AMP;P 500 advanced 33.2
percent since the same date.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of the week was Amazon.com, Tuesday, it announced
that it still had not made a penny in profit. In fact, losses are
expected to rise to 18 cents a share in the fourth quarter report,
three times the losses a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That makes no difference, apparently to investors. They are
betting the online book and music seller is going to be a big
winner in the future.
</P>
<P>
   So all they cared about in Tuesday's announcement was the
projection that fourth-quarter sales would jump to $250 million,
well above forecasts of $175 million.
</P>
<P>
   But those who got in last year have nothing but profits. From
the bottom of the technology selloff Oct. 8, the Nasdaq 100 index,
which includes the biggest of the technology heavyweights, has
soared 74.8 percent. But Amazon.com was up 457.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frenetic buying of Internet stocks is going to make the
tulip buyers of the 17th century look like value players,'' said
Rick Berry, director of equity research at J.P. Turner &AMP; Co. in
Atlanta. &QL;

GORE, IN IOWA, ACCENTUATES THE POSITIVE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX CITY, Iowa _ As the Senate debated how to conduct an
impeachment trial, the chamber's nominal president, Vice President
Al Gore, was 1,000 miles away Friday, talking about hogs,
methamphetamines and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing an apparent White House strategy to focus on policy
as a way to divert attention from events that could drive President
Clinton from office, Gore spent the day immersed in highly scripted
appearances designed to reflect an administration hard at work. For
all the words he uttered about the trial or its potential
consequences, he might as well have been a million miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm hearing is that families here in Iowa, and around the
country, for that matter, are concerned about the issues that
affect their families,'' he said in response to a question about
Iowans' view of the Senate procedures. ``They want to see continued
progress in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, another day of congressional action on the Clinton
scandal passed without Gore publicly expressing much of an opinion,
a tack that serves the dual purpose of promoting the administration
as well as the vice president, who has already begun raising money
for his 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he took a symbolic step of distancing himself from
the trial by declining to swear in Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
who will preside over the impeachment trial. The task was passed to
Sen. Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who, as the
chamber's longest-serving member, is Senate president pro tem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's reluctance to address the trial issue openly or
participate in its proceedings, his aides said Friday that he
continued to receive daily updates from members of his staff and,
between appearances, from telephone conversations with senators he
regarded as friends.
</P>
<P>
   One aide insisted, however, that Gore had made no effort to
lobby senators as a way of influencing their vote on any issue
relating to the trial, asserting that he would consider that
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Iowa, where caucuses in presidential election years
provide the first test for aspirants, Gore made hearty use of his
status on his first visit as a declared candidate by announcing
several budget items that would benefit state residents and by
serving as host at three community discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In Des Moines, Gore said the Department of Agriculture would pay
hog farmers $50 million to help compensate for falling pork prices
and would spend $80 million to slaughter 1.7 million hogs infected
with the contagious virus pseudo-rabies.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also told about 300 people listening to a
forum on methamphetamine, a highly addictive illegal drug, that the
government was taking steps to fight its distribution and abuse,
efforts that would include a $1.2 million grant to the Sioux City
Police Department. Iowa has been hit especially hard by the growing
popularity of methamphetamine, which Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
Clinton's chief drug adviser, characterized at the forum as ``the
worst drug that ever hit America.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sioux City, Gore led a forum on Social Security, in which he
echoed the administration's long-held position that the system
should be protected before any taxes are cut. Later, he joined a
round-table discussion with a dozen women, considering issues
related to domestic violence.

 &HT;    Bipartisian agenda promised in Clinton trial, but witness
question lingers
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the shadow of history upon it, the Senate on
Friday unanimously agreed to a bipartisan framework to conduct the
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement effectively dodges the most contentious issue
between Republicans and Democrats _ how to handle witnesses _ but
assures that the first and only presidential impeachment trial of
this century will at least begin under a spirit of relative unity
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be fair to the Senate on both sides of the
aisle, to the House, and to the White House,'' said majority leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.). ``I think today we have acted in the very
best tradition of the Senate, and it is an appropriate approach for
this historic, very solemn event.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the trial would begin next Wednesday with
motions by the two sides, followed the next day by opening
presentations. House prosecutors and presidential lawyers would be
given until 5 p.m. EST on Monday to file any pretrial motions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for giving House prosecutors and Clinton's legal
team 24 hours each _ over several days _ to make their
presentations. Senators would then have 16 hours _ again spread
over more than one day _ to ask questions through Rehnquist, who
presides over the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the timetable adopted Friday, the House managers or
prosecutors will open their case against Clinton next Thursday and
proceed for three days. Clinton will have three days to present a
defense beginning Jan. 19, to be followed by 16 hours of questions
from senators.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors, who have been pressing to call witnesses to
make their case, would have to wait until after the opening
presentations and questions to learn whether senators would permit
any such witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   After the question period, senators would be free to make
motions _ either to adjourn the trial and move to censure or to
call witnesses and produce evidence not in the House record.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement to reporters at the White House following
the Senate agreement, special counsel Gregory Craig promised a
``vigorous, successful and complete defense'' on behalf of Clinton.
``We are optimistic that senators, once they see and hear this
defense ... will conclude the articles do not justify or warrant
conviction or removal from office,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's sudden agreement on how to proceed with the trial,
which on Thursday had seemed a distant reality, was produced in a
closed meeting of senators in the Senate's old Senate chamber
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Senators met for more than two hours in the chamber that
produced the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the Senate's most
violent internecine attack. In 1856, an angry South Carolina
congressman named Preston Brooks caned Sen. Charles Sumner of
Massachusetts in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Senators on both sides of the aisle delivered impassioned
speeches on the need for the Senate to work together, rise above
partisan conflict and put the interests of the country first. They
quoted Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin and even Chaucer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was statecraft at its best,'' said Sen. Max Cleland
(D-Ga.). ``It was an auspicious moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to what is spelled out in the agreement, there
appeared to be broad consensus that none of the testimony heard on
the Senate floor, even from the official impeachment record,
include graphic details of Clinton's sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   While consideration of witnesses will not now come until at
least two weeks into the trial, under the Senate framework, the
agreement does erect several hurdles. The Senate will effectively
have to vote twice on whether to allow a witness to testify, first
to subpoena a witness and have he or she deposed and then again to
actually permit that person to testify on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   In another potential break for Clinton, the agreement also
requires Senate approval for House prosecutors to introduce
evidence outside the public impeachment record. This means, for
example, that the managers cannot introduce evidence about other
``Jane Does'' who claim to have had sexual encounters with the
president in their opening presentations.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) said the House
managers would use the three days allotted to them to ``present a
compelling case on the serious charges pending against the
president.'' Hyde reiterated the House managers' intention to call
witnesses, with Senate agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), another House manager, was not pleased
with the agreement. ``We don't have a choice,'' he said about the
deal. ``It seems to me that it's highly inappropriate. I think the
Senate ought to rely on our judgment. We ought to be free to call
who we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they congratulated themselves on their work, leaders in
both parties acknowledged that spirit of bipartisanship created
Friday could fall apart further down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing, nothing ever can replace members of this body being
alone with each other and talking to each other,'' said Sen. Chris
Dodd (D-Conn). ``This made a difference. Whether or not it is a
sustainable difference only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans also continued to disagree over
whether the Senate would ever hear from live witnesses. Sen. Jim
Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the Senate's most conservative members,
said he personally reviewed the proposed agreement with House
managers specifically to insure that the option of calling
witnesses was safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe said both he and the House managers were satisfied they
could call witnesses. ``You can't have a trial without witnesses,''
Inhofe said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats acknowledged that they may not have the votes to
prevent witnesses, but they argued that by the time the Senate
reaches the point when witnesses may be called they trial may
already be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have 60,000 pages of evidence entered to the
record. The House will present its side. The White House will
present its side,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). ``(Senators)
are going to see, No. 1, you don't need witnesses and, No. 2 ,
what's the point?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an extraordinary bipartisan caucus that
lasted about three hours, the Senate voted unanimously Friday to
approve a plan for President Clinton's impeachment trial that calls
for opening arguments next week and defers a decision on whether to
summon witnesses until later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement averted further confrontation over rival
Republican and Democratic trial plans that had threatened to send
the Senate into the same partisan spiral as the House. The two
sides had been deeply divided over whether to allow witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief session presided over by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist late Friday afternoon, the senators approved the plan
they had outlined earlier in the Old Senate Chamber, where the
Senate had met throughout the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   An official summons directing Clinton to respond to the two
articles of impeachment against him was delivered to the White
House by James Ziglar, the Senate sergeant-at-arms.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Democrats were wary of the blueprint, many
senators from both parties reveled in institutional pride at
maintaining a conciliatory tone that had eluded the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we didn't ask for this trial,'' said Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt. ``We didn't ask for the president to conduct himself
the way he did, and we didn't ask for the House to make a mishmash
of this thing. But all that's happened and now we have to preserve
the Senate and give the country a sense of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding the same note, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said: ``I
think there's a feeling in this situation that the Senate is on
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in a terse, carefully worded statement, said
Friday afternoon that it respected the Senate's decision. ``In
accordance with the procedures adopted by the Senate, we plan to
present on behalf of the president a vigorous, successful and
complete defense,'' said Gregory Craig, the special White House
counsel, in an appearance in the White House drive shortly after 5.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had hoped that the Senate would settle on an
abbreviated trial without witnesses, confined to the material
submitted by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. White House
aides waited anxiously while the senators met privately on Friday,
and some acknowledged disappointment at the procedure that emerged.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig said the White House was confident that the Senate
would move to cut off the proceeding after the opening
presentations, rather than extend the trial and call witnesses.
``We remain hopeful that this matter can be resolved expeditiously
and fairly,'' he said, before turning his back and walking
resolutely away from shouted questions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate plan approved Friday, the trial of Clinton on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his
efforts to hide his affair with Monica Lewinsky would get under way
in earnest on Wednesday with arguments on any procedural pretrial
motions by House prosecutors or White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the next day, the House has 24 hours to present its
case against the president. Clinton's legal team follows with its
allotted 24 hours. Both sides are precluded from introducing new
evidence unrelated to the impeachment record established in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Senators then will have 16 hours to question the two sides by
sending written queries to Rehnquist, who will be at the presiding
officer's chair in the front of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   At that point _ expected to be either Jan. 25 or Jan. 26 _
senators plan to debate and vote on two separate motions, first a
motion to adjourn the trial and next a motion on whether to call
witnesses. Those votes would be simple majority votes.
</P>
<P>
   If witnesses are approved, the House prosecutors or the White
House would question them first in a deposition. Sen. Tom Daschle,
the minority leader, said a second majority vote would be required
to have witnesses testify before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had previously stood adamantly against witnesses,
are taking solace in the fact that witnesses would have to be
approved en bloc, which they believe would discourage the House
from seeking to call too many witnesses. They also anticipate that
the senators _ sitting as jurors under a vow of silence _ will have
a diminishing appetite for witnesses after listening to the House
and White House for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing the Senate can't tolerate and that's
remaining quiet for very long,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn. ``And the idea they are going to sit there day after day
and listen to House managers and White House counsels, with their
inability to respond, is not going to last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the leader of the House impeachment managers,
said, ``We intend to use the time we have been provided to present
a compelling case on the serious charges pending against the
president. We also look forward to the opportunity _ with Senate
concurrence _ to call witnesses in support of evidence. The House
managers have said they want to call anywhere from five to 15
witnesses ranging from Ms. Lewinsky to an array of current and
former White House advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote brought to an end weeks of uncertainty and
contention over how the first presidential impeachment trial since
1868 should proceed. On Thursday the two sides had scheduled votes
on competing Republican and Democratic plans, but then pulled back.

</P>
<P>
   And so Friday began with a last attempt to reach across party
lines in the ceremonial room that served as the Senate chamber
between 1810 and 1859, when some of the great debates and
confrontations over slavery took place. The chamber was placed
under heavy security. Folding chairs supplemented the permanent
seats to accommodate the senators, whose number was greater than
that of their counterparts in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans assured Democrats that despite the House
prosecutors' insistence on witnesses, they too did not want a
sordid discussion of sex to take place in the Senate chamber.
``What was helpful in the room was for the Democrats to learn there
are a whole lot of Republicans who are not anxious to have a bunch
of witnesses either,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators said the sense of the history of the room helped
foster an atmosphere where they could come together. ``Every
senator knows the level of oratory and the weight of the issues
discussed here,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``It helped
all the senators put this in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd reminded his colleagues that ``one of the saddest moments
in Senate history'' had taken place in the room _ the caning of
Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts by Preston Brooks of South
Carolina. ``Many historians feel that was when the comity in the
Senate broke down, leading three and a half years later to the
commencement of the Civil War,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, breakthrough
came when an unusual pair _ Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts
liberal, and Phil Gramm, a Texas conservative _ made back-to-back
statements. ``I describe it as the Kennedy-Gramm or the
Gramm-Kennedy proposal,'' Lott told reporters. He then stressed the
bizarre notion of these two ideological opposites working together,
by saying with relish, ``Did you hear what I said?''
</P>
<P>
   Other senators said Gramm pointed out that under Senate
impeachment rules a vote on witnesses could always be demanded by
any party _ there was no way around it. Kennedy agreed that the
Texan was right and started suggesting ways to make the witness
situation more palatable to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the Democrats who moved the most, to accept a
proposal much like the one the Republicans had originally drafted.
And some Senate Democrats expressed private annoyance that Kennedy
had been so quick to support Gramm because they thought he gave
away a tactical advantage stemming from the Republicans'
unwillingness to look as partisan as their House counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat close to the developments said the White House as
well had been trying to get Democrats to forgo the display of
bipartisanship. But Senate Democrats said they felt they had won
the best deal they could from the majority Republicans. Some also
made clear that they had more allegiance to the Senate as an
institution than to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, said, when asked about White
House grumbling. ``They have no say.'' He added, ``We're not here
to defend either the White House or the House of Representatives.''

RIGHTS GROUPS SUING FLORIDA FOR FAILURE TO EDUCATE PUPILS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., N.C., Conn., Ohio)   By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coalition of Florida civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in
state court in Tallahassee Friday, accusing the state of violating
the rights of tens of thousands of schoolchildren by failing to
provide them with an adequate education as required by the state
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-page complaint names 19 pupils, all members of minorities
from poor schools where a large percentage of students fail state
reading and mathematics exams. It cites the state constitutional
requirement that ``adequate provision shall be made by law for a
uniform system of free public schools,'' and says the state has
failed to live up to that guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``All schools are required to provide adequate education and
many of these schools are not meeting the state's own minimal
standards,'' said Laura Besvinick, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
``Florida is ranked in the lowest 5 to 10 states in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the schools affected have large enrollments of black and
Hispanic students, although the lawsuit does not accuse them of
discrimination. Rather, as part of a growing trend in such
lawsuits, it tries to hold the state to its own word regarding a
constitutional promise to educate its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Shaw, associate director and counsel of the NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, which is not involved in the suit,
said, ``I think we are going to see more of these suits because the
quality of education is so abysmally poor and these schools are
being used as warehouses with no expectations of these students,
especially students of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``With federal desegregation cases now fading, people are
looking at educational adequacy as the best hope. They are being
pushed in that direction by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar lawsuits have been filed in Alabama, North Carolina,
Ohio and Connecticut. But the Florida suit is unusual in its
singular focus on educational adequacy rather than on racial
imbalances or the inequality of educational resources or spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida suit, brought by a group that includes the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the League of
United Latin American Citizens and the Florida Appleseed Center for
Law and Justice Inc. does not seek monetary damages, only an
improvement in education.
</P>
<P>
   A state referendum that passed in November and went into effect
this week refines the state's obligation as that of providing a
``uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high-quality system of free
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   John M. Ratliff of the Children First Project at Nova
Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said the plaintiffs intended to work with the new
administration of Gov. Jeb Bush and the Legislature to make sure
the new provisions were met.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the courts to insure that this opportunity is not
missed,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the schools in greatest crisis were in large urban
centers and rural areas. But the lawsuit was filed in the name of
the 1.4 million pupils _ a third of whom have failed the state
exams _ in all the schools where an adequate education toward
functional literacy had not been provided.

NEW YORK'S 4TH GRADERS PREPARE TO TAKE `THE TEST' 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linda LoPresti paid a price for her anxiety: $120.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety came from New York State's new fourth-grade English
exam, known in elementary schools simply as The Test, which is to
be given for the first time next week. The money went to hire a
tutor for her daughter, Lindsay Rose, who like 300,000 peers will
take a three-day exam that even state officials predict many
students will not pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This test is an unknown quantity, and I wanted her to have a
leg up,'' said Ms. LoPresti, a studio musician whose daughter
attends the Manhattan School for Children, a highly regarded
alternative public school.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other standardized tests, this one, aside from
traditional multiple-choice questions, requires students to take
notes on passages and write critiques and essays based on what they
heard. Spelling, grammar and punctuation all count.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth grade hasn't been the same.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew plans to visit two
schools on Monday to hear concerns about the exam, which will be
given over nearly three hours in the city on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety of some parents and students is largely misplaced: the
schools, teachers and principals have a lot at stake, because they
will be judged by Crew and the State Education Department on the
basis of how students do on the tests. The test results will not
have a direct impact on any student's standing, on promotion into
fifth grade or anything else, other than, in some cases, getting
into a middle school of a student's choice. Crew has proposed using
the test as a key factor in determining whether students move into
the next grade, but that would not take effect until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to anxiety in some school districts was the late delivery
of the exam because severe snowstorms in the Middle West, where the
printing plants are located, hampered delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools have devoted extra class time to preparing for the
test, some held classes over the winter break and after school, and
a few scheduled tutorials for Saturday. At least one test
preparation publishing company, Princeton Review, expects to have a
study guide in stores next fall. Some parents have put their trust
in private tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan Learning Centers, a for-profit agency where a typical
nine-month program costs at least $200 a month, estimated it had
experienced a 25 percent increase in enrollment of fourth-graders
this year, a trend it attributes to both a national advertising
campaign and test anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Testquest, a private company that charges $30 an hour, said
business is up 15 percent at its 17 sites across the city, largely
because of concerns about this test, which New York City may start
using next year to determine whether children should be held back a
grade. Results also may determine whether a school is placed on the
state's list of failing schools. Some selective middle schools may
use the grade as a factor in admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of their children will do well on this test without a
tutor, but parents want double insurance,'' said Annie Han, a tutor
who runs Saturday preparation classes for the test. Her son,
Matthew, is one of her students.
</P>
<P>
   Han, who teaches mathematics part time at Baruch College and
runs three Kumon private tutoring centers in Manhattan, said 35
parents signed up for her four Saturday sessions after she placed
an advertisement in school newsletters and a community newspaper.
The sessions were not part of Kumon, which does not plan to offer
specialized lessons. But like its programs, Han emphasized grammar,
spelling and writing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several tutors contend that students who take their lessons
improve their scores on other standardized tests, such as the
California Achievement Test.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Review said that later this year it would prepare
a study guide for teachers and another to be sold in stores for
about $12.
</P>
<P>
   John Katzman, president and founder of the company, said any
standardized test is ``coachable'' and predicted heavy demand for
materials related to this one, especially if the prognostications
that many students will do poorly ring true. The Princeton Review,
which sells materials for the SAT and other college-oriented exams,
published study guides last year for 10 of the 11 New York State
Regents exams, which are usually taken by the college-bound but
will be required for most prospective high school graduates within
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running joke around here is that we figured out how to do
test prep well, now how do we help mainstream education,'' Katzman
said. ``Well, we don't have to, because mainstream ed has moved
into test prep. These tests really are going to wag the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard P. Mills, the state education Commissioner, said Friday
that he had expected tutors and others to capitalize on concerns
about the exam. ``I'm not surprised and I'm not dismayed,'' said
Mills, setting aside criticism that high-stakes exams like New
York's and the SAT often unfairly favor those who can afford
private preparation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said he was heartened that even low-performing
schools, generally in low-income areas where parents may find it
difficult to afford a private tutor, were providing supplemental
help to students.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Lewis, principal of Public School 129, which in 1996 was
on the Schools Under Registration Review list, the state's roster
of failing schools, wrote her own study guide with the help of
staff, using children's storybooks for sample reading passages but
writing their own questions, based on the sample test provided by
the state. The 110 fourth-graders in the Harlem school practice at
home , as well as in school with practice time every morning at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard about the new test we were very concerned, but
we are also excited because it's a new challenge,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   PS 75 in Brooklyn, began a ``Breakfast Club'' last fall for
fourth-graders that meets every morning before school, from 7:30 to
8:30, so teachers can help students with their reading. About 30 of
the school's 90 fourth-graders showed up steadily, said Felicita
Santiago, the principal, whose school was placed on the Schools
Under Registration Review list in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that we show progress,'' Ms. Santiago said. ``We've
been working hard, so I know my fourth-graders are used to
pressure. I hope we don't slide.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Patricia Stewart, a South Bronx nutritionist, said she is not
relying solely on her school, Harbor Academy, an alternative public
school.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart said she signed April up for Han's tutoring, paying
half price because April already had been attending one of Han's
Kumon centers. Ms. Stewart said she was alarmed last year when
April scored in the 51st percentile on the city reading exam, far
below the 85 needed for entrance to the top competitive middle
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart said April is doing better on her English
assignments and practices at home for the new test. April has
advice for her fellow fourth graders: ``It's not going to be really
hard if you just practice.''

 &HT;    Top executives of Bass' hotel unit moving to London
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dunwoody, Ga.-based Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts said Friday
it was relocating its top brass to London, essentially moving the
headquarters of the largest operating unit of global conglomerate
Bass PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, this will be much more efficient,'' said Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Thomas R. Oliver, one of the senior
executives making the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a matter (of Bass PLC) gaining greater
control,'' Oliver said. ``It has been the objective of the company
for some time to get the headquarters into London. When you're
running a company like this, it's more efficient when you have the
key people running the company in close proximity to one another.
You can engage in conversations without there being formal
presentations, if you will. The major benefit will be the way we
communicate with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization takes effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's headquarters for its Holiday Inn brands in North
America will continue to be based in Dunwoody. The international
Holiday Inns, however, will be operated out of London, as will the
company's Crowne Plaza and Inter-Continental Hotels division.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Oliver, Andrew E. MacFarlane, chief financial
officer, and Robert D. Hill, general counsel, will relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Craig H. Hunt, who was promoted to vice chairman, reporting
directly to Oliver, also will make the move.
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Hunt, formerly president of Holiday Inn North
America, will assume global responsibility for corporate
development, human resources, corporate affairs and performance
planning. Corporate development will include driving development of
related business outside of the current hotel brands, such as
vacation ownership.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 50 staffers are relocating. However, Bass Hotels &AMP;
Resorts' 850 other employees in Atlanta will remain.
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer, the company plans to establish a global strategic
management team that will be based in London.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the changes, John T. Sweetwood, formerly president of
Holiday Inn Express, North America, has been named president,
Holiday Inn Brands, North America. In this position, Sweetwood will
assume responsibility for the three major Holiday Inn brands:
Holiday Inn hotels and resorts, Holiday Inn Express and Staybridge
Suites by Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts owns, operates or franchises more than
2,700 hotels in 95 countries. The overwhelming bulk of those
properties, 2,052, are in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is ``not overly surprising,'' said David
Leibowitz, managing director of Burnham Securities in New York.
``Bass (PLC) clearly wants to consolidate as much as they can under
one roof, and this move would be in keeping with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The relocations and the naming of Oliver to the Bass board of
directors last March seem to underscore the parent company's
commitment to the lodging industry. Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts
constitute 40 percent of Bass PLC's operating earnings. The
remaining holdings are in branded drinks, pubs and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're growing their investment in the hotel industry,'' said
Mark Woodworth, executive vice president of PKF Consulting in
Atlanta. ``If you're going to be successful in today's hotel
market, you have to think globally. Companies are going to have to
take a more global view in the next five to 10 years when there
will be far greater opportunities outside of the U.S. for all
brands, particularly Inter-Continental and Crowne Plaza.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the lodging industry has become
extremely competitive and Bass has become a leader, particularly in
the North American market. With the acquisition of
Inter-Continental Hotels last year, the company has solidified its
global presence in the higher-end tier of hotel properties.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the company has embarked upon an aggressive
program to spruce up the image of Holiday Inn brands and has
required franchisees to make significant improvements in the
physical structure and service of hotel properties.

UNLIKELY COLLABORATION FINALLY GETS TRIAL OVER HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Senator Edward M. Kennedy addressed his 99
colleagues in a private conference Friday, proposing the compromise
that would finally dislodge the impeachment blockade, he aligned
himself with someone he resembles least: Republican Senator Phil
Gramm of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The two had not discussed a plan. Indeed, after decades at
opposite ends of the political spectrum, Kennedy and Gramm never
attempt to collaborate at all. But as Kennedy listened to Gramm's
speech suggesting that Democratic and Republican proposals for the
impeachment trial were similar in many ways, Kennedy decided he
agreed. Minutes later, Kennedy spontaneously echoed his
conservative colleague, forging an alliance almost as rare as
impeachment itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent jumped up and down, and said, `We have a Kennedy-Gramm
agreement here?' '' said Senator James M. Jeffords, a Republican
from Vermont, referring to the majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up laughing,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell, a
Republican from Kentucky. ``We called it the Kennedy-Gramm
proposal. And it stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   The detente gave birth to a bipartisan agreement on how the
impeachment trial will proceed, and it quickly led to a boisterous
spirit in the hallways, as senators on both sides emerged from the
meeting claiming victory.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, the details were hammered out in smaller
sessions in Lott's office, where Kennedy and Gramm joined Senators
Slade Gorton, a Republican of Washington, and Joseph I. Lieberman,
a Democrat of Connecticut, in comparing the proposals from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Lieberman and Gorton _ who last week crafted and
advocated their own bipartisan proposal, only to see it shot down
by conservatives _ Kennedy and Gramm did not portray their
agreement as part of a larger, shared philosophy. Gramm, 56, even
sounded uncomfortable with the moniker, and by the end of the day
appeared to be distancing himself from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are overdoing the Gramm-Kennedy part of it,''
Gramm said. ``I think this was a deal with 100 members
participating.''
</P>
<P>
   The names have never been publicly linked before _ except in
arguments. They hold starkly different views of the world, agreeing
on policy matters as rarely as two senators could. They box over
legislation at least once a year. They are hardly more than civil
colleagues, aides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a lifelong liberal devoted to education and welfare
issues, has repeatedly blocked legislative efforts by Gramm, a
committed economic and social conservative who rarely softens his
remarks when he disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Aides from both staffs said the two senators have fought on
nearly everything: HMO reform, tobacco, affirmative action,
education. As recently as October, Kennedy held up a Gramm
legislative proposal to grant $233 million to the Customs Service
to fight drugs, over concerns that components of the bill were
unfavorable to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not personal friends,'' said Larry Neal, a spokesman
for Gramm. ``They hold quite different views and are serious in
their quite divergent philosophies. They don't believe in the same
things, and they often find themselves in conflict. They view the
world in fundamentally different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kennedy, 66, is a consummate dealmaker who enjoys stopping
crises before they unfold, even when the solution requires
negotiating across the aisle, aides and colleagues said. His most
recent, and high-profile, bipartisan effort came as a result of his
alliance with Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican of Utah, to hammer
out a tobacco deal in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, a Republican who has worked closely with Kennedy since
taking over the Democrat's former role as chairman of the Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said Kennedy is a natural liberal but
``senses the time'' to negotiate instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands when the common interest is to move ahead, to
bring calm in the storm and make decisions on important issues,
like what we're dealing with now,'' Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the rough outlines of the final proposal _
particularly how to resolve the main dispute over calling witnesses
_ had been percolating since the night before. In Friday's meeting,
Gramm articulated the central roadblock, one that Kennedy and other
Democrats knew for days: Regardless of what agreements were reached
ahead of time about calling witnesses, the Republican majority
could still override that arrangement during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kennedy's turn to speak. Seizing on a suggestion by
Gramm, Kennedy proposed the Senate decide everything but the
witness issue _ leaving the most contentious element unsettled, but
agreeing on everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Kennedy stood up and said, `Look, why can't we work this
thing out?' '' said Senator Joseph R. Biden, a Democrat from
Delaware. ``We're in agreement on how to get from home plate to
second base. Let's lock that in. And then let's worry about how to
get from second base to home later.'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kennedy admitted that questions remain. He said there
will be ``a lot of issues, sidebar questions'' he and Gramm will
differ over, particularly those involving the White House. And he
indicated their union was little more than a one-time arrangement _
an unusual solution to an even more unusual crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I differ with Phil, and I argue with him,'' Kennedy said.
``But he had an interest in getting this worked out, and I did
too.''

MY ACCOUNT STATEMENT IS BETTER THAN YOURS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mo.)  (af) 
 By ERIC HUBLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As part of an unceasing quest to find new ways to show that I am
right and my wife is wrong, I recently took haranguing to a new
level. I found fault not with her Spanish _ or with the fact that
she has been working on a sweater for me for six years and has only
one sleeve finished _ but rather with the cluttered presentation of
her mutual fund statements.
</P>
<P>
   To be blunt, I think my fund company's statements are better
than her fund company's statements.
</P>
<P>
   While this feud is unlikely to land us on ``The Jerry Springer
Show,'' it does involve the kind of nagging issue that can do
serious damage to a relationship. How am I supposed to keep track
of how much I love her if I can't tell how much she's worth?
</P>
<P>
   My wife invests with Fidelity Investments, the country's largest
fund company and I have money with the second-largest, the Vanguard
Group. Right off the bat, I should state that both seem to have an
extraordinary commitment to shareholder communication; if you never
read a glossy financial magazine or watched Louis Rukeyser as long
as you lived, but did read the marketing and educational materials
offered by either of these companies, you could still develop an
above-average financial IQ.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it comes to the single most important point of contact
between the fund company and the investor _ the quarterly statement
_ the two companies part company. I could never put my finger on
it, but something about my wife's Fidelity statements makes me not
want to read them, whereas my Vanguard statements are easy to
glance at, digest and file.
</P>
<P>
   Enter an outfit called Siegel &AMP; Gale, a New York consulting firm
that specializes in the specialized field of document
simplification _ and its credentials are impeccable. It helped
develop the 1040 EZ form for the Internal Revenue Service, for
example, as well as plain-English securities prospectuses for the
Securities and Exchange Commission and individual fund companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is taking aim at the ways financial services statements
try so hard to communicate vital information but only increase
misunderstanding and frustration. In fact, Siegel &AMP; Gale is the
firm responsible for Vanguard's statements, and I decided to ask it
what makes some statements easier to read than others
</P>
<P>
   First, a confession. I had always assumed that statements from
credit card issuers, banks, insurers, mutual fund companies and the
like were intentionally written poorly _ the idea being that a
confused customer is a complacent customer. That view is too
uncharitable, said Irene A. Etzkorn, group director of simplified
communications at Siegel &AMP; Gale. (Yes, Ms. Etzkorn is a dapper
dresser and keeps her desktop admirably bereft of clutter. ``I'm an
expert packer,'' she added.)
 &UR;  &LR;  The people who mind money for us are not evil, she said, just a
little confused sometimes. They want to communicate clearly, but
they often need a nudge in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the problem is not bad intentions, but antiquated
systems, Ms. Etzkorn said. There are statements that list
securities in order of their Cusip numbers, a securities industry
standard that is meaningful mostly to mainframes. Others show the
number of shares that the investor owns but not the dollar value.
Such things are nobody's fault in particular, which is part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, language that was perfectly comprehensible to
the generation writing and reading it has been preserved by the
next generation, innocently but ignorantly, turning the monthly
statement into a linguistic time capsule. Sometimes these documents
have a history that predates anyone currently working at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies seem to be some of the biggest culprits.
Acronyms and phrases that should be kept in-house, like USOC (for
universal service order code, a standardized table of designations
for various services, like call waiting) show up on bills, leading
confused customers to call the company for translations _ a waste
of time for both sides.

 &HT;    Holmgren settles in with Seahawks
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even after the longest goodbye in NFL history was over
_ sealed by the longest green ever awarded a coach _ Mike Holmgren
had some trouble Friday believing that a departure that began 50
weeks ago at Super Bowl XXXII finally was consummated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job,'' Holmgren said hours after accepting the position
of football czar for the Seattle Seahawks, ``really is the answer
to a dream that I've had for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough it may turn into a wakeup call for Holmgren. But for
at least a few hours Friday, before he settled into the business of
cobbling together his Seahawks staff, there was satisfaction tinged
with memories of what he had accomplished with the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   In seven seasons, Holmgren, 50, had a record of 84-42, including
postseason. The team went to the last two Super Bowls and captured
the championship in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be proud if we can duplicate that (Packers) organization
here,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't, Holmgren need only look in the nearest mirror to
find the source of failure. To take over the operation of a
franchise that has typically underachieved, Holmgren gets
near-absolute control of the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   His eight-year contract will pay him nearly $40 million, by far
the largest salary ever for an NFL coach. In addition to general
manager-coach responsibilties, he also will hold the title of
executive vice president. Joked Seahawks owner Paul Allen, the
billionaire software magnate who began pursuing Holmgren nearly a
year ago: ``We wanted to make sure he earns his keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's restructured contract with the Packers, which had one
season remaining, paid him approximately $2 million annually.
Seattle must compensate the Packers with their second-round choice
in this year's draft. With the biggest domino now off the coaching
market, other hires may fall into place. Pittsburgh defensive
coordinator Jim Haslett, who interviewed with Seattle earlier in
the week, is the clear front-runner in Philadelphia. The Baltimore
Ravens could turn to Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay GM Ron Wolf could choose from a group that includes
Billick, former Eagles coach Ray Rhodes and defensive coordinators
Bill Belichick (Jets) and Dick Jauron (Jaguars).

 UNDATED: both sides.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unclear statement can go beyond annoyance; it can cost real
money and even disrupt lives. Ms. Etzkorn recalls a case in which a
corporate letter led a couple to believe their children's student
loans were in order; when the children arrived on campus, they were
barred from classes for nonpayment of tuition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But back to me. I placed examples of both the Fidelity and the
Vanguard statements before Ms. Etzkorn, and she explained what was
going on.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, the differences sometimes seem trivial.
</P>
<P>
   My wife's Fidelity statements are printed ``landscape'' style,
with three binder holes at the top of the sheets; Vanguard prints
them ``portrait'' style, with the holes at the left. Hers use
uncoated, ruled paper with a green background, and the lines of
type do not always fall where they are supposed to; mine uses
heavier, white paper with a faint wave background, like that found
on checks, that I find easier on the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, her Fidelity statements cram transaction
details, share price and change in value for all six of her funds
onto a single page, whereas Vanguard statements take things nice
and easy, lavishing an entire page on each of my five funds. That
leaves plenty of space for a tear-off investment slip at the bottom
of each page _ a convenience that benefits both me and my fund
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confused,'' Ms. Etzkorn said while reading my wife's
statements, making my vindictive heart leap. ``This fund is in
which account? One thing I'm confused about, and this surprises me,
is the names of the funds are so small.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Stephen Cone, president of retail and corporate
marketing at Fidelity, disagreed strongly with my assessment,
pointing out that customers invariably want information on as few
pages as possible. ``We send 14 million people a statement a month
and we get very few people saying they don't like our statements,''
he said. Fidelity is nevertheless unveiling what Cone described as
``a major improvement'' to its statements in a few months. But he
said the issue of financial statements is likely to become less
important as more investors monitor accounts on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard must spend a lot of money on printing and mailing its
statements, because of the extra paper involved. Undoubtedly, that
was a tough decision for the company, which is known for its
parsimony. If the design of a seemingly simple piece of paper can
help bring in assets, however, it must be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Nice as my Vanguard's communications are, though, they do not
represent the latest in shareholder statements.
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of this year, Edward D. Jones, a
brokerage firm in St. Louis and a big seller of load mutual funds,
plans to introduce not just one new-and-improved statement, but
three. As a result of feedback from focus groups, each client will
have the choice of three types of statements: the ``at-a-glance,''
the ``preferred'' or the ``in-depth'' statement, in ascending order
of detail.
</P>
<P>
   The at-a-glance statement does little more than list account
activity, assets, balance and previous-month and previous-year
comparisons. The in-depth statement showers investors with
graphics, and includes Standard &AMP; Poor's ratings for bonds and
analyst recommendations for stocks. The ``preferred'' statement
falls somewhere between those two.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on whether Siegel &AMP; Gale is willing to take on my
sock drawer.

SEN. PHIL GRAMM MAY NOW BE MR. NICE GUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Phil Gramm's comeback may now be complete.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican, once labeled ``Senator Spite'' for his
mean-spirited attacks on colleagues, helped craft the bipartisan
compromise that will enable the Senate trial of President Clinton
to go forward next week.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising twist, the ``new'' Gramm was joined by his
ideological opposite, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in finding the
middle ground in a partisan dispute over the appearance of
witnesses that threatened to polarize the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   According to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
breakthrough came when the 100 senators met yesterday morning in
the historic old Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comments by Senator Gramm followed by Senator Kennedy actually
revealed to us the way to proceed,'' said Lott after the session
was over. Later, at a news conference with Gramm and others, Lott
introduced the Texan and said, ``He was the one who touched the
point that turned the whole thing around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gramm-Kennedy compromise would allow the trial to go forward
while setting a format that would make House managers present the
case they developed before the House Judiciary Committee before any
vote would be taken on witnesses. Moreover, a vote to end the trial
would be taken before a witness vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm described the session in an interview as an
``extraordinary event. When it came his turn to speak, the Texan
said he began on a historical note. ``One hundred and fifty years
ago, Daniel Webster had risen to speak in this same chamber and
said, `I rise today not as a New Englander but as an American. Hear
me for my cause,' '' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who holds a doctorate in economics, was self-effacing
about his ability to see a solution in a Senate replete with
lawyers. ``I got to speak last,'' said the Texas Republican,
explaining that had had the advantage of listening to both sides.
``It became obvious to me that the proposal the Democrats were
making did not alter the underlying rules of impeachment. Our
proposal did not alter the underlying rules and so, that in
reality, the two proposals were identical.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy rose and agreed with Gramm, the stage was set for
the two lawmakers to work out the details with Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much is being made of Kennedy and me,'' Gramm said. ``It
was really 100 members of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Gramm and the liberal Kennedy are frequently at
odds over legislation but the compromise shows a possible mellowing
of both men.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's role as power broker is one he has grown into since he
had to abandon his lifelong presidential ambitions after his dismal
showing in the 1996 primary campaign. Gramm, who withdrew from the
race just before the New Hampshire primary, was re-elected to the
Senate the same year and has refocused his energies on being a
legislator.
</P>
<P>
   But this being Gramm, known for grand gestures, or
``Gramm-standing,'' he has not been shy or retiring about it.
Instead, he has made his mark on contentious issues such as
Medicare by reaching across to Democrats. In the last two years he
has made unlikely alliances with Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., on cuts
in entitlements and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., on preserving
highway spending.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm credited Byrd yesterday for ``setting the tenor for what
we have achieved'' in his opening remarks during the private Senate
session. Byrd, who has an almost regal air, is the acknowledged
historian of the chamber but not a universally liked figure.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not someone who was exactly simpatico with the Gramm
of old.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, 56, has been one of the most partisan Republicans in the
House or Senate despite having been originally elected as a
Democrat to the House in 1978. A fiscal conservative, Gramm ran
afoul of then-House Majority Leader Jim Wright, D-Fort Worth, who
was enraged that his fellow Democrat was conspiring with the Reagan
White House on a budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Wright threw Gramm off of the House Budget Committee and Gramm
promptly switched parties, resigned his seat and ran for the post
as a Republican. He won easily in the 1983 special election and was
re-appointed to the panel.

49ERS VS. FALCONS CAPSULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL KRUGEL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (13-4) at ATLANTA (14-2) Time 11:35 a.m. today
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: KDFW/Channel 4; KTCK/1310 AM
</P>
<P>
   Line: Falcons by 3.
</P>
<P>
   Series record: 49ers lead 40-23-1.
</P>
<P>
   Last time: Falcons topped 49ers, 31-19, on Nov. 15 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Postseason records: 49ers 24-14, Falcons 2-5.
 &LR; subheds:THE STORYLINES San Francisco Talk about a Catch-22. The
49ers are coming off a dramatic last-second victory against Green
Bay on Sunday, but have had five days to prepare and travel to
Atlanta, where the Falcons are 10-0 in the Georgia Dome this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the running-game issue. Running the ball is the
way to beat the Falcons, but Garrison Hearst, who had 128 yards on
Sunday, is questionable because of a pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have far more playoff experience and they have the
second-best playoff record of all time with 24 victories. They are
playing better than the team that lost in Atlanta on Nov. 15.
Atlanta The common thought is the Falcons have the edge because of
their Nov. 14 victory against the Niners. But in the two games
combined, Atlanta outscored San Francisco 51-50, only because the
49ers went for a two-point conversion and failed in their 31-19
loss in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons haven't lost a game since October _ when they played
at the Jets without Chris Chandler. They've won nine consecutive,
are undefeated at home and are coming off a bye week.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler should be able to put up some serious passing yards
against the 49ers corners. The Falcons' ability to control the
clock _ and their considerable advantage on special teams _ could
be the difference.
 &LR; subheds:ONE TO STOP San Francisco Wide receiver J.J. Stokes The
Falcons cornerbacks are strong, but they will be preoccupied with
all-time playoff receiving leader Jerry Rice and last week's hero,
Terrell Owens. Stokes had 15 catches for 188 yards in the playoffs
last season, and could do more of the same against single coverage.
Atlanta Running back Jamal Anderson Not exactly a secret, but
Anderson accentuates the Falcons' speed advantage. If he gets 130
yards on 25 carries, Atlanta is off to the NFC Championship Game.
 &LR; subheds:THE QUARTERBACKS San Francisco: Steve Young Playoff
record: 7-5 as a starter
</P>
<P>
   Young had one of his best regular seasons ever, throwing for
4,170 yards and a career-high 36 touchdowns. Atlanta Chris Chandler
</P>
<P>
   Playoff record: First career playoff game in 11 seasons
</P>
<P>
   Chandler had his best season ever with career highs of 3,154
yards passing and 25 touchdowns. His 9.65 yards per attempt led the
league.
 &LR; subheds:INJURY REPORT San Francisco Questionable: RB Garrison
Hearst (Hamstring); TE Irv Smith (calf) Probable: G Tim Hanshaw
(neck); WR Mark Harris (shoulder); CB R.W. McQuarters (knee); WR
Jerry Rice (knee); LB Winfred Tubbs (pectoral); LB James Williams

   MIAMI (11-6) AT DENVER (14-2) When: 3:15 p.m. today, Mile High
Stadium, Denver
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Series record _ Dolphins lead 6-2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Last time: Dolphins beat Broncos, 31-21, on Dec. 21 at Miami.
THE STORYLINES Miami Dan Marino ``had the best game he's had since
I've been here,'' said third-year Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson of
his QB, who threw for 355 yards and four TD passes in the Dec. 21
victory against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has lost all six of its road playoff games since it won
the 1972 AFC Championship Game at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between this game and the Dolphins victory three
games ago are location (Mile High Stadium instead of Pro Player
Stadium) and health (now the Dolphins are beat up, with Jason
Taylor and Tim Bowens out and O.J. McDuffie and Troy Drayton
hurting). Denver Denver has won 17 consecutive at Mile High Stadium
and has scored more than 30 points a game in 13 of their past 16
home games.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos were frustrated by the way Miami's defense
completely shut down their offense Dec. 21. Or were they? Coaches
who have played the Broncos in the past month maintain that Denver
has stripped its offense down to the basics. Why would the Broncos
do that? Coach Mike Shanahan hasn't wanted to reveal anything
before the playoffs, and when Denver locked up home-field advantage
throughout the postseason, he figured why risk giving away strategy
unnecessarily. Ones to stop Miami: Wide receiver O.J. McDuffie
McDuffie had a team-record and NFL-leading 90 receptions this
season. He is Marino's crutch, and if McDuffie plays, Denver must
especially control him on third down. Denver: Running back Terrell
Davis You know the numbers: 2,008 yards, 23 touchdowns. But look
what happened when Miami held Davis to 29 yards on Dec. 21. The
quarterbacks Miami: Dan Marino Playoff record: 6-7
</P>
<P>
   Marino needs 24 yards to reach 4,000 for his playoff career and
one TD pass for 31 to move past Terry Bradshaw for second place on
the career postseason list. Denver: John Elway Playoff record: 11-7
</P>

AT&AMP;T ALTERS PART OF PLAN FOR TCI ACQUISITION
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T on Friday changed a major part of its $31.8 billion plan
for acquiring Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable television
company, saying it would not issue a new stock to track the
combined company's consumer operations.
</P>
<P>
   The change reflected a shift in how the market perceives AT&AMP;T's
prospects. Last summer, when the two companies announced their
deal, AT&AMP;T executives, concerned that some investors might not
understand how different parts of the new company would work
together, wanted to offer separate shares in those parts.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as its stock soars, AT&AMP;T is touting the synergies among
the two companies' operations and believes it has the momentum to
combine them under a single equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``By merging with TCI, we plan to create an advanced broadband
network that can deliver an array of communications, entertainment
and information services directly to millions of U.S. households,''
said AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong in a letter to
shareholders. ``We consider this a critical step toward our goal of
becoming the `total communications source' for our customers _
supplying complete packages of local telephone, long-distance,
wireless, Internet, entertainment and next-generation digital
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Having bought back $3 billion of its stock last year, AT&AMP;T said
Friday that it would repurchase an additional $4 billion worth of
shares by the time the TCI acquisition was finished. After the
acquisition is done, the company said Friday, it will split its
stock 3 for 2, AT&AMP;T's first stock split since a 2-for-1
distribution in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Exuding yet more optimism, the company also said it would earn
more money in its core business than had been previously expected:
between $4.20 and $4.30 a share in its continuing operations
(excluding the impact of the TCI deal), up to 5.1 percent more than
the $4.09 a share estimate of analysts polled by First Call, a
financial research firm.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T, the nation's No. 1 communications company, said
acquiring TCI would reduce its per-share earnings by about $1,
assuming the deal closes at the end of March. The analysts had
predicted post-TCI earnings of $3.41 a share, for a consensus
dilution estimate of 68 cents a share. AT&AMP;T would not say when the
deal would add to its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The increased dilution seemed to be a result of AT&AMP;T's plans to
accelerate spending to upgrade TCI's cable television systems. The
company said it planned to use TCI's network to offer telephone,
video and data services in 10 markets around the country this year
and telephone service in most TCI markets in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Intensifying its focus on the cable business, AT&AMP;T also said it
had reached deals to offer telephone service over the wires of five
small cable companies: Bresnan Communications, Falcon Cable TV,
Insight Communications, Intermedia Partners and Peak Cablevision.
Combined, the five companies have about 3.2 million customers.
Executives close to the negotiations have said that a deal between
AT&AMP;T and Time Warner Inc., the No. 1 cable carrier, might be
reached within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The raft of announcements boosted AT&AMP;T's stock Friday, sending
the shares, the most widely held in the country, up $2.8125, to
$85.0625, on the New York Stock Exchange. (On the day the deal was
announced last June, AT&AMP;T's shares closed at $60.) TCI's shares
gained $1.1875, closing at $62.25 in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T and TCI announced the acquisition in June, AT&AMP;T said
that as part of the deal it would issue a new stock to track the
combined company's consumer services, including cable television
and long-distance. Executives close to the deal, however, said
Friday that late last year some people at AT&AMP;T began to believe
that having the tracking stock (instead of AT&AMP;T common stock)
represent the consumer long-distance business would only confuse
investors because long-distance has been such a core part of AT&AMP;T's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The executives close to the deal said AT&AMP;T considered having the
tracking stock represent only AT&AMP;T's wireless operation and the
cable television business. They added that AT&AMP;T decided to scrap
the tracking stock altogether as recently as last weekend. (Liberty
Media Group, the television programming unit that will be run by
John Malone, now TCI's chairman, will still be issued its own
tracking stock.)
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental goal behind keeping all of the new AT&AMP;T
operations under one stock was avoiding the creation of rifts among
the company's different units, in the interest of delivering
integrated bundles of services to consumers. That choice was made
possible partly by the strong recent performance of AT&AMP;T's stock,
which convinced some executives that investors could properly value
a company with as broad a range of operations as AT&AMP;T's.
</P>
<P>
   A tracking stock tied to less-profitable operations, however,
would have given AT&AMP;T a currency that could help the company pursue
future acquisitions. Analysts at Friday's meeting said that Malone
hinted that AT&AMP;T could consider issuing a tracking stock in the
future.

THE INVESTIGATORS' SUMMARY: `A COLLECTIVE FAILURE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (With EMBASSY-CROWE. See also EMBASSY-BOMBS) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the text of a letter to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, from retired Adm. William Crowe, who
headed two panels investigating embassy security, summarizing their
findings:
</P>
<P>
   Pursuant to your mandate establishing Accountability Review
Boards to examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the Aug.
7, 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, the two boards herewith submit their combined
report. The two terrorist bombings resulted in the deaths of over
220 persons and injuries to more than 4,000 people. Twelve American
U.S.G. employees and family members and 40 Kenyan and Tanzanian
U.S.G. employees were among those killed. Both chanceries and
several other buildings were severely damaged or destroyed. The
F.B.I. investigation of criminal suspects in the attacks is
ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Having completed an extensive review in Washington, Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam, the boards were most disturbed at two interconnected
issues: first, the inadequacy of resources to provide security
against terrorist attacks and, second, the relative low priority
accorded security concerns throughout the U.S. Government by the
department, other agencies in general, and on the part of many
employees both in Washington and in the field. Saving lives and
adequately addressing our security vulnerabilities on a sustained
basis must be given a higher priority by all those involved if we
are to prevent such tragedies in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The boards did not find reasonable cause to believe that any
employee of the United States Government or member of the uniformed
services breached his or her duty in connection with the Aug. 7
bombings. However, we believe there was a collective failure by
several Administrations and Congresses over the past decade to
invest adequate efforts and resources to reduce the vulnerability
of U.S. diplomatic missions around the world to terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   We wish to commend the particular diligence and professionalism
of the U.S. Ambassador in Nairobi, Prudence Bushnell, in seeking
security enhancements for the embassy long before the bombing,
including efforts to relocate the post away from its vulnerable
location. We also applaud the leadership of Dar es Salaam's charge
d'affaires John Lange and the remarkable personal courage of the
embassy staffs in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam for their response to
the attacks, including countless hours spent in locating and
rescuing victims, providing for emergency assistance, and managing
to restore embassy operations under conditions of extreme crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The boards found that intelligence provided no immediate
tactical warning of the Aug. 7 attacks. We understand the
difficulty of monitoring terrorist networks and concluded that
vulnerable missions cannot rely upon such warning. We found,
however, that both policy and intelligence officials have relied
heavily on warning intelligence to measure threats, whereas
experience has shown that transnational terrorists often strike
without warning at vulnerable targets in areas where expectations
of terrorist acts against the U.S. are low.
</P>
<P>
   The security systems and procedures at both posts at the time of
the bombings were in general accord with department policy.
However, those systems and procedures followed by all the embassies
under the department's direction did not speak to large vehicular
bomb attacks or transnational terrorism nor the dire consequences
that would result from them. Both embassies were located
immediately adjacent or close to public streets and were especially
vulnerable to large vehicular bombs. The boards found that too many
of our overseas missions are similarly situated. Unless these
vulnerabilities are addressed on a sustained and realistic basis,
the lives and safety of U.S.G. employees and the public in many of
our facilities abroad will continue to be at risk from further
terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In our investigations of the bombings, the boards were struck by
how similar the lessons were to those drawn by the Inman Commission
over 14 years ago. What is most troubling is the failure of the
U.S. Government to take the necessary steps to prevent such
tragedies through an unwillingness to give sustained priority and
funding to security improvements.
</P>
<P>
   We are advancing a number of recommendations that deal with the
handling of terrorist threats and attacks, the review and revision
of standards and procedures to improve security readiness and
crisis management, the size and composition of our missions, and
the need to have adequate and sustained funding for safe buildings
and security programs in the future. We recognize that the
Department of State and other U.S. Government agencies are already
making adjustments and taking measures to enhance the protection of
our personnel and facilities abroad. It is clear, however, that
much more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   We viewed as our primary and overriding responsibility the
submission of recommendations that will save lives of personnel
serving at U.S. missions abroad in the future. We ask that you
review the recommendations with that objective in mind.

MARINE CORPS SUBPOENAS TAPES FROM `SIXTY MINUTES'  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS Friday filed a motion to quash a subpoena by a Marine Corps
prosecutor seeking tapes the program ``60 Minutes'' made of an
interview with the pilot of the jet that sliced through cables
supporting a ski gondola, killing 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena, issued in late December, said the tape, which has
not yet been broadcast, might contain statements that could help in
the prosecution of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The newsman Mike Wallace said Friday that he had interviewed the
pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, several times in preparation for a
report about the Marine Corps' handling of the case. The interview
was to be broadcast on Jan. 24 or Jan. 31, he said; the court
martial of Ashby and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, the navigator on the
Feb. 3 flight in the Italian Alps, is scheduled to start the first
week of February.
</P>
<P>
   In filing its motion with the officer presiding over the court
martial, CBS said the subpoena violated the news program's
privileges under the First Amendment and that, under the code of
military justice, it constituted an ``unreasonable and oppressive''
action.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the lawyer representing ``60 Minutes,'' said
Friday, ``This is a really extraordinary situation,'' involving not
only a request for material that has not been broadcast _
``outtakes,'' in the jargon of television news _ but in which ``the
party seeking the outtakes is the very party about whom the
broadcast may revolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said, ``I still cannot understand how they could ask us,
in effect, to help them make their case against Rich Ashby.'' He
added that his interview with a senior Marine officer has not yet
taken place, and speculated that the Marine Corps wanted to review
the other interviews before its officer spoke to the program.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Col. Katie Haddock said that the request from Lt. Col.
Carol Joyce _ the trial counsel, or prosecutor _ was made
independently of the Corps' command structure. If the material
being subpoenaed is evidence, she said, ``it is not available'' to
any officers outside the prosecution and defense teams.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said it is extremely rare for any prosecutor to subpoena
the raw information that goes into a news report before the report
is made public.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out, in an interview and in the motion to quash
the subpoena, that Justice Department guidelines require that,
before Federal prosecutors can subpoena journalists, they must have
``reasonable grounds to believe, based on information obtained by
non-media sources, that the information sought is essential of a
successful investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors are also seeking a ``60 Minutes'' interview with
Capt. Chandler Seagraves, who was in the back seat of the jet, an
EA-6B Prowler, at the time of the accident. He was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and Schweitzer each have been charged with 20 counts of
involuntary manslaughter and 20 counts of homicide. Any one count
of involuntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 10 years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the involuntary manslaughter and homicide
charges, the pilot and the navigator face charges of obstruction of
justice and conduct unbecoming an officer in connection with the
alleged disappearance of a videotape made during the fatal flight.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer declined to be interviewed by ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one officer, who supervised the public hearing that led
to the charges, indicated that the prosecution's case may be weak,
in part because the Marine Corps, the Air Force and a Pentagon
map-making agency had made systematic errors that contributed to
the accident. There is evidence that the jet's crew was given
inaccurate information when they planned the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the jet squadron involved in the accident, Lt.
Col. Richard Muegge, was relieved of command in August. Maj. Max
Caramanian, who was the director of standardization and safety for
the squadron, received a letter of reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were dismissed against two other officers.
</P>
<P>
   The accident provoked strong protest in Italy and strained
relations between it and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an electronic warfare jet, was on a low-altitude
training mission out of an air base in Aviano, Italy, when it hit
the cables about 370 feet from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident, local rules set a minimum height
above ground level of 2,000 feet, but everyone in the Marine
squadron said that they believed it was 1,000 feet, and some
material on file in the flight operations center gave an even lower
number for some areas.

BRONCOS THINK JOHNSON IS UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Forget Marino against Elway. Never mind Shannon
Sharpe's braggadocio. Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson has elbowed his
way onto center stage for Miami's American Football Conference
divisional game Saturday against the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson became an object of ridicule nationwide last week when
he peppered the Dolphins' locker room with Flutie Flakes after his
team's 7-point victory over Buffalo, not mindful that proceeds from
the sale of the cereal named for Bills quarterback Doug Flutie help
autistic children. Flutie and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino have
autistic children.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson later wrote a letter of apology to Flutie, but his
celebration stomp still prompted one contributor to The Denver Post
online message board to wonder this week what Johnson will do if
Miami happens to upset Denver at Mile High Stadium: ``Would Jimmy
bring in a bunch of the Sesame Street characters that Terrell Davis
sang with and beat the stuffing out of them with a tire iron?''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have also questioned Johnson's veracity in
describing his team's latest injuries, a sprained right ankle for
tight end Troy Drayton and a sprained right foot for wide receiver
O.J. McDuffie. They noticed on film, as Marino threw the
game-winning touchdown against Buffalo with 3 minutes 42 seconds
left, both Drayton and McDuffie running full-speed pass patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos (14-2) are left to believe Johnson is playing mind
games with them, making them think they will not have to beat
Miami's best. ``Well, it's not going to be that way at all,''
Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski said. ``We're going to get their
best 11 and we're going to play our tails off. His mind games
aren't working with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's team is apparently going to get one break. Even though
it snowed lightly Friday, temperatures for the game are expected to
be in the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a young team, which we have, that type of thing
can be a problem if you let it,'' Dolphins defensive end Trace
Armstrong said of the potentially icy weather. ``A lot of guys,
it'll be the first time they see that stadium or been in this type
of game. So all those things _ temperatures, stadiums, crowds _ can
be a factor if you let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides cereal-stomping and weather forecasting, there are other
subplots to this game, which determines one berth in next week's
AFC title game against the winner of Sunday's Jets-Jacksonville
Jaguars game.
</P>
<P>
   There are the veteran quarterbacks, the 37-year-old Dan Marino
against the 38-year-old John Elway. The two had faced each other
only once in their storied careers _ back in 1985 _ but will now
duel twice in a one-month span. The Dolphins (11-6) handed the
Broncos their second loss of the season in a 31-21 victory in Miami
on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Elway picked up his first Super Bowl championship ring last
season; Marino is still looking for his first. Elway is leaning
toward retirement after this season; Marino expects to play at
least several more years.
</P>
<P>
   In the event this winds up being Elway's final game, a columnist
in the Denver area has suggested that Bronco fans show their
appreciation. As the fourth quarter begins and the sun is setting
over the Rockies, fans are being asked to give some light _ a
candle, a match, a lighter, a flashlight _ in Elway's honor.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is for at least 50,000 to make such a gesture,
symbolizing a light for every yard thrown by Elway in his 17-year
Bronco career.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Marino seems to be the sentimental choice outside
of Denver in this matchup because he has only been to one National
Football League title game _ Super Bowl XIX in 1985 _ and he does
not have a championship ring. But Elway said he would not feel even
a twinge of sorrow for his longtime pal if Denver beats Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to who moves on and who doesn't,'' Elway
said, ``you have to get a little selfish.''

RELIGIOUS BOOKS HAVE TWO VIEWS OF CLINTON'S MISDEEDS

(lb) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first half of 1998, religious leaders and theologians
had a low profile in the national debate over President Clinton's
sexual and legal misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   But starting on Sept. 11, when Clinton chose a breakfast meeting
with religious leaders as the occasion for his fullest admission of
wrongdoing and expression of remorse, the situation began to
change.
</P>
<P>
   And as the president's trial begins in the Senate, two brief
books have appeared in which widely respected religious thinkers
offer larger frameworks for evaluating the issues. The books are
strikingly different in style and conclusion, but in some ways
complementary.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Philip Wogaman, pastor of Foundry United Methodist
Church in Washington where Clinton, a Southern Baptist, usually
worships with the first lady, a Methodist, has defended Clinton in
more than one television interview. Now he has written ``From the
Eye of the Storm'' (Westminster John Knox Press, $12), subtitled
``A Pastor to the President Speaks Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman is not only a pastor. For 26 years he was also a
professor of Christian ethics whose books on the topic are used as
standard texts in Protestant seminaries throughout the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate question of whether the president should be
removed from office,'' Wogaman writes, forces the nation to address
other questions: the nature of the presidency, the relationship of
an officeholder's private behavior to public responsibility and
leadership, the demands of repentance, healing and punishment, the
way in which the mass media define reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate pushes us toward consideration of profound issues
of law and morality,'' he adds, ``that will be around long after
the present crisis has been fully resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman does not condone Clinton's sexual sins or dishonesty,
and insists that the United States must be a nation of law and
``social discipline.'' But law and discipline, he argues, must be
in the service of love and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman builds his case around a contrast between two events
last Sept. 11: the White House prayer breakfast in the morning and
Congress' release of the Starr report that afternoon. One
emphasized ``the moral acts of repentance and forgiveness,'' he
writes; the other focused ``on judgment and condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayer breakfast is, in fact, the starting point for the
other book, ``Judgment Day at the White House'' (William B.
Eerdmans, $12), which contains essays by some of the nation's
leading religious scholars and ethicists. A large number of them
obviously prefer the bluntness of the Starr report to the sentiment
of the prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced by the breakfast that Clinton and his defenders were
manipulating the language of repentance and forgiveness for
political purposes, several theologians composed a Declaration
Concerning Religion, Ethics and the Crisis in the Clinton
presidency, which continues to circulate and gain signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The book reprints this declaration and develops its concerns in
essays insisting that personal and public morality cannot be
separated and that the president's talk of repentance and
forgiveness does not relieve him of political accountability or the
acceptance of consequences for his sins.
</P>
<P>
   The contributors, it should be underlined, do not come from the
religious right but largely from mainline Protestantism, and many
make clear their sympathy with Clinton's moderate liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of style, Wogaman certainly wins the face-off. His book
is conversational, he admits to uncertainties and suggests that
many judgments rest on matters of degree and proportion, although
sometimes his sentences beginning ``I wonder whether ...'' are just
ways of sidling up to conclusions that he doesn't wonder about at
all.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, many essays in ``Judgment Day at the White House''
are academic and more than slightly high and mighty. The arguments
are substantial but they are weakened by their tight focus on
Clinton to the exclusion of all the surrounding context _ from
Linda Tripp's taping and the work of the independent counsel to the
politics of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one sign of the book's value is its inclusion of critical
estimates on the declaration. In one of the dissenting essays, for
example, Nicholas Wolterstorff, the Noah Porter professor of
philosophical theology at Yale University, expressed amazement at
the declaration's worry ``that the president might escape without
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been placed in our model global equivalent of the
stocks of an old New England town,'' Wolterstorff writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has been humiliated,'' the professor adds,
``to a degree beyond the humiliation ever wreaked on any other
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Wolterstorff says he finds himself deeply troubled by
this deliberate shaming _ and by the declaration's silence about
the moral questions it raises.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, which of these books one finds more convincing on
the subject of repentance and consequences may depend on whether
one is convinced that Clinton is, as one of the declaration's
signers suggests, a political manipulator ``all the way down.'' The
president's pastor does not think so. His religious critics, along
with many of the inside-the-Beltway correspondents and
commentators, do.
</P>
<P>
   But also in the end, one wonders why it took two relatively
small religious publishing houses, rather than the trade publishers
who dispense millions for inside gossip, to produce these two
thoughtful, useful books.

BUYING IN TO `COMMUNICOPIA,' A RICH   NEW DATA LANDSCAPE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week it is a white-hot debut for a new business on the
Internet. The next it's a telephone company breaking a taboo by
buying a cable network. Last week, a spirited bidding war broke out
over a major wireless phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Like pixels lighting up one by one on a flat-screen display,
these seemingly disjointed events add new clarity and detail to a
developing picture of what analysts at Goldman, Sachs seven years
ago called ``communicopia'': an intertwined landscape of data and
voice communications, entertainment programming and electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its complexity, this world is rapidly converging.
More and more of the companies in these industries are doing more
and more of the same sorts of things.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call, Richard P. Simon, a managing director and
media analyst at Goldman, Sachs, and Oscar A. Castro, co-manager of
the Montgomery Global Communications fund, sorted out the
investment implications of the latest developments. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Have these diverse electronic businesses evolved the
way you thought they might in 1992?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMON ``Communicopia'' sprang from a conversation I had with
people at Time Warner, when we started talking about things like
band width, twisted pair compression technology and other things
outside my traditional industry framework. I walked away from that
meeting thinking how lost I was, that there was a broad cross
section of knowledge I didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   So a group of us at Goldman set out to write about this thing
without knowing what it was. But as we explored, we realized there
was a significant convergence taking place, and ended up concluding
that cable, not the telephone, is the advantage technology to
deliver information, because of its broad-band capability. The cost
of doing the same thing for telephone companies would be
exceedingly high.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-1990s, it looked like our conclusion might be
wrong. But things like AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI and Microsoft's
investment in Comcast illustrate cable's dominance. Of course, back
in the early 1990s, we didn't consider the Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO I have no problem with that conceptual construct. Cable
owns the last mile to the consumer. But I am not so enthusiastic
about cable companies as investments, because they don't express
their goals clearly, and until recently did not seem to be
interested in maximizing shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that convergence is happening. The model
is more advanced in Britain and Australia and has been developing
in the same vein in Germany and France. In the United States, we
have not been so quick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMON Only one of the companies I cover, Time Warner, is a cable
company. But over the last two to three years, they have directly
focused on building shareholder value. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What difference has the Internet's rise made in the
developing picture?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMON The Internet has broadened and enhanced things. It is
taking another product and offering it over the phone lines, but
the advantages of offering it over cable are numerous. For one
thing, it is easier and faster to use.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Internet has brought in a lot of players, from
advertisers to content providers to portal creators, that were not
around before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Without specialized knowledge, how can investors
spot companies that can best take advantage of convergence?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO Investors need to be looking at those companies that have
the right management, ones who have proven they can execute and are
flexible enough to take advantage of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom is an example. These guys were basically second-tier
long-distance providers who moved on to be competitive access
providers and went international. After that they became one of the
largest Internet providers. And now they have MCI, a long-distance
provider with a very strong Internet position. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMON Oscar noted earlier he does not like the News Corp.
because they do not appear interested in maximizing shareholder
value. But Rupert Murdoch has a very clear vision of how to build
global distribution and provide content for those distribution
platforms. He has that with the Fox network here, B Sky B in
Britain and Star TV in the Pacific. He owns a lot of content,
whether it is children's cartoons or the Los Angeles Dodgers, which
makes him less vulnerable than others. He makes big, long-term
bets.
</P>
<P>
   At one of our Communicopia conferences a few years ago, John
Malone from TCI was asked which competitor he most feared and
admired. He said, ``Rupert Murdoch.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Last week MCI Worldcom's name came up in connection
with the battle over Airtouch. Should they be interested?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO Well, voice communications is definitely moving to a
wireless world. But Bernie Ebbers has shown no interest yet in a
wireless strategy, and MCI failed to have a clear cellular
strategy, so it is outside their core competence.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when they identify a business they want to
get in to, they buy a company and its management. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)If MCI Worldcom isn't interested, which company,
Vodaphone or Bell Atlantic, does Airtouch fit best with?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO The best fit is with Vodaphone. If they got Airtouch,
they would control a big part of the wireless market.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic bought Nynex and is buying GTE; if it succeeded in
acquiring Airtouch, that could create some digestion problems.
Also, Bell Atlantic does not have one of our favorite management
teams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)AT&AMP;T made headlines last week with announcements of
a split, a big buyback plan and some new thinking about how to
digest its own recent acquisitions. Is its chief executive, C.
Michael Armstrong, on the right track?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO Armstrong has definitely established a clear leadership
role at the company, and the pickups of Teleport and TCI have been
very smart acquisitions. Their agreement to merge international
operations with British Telecom surprised a lot of people, but they
could be a formidable competitor internationally. The challenge he
has now is to deliver on the expectations that have been built up
on the Street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Which stocks in the world of communicopia do you
like?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMON Time Warner and Viacom are two of the stocks I like.
However, they have performed very well and are selling at record
multiples. So to some degree degree they are dependent on positive
developments to push their prices higher. We also like Newscorp,
which traditionally has been undervalued versus other media
companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO We like Global Telesystems, a European company based in
Virginia, and Colt Telecom, a British company. We also like
Telephonica and Teleitaliana, because they have articulated a clear
international strategy. Airtouch is a company we love, but the
stock is too rich. Orange, another British company, we also like.
And China Telecom.

 &HT;    Experience is on side of ... well, you know
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the San Francisco 49ers, the voice of experience
is Steve Young or Jerry Rice, who have won three Super Bowl rings
each while appearing in a combined 43 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   To the Falcons, whose players have participated in a total of 76
postseason games and only nine with Atlanta, it is cornerback Ray
Buchanan saying, ``We're not thinking about our past. It's all
about the present once you get out there on the football field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are aware that San Francisco's playoff span is about
as long as the Golden Gate Bridge, and they don't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that we want it more,'' cornerback Michael
Booker said. ``They've been there; it's old hat to them. We want to
make a statement to the world and the NFL that we are a contending
team and that we are the team of the new millennium. This is our
start right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Cornelius Bennett wants to make sure it's not their
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to communicate to these guys is that what we
did two weeks ago against Miami is not good enough now,'' said
Bennett, who played in 17 playoff games with Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we say, `They've got Super Bowl rings,' we're going to be
defeated before we take the field. What I have to tell our players
is that (the 49ers), by their experience, know they have to pick up
their level of play during the playoffs, and we're going to have to
match it or be better than they are (today) on.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 53 Falcons, 20 have playoff experience, but only 12
have appeared in more than one game. Among the 49ers, the
winningest team of the 1980s and '90s, 45 have been in the
playoffs, 34 in more than one game.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Eugene Robinson (Green Bay) and wide receiver Tony
Martin (Miami and San Diego) each have appeared in eight playoff
games. Cornerback Randy Fuller played seven games with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, (playoff experience) makes a difference,'' Fuller
said. ``An organization that's used to winning, they go into all
games expecting to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet at 14-2, these Falcons have become used to winning, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller offered this advice to his teammates: ``Make sure you
study, and you're focused and ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has tantalized them with tales of participating in a
Super Bowl. He played in Super Bowl XXX with the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the Super Bowl, it's like you're a superstar,
regardless of how much you played or what position you are,'' he
said. ``I just want everybody to feel that excitement that I felt
once.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler, who has never played in the
postseason, said he ``would hope'' playoff experience isn't a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a football game, and definitely the intensity level is
going to pick up,'' Chandler said. ``But there's no real secret in
a playoff game. It's just (that) you've gotta play really, really
good football.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson said he thinks the 49ers' additional
playoff experience will be a factor only ``if you allow it to be. I
know nobody on this team is going `Wow, gosh, they've been to a lot
of Super Bowls. Woooo.' Who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're trying to gain playoff experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves, who will be participating in his 46th playoff
game, said the Falcons also can learn from players whose seasons
have ended in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessie Tuggle has been involved in some playoffs but has gone
through the hard times,'' Reeves said, ``and Terance Mathis _ it
has been invaluable to have those kind of guys, because you
understand the other side of it and how special this is.

 &HT;    Loss made Birds of feather ...
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the Atlanta Falcons slogged to the locker room at
halftime on Sept. 27 in San Francisco, no one could have predicted
the good that lay ahead. Glassy-eyed, battered and bewildered, they
were too busy trying to figure out what had just hit them.
</P>
<P>
   Any notion of winning the NFC West, any notion of facing the
49ers in a huge January playoff game in the Georgia Dome, had been
trampled into the soggy turf at 3Com Stadium, where the 49ers raced
to a 31-7 halftime lead in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My psychiatrist told me I should forget that game,'' running
back Jamal Anderson said. ``Steve Young and Jerry Rice looked like
a video game on us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons managed to extract something of value from the
muck, pulling to within 31-20 by game's end. In a way, the team's
mindset started to mature under a deluge of big plays by the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a critical point in a remarkable season in which the
Falcons went 14-2, the offense and defense set a number of records,
Anderson made All-Pro, five Falcons made it to the Pro Bowl and Dan
Reeves was chosen Associated Press Coach of the Year three weeks
after open-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   When the 49erse (13-4) visit Atlanta today in the Falcons' first
home playoff game in 18 years, the Falcons will lean on confidence
that has grown steadily since the middle of last season. The
Falcons are 20-4 in that span, the NFL's best mark.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the second half of that game in San Francisco
propelled them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never quit,'' Reeves said. ``I didn't think the 49ers'
intensity in the second half was what it was in the first half, but
the way we played in the second half showed a lot to our football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons went 12-1 after that game, losing 28-3 to the Jets
in New York, when quarterback Chris Chandler, defensive tackle
Travis Hall and linebacker Henri Crockett were sidelined with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have won nine consecutive games, tying a franchise
record, and 10 in a row at home, a team best.
</P>
<P>
   But the first 49ers game was the watershed moment, when this
team's greatest intangible revealed itself. The difference in these
Falcons, the players and coaches say, is a special chemistry formed
in the locker room, uncommon in the age of youth and free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are a lot of inflated egos on this team,''
Chandler said. The quarterback signed a four-year, $25 million
contract extension two days before the season opener, then passed
for career highs of 3,154 yards, 25 touchdowns and compiled a 100.9
passer rating that ranked fourth in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys try to make each other feel special,'' he said. ``It
might come in forms of joking at each other's expense, but ... we
act more like brothers rather than teammates. That kind of evolved
out of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's becoming more and more rare in professional
sports, especially with guys moving around so much (because of free
agency). Then, when you throw in some guys who think they should
make more money, or their egos are getting bruised _ (but) we
haven't had a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves concedes that some luck was involved in finding 56
players who meshed as these Falcons have.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great surprises has been the chemistry of this
team,'' he said earlier this season. ``Certainly, you strive for a
balance of personalities, but there was no way of knowing these
guys would come together quite like they have or that their
relationships with the coaches would be this solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine of 53 active players have joined the team since
Reeves was hired two years ago this month. But just four starters
changed from last season _ free-agent free safety Eugene Robinson;
former reserve defensive tackle Shane Dronett; rookie right
offensive tackle Ephraim Salaam, a seventh-round draft choice; and
wide receiver Tony Martin, acquired in a June trade with San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Another newcomer helped the Falcons get back on track after the
loss at San Francisco. The next week, rookie Tim Dwight, a
fourth-round draft choice, returned the opening kickoff 93 yards
for a touchdown against Carolina. That play was the first salvo in
a 51-23 blowout of the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   It helped convince Martin, who went to the Super Bowl with the
Chargers after the 1994 season, that something was up with a team
that had only seven winning seasons in its first 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more important for the Falcons to bounce back than it
would be for a team like the 49ers, because they're expected to
bounce back,'' he said. ``We're a team that's been on the downside.
Even before that, though, I always felt this was a special team.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta won its next two games, but Chandler was injured in the
first half against New Orleans, and missed the Jets game. He was
replaced by Steve DeBerg, 44, the subject of many age jokes before
the season. DeBerg, who played and coached with Reeves, had retired
after the 1993 season. He looked his age against the Jets, and the
Falcons returned to earth.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, running back Jamal Anderson took control,
rushing for a career-high 172 yards and two touchdowns in a 37-15
victory against the Rams. His finished the season with an
NFL-record 410 carries, and franchise records of 16 touchdowns and
1,846 rushing yards, the ninth-highest total in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson rushed for 100 or more yards in an NFL-best 12 games
behind the blocks of left tackle Bob Whitfield, left guard Calvin
Collins, center Robbie Tobeck, right guard Gene Williams, Salaam,
tight end O.J. Santiago and fullback Bob Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Anderson) can run, catch, block,'' Reeves said. ``He is a
complete football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask him to pass. His two wounded ducks the next week
at New England were about the only things that went wrong against
the Patriots. The highlight was defensive end Chuck Smith's 71-yard
return of a Drew Bledsoe fumble caused by left defensive end Lester
Archambeau, as the Falcons won 41-10 and served notice that they
were for real.
</P>
<P>
   They reaffirmed it the next week with a 31-19 victory at home
against the 49ers that put the Falcons alone in first place in the
NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, at St. Louis, the Falcons won without Chandler,
who was sidelined with an ankle sprain. Second-year quarterback
Tony Graziani started, but was replaced at halftime by DeBerg with
the Falcons leading 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg's 27-yard touchdown pass to Mathis in the third quarter
regained the lead for the Falcons. Anderson had 188 rushing yards,
hitting the Rams with a career high for the third time in two
seasons. Most important, the Falcons moved to 4-1 in games Chandler
missed or left with an injury. In 1997, they were 0-6 in such
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for our football team,'' DeBerg said, ``that our
team could win without Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons kept winning, but Christian, a crucial blocker for
Anderson, was lost for the season Dec. 13 with a knee injury during
a 27-17 victory at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Reeves complained to team internist Charlie
Harrison about chest pains and underwent quadruple bypass surgery
the next day. With defensive coordinator Rich Brooks taking over as
interim coach, the Falcons were all business for the final two
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-17 victory the next Sunday at Detroit clinched the second
NFC West title in team history. The Falcons then returned home and
squashed Miami, an AFC playoff team, 38-16 in the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, Anderson, Buchanan, Robinson and Tuggle made the Pro
Bowl, but the overriding theme of 1998 was teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no formula you can easily repeat,'' Chandler said.
``For example, bringing Eugene Robinson in _ he fit so well with
Ray and all the guys in the secondary. We just have a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And most believe the fun began during a reality-check trip to
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically at 3Com or Candlestick, it just snowballed and
got worse, ending up in a 45-3 blowout or something,'' Anderson
said. ``We were like, 'We can't have this happen to us.' We didn't
come back and win, but we made it close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime, most of us looked across the field and saw those
guys elated,'' Bennett said. ``We thought, `We're a talented
football team, too, and if we play the way we're capable and trust
each other, we can do something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like win the West.

 &HT;    NFL will pay respect after playoff success
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Far from the madding crowd, Arizona Cardinals
offensive tackle Lomas Brown leaned against a wall in the trainer's
room under Texas Stadium on Saturday evening, a silent but amused
witness to the raucous celebration that accompanied the team's
first playoff victory in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   As defensive ends Simeon Rice and Andre Wadsworth slapped
high-fives, wide receiver Eric Metcalf fired up an expensive Cuban
victory cigar and quarterback Jake Plummer performed a
rhythm-challenged Chicken Dance, the 14-year veteran smiled wryly
and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we won this game (over the Dallas
Cowboys),'' Brown said, ``was because half this team is too young
to realize we weren't supposed to win. Take a guy like Wadsworth,
who was accustomed to always winning in college. He thinks this is
how it's supposed to be. The young players like him came in here
without any preconceived notion of failure. But they'll find out it
takes more than one playoff win to have the 'all that' attitude. In
the playoffs, you earn respect by doing it and then doing it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a league dogma most Atlanta Falcons veterans know, as
the team continues its improbable Super Bowl quest with this
afternoon's rubber match against the San Francisco 49ers. The
Falcons earned a spot this season among the league's elite by
becoming one of only 15 teams to post 14 victories since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 12 teams that enjoyed 14-victory seasons before 1998 _
when the Falcons, Denver Broncos and Minnesota Vikings joined the
group this year _ only one, the 1986 Chicago Bears, failed to
advance to a conference championship game. Nine of the clubs played
in the Super Bowl, and seven won it.
</P>
<P>
   In a weak NFC West, and even with a more difficult schedule than
they faced in 1998, the Falcons aren't likely to regress in 1999.
An offense based on a power running game and play-action passing,
and a defense that creates turnovers and doesn't surrender the big
play, represents the formula for success in the NFL. Coach Dan
Reeves has said he is building a team for the long haul, and it
appears he has succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   An upset loss today, however, would transform the Falcons
quickly from championship contenders to pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've accomplished this year was a big step,'' said
linebacker Cornelius Bennett, one of several veterans who spent
some time this week addressing the younger players about the
intensity of playoff football. ``But we need to keep going.
Anything less than a win (today) would be one step back.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Falcons want in this magical season is to
find out they were simply an overhyped disappearing act. A playoff
victory against the 49ers, still perceived as an elite franchise
despite aging, would answer the few remaining skeptics in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is respected around the NFL and his experience in
preparing a team for the playoffs is a huge plus. Even with 20
veterans totaling an aggregate 76 games of postseason experience,
and the presence of Bennett and free safety Eugene Robinson, the
Falcons remain an unknown playoff commodity.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison with the other 14-victory teams since 1970,
Atlanta's rise was meteoric and with much less foundation. Only
five teams since the merger improved by more than the Falcons'
plus-8 from 1997 to this season. Of the 14-victory teams, only the
Redskins of 1983 can approximate Atlanta's speedy ascent. Eleven of
the teams had double-digit victories the season before they notched
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one around here,'' tailback Jamal Anderson said,
``feels what we accomplished is a fluke. If there's still anyone
out there who thinks it was, we can take care of that in the
playoffs. That's where you want to demonstrate your staying
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Falcons defensive end Tim Green, an NFL analyst for Fox,
said, ``It would be tough for them to undo all the good, but a
(playoff) loss at this point (would make) the people who were
turned onto them locally this year climb back on the fence again.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the NFL is full of teams that turned out to be
one-year wonders.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of Bobby Ross' professional football resume is
taking San Diego to Super Bowl XXIX in 1994. But the Chargers were
a .500 team the next two seasons, and Ross was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In just their fourth season of existence, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers went to the 1979 NFC Championship Game and lost 9-0 to
the Los Angeles Rams. The Bucs, 10-6 during that dizzying season,
then qualified for the playoffs twice in the next 17 years and had
a league-record stretch of a dozen seasons with double-digit
defeats. ``That we went to the (conference) championship game ...
was like some asterisk in the history of the team,'' said Grambling
coach Doug Williams, the Bucs quarterback in '79. ``We became the
best example of 'What have you done for me lately?' in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, even though Minnesota enters the playoffs with the
best record and is the NFC favorite to go to the Super Bowl, coach
Dennis Green knows that a loss to Arizona will expunge the Vikings'
15 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Green took the Vikings to the playoffs in five of the previous
six seasons and won the NFC Central in 1992 and '94. But Minnesota
is just 1-5 in the playoffs during that stretch. In both years that
they won division titles, they were knocked out in the wild-card
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you do it, the people have a right to question you,''
Green said. ``Our 15 wins aren't going to scare anyone at this
point. We're starting again from scratch, like everybody else. We
have to re-earn all those stripes.

 GORTON CLEBRATES ROLE IN SENATE COMPROMISEx  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton would have spent Friday
celebrating anyway _ it was his 71st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton, R-Wash., was also celebrating what he called ``one
of the most rewarding experiences I've had in the Senate,'' his
central role in developing the bipartisan plan for proceeding with
the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was one of four senators who drafted the final compromise
plan approved unanimously by the Senate Friday. Senators from both
parties said it was his month-long effort to hammer out a proposal
with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., that made the deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Joe Lieberman, in a bipartisan way, put their heads
together, they started thinking about it, they started coming up
with ideas, and we moved forward and it led to what we have here
before us,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he talked to Gorton daily over the past few weeks.
``So I want to thank Slade for being willing to do that and for
enduring praise and criticism that he has had to live with over the
past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gorton and Lieberman failed to sell their own plan,
which might have led to an abbreviated trial proceeding, to the
full Senate. It was one of the plan's most vocal critics, Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, along with Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who found a
way to alter the plan to win approval by allowing senators to vote
on each proposal to bring in a witness or discuss new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But senators said Gorton and Lieberman played a critical role
both in laying the groundwork for a bipartisan plan and in writing
the final agreement. After a closed-door meeting at which Gramm and
Kennedy verbalized the final compromise, Gorton and Lieberman, both
former state attorneys general, joined them in Lott's office to
write the language that was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enjoyed cussing and discussing him (Gorton) and his
proposals for the last week,'' said assistant majority leader Don
Nickles, R-Okla. ``He has shown great courage and leadership, and
he has worked with all of us ... Republicans and Democrats, to try
to forge a bipartisan resolution to this challenge. And I
compliment him for his legislative skills in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has been working with Lieberman to come up with a plan
for a Senate trial after the House impeached Clinton on perjury and
obstruction of justice charges for his alleged effort to conceal
his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a formal plan, it became outmoded fairly quickly, but it
triggered a wide range of conversations among Republicans and among
Democrats and most importantly between members of the two
parties,'' Gorton said. ``All of us are elated that we did not
start out with a partisan vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that he wound up at the center of the firestorm
because of his close relationships with Lieberman, which dates back
two decades, and with Lott, for whom Gorton is counselor and
confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a great sense of gratification that we started the
procedures that brought members together on both sides of the
political aisle and ended in this result,'' Gorton said. ``My
colleagues are delighted with me, and it's hard to get a better
feeling than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment issue carries risks for Gorton, who says he
plans to run for re-election to a fourth term in the Senate next
year. Removing Clinton from office _ a step Gorton says he is
inclined to support _ is likely to be unpopular in Washington,
where a plurality of voters supported Clinton in 1992 and 1996. And
his work for a bipartisan handling of the trial is alienating some
conservatives in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton said he had no choice but to take a position on
impeachment, and as a lawyer who delights in nitty-gritty legal
debates, he jumped into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a United States senator, (and) even if I sat still like
the bump on a log, I'm going to have to vote at some point or
another on it,'' he said. ``But more importantly than that, I'm a
United states Senator under the Constitution of the United States,
and the Constitution calls for these procedures, and to me it is
the inevitable duty that one do the best that one can. ... I think
it's my duty to try to see to it to the best of my ability that the
Senate does do impartial justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the Senate trial is a political process, not a
judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a tremendous burden, and I guess part of the reason
that I feel that burden is that this is only the second time this
has ever taken place in our history,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the burden is more the importance of the issue
and the weight of the oath (of impartiality) than it is some
abstract conception of history. ... Will it be a part of history?
Yes it will be. But the real burden is doing impartial justice.''

UNHEEDED WARNINGS: A SPECIAL REPORT ON THE EMBASSY BOMBING IN
KENYA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change death toll in 4th graf from ``254 Africans'' to
``more than 200 Africans.'' Rewrites 15th graf to strengthen State
Department response. No other changes.) (Eds: A short version has moved as EMBASSY-BOMBS-ABR) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN and BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to
Kenya, sent an emotional letter to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright begging for the secretary's personal help.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, a career diplomat, had been fighting for months
for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats
and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot. The
department had repeatedly refused to grant her request, citing a
lack of money. But that kind of response, she wrote Albright, was
``endangering the lives of embassy personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the FBI had been amassing increasingly ominous and
detailed clues about potential threats in Kenya, officials said.
But the State Department bureaucracy still dismissed Ms. Bushnell.
She was even seen by some at the State Department as a nuisance who
was overly obsessed with security, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   Albright took no action. And three months later, on Aug. 7, the
American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were simultaneously
attacked with car bombs. Twelve American diplomats and more than
200 Africans were killed in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has acknowledged that Ms. Bushnell raised
questions about security before the bombing. But a close
examination of events in the year before the assaults, based on
interviews with officials throughout the U.S. government, shows her
concerns were more intense, more well-founded, more specific, and
more forcefully expressed than has previously been known.
</P>
<P>
   The review shows that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA repeatedly told State Department officials in
Washington and in the Kenya Embassy that there was an active
terrorist cell in Kenya connected to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
exile who is accused of masterminding the attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA and FBI investigated at least three terrorist threats
in Nairobi in the year before the bombing and took one seriously
enough to send a counter-terrorism team from CIA headquarters. The
agency ultimately concluded that threat was unfounded, but some
officials believe the inquiry was botched, and the agency's
inspector general is investigating how it was handled.
</P>
<P>
   _ State Department officials brushed aside Gen. Anthony Zinni,
commander of the U.S. Central Command, who had visited Nairobi on
his own and warned that the Nairobi embassy was an easy and
tempting target for terrorists. Zinni's offer to send his own
specialists to review security in Nairobi was turned down by the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ The State Department had all but abandoned the commitment it
made after the 1983 bombing of the Beirut embassy to improve
embassy security. Department officials had long since stopped
asking Capitol Hill for the money needed to meet its own standards,
and had adopted a strategy of improving the handful of embassies it
believed were at greatest risk. Nairobi was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, in her first interview about the bombing, said by
telephone from Nairobi on Friday: ``This is a tragedy in the real
sense of the word, and it's a tragedy that has caused us to think
differently. We no longer operate under the assumptions that we did
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A report made public Friday by a commission appointed by
Albright excoriated the State Department for failing to safeguard
American missions against terrorist attacks, particularly for the
practice of giving vulnerable missions like the one in Nairobi
lower priority when experience shows they make tempting targets for
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, signed by Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concluded that ``intelligence provided
no immediate tactical warning of the August 7 attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, classified cable traffic and intelligence reports, which
were not included in the public version of Crowe's report, show
that while none of the warnings gathered by American intelligence
in the year before the bombings pointed to a particular act of
terrorism on a particular day, the United States had growing
evidence that the embassy was a target of terrorist plots, and that
terrorists hostile to American interests were active in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were sympathetic to
Ms. Bushnell's concerns. They added that it was impossible to
respond to each terrorist threat it received. Department officials
also assert that even if Ms. Bushnell's requests had been granted,
a new embassy could not have been in place in time to prevent the
attack in August.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were told at the time by the CIA that the
threats in Nairobi had either proved unfounded or had been dealt
with by Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Ms. Bushnell began raising
concerns about the embassy's security soon after her arrival in
Nairobi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She sent two cables to headquarters in December 1997, outlining
the dangers and asking for a new embassy. Her request was not
seriously considered, officials said, when senior State Department
officials met in January 1998 at the State Department to set a
budget for embassy construction in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up on the radar screen,'' said one senior
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Ms. Bushnell to try her end-run with Albright. In
memos sent in April and May, she asked Albright to cite Nairobi's
vulnerability to Congress in seeking more funds for security. In
addition, Ms. Bushnell was lobbying every senior American official
and member of Congress who came to Nairobi. The ambassador would
say, ``How do you like our building? I think it's terrible,''
according to an American official. Ms. Bushnell ``did not want to
be in that building,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the terrorist threats investigated by the CIA
panned out, they focused Ms. Bushnell's attention on just how
vulnerable her embassy was. ``If you know there is a viper's nest
around, then that gives you pause,'' one State Department official
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the global investigation touched off by the
1993 World Trade Center bombing had focused on bin Laden and his
associates. FBI agents from New York were hard at work building a
criminal case against the Saudi exile. At the same time, the CIA
was tracking the group's movements and finances in hopes of
preventing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One trail led to Kenya where the agency discovered that bin
Laden's operatives were living in the country. Intelligence
officials say they briefed Ms. Bushnell about the presence of the
group in early 1997 but told her there was no evidence of a
specific threat against the embassy or American interests in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, American intelligence officials began to
look more closely at what bin Laden was doing in Africa. The CIA
identified an intriguing suspect: Wadih el Hage, a Lebanese-born
American citizen in Kenya who was believed to have close ties to
the leadership of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials prodded their Kenyan counterparts to raid el
Hage's home in Nairobi, an overture that was shared with Ms.
Bushnell and others in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police, accompanied by the CIA and FBI, searched the
house in August 1997. They found his computer, downloaded its
files, and read a letter describing the existence of an ``East
African cell'' of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the letter mentioned recent attempts by American
intelligence to investigate the group's Kenyan operations and
alluded to its role in attacking American soldiers in Somalia a few
years earlier. According to the document, the group had moved a
cache of incriminating files from el Hage's house and hidden them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That reference set off alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   American officials suspected that the missing files might
contain evidence of an upcoming attack by bin Laden's Kenyan
operatives. The working theory, officials said, was that such a
plot would be aimed at another country, with Nairobi used as a
``jumping off point.''
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official said American investigators began a
``somewhat frantic, concerted effort'' to locate the missing files.
``The concern was high enough about something being out there to go
right away,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, a second search was conducted in Kenya
at another location in September 1997. This time, a State
Department official from the embassy joined the CIA, FBI and
Kenyans. No files were found.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI interviewed el Hage, who had moved to the United States,
three times, but he professed to know little of bin Laden or his
activities in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Today, el Hage is in jail in New York, awaiting trial on charges
of lying in those interviews and conspiring with bin Laden to kill
Americans abroad. He has not been directly linked to the bombings
in Kenya, but has been accused of being one of the Saudi exile's
chief lieutenants, responsible for setting up front companies in
Kenya and seeking components for chemical weapons. He has pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CIA and FBI believed at the time that they had
uncovered a potentially dangerous terrorist group linked to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were not told of
this and stress that they were given only a ``fragmentary''
understanding of the reasons for the raid on el Hage's house.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were told only that the CIA was
assisting a criminal investigation by the New York FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time were we told he was connected to Osama bin Laden or
to any threat against U.S. interests in Kenya,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official said: ``If we had known there
was a significant bin Laden network in Kenya we would have gotten
our people the hell out of that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence and law enforcement officials strongly dispute the
State Department's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, said one intelligence official, was
briefed about the presence of bin Laden's operatives in Kenya
``before, during and after'' the August 1997 raid on el Hage's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, intelligence officials said the CIA sent the
State Department numerous reports detailing the activities of el
Hage and others linked to bin Laden in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those reports referred to Osama bin Laden in the first
paragraph,'' recalled one U.S. intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, the CIA's Nairobi-based officers learned
of another possible terrorist threat to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence service of another country, which American
officials declined to identify, turned over an informant to the
CIA. In a series of conversations, the informant said that the
Nairobi branch of an Islamic charity, the Al-Haramain Foundation,
was plotting terrorist attacks against Americans, according to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The informant eventually warned that the group was plotting to
blow up the American embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the CIA's station chief in Nairobi relayed the
threats to the ambassador and other embassy officials, touching off
a dispute between the agencies over what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Senior diplomats at the embassy wanted the CIA to ask the Kenyan
authorities to arrest the group's members immediately. But the
CIA's station chief, uncertain about the credibility of the
informant, initially favored keeping an eye on the group, according
to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats prevailed, and on Oct. 31, the Kenyans arrested
nine Arabs connected to Al-Haramain, and seized the group's files.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States receives thousands of terrorist threats
a year, this one was taken so seriously that the CIA took the
unusual step of sending a team of counter-terrorism specialists
from its Langley, Va., headquarters to Nairobi to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA team, which included an Arab linguist, scoured
Al-Haramain's seized files, but could find no evidence of a bomb
plot. Members of the counter-terrorism team then wanted to question
the Al-Haramain members in jail, to make sure they were not missing
any clues.
</P>
<P>
   But that request set off another dispute, officials said. The
agency's station chief, the highest ranking CIA officer in Nairobi,
refused to ask the Kenyans for access to the Al-Haramain suspects,
insisting that he had pushed his local counterparts far enough. The
station chief said he did not want to strain his relations with the
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials at CIA headquarters urged the station chief to
reconsider, but they said the decision was ultimately his, and he
held his ground.
</P>
<P>
   There were no interviews. Because the documents seized from the
group's offices showed no evidence of a bombing plot, the CIA soon
dropped its investigation. Without any evidence against
Al-Haramain, the agency concluded that its informant was not
credible, officials said. Kenya washed its hands of the group,
ordering the nine deported.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of the counter-terrorism team were furious,
officials said, and complained that their investigation had been
dangerously short-circuited. They felt they were unable to conduct
a thorough investigation without talking to the suspects
themselves. Some team members blamed the decision on the station
chief's lack of field experience; he was a career analyst from the
CIA's directorate of intelligence on his first overseas espionage
assignment. Embassy officials say they were not aware of the
internal CIA dispute, and add that they assumed at the time that it
was the Kenyans who had denied access to the suspects. ``Why would
you not want to interview them?'' asked one State Department
official.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell was told of the findings of the inquiry, and
assured that the threat had been eliminated by the arrests. In
fact, there were some lingering questions. Some intelligence
officials believed at the time that members of the charity were
tied to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   It was, perhaps, another clue about possible terrorist activity
in Kenya. However, the CIA did not circulate any intelligence
reports throughout the rest of the government about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Today, intelligence officials insist there is no evidence
linking the group to the embassy bombings. But they say they now
have evidence that connects them to bin Laden. The agency's
inspector general is examining the case.
</P>
<P>
   A third warning surfaced in November, 1997. Mustafa Mahmoud Said
Ahmed, an Egyptian, walked into the embassy and told CIA officers
he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb-laden truck
inside the diplomats' underground parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interrogation by Kenyan security officials, which
was relayed to the Americans, Ahmed made his own involvement in the
plot clear, saying he had already taken surveillance photos of the
embassy for the attack, which he said was to involve several
vehicles and stun grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA issued two intelligence reports on Ahmed's statements,
but cautioned in its reports that Ahmed may have fabricated his
story, thus downplaying the significance of the warning.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed is now being held in jail in Tanzania in connection
with the Dar es Salaam embassy bombing, and U.S. officials still
aren't sure what to make of his 1997 warning.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings in August and November prompted Ms. Bushnell to
renew her case for a new embassy.
</P>
<P>
   On December 15, 1997, she sent a report back to State Department
headquarters warning that the embassy's location made it
``extremely vulnerable to a terrorist attack,'' and that it had to
be replaced with a more secure building.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, on December 24th, she sent another
cable noting again that ``the embassy's security profile, in a
congested, downtown location, is cause for serious concern,'' and
asked for a comprehensive review of the embassy's security status.
</P>
<P>
   She also asked that State Department officials go back to
Congress to ask for more money in order to fund a new Nairobi
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials were not swayed, arguing that the dangers were
nonexistent or already dissipated. Ahmed's warning, one senior
official said, had been largely discounted as not credible. The
Kenyans had taken care of the more serious threat, he said, by
arresting members of al-Haramain.
</P>
<P>
   In a January 1998 budget review concerning embassy construction
funding, which included Undersecretary of State for Management
Bonnie Cohen and other senior officials, Ms. Bushnell's request was
not seriously considered, officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to her warnings of a worsening terrorist threat,
in a January 1998 cable, Ms. Bushnell was told by headquarters that
other embassy projects had priority, and that a new Nairobi embassy
was not in the State Department's future plans.
</P>
<P>
   The cable said that headquarters agreed that a ``new chancery
would be ideal,'' but that State ``had reviewed the case and
understood her concerns'' and had turned her down. In fact, the
State Department had a long wish list of embassies it eventually
wanted to replace, and Nairobi was not on it.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and State Department officials say that, prior to
the August embassy bombings, State asked Congress to include funds
in its fiscal 1999 budget for only two new embassies _ in Beijing
and Berlin. Those were the only new embassies the State Department
had sought congressional funding for since at least fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell's increasingly insistent demands for a new embassy
were so far out of step with the State Department's plans that
officials at headquarters were beginning to see her as a nuisance
who was obsessed by security, according to one official familiar
with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to the terrorist threats, Ms. Bushnell had other
reasons for concern about security, including street crime and
local political violence.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, the CIA's deputy station chief in Nairobi was
mugged near the building. Ms. Bushnell, officials disclosed, had
been told about a plot to kill her in early 1998 as well. And local
police refused to guard the embassy, and sometimes beat up
political dissidents right in front of the building, according to
an American official.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even similar warnings from other senior government
officials failed to persuade the State Department to change its
mind. Zinni sent a cable to the State Department warning that the
embassy was vulnerable to a terrorist attack after having seen
security conditions at the embassy for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the cable, Zinni offered to send a security team from CentCom
to review security at the embassy, but his offer was turned down by
the State Department because it already was planning to send its
own team to placate Ms. Bushnell. In March 1998, a team from
diplomatic security and the foreign building office, which handles
embassy leases and construction projects, arrived in Nairobi to
conduct a security review.
</P>
<P>
   In March, officials updated the security assessment last
conducted at the embassy in 1994, and found that the embassy was in
compliance with the security standards the State Department had
established for a post facing a medium terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
   Security recommendations made in 1994 had been carried out, the
review found. A week later, the team sent out from Washington
conducted its review, and proposed about $500,000 worth of new
security measures, including the installation of a new fence around
the front parking lot, upgrading perimeter surveillance, and
construction of a fence in front of the embassy's front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   In March, funding for a special roll-down door for the
underground parking garage was approved. Two months later, funding
for a similar door for the front entrance of the building and a new
perimeter fence was approved. But by the time of the attack, only
the garage door had been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the attack, the State Department said it had
been planning to spend about $3 million in 1999 to upgrade security
at the embassy. But officials now acknowledge that most of the
money was earmarked for interior remodeling, and only a small
portion was to go for security. ``We felt they shouldn't bother to
renovate,'' one official said. ``We said they should use that money
for a new building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the bombings, the Clinton administration has also
asked Congress for $1.8 billion to improve security at diplomatic
posts around the world, and to build new embassies in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam. On Friday, the Crowe panel included among its
recommendations that State spend an additional $1.4 a year over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   And just before Christmas, the State Department briefly closed
the embassy in Nairobi after the U.S. was warned that bin Laden and
his group might be ready to strike again.

 &HT;    Atlanta police improperly listed hundreds of unsolved crimes,
probe reveals
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An audit by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to
determine whether Atlanta police manipulated crime statistics to
reflect a lower crime rate did not reveal any criminal wrongdoing
by the department, but did highlight hundreds of mistakes by
investigators in improperly classifiying unsolved crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard defended her department
Friday afternoon, saying the number of reports questioned by GBI
and FBI auditors is insignificant in light of the thousands of
crimes reported during the period the study focused on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report clearly vindicates the police department and the
city in the face of these clearly irresponsible allegations,''
Harvard said. ``All along we knew there were some problems, but the
allegations were that there was a 'gross' underrepoprting of crime.
And the audit clearly disputes that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard referred to allegations leveled at department brass in
1997 by then-Deputy Chief Louis Arcangeli. In a series of
strongly-worded memos, Arcangeli alleged that Harvard and deputy
chiefs Bobby Rocker and Carter Jackson pressured officers and
investigators to reclassify some violent crimes to lesser crimes
and to improperly classify unsolved crimes as baseless reports.
</P>
<P>
   The report was conducted by 13 auditors from the Georgia Crime
Information Center, the agency that compiles crime statistics from
the state's law enforcement agencies. The GBI said the audit was
never intended as a criminal investigation, but a ``narrowly
focused effort to determine whether Atlanta police was in
compliance with federal crime reporting guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The probe shows that especially in the category of robberies,
several hundred incidents were left out of the total number of
robberies reported to Atlanta police in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to the audit, 498 robberies were incorrectly omitted
from the 5,191 robberies reported to police in 1996. That was more
than half of the 885 robberies that were deemed ``unfounded'' by
investigators. In a series of investigative hearings held by the
city's Public Safety Committee in May, Arcangeli told committee
members that he believed roughly 500 robberies had been incorrectly
omitted from the grand total.
</P>
<P>
   Omissions by investigators in the categories of rape and motor
vehicle theft _ the other two crimes highlighted by the audit _
were lower, however.
</P>
<P>
   Of 10,790 motor vehicle thefts reported to police in 1996,
investigators incorrectly ommitted 108. Of 553 rapes reported to
police in 1996, investigators incorrectly omitted 56 from that
total.
</P>
<P>
   GBI and FBI auditors also highlighted these findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Homelsss victims cases were unfounded due to the fact the
investigator could not locate them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rape cases were unfounded when the victim refused to
cooperate. Several attempts were made by the investigator to to
talk with the victim, however, because the victim never showed up,
or failed to contact the investigator, the case was not placed in
an ``inactive status.'' If the victim refuses to cooperate, the
case is not to be unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regarding car thefts, incident reports indicate that vehicles
reported stolen and recovered in the same day were improperly
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard said she would immediately implement recommendations for
further training for investigators to overcome the problem with the
improper reports. She also agreed to further audits by the GBI and
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report vindicates our police department and confirms what
we already knew _ that crime is down because the men and women who
wear blue have worked hard to make community policing a reality,''
Mayor Bill Campbell said in a written statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   City Council President Robb Pitts was less supportive. ''I would
reserve judgement on that until I have a chance to read it myself
because I don't know how extensive the investigation was that was
conducted by the GBI, and whether or not they talked to Arcangeli
and others in the department that have indicated that there are
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Arcangeli, who has since been demoted to captain, showed up for
Harvard's press conference, but was escorted out before the results
of the audit were released. He said he has not received a copy of
the report and would not comment on it until then.
</P>
<P>
   The city council public safety committee, meanwhile, still
hasn't released a report of its findings that resulted from the
June hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman C.T. Martin, chairman of committee, said Friday the
report may be ready by the group's meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the committee will have to review the report and decide
``whether everybody's in agreement with its recommendations.''
</P>

DESTINY AND FALCONS CONFRONT 49ers 
(bl) 
By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After San Francisco had sent Green Bay tumbling in a wild-card
playoff thriller last Sunday, the 49ers hugged and celebrated and
then quickly turned to the next task _ the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as 49ers cornerback Marquez Pope put it, ``Going down there
to Atlanta to get us some dirty bird.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the Falcons saw receiver Terrell Owens leap and grab
Steve Young's pass to miraculously beat the Packers, 30-27, with
three seconds left, the Falcons knew, too. Destiny was calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Us and San Francisco _ I guess it was just meant to be,''
Falcons running back Jamal Anderson said. ``We kind of knew it
would be us and them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons and 49ers play Saturday afternoon for the third time
this season, with this meeting before more than 71,000 fans in the
Georgia Dome being the one that matters most. The winner advances
to the National Football Conference championship game. The winner
is one victory away from playing in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an emotional game for the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   They are longtime rivals with the Falcons in the NFC West. The
49ers saw the Falcons rule the division this season with a 14-2
record and earn a bye in the first round of the playoffs. Though
San Francisco beat the Falcons at home, 31-20, Atlanta won on its
field, 31-19, and the 49ers finished with a 12-4 record and entered
the playoffs as a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Before playing Green Bay, the 49ers were anxious. Green Bay had
had much success against them, and the future of the 49ers'
coaching staff looked in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 49ers are soaring in confidence. Their victory over
Green Bay gave them reason to believe that this is meant to be a
special season for them. As in going to the Super Bowl. And,
certainly, the 49ers want to show Atlanta who remains king in their
series, in which San Francisco has won eight of the last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   But it also will be an emotional game for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   They have set so many franchise records this season that their
fans can hardly keep count. This is the most successful Falcons
team ever, it has won nine straight and it is 8-0 in the Georgia
Dome this season, where it has 10 straight victories. The Falcons
have enjoyed plenty of fun this year, scoring touchdowns and then
offering a dance called the dirty bird _ with players flapping
their arms like birds flapping their wings.
</P>
<P>
   It is a great emotional release for the Falcons after so many
years of frustration. But their greatest emotion will be having Dan
Reeves, their head coach, back with them.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, Reeves underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery. He
was expected to miss the final two regular-season games and
possibly the playoffs. Then that was upgraded to a possibility that
he could attend this playoff game, but remain upstairs in a booth.
Now Reeves will be on the sideline, though in a reduced role. But
on the sideline nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a recovery in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has worked wonders on the Falcons since becoming their
coach last season. They were a 3-13 team in 1996, but have won 20
of their last 24 games. No NFL team has done better during that
span.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the running of the 49ers' Garrison Hearst (1,570 rushing
yards) and the Falcons' Anderson (1,846 rushing yards). Anderson is
the better pass catcher out of the backfield, and that will likely
be what separates their performances.
</P>
<P>
   And will the 49ers' defense match the Falcons'? Atlanta is tops
among the remaining playoff teams in rushing defense (allowing an
average of only 75.2 yards per game compared with San Francisco's
100.6 yards). This Falcons defense also set a club record by
scoring six defensive touchdowns.

   CARROLLTON, Ga. _ A 15-year-old girl was found shot to death in
a high school restroom here and the 17-year-old boyfriend whom she
had apparently been forbidden to see was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are trying to determine whether the two shot
themselves or whether the boy, Jeff Miller, 17, shot Andrea
Garrett, Sheriff Tony Reeves of Carroll County said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the weapon was a .22-caliber pistol that had
been taken from a safe in the Garrett home. A key had been used to
open the safe.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, who were shot in the head, were found about 9
a.m. Friday by a custodian in the girls' restroom at Central
Carrollton County High School. Miller was taken by helicopter from
this town of 16,700 people, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, to
Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, where he was in intensive care
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garrett had said her parents had told her to stop seeing
Miller, friends of the two said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told everybody if they couldn't be together, they were
going to kill themselves,'' said Pam Frasure, 17, a friend of Ms.
Garrett. ``She told me that. She was crying yesterday. We all
thought she didn't mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of parents rushed to the school after hearing of the
shooting, and about half of the 1,050 students were allowed to go
home. More than 35 counselors were on the scene to help grieving
students.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garrett was a good student and played the clarinet in the
band, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was nice and she was very smart,'' Ms. Frasure said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who worked as a dishwasher at a local nightclub, was
known for his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how bad you felt, he could make you laugh,'' said
Holly King, 16, a sophomore at Central High. ``He was always
kidding, a funny person.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE, Md. _ Perhaps it is the references to the fiction of
Jorge Luis Borges, the late Argentine author whose metaphysical
imagery he uses to illustrate a point about price-to-earnings
ratios. Or maybe it is the nods to the philosophy of William James,
whose theories are called upon to justify why America Online is a
value stock. Certainly some hint is in the ``thought experiments''
that he calls upon his staff to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Spend even a few minutes talking with William H. Miller III and
it becomes clear that he is not a typical mutual fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of his fund speaks to that. In each of the last
eight years, the $6 billion Legg Mason Value Trust has outperformed
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Since the beginning of the
90s, shareholders of the fund have seen their investment grow by
453 percent, or 20.9 percent a year, on average _ well ahead of the
17.8 percent annual return of the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   None of the thousands of other mutual fund managers currently
plying the trade has equaled that feat; barely 1 in 10, in fact,
have beaten the benchmark over the last three years. Anyone else
aspiring to the mantle of fund manager of the decade should note
that not even Peter Lynch, the legendary former overseer of the
Fidelity Magellan fund, ever strung together such a consistent
record.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost nothing that Miller does would seem to fit within the
traditional parameters of the religion he claims to practice:
``value investing,'' the method of buying assets for a small
portion of their true worth whose best-known evangelist is Warren
E. Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Miller, 48, oversees a portfolio whose two largest
holdings are Dell Computer and America Online, stocks whose market
values have been hyperinflated by the craze for anything to do with
the Internet. Such stocks are all but shunned by strict value
types.
</P>
<P>
   That those two stocks account for more than three-quarters of
the gains in the Legg Mason Value Trust over the last two and a
half years only adds to the skepticism of people who doubt that
Miller is anything more than a crowd-follower. Without those
investments, Miller might be just another value fund manager,
struggling to keep up with a runaway bull market.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the holdings raise questions for current and
prospective investors in his fund _ including whether he can
realize profits without causing huge tax burdens for fund
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken and unflappable, Miller expresses confidence in both
his methods and the results, steadfastly defending his style as
holding to traditional value methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't want to figure out what a company is
worth,'' Miller said. ``They want to know where the stock is going.
We're always trying a Rubik's Cube approach, looking at something
from all different directions. We want to know, `What's the best
description of what's going on?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is an approach he honed in the mid-1970s at Johns Hopkins
University as a graduate student _ not in business, but in
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hooker, a former philosophy professor at Johns Hopkins
who is now chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, recalls his first impressions of Miller. ``Every morning I
was the first faculty member to get to work,'' Hooker said. ``And
when I would arrive, Bill would be sitting in the faculty library
reading The Wall Street Journal. It was odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Over months of talking to Miller about a dummy portfolio he was
managing and hearing Mr. Miller's excited explanations of the
theories of Buffett and Benjamin Graham, the father of value
investing, Hooker began to discern in the student ``an ability to
connect the dots where other people don't even see the dots.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker encouraged his protege to quit philosophy _ before
earning the doctorate he had been studying for _ and to try his
hand at finance.
</P>
<P>
   The principles that have had the greatest influence on Miller
are those of William James, the father of the school of philosophy
known as pragmatism. James believed that the way one knows that an
idea is true is if it is useful, and that knowledge can be rightly
understood only in its context. To Miller, that means that the
value of companies like America Online and Dell Computer must be
considered in light of how technology is changing the ways in which
companies do business and people communicate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, technological advances that let companies better
control their inventories have taken some of the big swings out of
the economy _ and, as a result, out of the fortunes of historically
cyclical companies, like makers of heavy equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional value investors might be tempted to buy those
relatively cheap, cyclical stocks, in anticipation of the next big
upturn in the economy. Miller, however, thinks any such swings will
be longer in coming and of smaller significance than history
teaches.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Dell serves companies capitalizing on this new
economy _ and its own inventory controls are the envy of its
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot like the change from an agrarian economy to an
industrial economy,'' Miller said. ``It didn't happen all at once;
it happened very subtly, year after year, but the accumulated
change was very large.''
</P>
<P>
   That way of thinking also informed the discussion of America
Online on a recent blustery December morning at the offices of Legg
Mason, hard by Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The evening before,
American Online had been selected as the newest addition to the S&AMP;P
500. Its stock was certain to open higher, as investors anticipated
the surge of buy orders that would come from index funds that track
the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   On that morning, Miller was meeting with his team of analysts
and portfolio managers, who contribute to the Value Trust but who
also manage four other funds, Legg Mason Special Investment Trust,
Total Return Trust, American Leading Companies and Focus Trust. The
topic was whether America Online's rising value should lead the
fund to sell some of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   The fund had bought the stock in late 1996, when a flood of new
subscribers to America Online overwhelmed the capacity of the
service's computers. Investors, fearing that subscribers would flee
from the service, sent the shares down 50 percent from their high.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Rapuano, an analyst on Miller's team, believed that
Wall Street misunderstood the significance of America Online's
problems. The higher demand meant customers loved the service, she
figured _ that it was changing the way that millions of people
gathered and shared information. She convinced Miller to buy a
million shares for the Value Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years later, America Online's shares were trading at
about $138, about 15 times the $9 or so that Value Trust had paid.
Based on Ms. Rapuano's models, which calculate the immediate value
of the future cash flows of America Online's business, the stock
was close to its full value.
</P>
<P>
   But in the longer term, Ms. Rapuano said, America Online's
potential remained great. ``The company has a $60 billion market
value,'' she said. ``In our long-term model, this is potentially a
gigantic company _ $200 billion to $300 billion over the next 10
years. Over the next 12 to 24 months, we shouldn't have quite so
much in AOL, but that doesn't mean we don't want to have a large
position over the 5-to-10 year horizon.'' The fund sold a few
hundred thousand of its eight million shares that day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the roughly two years after Miller bought America Online and
Dell Computer for the Value Trust, those stocks grew to account for
14 percent and 9 percent of the fund's assets, respectively. But
even though the fund took in more than $3 billion in new cash from
investors over that period _ by itself enough to triple the fund's
size _ the fund has made no additions to those holdings. On
balance, the fund has sold more than $100 million of those stocks
since its first purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is unusual for a fund called the Value Trust to be
holding on to stock that trades for 600 times the company's
earnings, as America Online does. The issue is not lost on Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of value funds out there with good long-term
records and not-so-good one- and five-year records,'' he said. But
he said the Value Trust's superior performance this decade goes
beyond Dell and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Miller invested a big portion of the fund in
bank and financial stocks, which were depressed because of high
interest rates and worries over loans to developing countries.
Since then, financial stocks have been among the market leaders,
and the fund still counts many of them among its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the Value Trust snapped up shares of health
care companies when they were beaten down by concerns over
President Clinton's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll easily trade no rate of return in the near term for
higher confidence that a stock will outperform in the long term,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of examples of that philosophy in the Value
Trust's portfolio. Consider Circus Circus, the casino stock that
Miller bought in the first quarter of 1996 _ at the same time he
bought Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell's shares have since increased 35-fold, Circus Circus
has fallen from the mid-30s to $12. Miller has responded by
gradually quadrupling his holdings of Circus Circus, to more than
five million shares _ more than 5 percent of the company. And
recently he has been adding shares of Mirage Resorts and MGM Grand
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stocks are flat, but the cash flows of gaming companies
have been growing,'' he explained. With new construction slowing
down in Las Vegas, Nev., Miller expects those companies' cash flows
to soar.
</P>
<P>
   Low-priced assets, high cash flow, a business turnaround _ all
traditional value-investing approaches, Miller points out.
</P>
<P>
   How to detect the signs of change that will lead to big
turnarounds in a company's market value is the subject of an
exercise occasionally used by Miller for his team of analysts and
portfolio managers. He calls the drills ``thought experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent example, Miller _ drawing on the work of Douglas
North, the 1993 Nobel laureate in economics _ asked the group to
think of two continents with the same climate, land mass,
indigenous populations and natural resource base that were settled
at about the same time. Then, he asked them to figure out why one
had created enormous wealth and the other had not.
</P>
<P>
   Like many experiments in a science lab, the ``answer'' lies as
much in the process as in the results. The continents, he explained
to his team, are North and South America, and the application of
traditional economic theory might lead one to conclude that,
because the two continents started with equal assets, they should
have been able to create equal levels of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   But when viewed in the context of the ideas and institutions
that guided the settlement and development of North and South
America, Miller said, those assets have very different values _ and
the outcomes, of course, have been far different, too.
</P>
<P>
   What does any of that have to do with managing a mutual fund?
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a framework to think about things,'' said Jay
Leopold, who follows health care and finance companies for Miller's
team. ``He doesn't cram philosophy down our throats. But he gets us
to think about how the context of something affects the anticipated
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also draws on the work of the Santa Fe Institute, a
research organization in New Mexico devoted to studying the science
of complexity _ things like swarm behavior, the collective actions
of groups of bees, ants, birds or portfolio managers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as managers have swarmed to stocks with even a glancing
connection to the Internet, so have traditional value investors
fled from the high price-earnings ratios that those stocks carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at price-earnings ratios like the Aleph,''
referring to the Borges short story by the same name. ``The Aleph''
is a mystical tale of a man who discovers in his cellar a point in
space that contains all points in time, a center of infinite
knowledge where, Borges writes, ``without admixture or confusion,
all of the places of the world, seen from every angle, coexist.''
</P>
<P>
   To perceive the P/E ratio as an Aleph, a be-all indicator of a
company's value, Miller says, is a ``pathetically simple view,''
one which would have led him to sell his most successful
investments months ago. No simple ratio can tell everything that
any investor _ value or otherwise _ needs to know about a stock.
</P>
<P>
   One of the monumental tasks ahead of Miller is dealing with new
investors, who likely believe that the fund's 40 percent annualized
returns over the last four years should continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probabilities favor those returns being a lot lower in the
future,'' he said. ``Our record looks great right now,'' he added.
``But I've had streaks that look really bad. We could have a streak
that makes us look really mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he eschews summing up his legacy. ``As William James
would say, we can't really draw any final conclusions about
anything.''

 By JAMES RISEN and BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to
Kenya, sent an emotional letter to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright begging for the secretary's personal help.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, a career diplomat, had been fighting for months
for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats
and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot. The
department had repeatedly refused to grant her request, citing a
lack of money. But that kind of response, she wrote Albright, was
``endangering the lives of embassy personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the FBI had been amassing increasingly ominous and
detailed clues about potential threats in Kenya, officials said.
But the State Department bureaucracy still dismissed Ms. Bushnell.
She was even seen by some at the State Department as a nuisance who
was overly obsessed with security, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   Albright took no action. And three months later, on Aug. 7, the
American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were simultaneously
attacked with car bombs. Twelve American diplomats and more than
200 Africans were killed in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has acknowledged that Ms. Bushnell raised
questions about security before the bombing. But a close
examination of events in the year before the assaults, based on
interviews with officials throughout the U.S. government, shows her
concerns were more intense, more well-founded, more specific, and
more forcefully expressed than has previously been known.
</P>
<P>
   The review shows that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA repeatedly told State Department officials in
Washington and in the Kenya Embassy that there was an active
terrorist cell in Kenya connected to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
exile who is accused of masterminding the attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA and FBI investigated at least three terrorist threats
in Nairobi in the year before the bombing and took one seriously
enough to send a counter-terrorism team from CIA headquarters. The
agency ultimately concluded that threat was unfounded, but some
officials believe the inquiry was botched, and the agency's
inspector general is investigating how it was handled.
</P>
<P>
   _ State Department officials brushed aside Gen. Anthony Zinni,
commander of the U.S. Central Command, who had visited Nairobi on
his own and warned that the Nairobi embassy was an easy and
tempting target for terrorists. Zinni's offer to send his own
specialists to review security in Nairobi was turned down by the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ The State Department had all but abandoned the commitment it
made after the 1983 bombing of the Beirut embassy to improve
embassy security. Department officials had long since stopped
asking Capitol Hill for the money needed to meet its own standards,
and had adopted a strategy of improving the handful of embassies it
believed were at greatest risk. Nairobi was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, in her first interview about the bombing, said by
telephone from Nairobi on Friday: ``This is a tragedy in the real
sense of the word, and it's a tragedy that has caused us to think
differently. We no longer operate under the assumptions that we did
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A report made public Friday by a commission appointed by
Albright excoriated the State Department for failing to safeguard
American missions against terrorist attacks, particularly for the
practice of giving vulnerable missions like the one in Nairobi
lower priority when experience shows they make tempting targets for
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, signed by Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concluded that ``intelligence provided
no immediate tactical warning of the August 7 attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, classified cable traffic and intelligence reports, which
were not included in the public version of Crowe's report, show
that while none of the warnings gathered by American intelligence
in the year before the bombings pointed to a particular act of
terrorism on a particular day, the United States had growing
evidence that the embassy was a target of terrorist plots, and that
terrorists hostile to American interests were active in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were sympathetic to
Ms. Bushnell's concerns. They added that it was impossible to
respond to each terrorist threat it received. Department officials
also assert that even if Ms. Bushnell's requests had been granted,
a new embassy could not have been in place in time to prevent the
attack in August.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were told at the time by the CIA that the
threats in Nairobi had either proved unfounded or had been dealt
with by Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Ms. Bushnell began raising
concerns about the embassy's security soon after her arrival in
Nairobi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She sent two cables to headquarters in December 1997, outlining
the dangers and asking for a new embassy. Her request was not
seriously considered, officials said, when senior State Department
officials met in January 1998 at the State Department to set a
budget for embassy construction in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up on the radar screen,'' said one senior
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Ms. Bushnell to try her end-run with Albright. In
memos sent in April and May, she asked Albright to cite Nairobi's
vulnerability to Congress in seeking more funds for security. In
addition, Ms. Bushnell was lobbying every senior American official
and member of Congress who came to Nairobi. The ambassador would
say, ``How do you like our building? I think it's terrible,''
according to an American official. Ms. Bushnell ``did not want to
be in that building,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the terrorist threats investigated by the CIA
panned out, they focused Ms. Bushnell's attention on just how
vulnerable her embassy was. ``If you know there is a viper's nest
around, then that gives you pause,'' one State Department official
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the global investigation touched off by the
1993 World Trade Center bombing had focused on bin Laden and his
associates. FBI agents from New York were hard at work building a
criminal case against the Saudi exile. At the same time, the CIA
was tracking the group's movements and finances in hopes of
preventing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One trail led to Kenya where the agency discovered that bin
Laden's operatives were living in the country. Intelligence
officials say they briefed Ms. Bushnell about the presence of the
group in early 1997 but told her there was no evidence of a
specific threat against the embassy or American interests in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, American intelligence officials began to
look more closely at what bin Laden was doing in Africa. The CIA
identified an intriguing suspect: Wadih el Hage, a Lebanese-born
American citizen in Kenya who was believed to have close ties to
the leadership of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials prodded their Kenyan counterparts to raid el
Hage's home in Nairobi, an overture that was shared with Ms.
Bushnell and others in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police, accompanied by the CIA and FBI, searched the
house in August 1997. They found his computer, downloaded its
files, and read a letter describing the existence of an ``East
African cell'' of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the letter mentioned recent attempts by American
intelligence to investigate the group's Kenyan operations and
alluded to its role in attacking American soldiers in Somalia a few
years earlier. According to the document, the group had moved a
cache of incriminating files from el Hage's house and hidden them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That reference set off alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   American officials suspected that the missing files might
contain evidence of an upcoming attack by bin Laden's Kenyan
operatives. The working theory, officials said, was that such a
plot would be aimed at another country, with Nairobi used as a
``jumping off point.''
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official said American investigators began a
``somewhat frantic, concerted effort'' to locate the missing files.
``The concern was high enough about something being out there to go
right away,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, a second search was conducted in Kenya
at another location in September 1997. This time, a State
Department official from the embassy joined the CIA, FBI and
Kenyans. No files were found.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI interviewed el Hage, who had moved to the United States,
three times, but he professed to know little of bin Laden or his
activities in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Today, el Hage is in jail in New York, awaiting trial on charges
of lying in those interviews and conspiring with bin Laden to kill
Americans abroad. He has not been directly linked to the bombings
in Kenya, but has been accused of being one of the Saudi exile's
chief lieutenants, responsible for setting up front companies in
Kenya and seeking components for chemical weapons. He has pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CIA and FBI believed at the time that they had
uncovered a potentially dangerous terrorist group linked to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were not told of
this and stress that they were given only a ``fragmentary''
understanding of the reasons for the raid on el Hage's house.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were told only that the CIA was
assisting a criminal investigation by the New York FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time were we told he was connected to Osama bin Laden or
to any threat against U.S. interests in Kenya,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official said: ``If we had known there
was a significant bin Laden network in Kenya we would have gotten
our people the hell out of that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence and law enforcement officials strongly dispute the
State Department's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, said one intelligence official, was
briefed about the presence of bin Laden's operatives in Kenya
``before, during and after'' the August 1997 raid on el Hage's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, intelligence officials said the CIA sent the
State Department numerous reports detailing the activities of el
Hage and others linked to bin Laden in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those reports referred to Osama bin Laden in the first
paragraph,'' recalled one U.S. intelligence official.

MCI WON'T MAKE BID FOR AIRTOUCH

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speculation over whether MCI Worldcom Inc. would join the
bidding for Airtouch Communications Inc. appeared all for naught
Friday. MCI Worldcom said in a press release that after reviewing
the possibility of acquiring Airtouch, it had ``determined not to
pursue a bid for the company at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement came after news reports earlier in the day that
MCI Worldcom had made a verbal offer to buy Airtouch in a stock
swap.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch, the nation's leading wireless phone company, has been
in merger talks with Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local
phone concern, which wants to buy the company in a stock deal
valued at about $45 billion. Last weekend Vodafone Group PLC, a
British wireless carrier, proposed buying Airtouch for cash and
securities worth about $54 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Airtouch is clearly the company in play, some merger
professionals said Friday that Vodafone might find itself an
attractive target, particularly for European telecommunications
concerns that want to expand.

SURGING INTERNET STOCK'S TRADING HALTED FOR A TIME
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas) (bl) 
By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest twist on highflying Internet stocks, the Nasdaq
exchange Friday temporarily halted trading of Broadcast.com, a
Dallas-based Internet company, after a more than 70 percent jump in
the price of its shares _ then allowed trading to resume even
though the company declined to comment on what might have caused
the surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically said that they don't comment on unusual market
activity, and we didn't see any information out there, so we
resumed trading,'' said Mike Shokouhi, a Nasdaq spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The company also declined to comment when reached by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Although several analysts said it was unusual for an exchange to
accept a no-comment response from a company, Shokouhi said: ``We
basically let the markets do what they do. And you know, it seems
like it's a brave new world with these Internet stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq halted trading on Broadcast.com stock at 11:51 a.m. after
the stock surged as high as $230.50 for no apparent reason after
opening at $131, Shokouhi said. When trading resumed at 1:20 p.m.,
it fell as low as $175 but closed at $197.50, up $65.50. In all,
2.7 million shares changed hands _ most in lots of between 100 and
500 shares, indicating the kind of retail buyers who have been
fueling the meteoric rise in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy caused some transaction delays, with one trader
reporting canceling an order after waiting 10 minutes for a sell
order, during which the price dropped 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   The wild ride capped another week of astronomical gains by
Internet stocks and preceded a meeting called for Monday by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's board, with
securities firms to discuss market volatility in technology stocks,
some of which have recently seen 50-point daily swings.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Smith, an analyst with Renaissance Capital Corp. who
follows Broadcast.com, said: ``The market is crazy over the
Internet. But that's a pretty amazing leap in value, so it must be
related to something. It's beyond anything the Internet is
producing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Nasdaq's resumption of trading after the company's
refusal to comment, Ms. Smith said, ``That makes it all the more
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com, which has about 250 employees, transmits over the
World Wide Web sound and video of events ranging from sports and
news to corporate shareholder meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Among other popular Internet stocks that posted $30 gains Friday
were Amazon.com, CGI Group, Yahoo and Geocities. &QL;

POLICEMAN HOPES TO BEAT WORLD BOXING CHAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ Richard Frazier, a New York City police
officer in the 26th Precinct, is way out of his jurisdiction down
here in this Gulf Coast town. And some would argue that he is also
way of out his league, challenging Roy Jones Jr., arguably the best
boxer in the sport, for Jones' World Boxing Council and World
Boxing Association light heavyweight titles.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier understands the skepticism. ``I'm a cop,'' he said. ``I
don't believe too much.''
</P>
<P>
   If Frazier were not the one fighting Jones, who turns 30 on Jan.
16, he would find it unbelievable that he is the No. 1 contender
and in this position. Although he was a very good amateur boxer,
winning three Golden Gloves championships, there is nothing on his
professional boxing resume that would indicate that Frazier should
be here. He has only seven knockouts on his 18-3-1 record. His most
noteworthy opponent was William Guthrie, a former light heavyweight
champion who knocked Frazier out in the sixth round.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier will probably suffer the same fate against Jones (38-1)
in a scheduled 12-round bout that will be broadcast on HBO at 10
p.m. as part of its ``Championship Boxing'' series.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Shane Mosley (30-0, 28 knockouts), the
International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, will defend
his title against Golden Johnson (15-2-2), a former short order
cook. With the vocations of Frazier and Johnson in mind, this show
has been billed ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said his resume was light on quality opponents because
all of the good boxers pulled out of bouts before signing
contracts. Grant Phillips, Frazier's manager, said at one time or
another that they had agreements with Michael Nunn, Lou Del Valle,
Merqui Sosa and Dario Matteoni, but they all backed out.
</P>
<P>
   Murad Muhammad, Jones' promoter, made light of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys pulling out on you, you're a monster,''
Muhammad said. ``You'll have to prove it Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier is in this position because Phillips and his promoter,
Don King, know how to work the ratings systems of the various
boxing organizations. Frazier benefits because this will be his
biggest payday. His previous high was $12,000, and he will earn
$350,000 for this bout. It is a pittance compared to the $3.6
million that Jones will earn for the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``People travel long and far for a lottery ticket,'' Muhammad
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he turned pro, Frazier was a very good amateur boxer. In
May 1991, a week before he was to accompany a group of amateur
boxers to a meet in Russia, Frazier became embroiled in the
controversial death of a Haitian street artist in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, who was off duty at the time, and some of his friends
got into an argument with the man, Grady Alexis. During the
confrontation, Alexis was punched in the head and died at the
scene. Frazier and another man, Terry Presley, were indicted on
third-degree assault charges, although witnesses gave police
conflicting reports of what happened. The charges against Frazier
were later dismissed twice, and he never faced administrative
charges by the Police Department. Presley, who was a student at the
John Jay School of Criminal Justice at the time, was convicted and
served weekends in jail for four months.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier still walks a beat on 126th Street between Amsterdam
Avenue and Broadway. ``I'm a cop, so no one has ever taken me
seriously as a boxer,'' Frazier said. ``It's as if you have to be a
street bum to be a good boxer. I have a dual career. I'm a boxer
who just happens to be a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, 39, said he had not had any special privileges for this
bout. He trains in his spare time and has taken vacation time to
prepare for Jones. He sparred 50 rounds with Bernard Hopkins, the
IBF middleweight champion. And since this bout was announced, his
fellow officers in his precinct have been giving him extra ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   They have probably been tougher on Frazier than Jones will be.
His latest modus operandi is that he takes it easy on opponents
that he likes. And he likes Frazier. Jones had to be admonished by
the referee to box in his last bout against Otis Grant, after he
got Grant in trouble.

BAD WEATHER? NOT FOR THE JETS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The New York Jets take a six-game winning
streak into their first playoff game in seven years on Sunday, when
they face the Jacksonville Jaguars. And Sunday's weather forecast
for Giants Stadium _ temperatures in the mid-20s to the very low
30s, with gusty winds _ seems to be just what Jets coach Bill
Parcells was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   It was 70 degrees Friday in Jacksonville, Fla., good for
practicing pass plays but not for getting ready for a game in which
the wind chill is expected to hover near zero. So suddenly, but not
surprisingly, the weather is looming as a factor in this
second-round game.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, with a coach who relishes hard-nosed, wintry football,
already have what they refer to as their ``cold-weather'' plan.
That probably means an increased emphasis on the run and a shorter
passing game.  &QL;

TWO OLYMPICS ORGANIZERS QUIT IN SALT LAKE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Rewrites 2nd to 5th grafs. Adds sentence to end of graf that

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The top two local organizers of the 2002 Winter
Olympics resigned Friday as new details continued to emerge in a
mushrooming bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two, Frank Joklik, resigned under pressure as
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and Joklik asked
for the resignation of the other, Dave Johnson, the senior vice
president of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik, 70, has not been linked to the scandal and will remain
in his position until a successor is found.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik, 70, has not been linked to the scandal and will remain
in his position until a successor is found. The pressure came from
Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, a member of the board of trustees of the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and U.S. Olympic officials, who
were concerned about public embarrassment and about wavering
confidence by corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the Salt Lake City bid committee had paid
housing, travel and education expenses to relatives of members of
the International Olympic Committee; had provided expensive gifts
to IOC members; had provided free health care to IOC members and
their families; had aided an IOC member in a profitable Utah land
deal; and had made direct cash payments _ apparently exceeding
$70,000 in one case _ to ``a number'' of IOC members and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Thursday that the payments had been made to
IOC members from Africa and Latin America. Speaking on the
condition of anonymity, investigators said Friday that Jean-Claude
Ganga, an IOC member from Congo Republic, had received a series of
payments totaling about $70,000, in a period leading up to the June
1995 vote in which Salt Lake City won the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that there did not appear to be any
justification for the payments, but that they were still being
examined. Efforts to reach Ganga on Friday and in recent weeks were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik also announced Friday that a monthly $10,000 consulting
fee paid to the former president of the Salt Lake City organizing
committee, Tom Welch, would be discontinued. Welch headed the bid
committee that secured the Games, but resigned his Olympic position
in 1997 after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge of
spousal battery. Welch and Johnson were the two most visible
members of the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two other employees of the local organizing committee took
administrative leave pending the outcome of the inquiry: Kelly
Flint, senior vice president for marketing and legal affairs, and
Rod Hamson, the licensing director, who worked as finance director
of the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   While an international search will be conducted for Joklik's
replacement, some of the potential candidates being mentioned here
include Dave Checketts, the chief executive officer of Madison
Square Garden and a native of Utah whose name surfaced as a
possible replacement for Welch in 1997; Jon Huntsman Jr., vice
chairman of Huntsman Chemical Corp.; Bill Marriott of Marriott
Corp.; Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser to
President Bush; David Gardner, former president of the University
of Utah; and Henry Marsh, a former Olympic steeplechaser.
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, one of two members of the IOC from the United
States, said here Friday that some IOC members involved in the Salt
Lake City scandal would be asked to resign at a meeting Jan. 23 and
24 at IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC also
reiterated Friday that it would not take the 2002 Winter Games away
from Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any IOC heads would roll, DeFrantz said, ``I don't
think we will have executions, but we will have fewer members.'' It
was the strongest indication yet from the IOC that some of its 114
members would be pressured to relinquish their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few individuals who have abused their privilege,''
DeFrantz said. ``We must have them removed from the Olympic
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   One who has come under scrutiny is Ganga, 64, who holds
influence as president of the national Olympic committees of
Africa. According to Olympic officials, the Salt Lake City bid
committee targeted African votes in their attempt to win the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga received free medical treatment for hepatitis in Salt Lake
City during the bid process, and profited in a land deal arranged
by Bennie Smith Jr., a member of the bid committee, several months
after the Games were awarded to Salt Lake City, investigators have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga has long been a controversial figure in the Olympic
movement as one of the organizers of the African boycott of the
1976 Summer Games in Montreal. A former ambassador to China, he is
currently Congo Republic's minister for tourism, sports and
leisure, as well as president of the country's Olympic Committee.
He was recently removed from the IOC's commission on new sources of
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Unless investigators can prove that Ganga received excessive
payments, gifts or services while acting in his official government
capacity, and not as an IOC member, it seems unlikely that Salt
Lake City officials would be subjected to charges of violating the
Corrupt Foreign Practices Act, said Jeffrey Weiner, a Miami
attorney who was formerly president of the national association of
criminal defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Four investigations, including those by an internal Salt Lake
City ethics panel, the USOC, the IOC and the U.S. Justice
Department, are examining vote-buying charges first leveled last
month by Marc Hodler, a senior IOC official from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as many as 25 of the 114 IOC members sold their
votes in recent elections to name Olympic sites. He has also said
that Salt Lake City was a victim of so-called agents who demanded
exorbitant fees for delivering blocs of votes. The report by the
Salt Lake City ethics panel could be made public as early as next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Leavitt said that he deplored the misdeeds of the
Salt Lake City bid committee ``and we revolt at being associated
with them.'' He also sternly criticized a ``sinister and dark
corner of corruption'' in the Olympic movement that exists because
of what the governor called a lack of accountability in the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, to
institute reforms in the bidding process and to restore the
integrity associated with the five interlocking Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the Olympics to move forward in an ethical, honest
way,'' Leavitt said. ``It is clear to us that the mistakes by a few
have very seriously damaged this movement and our Games, and for
that, we have deep regret.''

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, Salt Lake City Olympic officials had acknowledged
only that $400,000 had been spent on tuition assistance and
athletic training programs that benefited 13 people, including six
relatives of IOC members, most from Africa. Officials had defended
the programs as humanitarian assistance, not bribery. Welch had
also said that items such as shotguns and skis had been given to
IOC members, which exceeded a limit of $150 on gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to cash payments and other irregularities acknowledged
on Friday, Joklik said: ``It is clear that these disturbing actions
were taken in an effort to win friends for the bid. It is clear
that they were done in an atmosphere in which at least some IOC
members expected such gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Joklik said that as a member of the Salt Lake City bid committee
he had been unaware of any improper payments. He said the bid
committee's board of trustees had been screened from such
information and had been assured by auditors that all expenditures
were proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I do not believe that anyone promised us a vote in
exchange for our expenditures, nor that our actions influenced the
outcome of the bidding process, a handful of IOC members seem to
have seriously abused our generous impulses and expected _ and
received _ more than they should have been given,'' Joklik said,
reading from a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik said he was ``deeply dismayed'' by the revelations of
recent weeks and felt that it was necessary to resign to give the
organizing committee a chance to make a fresh start with the Games
only three years away.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation was welcomed by the USOC, which still must raise
more than $250 million in a joint marketing effort with Salt Lake
City to achieve the privately-financed budget of $1.45 billion for
the 2002 Winter Games. Corporate sponsors have become jittery in
recent weeks as details of the scandal became public, and US West
even withheld a $5 million sponsorship payment.
</P>
<P>
   Without Friday's resignations to signal to sponsors that the
scandal was being handled quickly and thoroughly, it would have
been ``extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, to raise funds
necessary for these Games,'' said John Krimsky Jr., the USOC's
chief fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   While the resignations of Joklik and Johnson, 40, may have
provided relief in a public relations sense, Salt Lake City is now
left without the two people who possess the greatest knowledge in
organizing the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Joklik's successor, most of the sports
facilities are completed or are well under construction. Major
projects remaining include enclosing the Olympic speed-skating oval
and constructing the 120K hill for ski jumping. All sports
facilities are expected to be completed by November 2000, so they
can be tested in competition long before the Games open on Feb. 8,
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reputation has been tarnished around the world,'' said
Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini. ``We will make it right
again.''

   HARRISON, N.Y. _ If he had followed his initial inclination,
Peter I. Bijur might be peddling bathroom tissues and paper towels
to supermarkets these days. Fresh out of Columbia Business School
in 1966, he accepted a marketing job at the Scott Paper Co. at
$12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Before he could pack his bags, though, Bijur was persuaded by
the school's dean to have lunch with a recruiter from Texaco Inc.
Texaco offered him a marketing job for only $10,000, but the
recruiter told him the company would give anybody with talent and
drive the chance to move high up the corporate ladder. ``I thought
that was a pretty neat opportunity, and so I turned down the other
job,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, Bijur occupies the ladder's top rung, as
Texaco's chairman and chief executive. But the prospects for
advancement aren't nearly as rosy for ambitious business school
graduates in 1999 as they were in the company's glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bijur took over in July 1996, the price of oil has plunged
from about $19 a barrel to below $13, casting a pall on the
industry. In response, Texaco has gone through a wrenching
reorganization, shedding thousands of jobs. Bijur says he plans
more layoffs as part of a plan to shave $600 million in annual
costs by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs at the sprawling concrete-and-glass headquarters here have
already been slashed in half, to 900, from the boom days of the
1980s, leaving rows of offices and cubicles empty. And breaking
with the tradition of scheduling holiday parties in local
restaurants for the various corporate divisions, Bijur held a
single _ and relatively inexpensive _ event on Dec. 16 in the
company cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   With balloons festooning the walls and a Christmas tree, menorah
and Kwanzaa decoration on display, the celebrants stood around
nibbling hors d'oeuvres and sipping drinks. They also watched a
video that tried to raise their spirits by poking fun at the
company and at its boss.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with little fat left to cut, Bijur is coming under pressure
from employees, analysts and shareholders to bolster the company's
fortunes by seeking a merger with another oil giant, along the
lines of British Petroleum-Amoco and Exxon-Mobil. ``People are
asking me all the time: `Well what about you? What are you gonna
do?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is silent on the subject. But he's proceeding as
though Texaco will remain independent, and for all the job cuts he
has engineered, he says he is determined to keep the lines of
communication open with the company's 20,000 employees. He solicits
e-mail advice from them, and personally answers most of the 30 or
so messages he receives each day. Some missives are sharply worded
_ and his replies can be equally candid.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is the most wonderful thing in the world,'' Bijur said.
He frequents the company cafeteria, he said, because ``I want to
see people in the lunch line; I want to hear what they have to
say.'' One of his favorite meals _ in the cafeteria or anywhere
else _ is hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   His office, which looks out on wooded hills and Long Island
Sound, is adorned with photographs of his wife, Ann, and their
daughter and two sons. On a coffee table are a catalog of Degas
paintings shown recently at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a
replica of the Cessna single-engine plane that Bijur flies on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first acts after taking over two and a half years ago
was to replace the thick oak doors separating the executive suites
with glass _ a move that some saw as a symbolic break with the
style of his predecessor and mentor, Alfred C. DeCrane Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Three months into his new job, Bijur faced a baptism by fire
with the publication of secretly recorded tapes in which some
Texaco executives made some apparently disparaging remarks about
blacks (one of the most publicized was later found to be innocuous)
and discussed the possible destruction of documents being sought in
a racial-discrimination lawsuit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the crisis, he turned the third-floor executive
suite into a war room, where scores of employees ate sandwiches and
pizza late into the night as they planned the company's legal
defense. Texaco settled the discrimination suit out of court in
1997 for $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies would have overreacted and basically gone into
their shell,'' said J. Robinson West, the chairman of the Petroleum
Finance Co., an energy consulting group based in Washington. Bijur,
he added, is ``a guy who took over a company which had lost its
momentum and he's giving it back.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate dispute, the company agreed last week to pay $3.1
million to 186 women in the largest ``glass ceiling'' settlement
ever reached with the federal Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been all smooth sailing with his top executives,
either. In beefing up his management team, he has bruised numerous
egos, bypassing insiders to recruit John J. O'Connor from BHP
Petroleum to oversee exploration, for example, and William M.
Wicker from Credit Suisse First Boston to take charge of corporate
development. ``It's important to go out and get fresh blood,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bijur says he encourages subordinates to challenge his
decisions, and sometimes makes outlandish proposals in meetings
just to provoke debate. ``I expect confrontation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he relishes digs at the only company he has worked for. A
framed photograph on his office wall shows a Texaco station with a
sign reading ``No Gas'' and an inscription by a Texaco manager:
``Peter, we sense there is a problem here.''

ZALMAN C. BERNSTEIN, 72, ICONOCLASTIC BROKER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn.)   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he started a securities firm under his own name
in 1967, Sanford Charles Bernstein made sure that hurried investors
would not fail to notice. To announce the firm, the 41-year-old
upstart ran a series of full-page newspaper ads emphasizing in
bold, black type a single word: ``Bernstein.''
</P>
<P>
   The display of hubris drew a wave of titters. The titters turned
to gasps when the Brooklyn-born Bernstein topped himself with a
demonstration of chutzpah that is still reverberating on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, so-called discretionary accounts, in which a broker
makes all the investment decisions without consulting the client,
were such an industry scandal that the New York Stock Exchange
imposed strict controls and many old-line brokers banned them
altogether. But Bernstein announced that he would seek nothing but
discretionary accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Given the potential for abuse by unscrupulous brokers tempted to
churn accounts by buying and selling, collecting fees with each
transaction, Wall Street laughed off Bernstein's chances for
attracting serious investors.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he died on Wednesday at 72 at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Bernstein had long since had the
last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   His brokerage had grown into one of the world's largest
independent investment companies, managing more than $80 billion in
securities for 25,000 private and institutional clients, and
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. had become one of the most respected
names on Wall Street _ even as Bernstein, true to his contrarian
ways, had changed his own name.
</P>
<P>
   To honor a late-life surge of interest in his Jewish heritage
and his conversion to Orthodox Judaism, he had moved to Jerusalem,
established dual American-Israeli citizenship and replaced his
``Sanford'' and ``Charles'' with rough Hebrew equivalents, becoming
Zalman Chaim Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than hubris and chutzpah to make Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co. a runaway success.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he started the company, Bernstein already had made
something of a name for himself. After enlisting in the Navy at 18
and becoming a Supply Corps officer in World War II, he studied
economics and accounting at New York University, picked up a
master's degree in business administration at Harvard and spent
three years with the Marshall Plan in Europe. He returned to the
United States with a French wife and such driving ambition that
when the Value Line Investment Survey turned him down for a job, he
won one anyway by offering to work without pay.
</P>
<P>
   He later worked as a research analyst, money manager and
institutional salesman at Oppenheimer &AMP; Company and then spent two
years as a partner in a small securities firm, Ralph E. Samuel &AMP;
Co., before striking off on his own. At first his younger brother,
Paul, was his sole partner and he had a total of seven employees,
including his father, Jack, a retired jeweler.
</P>
<P>
   His vision of a firm that would give comparatively small
investors the benefits of professional money management was so
novel, his brother recalled , that the Harvard Business School sent
a team of student researchers to study the operation. They
concluded that the approach was sound but wouldn't work for a
Jewish firm.
</P>
<P>
   They were half right. Within a decade, the firm was attracting
huge investments from major insurance companies, banks and pension
funds and had become known for the exhaustive research reports it
sold as a sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the iconoclast, Bernstein shunned the prevailing system of
star portfolio managers and adopted the so-called dividend discount
investment model, which bases investment decisions on a formula for
determining the value of a company's future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the formula depends on the accuracy of earnings
projections, Bernstein concentrated on the quality of the company's
research.
</P>
<P>
   A big, gruff and sometimes unpolished man, Bernstein became
famous for the pains he took in hiring, putting applicants through
a battery of psychological and other tests and sometimes playing
backgammon or chess with them to gauge their stomach for
competition and cigar smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards of his efforts were considerable for Bernstein, who
continued to be his company's largest shareholder after his
retirement in 1993. But he lived modestly after he accepted the
warm embrace of the close-knit Orthodox community, and he gave
hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli causes and other
charities.
</P>
<P>
   His family said that he died from complications of lymphoma. In
addition to his brother, who lives in Manhattan, Bernstein, who was
married three times, is survived by his mother, Martha, of
Manhattan; his wife, Mem; a son, Claude, of New Canaan, Conn.; two
daughters, Leslie Armstrong and Rochel Leah Bernstein, both of
Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

 &HT;    Ohio set for eventful inauguration of Gov.-elect Bob Taft
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Get ready for the glitter.
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Bob Taft is throwing a three-day bash beginning
starting Sunday to celebrate his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff begins at noon when Taft and lieutenant
governor-elect Maureen O'Connor attend the Ohio Family Celebration
_ a free public event that features a tour and hands-on learning
experience about Ohio government and the office of governor.
</P>
<P>
   The event also will feature two Dayton groups. The Kids Voting
Performing Troupe will perform a skit in the Statehouse atrium
about the importance of voting. And two members of Movin' On, a
Dayton dance group made up of adults with developmental
disabilities, also will perform.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Miller Holmes, who teaches the dance company, said
Daytonians Kathy Ostermann and Julie Porter will dance to jazz and
then boogie-woogie music.
</P>
<P>
   Performing at the Statehouse will be a real thrill, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that they've asked for a diversity of
people and we will have that exposure,'' Miller Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Sunday, the Motown singing group Mary Wilson and the
Supremes will headline the Ohio Republican Party's Inaugural eve.
</P>
<P>
   The gala is $50 per person and also will feature the Cincinnati
Boychoir and the Richens/Tim Irish Dance Troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Martin, executive director of the Taft-O'Connor
Inaugural Committee, said all of the events are expected to attract
large crowds. She said so many youths asked to come to the
Celebration of Youth Breakfast on Monday morning, for example, that
the event was moved from a 400-person hall at the Adams Mark hotel
in downtown Columbus to a 1,000-person hall at the downtown
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the general public will come and is interested in
being a part of the gubernatorial inauguration,'' Martin said.
``It's a great way to involve the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all events are free and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   After Taft's official swearing-in ceremony Monday afternoon,
Taft and his wife, Hope, will attend various private parties.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, the governor's ball, is a $1,000 per-person,
black-tie affair at the Hyatt on Capital Square.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to celebrate Taft's election, but aren't eager to
cough up quite so much cash, can make do with the Capitol Ball,
which at $250 per person is billed as ``black-tie optional.''
</P>
<P>
   Others can attend the Buckeye Bash, a $25-per-person, ``business
attire party.''
</P>
<P>
   The final inaugural event will be Tuesday for state employees
who want to join the governor, his wife and O'Connor for a free
boxed lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Privately funded corporations and individuals will pay the tab
for the three-day party, Martin said. Guests at the dances are
being asked to bring children's books that will to be contributed
to schools, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said she expects the events to be fun, but added that
planning so much in such a short time has been hectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like planning a wedding, graduation party and 50th
anniversary party, all rolled into one,'' she said.

EDITORIAL: THE SCALE OF DONALD TRUMP'S DREAMS  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Jan. 9:
</P>
<P>
   The normally loquacious Donald Trump quietly has amassed enough
real estate and air rights to build an 861-foot-high skyscraper
near the United Nations. What he touts as the world's tallest
apartment project is too lanky, even for the architectural mishmash
of Manhattan's East 40s. His bronze-glass monolith, the equivalent
of 90 stories, would dwarf the 39-story U.N. Secretariat and its
waterfront park. The project should be scaled back. But for the
moment, Trump appears well positioned to put his signature on New
York's skyline anew since his project is as-of-right, or not
subject to extensive public review.
</P>
<P>
   The project's legal pedigree does not mean the Giuliani
administration should remain on the sidelines. As-of-right status
shields a project from a full public review of its impact on air,
light and traffic and from assessing wind shear and shadows. But
City Hall may have grounds to scale it back, and the Planning
Commission can forestall a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall should review the Buildings Department's approval of
Trump's use of zoning rules that are as tough to decipher as
Sanskrit. The agency found that the way he assembled air rights
across zoning district boundaries fell within a mid-1980s exception
to the ban on such mergers in the city's 1961 zoning code. At issue
is whether Trump merely took maximum advantage of the rules, or
flexed them. It should not require months for the city to review
whether that judgment was reasonable and in line with how
developers operate.
</P>
<P>
   The far thornier task of safeguarding the city's skyline and its
neighborhoods falls to the Planning Commission. It should revise
the antediluvian zoning code to prohibit any developer from
exploiting air rights, plaza bonuses and other zoning tools to
create a structure that does not fit the scale of a neighborhood,
while allowing reasonable use of air rights to save landmarks, help
neighborhoods and promote economic development. Such zoning
decisions must remain the province of city government, not
neighborhoods or developers.
</P>
<P>
   A Trump executive thinks his boss' project will someday be
lauded as a landmark. But Trump's musings suggest an awareness of
the mismatch between the building's scale and the U.N. environs. He
said he believed that, had he boasted about his goal before buying
the site and air rights, zoning would have been altered to stop
him. His intuition should galvanize City Hall and the commission.

EDITORIAL: FIXING EMBASSY INSECURITY  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Jan. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bombs that killed 258 people at the American Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania last summer also destroyed any lingering
illusions about the protection America offers its diplomats and
their employees overseas. The dismal state of security was deplored
again Friday by two State Department commissions that investigated
the August attacks. They found that Washington has neglected
embassy security for decades. The administration and Congress
should carry out many of the report's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations were supervised by William Crowe, who has
served as both chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and ambassador
to Britain. His two groups issued a joint report, which concluded
that while security measures at both embassies followed State
Department policy, that policy was deficient. Though guidelines
required most buildings to have perimeter defenses 100 feet away,
the two embassies were exempt, as were other older buildings. The
report criticizes the government for complacency about security in
the absence of specific terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   It recommends spending $1.4 billion per year for 10 years to
hire more security personnel, prepare for new threats, upgrade
buildings and where necessary build new embassies or close old ones
in favor of regional embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Policy makers and legislators have heard, and ignored, similar
warnings before. In 1985 a State Department panel directed by Bobby
Ray Inman, a former deputy director of central intelligence, said
that more than 100 American Embassies needed replacement or
substantial renovation, including those in Kenya and Tanzania. The
investigation placed the cost of the needed changes at $3.5
billion. Congress appropriated about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's bombings led to increased spending by Congress and
a more serious attitude toward security at the State Department. On
Friday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright praised the Crowe
report and called the measures already taken an ``initial deposit''
toward protecting posts overseas. Congress should work with her to
prepare for terrorist threats.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After an extraordinary bipartisan caucus that
lasted about three hours, the Senate voted unanimously Friday to
approve a plan for President Clinton's impeachment trial that calls
for opening arguments next week and defers a decision on whether to
summon witnesses until later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement averted further confrontation over rival
Republican and Democratic trial plans that had threatened to send
the Senate into the same partisan spiral as the House. The two
sides had been deeply divided over whether to allow witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief session presided over by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist late Friday afternoon, the senators approved the plan
they had outlined earlier in the Old Senate Chamber, where the
Senate had met throughout the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   An official summons directing Clinton to respond to the two
articles of impeachment against him was delivered to the White
House by James Ziglar, the Senate sergeant-at-arms.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Democrats were wary of the blueprint, many
senators from both parties reveled in institutional pride at
maintaining a conciliatory tone that had eluded the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we didn't ask for this trial,'' said Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt. ``We didn't ask for the president to conduct himself
the way he did, and we didn't ask for the House to make a mishmash
of this thing. But all that's happened and now we have to preserve
the Senate and give the country a sense of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding the same note, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said: ``I
think there's a feeling in this situation that the Senate is on
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in a terse, carefully worded statement, said
Friday afternoon that it respected the Senate's decision. ``In
accordance with the procedures adopted by the Senate, we plan to
present on behalf of the president a vigorous, successful and
complete defense,'' said Gregory Craig, the special White House
counsel, in an appearance in the White House drive shortly after 5.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had hoped that the Senate would settle on an
abbreviated trial without witnesses, confined to the material
submitted by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. White House
aides waited anxiously while the senators met privately on Friday,
and some acknowledged disappointment at the procedure that emerged.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig said the White House was confident that the Senate
would move to cut off the proceeding after the opening
presentations, rather than extend the trial and call witnesses.
``We remain hopeful that this matter can be resolved expeditiously
and fairly,'' he said, before turning his back and walking
resolutely away from shouted questions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate plan approved Friday, the trial of Clinton on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his
efforts to hide his affair with Monica Lewinsky would get under way
in earnest on Wednesday with arguments on any procedural pretrial
motions by House prosecutors or White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the next day, the House has 24 hours to present its
case against the president. Clinton's legal team follows with its
allotted 24 hours. Both sides are precluded from introducing new
evidence unrelated to the impeachment record established in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Senators then will have 16 hours to question the two sides by
sending written queries to Rehnquist, who will be at the presiding
officer's chair in the front of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   At that point _ expected to be either Jan. 25 or Jan. 26 _
senators plan to debate and vote on two separate motions, first a
motion to adjourn the trial and next a motion on whether to call
witnesses. Those votes would be simple majority votes.
</P>
<P>
   If witnesses are approved, the House prosecutors or the White
House would question them first in a deposition. Sen. Tom Daschle,
the minority leader, said a second majority vote would be required
to have witnesses testify before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had previously stood adamantly against witnesses,
are taking solace in the fact that witnesses would have to be
approved en bloc, which they believe would discourage the House
from seeking to call too many witnesses. They also anticipate that
the senators _ sitting as jurors under a vow of silence _ will have
a diminishing appetite for witnesses after listening to the House
and White House for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing the Senate can't tolerate and that's
remaining quiet for very long,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn. ``And the idea they are going to sit there day after day
and listen to House managers and White House counsels, with their
inability to respond, is not going to last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the leader of the House impeachment managers,
said, ``We intend to use the time we have been provided to present
a compelling case on the serious charges pending against the
president. We also look forward to the opportunity _ with Senate
concurrence _ to call witnesses in support of evidence. The House
managers have said they want to call anywhere from five to 15
witnesses ranging from Ms. Lewinsky to an array of current and
former White House advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote brought to an end weeks of uncertainty and
contention over how the first presidential impeachment trial since
1868 should proceed. On Thursday the two sides had scheduled votes
on competing Republican and Democratic plans, but then pulled back.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And so Friday began with a last attempt to reach across party
lines in the ceremonial room that served as the Senate chamber
between 1810 and 1859, when some of the great debates and
confrontations over slavery took place. The chamber was placed
under heavy security. Folding chairs supplemented the permanent
seats to accommodate the senators, whose number was greater than
that of their counterparts in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans assured Democrats that despite the House
prosecutors' insistence on witnesses, they too did not want a
sordid discussion of sex to take place in the Senate chamber.
``What was helpful in the room was for the Democrats to learn there
are a whole lot of Republicans who are not anxious to have a bunch
of witnesses either,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators said the sense of the history of the room helped
foster an atmosphere where they could come together. ``Every
senator knows the level of oratory and the weight of the issues
discussed here,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``It helped
all the senators put this in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd reminded his colleagues that ``one of the saddest moments
in Senate history'' had taken place in the room _ the caning of
Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts by Preston Brooks of South
Carolina. ``Many historians feel that was when the comity in the
Senate broke down, leading three and a half years later to the
commencement of the Civil War,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, breakthrough
came when an unusual pair _ Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts
liberal, and Phil Gramm, a Texas conservative _ made back-to-back
statements. ``I describe it as the Kennedy-Gramm or the
Gramm-Kennedy proposal,'' Lott told reporters. He then stressed the
bizarre notion of these two ideological opposites working together,
by saying with relish, ``Did you hear what I said?''
</P>
<P>
   Other senators said Gramm pointed out that under Senate
impeachment rules a vote on witnesses could always be demanded by
any party _ there was no way around it. Kennedy agreed that the
Texan was right and started suggesting ways to make the witness
situation more palatable to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the Democrats who moved the most, to accept a
proposal much like the one the Republicans had originally drafted.
And some Senate Democrats expressed private annoyance that Kennedy
had been so quick to support Gramm because they thought he gave
away a tactical advantage stemming from the Republicans'
unwillingness to look as partisan as their House counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat close to the developments said the White House as
well had been trying to get Democrats to forgo the display of
bipartisanship. But Senate Democrats said they felt they had won
the best deal they could from the majority Republicans. Some also
made clear that they had more allegiance to the Senate as an
institution than to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, said, when asked about White
House grumbling. ``They have no say.'' He added, ``We're not here
to defend either the White House or the House of Representatives.''

EDITORIAL: AT LONG LAST, LEADERSHIP  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Jan. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then sanity breaks out, even in Congress. Through
bipartisan effort the Senate has devised something that was missing
in the House, a system for planning and managing the inquiry into
President Clinton's offenses in an orderly way. The essence of the
agreement is that it sets up a multi-vote hurdle to prevent the
wholesale calling of witnesses, and it sternly limits the
fire-breathing House prosecutors to arguing the existing record
developed in that body's Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The senators were full of self-congratulation after adopting the
complex rules of procedure, and they had a right to be. What the
Republican Slade Gorton called ``the mighty accomplishment'' on
knitting the Republican right and the Democratic left into unified
agreement was just that. The Senate devised what Sen. Phil Gramm
called ``a road map'' that was designed to lead in a matter of a
few weeks to a preordained destination: the punishing of Clinton
through censure, not removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   What the Democrats and the White House got out of the deal was a
set of formidable firewalls against the possibility of live,
embarrassing testimony about Clinton's sexual activities. As Gramm
explained, the House could propose witnesses only to provide
information that is not already on the record. A motion to call a
witness would be subject to debate, and even if it passed, the
witness would first be deposed in private.
</P>
<P>
   Another vote would be required before a witness could give live
testimony before the Senate. ``We now have a process that will
allow the case to be made without witnesses,'' said Tom Daschle,
the minority leader. The rules do not say that flat-out, of course.
But by building so many hurdles, the Republicans were signaling
strongly that there will probably not be 51 votes for an extended
round of new testimony.
</P>
<P>
   What the Republican majority got out of the deal is a reputation
for judgment not enjoyed by the House GOP. The majority leader,
Trent Lott, obviously decided weeks ago that a long trial would
damage his party and his personal reputation. Using Gorton as a
cat's-paw, he began his caucus toward putting House prosecutors on
a short leash. In a week of smart moves by Lott, the smartest may
have been the avoidance of a partisan vote to impose rules on the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   By setting up a format that allows the White House and the
prosecutors a total of 48 hours of opening argument and sets 16
more hours of questions from the floor, Lott has devised a safety
valve. Its value will become clearer as time goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone can let off steam for a few days, and then the Senate
may be in a mood to entertain a motion to bring matters to a
conclusion. That could come through a motion to vote on the
articles of impeachment and then move to a censure resolution, or
through a motion to adjourn the trial and move directly to censure.
Either course would require a simple majority and would show there
are not the 67 votes needed to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many in the House and at the White House, Lott and his
Democratic counterpart, Daschle, exhibited leadership that rose to
the demands of the occasion. Well-known partisan warriors such as
Gramm and Sen. Ted Kennedy on the Democratic side responded to
their example. As a result, the senators found the proper
legislative response to the situation. That is, they have figured
out a plan for punishing Clinton, rather than themselves or the
nation.

ANDREW CUOMO WILL NOT RUN FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NY-HILLARY-POLITICS) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, said Friday that he would not run for the U.S. Senate
in 2000 and would instead stay in the Clinton administration, where
he could play what is expected to be a major role in Vice President
Al Gore's campaign for president over the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife actually made this decision for me,'' Cuomo, 41, said
in an interview, referring to his wife, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo,
daughter of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy. ``She said: `Forget the
ego, it's not about ego. It's about public service. How do you
serve the most people?' The answer is clear: HUD secretary. It's
not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he chosen to run, Cuomo, the eldest son of former Gov. Mario
Cuomo, would have immediately jumped to the head of the Democratic
pack for the seat held by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who
has announced that he will retire next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo's withdrawal _ coupled with the decisions by Robert
Kennedy Jr. and state Comptroller H. Carl McCall not to seek
Moynihan's seat _ leaves the Democrats bereft of a big-name
candidate to challenge the man many politicians think will be the
Republicans' nominee: New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the Democrats' worries about the Senate race
in 2000, several party leaders said Friday that they remained
hopeful that Hillary Rodham Clinton would decide to move to the
state and run for Moynihan's seat. Mrs. Clinton's aides have said
she has no plans to do so, though they have not ruled it out.
</P>
<P>
   A few county leaders have begun promoting Rep. Nita Lowey of
Westchester as the Democrats' next best hope. Ms. Lowey says she is
seriously considering running, but many politicians think she is
leaning against it.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats who are considering running include Rep. Carolyn
Maloney of Manhattan and Assemblyman Michael Bragman, who is from
the Syracuse area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Giuliani, the potential Republican candidates
include Rep. Rick Lazio from Suffolk County, Rep. Peter King from
Nassau County, Thomas Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, and
Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   A number of prominent Democrats, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said they thought that Cuomo had decided against running
because Giuliani would be a formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo asserted that he could have defeated Giuliani. ``Just
because you are a good mayor does not mean you will be a good
senator,'' he said.

CLEMENS LETTER TO COST TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has always been a smell to the way Roger Clemens left
Boston for Toronto, and now the reason for the stench is starting
to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens and his agents, the Hendricks brothers, made a deal with
Blue Jays management that was not in accordance with Major League
Baseball rules, which the league discovered two years after the
fact and for which Toronto will be fined. They signed a side letter
to the contract and never filed it with the American League office
or the Players Association, which breaks the rules of the
collective bargaining agreement. The letter, kept secret for two
years but reported recently in the New York Times, incredibly gave
Clemens the right to leave Toronto after any of the four years on
his contract; the right to request a trade at any point; the right
to approve the team to which he is traded; and the right to be
traded to the Houston Astros if the Hendricks brothers purchased
the team, which was for sale at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The most embarrassing part for baseball is that Paul Beeston,
now the No. 2 man in the game under commissioner Bud Selig, made
the deal with the Hendricks brothers. Beeston was running the Blue
Jays then and is a close friend of Randy Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have asked the league to investigate the matter
fully, and they should ask the league to determine whether the Blue
Jays were tampering with Clemens while he was still with Boston. I
guarantee they were, and because they were, the Red Sox are
entitled to full compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Just this past Monday, the National Hockey League had the guts
to fine the St. Louis Blues $1.5 million and a first-round draft
choice for tampering with defenseman Scott Stevens _ five years
ago. The Blues were making offers to Stevens while he was still
playing for the Devils, and Stevens was forced to stay in New
Jersey when the Devils matched the offer. Only recently did someone
blow the whistle, and the evidence was found in the St. Louis
files.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of shredders are working full-time around the league
this week,'' said Bruins president Harry Sinden. ``Stuff like that
has been going on for years. We would never become part of it, and
I told (assistant general manager) Mike O'Connell not to get
involved in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Selig should do is make Beeston and Blue Jays GM
Gord Ash take a lie detector test about the Clemens contract.
Second, Toronto should be forced to produce every telephone record
for the summer of 1996, the months immediately before Clemens
signed with Toronto _ including the home phone records of Beeston
and Ash.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of '96, Clemens had said he owed everything he had
to the Red Sox and no one had treated him better than club CEO John
Harrington. Clemens had assured the Red Sox that he would talk with
them about a new contract when the season was over.
</P>
<P>
   However, the odor started to surface in the last week Clemens
was in a Boston uniform. He took his name plate off his locker,
cleaned out his locker, and announced he was not going to pitch the
final game of the season, as scheduled. Common sense tells you that
no player does that unless he knows he has a deal somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the most telling part. After several teams,
including the Blue Jays, met with the Hendricks brothers in
Houston, they refused to meet with Harrington to get a Boston offer
and shortly thereafter announced Clemens was going to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Clemens group knew there was no way Boston would agree to
the illegal side letter that would allow Clemens an out after every
season. Therefore, the letter gave the Blue Jays an unfair
advantage over the Red Sox, and only a fool would think that Randy
Hendricks and Beeston did not talk about Clemens going to Toronto
while he was still playing with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And that is tampering.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Boston should be compensated in full for whatever
Selig determines is the value of a player who has had two of the
greatest seasons of any pitcher ever since joining Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Clemens contract should be voided. Toronto should be fined.
Beeston and Ash should be fined. The Hendricks brothers should be
decertified as agents by Major League Baseball and forced to give
up whatever compensation they got for doing the illegal Clemens
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball will try to duck this responsibility
because it is so embarrassing. It will say that Clemens was a free
agent, and therefore, Boston should not get compensation. It will
try not to have Beeston and Ash undergo a lie detector test
administered by an independent company and will try to avoid
pursuing the telephone records.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox should keep pressing and go to court, if
necessary, to subpoena the Toronto records and get depositions from
those involved. This sleazy stuff has gone on for years in all
major league sports, and this would be a great way to scare some
teams from doing it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet the shredders are working in Toronto this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's have some experts dissect the two NFL playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   First up, San Francisco at Atlanta, through the eyes of Redskins
coach Norv Turner: ``I like Atlanta a lot as a team. They have a
good group of players. On offense, they can run the ball well with
(Jamal) Anderson, and I think that is important against San
Francisco. You want to control the ball and keep it away from Steve
Young and those three wide receivers (Jerry Rice, Terrell Owens,
J.J. Stokes) because they can move it on anyone. I'm really
impressed by the job Atlanta's two wideouts, Tony Martin and
(Terance) Mathis, have done. They give the team great speed on the
outside. When Chris Chandler has been healthy, their offense has
been very good. He is a very effective play-action passer and is
not afraid to make the big play. They have the right ingredients to
beat San Francisco. It's going to be very difficult for San
Francisco to beat them in the (Georgia) Dome and on AstroTurf. The
Niners like it much better outdoors and on turf. And Atlanta can
pressure the passer better than most people think. It's going to be
a close game, but if Atlanta plays their game, I like their
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Second up, Miami at Denver, analyzed by an NFL head coach who
requested anonymity: ``Miami's defense has really been hurt with
the loss of (Jason) Taylor and (Tim) Bowens. Miami's strength is on
defense. Bowens provided a great push in the middle. They have
taken away other teams' run game with his penetration. Taylor is
their best pass guy and best (play) chaser. Both of those guys
played well when they beat Denver in Miami a couple of weeks ago,
and now they are out of the lineup. Denver will throw a lot of
defensive looks at (Dan) Marino. They'll give him different types
of rushes to bother his timing. Miami is throwing the ball more in
the last month than they did during the season. (Running back)
Lamar Thomas has played big. He had three touchdown catches when
they beat the Broncos down there. The key to the game for Miami
will be to stop the Denver running game. That's how they beat them
in Miami. They made Denver play one-dimensional, and that usually
doesn't happen. Denver usually doesn't go away from the run, but
they did in that game. If Denver comes out running the ball well,
then Miami will have a hard time staying in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumors coming out of the locker room in
Foxborough forecasting different scenarios for the coaches. One
claimed that Pete Carroll met with some of his assistants and said
he will be back with the Patriots and they will be with him. Others
say some of the assistants have been told to start looking for
jobs. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle _ Carroll
expects to be back and to have a say concerning his staff. However,
none of the assistants have been told they will be back.
</P>
<P>
   How pathetic is it to call players into the front office to rat
out the coaching staff? This might be a first in pro football
history. Why not let the assistant coaches evaluate the job of the
front office the last couple of years in drafting players and
signing free agents?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red Auerbach doesn't think the NBA players need a month to get
ready for the belated season. ``If the player has stayed within 5
pounds of his playing weight, he should be ready to go in a week,''
says Auerbach. ``That's all it takes. One week of playing
five-on-five basketball. You can lift all the weights you want, run
all you want. But you have to play five-on-five basketball for a
week to get up to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   One final offering from Red, to show he hasn't lost his
fastball: ``Michael Jordan is the greatest player to ever play the
game. No question. But I'm getting sick of all this bull about
whether he is going to play. Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' move to Hartford is not on the owners' agenda at
the Super Bowl, despite speculation. The owners will meet the
Thursday before the game in Miami and will probably vote on the
sale of the Washington Redskins. We hear that the NFL is very
concerned about the federal lawsuit Ralph Nader will take in an
effort to prevent the Hartford stadium deal. We are told that the
revised legislation in Connecticut exempts 18 state laws on the
stadium project. Like to see them try to pull that one off in
Massachusetts. Is there an attorney general in Connecticut?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Know the answer? According to the NFL, only two coaches ever
have won division titles with three teams. Bill Parcells (Giants,
Patriots, Jets) is one. The other will be named next Saturday.

<P>
   Despite an unsettled global economy, lower corporate profits and
a new round of layoffs, the U.S. economy keeps creating jobs at an
astonishing pace.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the number of workers on U.S. payrolls grew by
378,000, the biggest gain in more than a year, the Labor Department
reported Friday. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.3 percent,
matching last April's 28-year low. The unemployment rate for all of
1998 was 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other than during 1969, the height of the Vietnam War, the last
time unemployment was this low for any significant period was 1957,
when the first baby boomers were in fifth grade and Dwight
Eisenhower was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some of December's increase was helped by balmy weather in the
North and East, which postponed the construction layoffs usual for
that time of year. Further, a few statistical flukes probably
inflated the figures a bit. But signs of strength were impressive
and widespread, reflecting robust spending by consumers and
homebuyers who account for nearly three-fourths of economic
activity.
</P>

   ``If the economy is an eight-cylinder car, it's running on
nine,' said David Blitzer, chief economist at the Standard &AMP; Poors
Corp. ``A little may be special factors like weather, but there's a
lot of strength there.''
</P>
<P>
   The job market's strength, which shows that the widely
anticipated economic slowdown has yet to happen, caught forecasters
off guard. After a wave of corporate layoff announcements and a
surge in first-time claims for unemployment insurance in the last
half of December, economists had expected job growth to weaken and
unemployment to edge up. Even President Clinton's chief economic
adviser, Janet Yellin, admitted she is amazed by the economy's
momentum. ``I'm surprised. It's great. It's just extraordinary,''
she said. ``There's no obvious reason we can't continue down this
path.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, speaking in Detroit, took credit for the
economy's performance and for the 93-month old expansion, now the
longest in peacetime though still more than a year shy of the
record set by the 1960s expansion. Clinton called this a time ``of
American renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors celebrated with a market rally that pushed the
Dow Jones average and other key measures to records.

<P>
   The December jobs report capped a year in which, contrary to
predictions, net job growth was nearly 3 million, unemployment
hovered between 4.3 and 4.5 percent, wage gains adjusted for
inflation were the best in a generation, and productivity growth
picked up instead of slowing as it usually does as economic
expansions age.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some of the most disadvantaged workers have enjoyed
substantial job and pay gains in the past two years. In December,
for example, while the jobless rate for most major demographic
groups was largely unchanged, the unemployment rates for black
workers and teen-agers, typically multiples of the white and adult
rates, dropped sharply. ``We're finally back to the kind of tide
that lifts all boats,'' said Dr. Yellin.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are still predicting a sharp slowdown in 1999,
starting in the current quarter, although at least one admitted
Friday that there is scant evidence so far. Along with recent data
showing that retail sales, homebuying and car purchases remained
strong through year-end, Friday's jobs report suggests that the
economy may have been expanding at a 4 percent annual rate in the
final quarter of 1998, which is considered exceptionally strong.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a private
research organization, said, ``We're going into 1999 with
fundamentals better than in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for expecting some moderation of growth,
though. Much of the rest of the world is either in recession or
slowing down. Consumers have been spending much of their income at
an unsustainable rate. Homebuying is at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists say job growth would have to fall below the
rate of 100,000 or so a month for unemployment to start rising.
</P>
<P>
   Factory employment, which fell during most of last year,
declined by another 13,000 jobs. But that's a fraction of the
losses in recent months. Factory employment has fallen by 272,000
jobs since last March, as recessions in Asia and Latin America have
hurt U.S. exports. Despite record car sales, employment in Detroit
is down 12,000 from a year ago. On the other hand, manufacturers of
anything related to the housing market _ from bricks and glass to
furniture and hardware _ continue to thrive and did lots hiring
last month, as they've done all year.
</P>
<P>
   Weather was partly responsible for construction jobs surging by
104,000 last month, the biggest monthly gain since February 1984.
Most of the gains were in outdoor work like highway construction
and roofing as contractors were able to continue working longer
than usual. But construction hiring has been strong all year. With
state treasuries bulging and mortgage rates down to the lowest
level in 30 years, public works and housing are both booming.
</P>
<P>
   The main engine of job growth remained the service economy _
everything from fast food chains to schools _ which added 290,000
jobs. Business services like public relations, consulting and
computing did extensive hiring. Temporary help firms saw the
biggest jump in headcounts since August. With companies and
government agencies scrambling to fix their year 2000
computer-clock problems, hiring by computer services firms was
brisk; jobs in that industry swelled by more than 13 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in the retail industry rose by 53,000 in December, bringing
total job gains for the year to nearly one half million.
Restaurants added 33,000 workers. Department stores hired a lot of
extra holiday help. A surge in renovation, building material and
garden supply stores added 9,000 jobs, the biggest increase of the
year. Most services related to the building business expanded
payrolls last year.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for workers is fattening paychecks. Hourly earnings
jumped 5 cents, to $12.98. That is a 3.8 percent gain for the past
year, about the same as in each of the two previous years. Pay is
growing fastest in financial services, mining, services and retail
trade, where workers are in especially short supply.

COLOMBIAN REBEL CHIEF SAYS THREATS MADE HIM MISS TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ The commander of the largest
rebel force in Colombia sought out government officials and foreign
dignitaries here Friday, saying that he was committed to seeing
talks progress to end the civil war. He said he was absent from a
ceremony on Thursday to start the effort because of death threats.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Manuel Marulanda, who has been living in the
mountains since 1949, appeared unexpectedly Friday morning outside
town, Deputy Labor Minister Fabio Palacio said.
</P>
<P>
   Palacio said he and the chief of the security detail for
President Andres Pastrana were on their way at 6 a.m. to obtain
security equipment when Marulanda showed up to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Palacio recounted, said that his group had
information that sharpshooters would make an attempt on his life
and that he mixed in the crowd that watched the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Palacio quoted Marulanda as describing the peace talks as ``a
long road, but a positive one for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He also said,'' Palacio recalled, ``the most important thing
that happened yesterday was the initiation of a process of peace
and that that was more important than his appearance and that there
would be other opportunities for him to meet the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure to attend what Pastrana called ``an appointment with
history'' had initially appeared as a humiliation of the new
president, who is staking his career on forging peace with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana met Marulanda before taking office in August and
pledged to remove security forces from an area twice the size of El
Salvador to allow a dialogue with the rebels. The festivities on
Thursday were supposed to begin talks to build a peace with the
rebels, who have been battling government forces for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla's actions away from the limelight appeared geared
toward reversing any ill will created by Marulanda's absence.
Palacio said that Marulanda had met negotiators designated by the
government for talks scheduled to begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The commander also hastened to meet invited foreign delegates on
Thursday night and Friday morning. A Nicaraguan legislator, Jacinto
Suarez, said Marulanda had spoken to delegations from Costa Rica,
Italy, Mexico, Nicaragua and other countries, stressing his desire
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question everybody asked was why he didn't come, and
he said that they had intelligence that there would be an attempt
on his life,'' Suarez said. ``He said they're engaged in this
process and they're not asking for the participation of anybody
else for the moment. That this is a process that Colombians have to
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is trying to end the carnage that has claimed 35,000
lives in 10 years. The fighting has been between the government,
paramilitary forces that defend landowners, who frequently enjoy
complicity of the army, and leftist guerrillas. The war, fought
largely through attacks on civilian populations, has displaced more
than 1.2 million farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups attribute 70 percent of the political
killings in Colombia to the paramilitary groups, but all sides have
been implicated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rebels have made bold incursions into areas widely
considered to be a stronghold of right-wing paramilitary forces,
including one in Nudo de Paramillo that led to false reports that
the rebels had killed the top paramilitary leader, Carlos Castano.
</P>
<P>
   Castano contacted a radio station in Medellin this week to
promise revenge, suggesting that the rebels may have taken the
death threats especially seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a unilateral cease-fire that the paramilitary chief
had declared to demonstrate his will for peace expired, oddly, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Palacio said the top rebel had been in a house 10 minutes from
the town square on Thursday. Palacio told a few reporters that two
sharpshooters were arrested minutes before he was to appear
alongside Pastrana.

EDITORIAL: RECOMPENSE FOR BLACK FARMERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Jan. 9: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by
black farmers against the U. S. Department of Agriculture for
racial discrimination in farm loans probably will not curb the
decline of independent black farmers, who now account for only 1
percent of the farming force. But it provides some redress to many
who have had their livelihoods destroyed by illegal practices.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 lawsuit was filed on behalf of more than 1,000 black
farmers. Under the settlement, farmers who can produce some
evidence that they suffered discrimination in the loan programs
between 1981 and 1997 would receive $50,000 tax-free and be
forgiven their federal farm debts. Those who can document with
precision that they suffered greater financial harm can get a
higher recovery from an arbitrator. Others can continue their
suits.
</P>
<P>
   The loan programs, which are supposed to aid farmers who fail to
get commercial bank loans, were administered by local county
committees. In some Southern states, the disparity in loans to
whites and blacks was large. It often took three times longer to
process an application from a black farmer than from a white
farmer. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has attacked this
shameful history by, among other things, taking away the power of
local committees to approve loans.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan leaders in Congress helped make restitution to the
farmers possible by waiving the two-year federal statute of
limitations that would have barred many from recovering in court.
The settlement will not make whole those who already have lost
their farms, but it will give desperately needed help to those
still hanging on.

SOLAR-POWER DEMAND RISES ON Y2K FEARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Monday, Jan. 11) 
(Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By ERIC HANSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Food, water and bullets are not the only things being
bought by people who fear that the Y2K phenomenon will bring a
societal meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Some are also buying solar-powered electrical systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to sell one or two per month for homes. Now we are
selling four or five a week and the customers are telling us it is
because of Y2K,'' said Marshall Blalock Jr., president of Southwest
Photovoltaic Systems of Tomball, a city of 7,000 about 20 miles
northwest of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the `solar hippies' that were buying them. Now
it's just normal people,'' Blalock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem stems from a computer programming practice begun
more than 30 years ago. To save computing capacity, programmers
used the last two digits to designate each year. For example, 1978
was written ``78.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of next year, many fear that computers will see
``00'' and interpret it as 1900 _ causing shutdowns or malfunctions
that will lead to a general breakdown in communication,
transportation, general infrastructure and ultimately society.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating such a crisis, nervous people across the country
have begun stockpiling food, water, clothing, fuel, medicine and
other essentials. Advice on what to stock is readily available on
hundreds of Internet sites offering advice on everything from
beekeeping to water purification.
</P>
<P>
   Government and industry officials discount the problem, saying
many operations performed by computers are not related to time and
year and that any glitches that arise will cause only minor
inconveniences.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the anxiety, the President's Council on Year 2000 has
set up a toll-free line providing information on how computers,
small businesses, telephones and other products and services will
be affected by the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The information on the line, 1-888-USA-4-Y2K, comes from
government agencies, companies and industry groups reporting on
what measures they are taking to prepare for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Industries, parent company of Houston Lighting and
Power, has been working on the problem since May 1997 and plans to
spend $35 million to $40 million on it, said spokeswoman Leticia
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said HL&AMP;P has examined all computer programs and systems
and made changes or replacement where needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 priority is to ensure that the production and
delivery of energy is uninterrupted,'' she said. ``We feel
confident that we are going to deal with this in an appropriate
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said the company continuously plans for emergencies,
including coal and gas stockpiling and ensuring enough HL&AMP;P
employees are available to handle any situation.
</P>
<P>
   She said there have been instances in the past where
weather-related outages caused computers to be shut down and
technicians operated the power system manually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been successful at it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The HL&AMP;P Web site _ www.hlp.com _ has a section on Y2K, which
notes that Jan. 1, 2000, falls on a Saturday, when electrical
demand is lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electrical system will have excess generating capacity
during the millennium date change to help balance any possible
problem. Also, electric systems and power delivery do not rely
heavily on computerized technology or digital controls,'' the site
says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such precautions, many people are taking no chances on
having a reliable power source. Thus, the mini-boom in solar
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Blalock said solar cells can generate enough power for a
five-bedroom house, and systems cost from $5,000 to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just depends on the (electrical) load you want to have,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The systems are composed of solar panels that convert sunlight
into electricity and feed the current into a controller, which
sends it to an inverter where it is converted from direct current
to alternating current for household use.
</P>
<P>
   Any surplus generated power is stored in batteries that supply
current for night use and times of heavy cloud cover.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Photovoltaic's marketing manager Jim Gregory said the
company began noticing the trend about three months ago. He said
the new customers tell them they fear that the Y2K bug will not
only cause food shortages, but also a loss of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hoping that it won't happen but want to be ready just
in case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory said the company has not installed any solar power
systems in traditional residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have gone in houses where people have one or two
acres and big lots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said many solar units have been installed in weekend cabins
and mobile homes across the Texas countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are usually set up to power a refrigerator, lights, fans
and a water well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has not been limited to Texas, according to Richard
Curry, editor of Photovoltaic Insider's Report.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said sales figures are unavailable but every person in the
industry he has talked to has reported increases in sales of the
systems for home use.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they are attributing those increases to Y2K,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gregory believes the trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be self-sufficient. They could go out and get a
generator but you have to feed it fuel. With solar there is no
fuel, just the sun.''

FIRST CONTRACT AWARDED FOR TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY OVERHAUL
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City Transit has awarded an $82.8 million
contract for the first phase of a Times Square subway station
renovation project to a consortium of companies headed by Slattery
Skanska Inc., a Swedish-owned construction company.
</P>
<P>
   The award was approved in December by the board of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent of New York City
Transit. It is part of the $180 million project to rebuild the
entire Times Square station, the city's largest subway hub, where
500,000 people converge on eight subway lines every day.
</P>
<P>
   Al O'Leary, a New York City Transit spokesman, said work on the
first phase of the project would begin in the spring and was
scheduled to be completed by the end of 2002. The transit agency
has not disclosed when it expects to complete the whole project.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York City Transit documents describing the
competitive bidding process that led to its selection of Slattery
Skanska, 25 construction companies expressed interest in the job,
and 5 were asked to submit detailed bids.
</P>
<P>
   Two bidders were selected as finalists, including A.J. Pegno
Inc., a New York City firm that last year oversaw the rebuilding of
the Lenox Avenue subway line between 110th and 116th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   In that project, A.J. Pegno won widespread praise _ and a bonus
from the transit agency _ for finishing its work ahead of schedule
and under budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents said Slattery Skanska had been selected for
the Times Square project because its bid was $2.7 million below
A.J. Pegno's, and because Slattery Skanska had suggested ``an
innovative approach'' in which it would do much of its work during
the day, working around the crowds of subway riders. A.J. Pegno had
insisted on doing almost all of its work at night, the documents
said, which would have pushed back the completion date.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is owned by Skanska Ltd., based in Stockholm,
through its United States subsidiary, Skanska U.S.A., the winning
consortium includes Slattery Associates, which is based in Queens
and has considerable experience with large construction projects
for the MTA. The other member of the consortium is Robert Gottlieb,
a New York City builder.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents, the first phase of the Times Square
project is to include rebuilding and enlarging the mezzanine that
stretches from 41st Street to 42nd Street under Seventh Avenue;
reconstructing the platforms for the Seventh Avenue trains (the
Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 9 lines) and the Broadway trains (the N and R
lines); installing four elevators suitable for people with
disabilities, and rebuilding floors, stairs and ceilings throughout
the station.
</P>
<P>
   Other work, including renovation of the platforms for the Times
Square shuttle and the No. 7 train, is to be completed during the
second phase of the project, transit officials said.

SENATE ACCEPTS COMPROMISE ON IMPEACHMENT RULES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending a critical impasse, the Senate Friday agreed
during a remarkable, closed-door session to temporarily forsake
partisan politics and adopt a blueprint for President Clinton's
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute agreement _ inspired by what Senator Edward M.
Kennedy portrayed as ``a certain magic'' in the Old Senate Chamber
where the nation's great orators once debated _ calls for the trial
to begin next Wednesday and puts off for at least two weeks a vote
on whether Clinton's accusers or his lawyers can call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The pact also cleared the way for the Senate sergeant-at-arms,
James Ziglar, to serve Clinton a summons Friday &UR;  &LR; night formally
notifying him of the trial. Clinton was not in the White House when
the summons arrived.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers praised the agreement, but vowed to wage ``a
vigorous, successful, and complete defense'' on Clinton's behalf.
``We are optimistic that senators, once they see and hear this
defense, will conclude the articles do not justify or warrant
conviction or removal from office,'' said Gregory B. Craig, a White
House special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 House Republicans who will serve as managers, or
prosecutors, in the trial expressed guarded optimism that the
Senate will permit them to present as many as 15 witnesses against
Clinton. Representative Henry J. Hyde, the lead manager as chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, said the team would present ``a
compelling case'' against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate unanimously approved the pact, ending days of
wrangling. The agreement narrowly averted the threat of having the
historic proceedings begin amid partisan rancor, and appears to
prevent the process from turning into a monthslong ordeal
</P>
<P>
   Under the blueprint, the trial could end late this month or
early in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, called the deal a
``magnificent conclusion'' to the rare, private session involving
100 senators who often yield little ground in defending their
diverse beliefs. Lott called the meeting after struggling
unsuccessfully to resolve the procedural issues since the House
approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we have acted in the very best tradition of the
Senate,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which Kennedy helped to forge as time was about
to expire in the two-hour meeting, both parties said they made
concessions to promote fairness and protect the dignity of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers and Clinton's lawyers have until 5 p.m. on
Monday to file any pretrial motions, which the Senate will consider
on Wednesday. The pact then calls for the House managers to present
their case over three days, beginning Thursday. Clinton's lawyers
will be given three days for a rebuttal, starting Jan. 19. The
Senate would then have two days to pose questions to both sides
through the presiding officer, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   In a boon to Clinton's lawyers, the House managers will be
restricted during their three-day presentation to evidence that was
made public during the House impeachment process. The House team
has indicated it might try to introduce additional allegations
against Clinton that were not raised in the House proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, the managers will be barred from calling
witnesses or presenting new evidence unless the Senate approves the
requests after the two-day question period.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will then vote on a motion to dismiss the impeachment
articles before the votes on witnesses or additional evidence. If
the motion to dismiss the charges passes, the trial would end, and
the Senate could move to censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But if the motion fails, and senators decided to call witnesses,
the trial could stretch out for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the agreement permits the Senate ``to respond the
way it should to one of the great challenges it has faced in this
country's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who is one of
the chamber's most gifted orators, began the session with a
30-minute speech invoking the memories of some of the famous
statesmen who held forth in the chamber in the buildup to the Civil
War: Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said the House had fallen into ``the black pit of partisan
self-indulgence'' in its impeachment process. ``I ask everyone here
who might harbor such feelings to abandon any thought of
mean-spirited, destructive, vengeful, partisan warfare,'' Byrd
said, according to a transcript released later by his office.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd also told a parable from the Canterbury Tales ``about each
side killing each other and nobody winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal emerged soon after Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas
Republican, invoked Daniel Webster, who was a Massachusetts senator
with New Hampshire roots, saying, ``I stand not as a partisan, not
as a New Englander, but as a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm argued that the differences were minimal between the first
stages of competing Republican and Democratic plans for the trial.
Kennedy, one of Gramm's most ardent political foes, rose to support
him. ``The reference to Daniel Webster kind of caught me a little
bit,'' Kennedy said he told his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said he
told Gramm: ``Phil, you mentioned Daniel Webster, and Ted got all
dewey-eyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry said the agreement sprang from ``a sense
of urgency that the nation is watching and we have a responsibility
to prove that the Senate can fulfill its duties well.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Gramm and Kennedy had agreed, Lott quickly seized on the
unlikely alliance, declared the ``Gramm-Kennedy plan'' viable and
cut off the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which could spare the GOP majority a backlash
from presiding over partisan proceedings, also gives the White
House what it most wanted: The opportunity to file a motion to
dismiss the charges before witnesses are called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fair deal,'' said former White House special counsel
Lanny Davis, who is informally advising the president's defense
team.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faces impeachment charges that he committed perjury and
obstructed justice in trying to cover up an affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling among White House lawyers is that they can win the
legal arguments, and raise enough doubt that Clinton committed the
offenses to persuade senators to dismiss the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly today for the first time have confidence that this
is not going to be a party-line judgment,'' Davis said. ``I have
confidence that they will listen to the evidence, and they will
suddenly realize this is an incredibly weak case.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kennedy gave no indication he was working in concert
with the White House, it is no secret that he is a key supporter of
Clinton and close friend of Gregory Craig, who was Kennedy's
foreign policy adviser from 1984 to 1988. In 1991, Craig, serving
as a defense lawyer, prepped Kennedy for his testimony in the Palm
Beach, Fla., rape trial of the senator's nephew, William Kennedy
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy's attempt to forge the agrement did not end with the
closed-door session. He spent several more hours negotiating with
Gramm and two other senators whose original proposal the deal was
modeled after: Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, and
Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Kennedy said, Gramm insisted the House managers
should be permitted to present new evidence during their opening
presentation. ``He said, `You can't muzzle the House,' '' Kennedy
quoted Gramm as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy told Gramm the initial agreement precluded the
introduction of new allegations. ``That's not the way we're going
to deal with it,'' he said, and then walked out of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy returned with a new draft proposal, Gramm said,
``This doesn't look right,'' according to Kennedy. ``So we had
Daschle and Lott come in and work it out,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm declined to discuss details of the negotiations. But he
said he was proud to take part in resolving the impasse.

HIGH-RISE FIRE SURVIVORS URGE SPRINKLER MANDATE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Survivors of a deadly high-rise fire in Manhattan and
the widow of a fallen firefighter pleaded with City Council members
Friday to require sprinklers in all high-rise apartment buildings,
but city officials appeared to be far from a consensus on the most
far-reaching fire safety proposals under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   With tears in their eyes and their voices choking, survivors of
the Dec. 23 fire on the Upper West Side, which killed four people,
spoke at a Council hearing about the horror they endured and urged
the adoption of broad new rules for residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complete sense of panic, the fear I felt at that moment is
impossible to describe,'' said one of the survivors, Priscilla
Lima, recalling how she and her visiting parents were trapped in a
smoke-filled hallway and stairwell during the fire at Park South
Tower on West 60th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But real estate developers, while careful to endorse the need
for greater fire safety, contended that requiring sprinklers would
be too expensive and could inhibit the development of new housing
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   If the city requires sprinklers in new residential buildings, it
should offset the cost with tax breaks, subsidies or concessions in
zoning and construction codes, developers said. ``I'm not opposed
to sprinklers, and it's very hard to argue against safety,'' said
one developer, Joshua Muss. But he warned that such a requirement
would stall the construction of moderate-income housing outside
Manhattan unless zoning rules were changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Council hearing came after two high-rise apartment fires
last month _ the Manhattan blaze and another in Brooklyn on Dec. 18
that left three city firefighters dead.
</P>
<P>
   But when the daylong hearing ended, it was far from clear
whether city officials would agree to require sprinklers for all
existing apartment buildings, as was urged by the survivors, safety
experts, sprinkler company representatives and others who
testified. Most other major cities have such a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Council appear to have already
agreed on two changes: requiring sprinklers for new residential
buildings and requiring the installation of emergency public
address systems for all high-rises, new and existing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this issue moving fast,'' said Walter McCaffrey, a
Queens Democrat who has taken a leading position on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But the much larger issue of requiring sprinklers for existing
buildings, a proposal that developers and landlords have opposed as
needless and costly, remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a little rough sledding for retrofitting,''
said the chairman of the Council's Housing and Buildings Committee,
Archie Spigner, a Queens Democrat who presided over the hearing.
``The discussion has just begun, but it has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many speakers pushing for sprinkler requirements was
Vina Drennan, a board member of the National Fallen Firefighters
Committee and the widow of a city firefighter who was killed in a
1994 fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge anyone who says, `We cannot afford a sprinkler
system law' to visit the burn unit'' at New York Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center, where her husband, John Drennan, died, she said.
``We can change this. I hope you have the courage to stand up to
the forces that have blocked sprinklers in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Real Estate Board of New York said it was
committed to ``the highest level of life and fire safety'' for
apartment residents. But it added, ``If we are changing our codes
to conform to the rest of the country with respect to sprinklering
new construction, then it is essential to allow the types of
construction and materials used in the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Fire Department officials proposed requiring
sprinklers in the hallways and apartments of all new high-rise
buildings. In a surprise move, however, they said the regulations
should cover all new residential construction, including one- and
two-family houses. That would affect the few thousand new houses
built in New York City in a typical year.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials also suggested installing public address systems
that could be used to alert and direct residents in case of a fire
or other emergency. Under their proposal, the speaker systems would
be required for all high-rises, new and existing, over six stories
high.
</P>
<P>
   The cost remains the key stumbling block to installing
sprinklers, and the figures are in dispute. Dan Margulies, director
of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord group,
estimated that citywide installation would cost billions of
dollars. ``Who is going to finance it?'' he asked. ``Can tenants
afford to pay $50-per-month rent increases? We don't believe that
sprinklers are a magic bullet, or that codes should be haphazardly
amended based on the headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey said he was intrigued by city estimates of $839 to
install sprinklers in the typical new apartment and $1,376 to do so
in an existing apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The city chapter of a firefighters' union, the Uniformed Fire
Officers Association, endorsed sprinklers for all residential and
commercial buildings. The fire chief of Jacksonville, Fla., Ray
Alfred, said retrofitting existing buildings to include sprinklers
``is going to have to be done sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Other national experts testified that Maryland is requiring
sprinklers in all new buildings and that Florida is requiring them
for all existing buildings, a requirement that will be phased in
over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York City lags behind'' the rest of the country, said
Russell Fleming, a spokesman for the National Fire Sprinkler
Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions at the hearing included requiring modern alarm
systems that monitor sprinklers to insure that they are working
properly and make automated announcements to residents in
emergencies before firefighters arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Holtzman, a former city comptroller and congresswoman,
spoke on behalf of the Firecom alarm company, based in New York.
She said the city's regulations are more stringent for commercial
buildings than they are for residences. ``There is no good reason
that New Yorkers should not be as safe in their homes as they are
when they go to work,'' she said. ``There is no good reason for
tourists who visit New York to have the benefit of stronger
fire-protection measures than people who live in this great city.''

CHARLES F. ADAMS, CHAIRMAN   AND PRESIDENT OF AN ARMS MAKER ,  DIES
AT 88 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Francis Adams, a former president and chairman of
Raytheon, the military and commercial electronics manufacturer,
died Tuesday at his home in Dover, Mass. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Adams joined Raytheon Manufacturing Co. as executive vice
president in 1947 and became president the next year. He served as
chairman from 1960 to 1975, except for two years starting in 1962
when he returned to the president's job. After he retired as
chairman in 1975, Adams served as a director until December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure with the company, it grew from a manufacturer
of transistors and vacuum tubes used in radar into a maker of
missiles and radar and communications systems with military
applications.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Raytheon owned petrochemical, home appliance and
heating businesses, publishing and computer companies. Today,
Raytheon manufactures electronics and the Hawk and Patriot
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a direct descendant of both presidents John Adams and
John Quincy Adams, graduated from Harvard College in 1932. He also
attended the Harvard Business School. Starting in 1934, he worked
at Jackson &AMP; Curtis, a brokerage firm, and was named a partner in
1937.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was called to active duty in the Navy in 1940, where he
rose to the rank of commander and led destroyer escorts in the
Atlantic and Pacific. He continued to serve in the personnel bureau
of the Navy after World War II and left the service in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is survived by his wife, Beatrice, of Dover; three
children by his first wife, Margaret Stockton, who is deceased,
Abigail A. Manny of Brunswick, Me., Alison A. Hagan of Fairplay,
Colo., and Timothy Adams of Louisville, Colo.; a stepson, Giannotto
Penati of Washington, D.C.; nine grandchildren, and 13
great-grandchildren.

120 TWIN-ENGINED JETS UNDER CAUTION AFTER 3 HAVE TROUBLE IN FLIGHT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Brazil, Tex., Ohio, N.J., Ill., Minn., Fla., Mich.)   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three twin-engine jets have had an engine shut down
in flight in the last week, probably because a seal weakened by
cold let oil leak out, the Federal Aviation Administration said
Friday. The agency issued an emergency order requiring special
tests on about 120 planes with the engines any time the oil
temperature is below 32 degrees, and prohibiting flight if
excessive leaks occur.
</P>
<P>
   The order affects Embraer 145's, a new model of 50-seat regional
jet built in Brazil that is used heavily by American Eagle and
Continental Express. It also affects Cessna 750s, which are
business jets. All the planes use Allison turbofan engines.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said further orders might be needed as its investigation
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Express flies 38 EMB 145's, from its hubs in
Houston, Cleveland and Newark, N.J. On Tuesday the crew of one of
them, on a flight from Cleveland to Minneapolis, shut down an
engine and diverted to Grand Rapids, Mich., when a sensor in the
cockpit warned of low oil. On Thursday the same problem occurred on
an American Eagle flight from Chicago to Cleveland; it made an
unscheduled landing in Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the third incident could not be determined, but the
FAA said all three planes landed safely. Marty Heires, a spokesman
at American, said the airline had begun on Thursday to keep its 20
EMB-145's indoors at night, or have mechanics start the engines
every few hours during the night. Ned Walker, a spokesman for
Continental, said his airline was performing the checks of the oil
level every morning.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first winter that American has flown the planes.
Continental used them last winter, but this winter has been much
colder in places Continental flies, especially in the Midwest. The
airlines have been buying jets like the EMB-145 for routes where
they previously used turboprop planes, partly because of customer
perceptions that the propeller planes were less reliable,
especially in cold weather, when they are prone to accumulate ice
in flight.
</P>
<P>
   A switchboard operator at Embraer's headquarters in Sao Jose dos
Campos, Brazil, said that no one was in the office there; company
representatives in a sales office in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., did not
return phone messages.

SPY, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OPPOSED TO REDUCTION OF POLLARD
SENTENCE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite 2nd, 3rd, 4th and final grafs.)   By DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement and intelligence officials said
Friday that they remain adamantly opposed to shortening the life
sentence of Jonathan Pollard, a former Navy intelligence analyst
convicted of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the White House asked the agencies to submit their
recommendations on whether Pollard should be granted clemency after
demands for his release were made by Israel in October at the
Middle East peace negotiations in Wye, Md. According to these
officials, the FBI, the CIA and the Pentagon will submit reports
next week arguing against any leniency.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition to reducing Pollard's prison term, which has
never wavered during Clinton's presidency, may not end the debate
over the case, the officials said. The president has exclusive
power to grant clemency, and the officials said Clinton's aides
could seek to reduce Pollard's sentence or give him a release date
from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and the Justice Department are also to
submit their views, and officials said Clinton and his aides are
not likely to make a decision soon. The officials said that while
they agree that Pollard's crimes are ``reprehensible,'' as several
described them, not all are convinced that Pollard should never be
released.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies have until Monday to provide their evaluations to
Charles Ruff, the White House counsel. Last month the White House
sent letters to Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, asking for their
views on the Pollard case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have begun to receive recommendations from the president's
advisers,'' said David Leavy, a White House spokesman. ``The
president will review the information. He may want further
information. He may ask additional questions and will move forward
in a careful and timely manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy pressure from Israel and supporters of Pollard in
the United States, Clinton reviewed the case in 1993 and again in
1996. Each time, the president decided against clemency after
receiving recommendations from Cabinet officials and agencies
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the officials have long been on record as opposing
clemency for Pollard. During the peace talks in October, Tenet
bluntly told Clinton that he would resign if the president agreed
to turn over Pollard as part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the other U.S. intelligence agencies are known to be
strongly opposed to any consideration of leniency toward Pollard.
They have said in the past that his spying inflicted the gravest
damage to national security by revealing secret codes and
communications methods, endangering the ability of intelligence
officers to communicate and gather information in secret.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, conservatives have championed the release of Pollard
for years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has pressed
the administration for Pollard's release and the case became a
central issue in the peace talks. On the last of nine days of
negotiations, Netanyahu demanded Pollard's release in exchange for
his support for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton denied Netanyahu's demands, he did agree to
reconsider the case even though there was little likelihood that
any of the agencies involved would support a reduction in Pollard's
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was arrested in 1985 after spying for Israel for at
least 18 months. He turned over a huge quantity of classified
documents to the Israelis. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material Pollard sold to the Israelis involved
Soviet weapons systems, information that had been obtained at
enormous risk by spies working inside the former Soviet Union, who
were compromised as a result of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard says he was punished too severely, arguing that he
obtained information for an ally that Washington should have been
providing. But American officials said he betrayed vital secrets to
the Israelis, who, they said, had never fully cooperated with
investigators or even returned all of the documents Pollard
supplied to them.

IN BOW TO REALITY, NBA ALLOWS TALKS WITH AGENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fearing a mad scramble for free agents three weeks before the
season is scheduled to begin, the National Basketball Association
agreed Friday to permit teams to negotiate with player agents
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   From Michael Jordan to Zan Tabak, the decision opens the
floodgates for nearly 200 players to negotiate new contracts
through their agents. No deals can be signed until the new
collective bargaining agreement is set in writing sometime next
week. And the moratorium for players having contact with teams
remains in effect until training camps are scheduled to begin Jan.
18.
</P>
<P>
   But the cloak-and-dagger methods of many agents and team
executives will end this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with the union, and aware that talks were
already secretly going on after Wednesday's settlement that saved
the season, the league sent memorandums to the 29 teams about 5
p.m. Friday advising them that negotiations could proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was obviously such pent-up demand that it wasn't worth
fighting about,'' one league official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has yet to decide whether he will retire, but a
free-agent class that includes Antonio McDyess, Scottie Pippen,
Dennis Rodman, Damon Stoudamire and Jayson Williams is about to
experience the NBA's version of Job Fair '99, replete with the
usual inducements and recruiting tactics from prospective
employers.
</P>
<P>
   One agent, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Nets
were keenly interested in acquiring McDyess, the skywalking forward
whose youth and athleticism make him perhaps the No. 1 commodity.
Phoenix and Denver, teams McDyess has played for, were also in the
bidding, as was Houston. The Nets are planning to keep Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent, said there was a possibility his
client would return to the Chicago Bulls when the 50-game,
lockout-delayed season is scheduled to open Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie loves Chicago, loves the team and so, if we can work a
deal out that works for Scottie, I think he would like to stay
there,'' Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, Orlando Magic and Rockets have only four players
apiece under contract, while the Suns have five.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Kasten, the Atlanta Hawks president, told The Associated
Press that he was suspicious that other teams were getting a jump
on negotiations in violation of the rules. He said he had spoken
with Commissioner David Stern about the situation and vowed to turn
in any team that breaks the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that teams and players were secretly negotiating for the
past 48 hours, the league deemed the moratorium as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got lesser guys that I need to get into camps,'' said
Eric Rudolph, an agent who represents the free agents Johnny
Newman, Kebu Stewart and Shawnelle Scott. ``It just makes sense to
lift the moratorium. I'd like to be able to negotiate. So now, when
the 18th comes, it's like a formality of cutting their deals. A lot
of GMs were pushing hard for it for no other reason than they
wanted to find out if a certain player was interested in their
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another agent, on condition of anonymity: ``Whether they
lifted it or not, I'm just telling you we've been going about
business. So have a lot of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden State is said to be trying hard to trade Latrell
Sprewell, with Miami and San Antonio the most interested. The
controversial All-Star guard has not played since November 1997
after choking and punching his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, and
subsequently being suspended for the remainder of last season. His
contract was originally terminated as well, but an arbitrator
sharply reduced the penalty and allowed Sprewell to return to
Golden State contractually. The Warriors have been trying to deal
him since.
</P>
<P>
   The season is expected to start in four weeks, and the playoffs
could end in late June or early July. Leading up to that date, the
face of the league may change considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte is in the most trouble regarding free agents, with
both centers Vlade Divac and Matt Geiger fielding offers from
several teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls remain the most intriguing subplot, with nine
players on the open market. The feeling among most team officials
is that if Jordan and Pippen somehow are retained, the club will
try to sign Rodman, Steve Kerr, Bill Wennington and Luc Longley to
attempt a run for a fourth consecutive title. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three decades ago, Congress, embarrassed by the disclosure that
155 wealthy Americans had paid no federal income taxes, enacted
legislation aimed at preventing the very rich from shielding their
wealth in tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that legislation, creating the alternative minimum tax,
is instead snaring a rapidly growing number of middle-class
taxpayers, forcing them to pay additional tax or to lose some of
their tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than two million taxpayers who will be subject this
year to the alternative minimum tax, or amT, about half have
incomes of $30,000 to $100,000. Some are single parents with jobs;
some are people making as little as $527 a week. Over all, the
number of people affected by the tax is expected to grow 26 percent
a year for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the wealthy will not be among them. Even with the
amT, the number of taxpayers making more than $200,000 who pay no
taxes has risen to more than 2,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
   How a 1969 law aimed at the tax-shy rich became a growing burden
on moderate earners illustrates how tax policy in Washington can be
a hall of mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republican congressmen favor eliminating the tax,
other lawmakers say such a move would be an expensive tax break for
the wealthy _ or at least would be perceived that way, and thus
would be politically unpalatable. And any overhaul of the system
would need to compensate for the $6.6 billion that individuals now
pay under the amT. &UR;  &LR; This year, such payments will account for
almost 1 percent of all individual income tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case of both Congress and the administration
agreeing that the tax doesn't make much sense, but not being able
to agree on doing anything about it,'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, an
economist with the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research
organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Steuerle was a Treasury Department tax official in 1986, when an
overhaul of the tax code set the stage for drawing the middle class
into the amT.
</P>
<P>
   In eliminating most tax shelters for the wealthy, Congress
decided to treat exemptions for children and deductions for medical
expenses just like special credits for investors in oil wells, if
they cut too deeply into a household's taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Congress decided that once these ``tax preferences'' exceeded
certain amounts _ $40,000 for a married couple, for example _
people would be moved out of the regular income tax and into the
alternative minimum tax. At the time, the threshold was high enough
to affect virtually no one but the rich. But it has since been
raised only once _ by 12.5 percent, to $45,000 for a married couple
_ while the cost of living has risen 43 percent. And so the limits
have sneaked up on growing numbers of taxpayers of more modest
means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew back then that it had problems that had to be
fixed,'' Steuerle recalled. ``They just said, `next year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But ``next year'' has never come _ and it is unlikely to arrive
in 1999, either. While tax policy experts have known for years that
the middle class would be drawn into the amT, few taxpayers have
been clamoring for change.
</P>
<P>
   Among those few, however, are David and Margaret Klaassen of
Marquette, Kan. Klaassen, a lawyer who lives in and works out of a
farmhouse, made $89,751.07 in 1997 and paid $5,989 in federal
income taxes. Four weeks ago, the Internal Revenue Service sent the
Klaassens a notice demanding $3,761 more under the alternative
minimum tax, including a penalty because the IRS said the Klaassens
knew they owed the amT.
</P>
<P>
   Klaassen acknowledges that he knew the IRS would assert that he
was subject to the amT, but he says the law was not meant to apply
to his family. ``I've never invested in a tax shelter,'' he said.
``I don't even have municipal bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klaassens do, however, have 13 children and their attendant
medical expenses _ including the costs of caring for their second
son, Aaron, 17, who has battled leukemia for years. It was those
exemptions and deductions that subjected them to the amT.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of policy taxes you for spending money to save your
child's life?'' Klaassen asked.
</P>
<P>
   The tax affects taxpayers in three ways. Some, like the
Klaassens, pay the tax at either a 26 percent or a 28 percent rate
because they have more than $45,000 in exemptions and deductions.
Others do not pay the amT itself, but they cannot take the full tax
breaks they would have received under the regular income tax system
without running up against limits set by the amT. The amT can also
convert tax-exempt income from certain bonds and from exercising
incentive stock options into taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   It may be useful to think of the alternative minimum tax as a
parallel universe to the regular income tax system, similar in some
ways but more complex and with its own classifications of
deductions, its own rates and its own paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that taxpayers who had escaped the regular tax
universe by piling on credits and deductions would enter this new
universe to pay their fair share. (Likewise, there is a corporate
amT that parallels the corporate income tax.)
</P>
<P>
   At first, the burden of the amT fell mainly on the shoulders of
business owners and investors, said Robert S. McIntyre, executive
director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit group in
Washington that says the tax system favors the rich. Based on IRS
data, McIntyre said he found that 37 percent of amT revenue in 1990
was a result of business owners using losses from previous years to
reduce their regular income taxes; an additional 18 percent was
because of big deductions for state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that has begun to shift, largely as a result of the 1986
changes, which eliminated most tax shelters and lowered tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   When President Reagan and Congress were overhauling the tax
code, they could not make the projected revenues under the new
rules equal those under the old system. Huge, and growing, budget
deficits made it politically essential for the official estimates
to show that after tax reform, the same amount of money would flow
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One solution, said Steuerle, the former Treasury official, was
to count personal and dependent exemptions and some medical
expenses as preferences to be reduced or ignored under the amT just
as special credits for petroleum investments and other tax shelters
are.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage interest and charitable gifts were not counted as
preferences, according to tax policy experts who worked on the
legislation, because they generated more money than was needed.
</P>
<P>
   But the amT has not stayed ``revenue neutral,'' in Washington
parlance.
</P>
<P>
   The regular income tax was indexed for inflation in 1984, so
that taxpayers would not get pushed into higher tax brackets simply
because their income kept pace with the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   The amT limits, however, have not been indexed. The total
allowable exemptions before the tax kicks in have been fixed since
1993 at $45,000 for a married couple filing jointly. For unmarried
people, the total amount is now $33,750, and for married people
filing separately, it is $22,500.
</P>
<P>
   If the limit had been indexed since 1986, when the amT was
overhauled, it would be about $57,000 for married couples filing
jointly _ and most middle-income households would still be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Steuerle said he warned at the time that including ``normal,
routine deductions and exemptions that everyone takes'' in the list
of preferences would eventually turn the amT into a tax on the
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   That appears to be exactly what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a married person who makes just $527 a week and
files her tax return separately can be subject to the tax, said
David S. Hulse, an assistant professor of accounting at the
University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   And the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which allows a $500-a-child
tax credit as well as education credits, may make even more
middle-class families subject to the amT by reducing the value of
those credits.
</P>
<P>
   Two Treasury Department economists recently calculated that
largely because of the new credits, the number of households making
$30,000 to $50,000 who must pay the alternative minimum tax will
more than triple in the coming decade. The economists, Robert
Rebelein and Jerry Tempalski, also calculated that for households
making $15,000 to $30,000 annually, amT payments will grow 25-fold,
to $1.2 billion, by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, many more people would have been subject to the amT
if Congress had not made a last-minute fix pushed by Rep. Richard
E. Neal, D-Mass., that _ for 1998 only _ exempted the new child and
education credits. The move came after IRS officials told Congress
that the credits added enormous complexity to calculating tax
liability. Figuring out how much the amT would reduce the credits
was beyond the capacity of most taxpayers and even many paid tax
preparers, the IRS officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Congress makes a permanent fix to the problems created
by the child and education credits, it will put only a minor drag
on the spread of the amT as long as the tax is not indexed for
inflation. The two Treasury economists calculated that revenues
from the tax would climb to $25 billion in 2008 without a fix, or
to $21.9 billion with one.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, if there is no exemption for the credits, a single
parent who does not itemize deductions but who makes $50,000 and
takes a credit for the costs of caring for two children while he
works, will be subject to the amT, estimated Jeffrey Pretsfelder,
an editor at RIA Group, a publisher of tax information for
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   If the tax laws are not changed, 8.8 million taxpayers will have
to pay the amT a decade from now, the Congressional Joint Committee
on Taxation estimated last month. Add in the taxpayers who will not
receive the full value of their deductions because they run up
against the limits set by the amT, and the total grows to 11.6
million taxpayers _ 92 percent of whom have incomes of less than
$200,000, the two Treasury economists estimated.
</P>
<P>
   While many lawmakers and Treasury officials have criticized the
impact of the tax on middle-class taxpayers, there are few signs of
change, as Republicans and the administration talk past each other.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who as the chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee is the chief tax writer, said the amT should be
eliminated in the next budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the amT tax can penalize large families, which
is part of the reason why Republicans for years have tried to
eliminate it or at least reduce it,'' Archer said. ``Unfortunately,
President Clinton blocked our efforts each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy Treasury secretary, said the
administration was ``very concerned that the amT has a growing
impact on middle-class families, including by diluting the child
credit, education credits and other crucial tax benefits, and we
hope to address this issue in the president's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subject to budget constraints, we look forward to working with
Congress on this important issue,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That revenue concerns have thwarted exempting the middle class
runs counter to the reason Congress initially imposed the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need an amT because people who make a lot of money should
pay some income taxes,'' said McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax
Justice. ``If you believe, like Archer and a lot of Republicans do,
that the more you make the less in taxes you should pay, then of
course you are against the amT. But somehow I don't think most
people see it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klaassens, meanwhile, are challenging the amT in federal
court. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear
arguments in March on their claim that the tax infringes their
religious freedom. The Klaassens, who are Presbyterians, say they
believe children ``are a blessing from God, and so we do not
practice birth control,'' Klaassen said.
</P>
<P>
   When Klaassen wrote to an IRS official complaining that a $1,085
bill for the amT for 1994 resulted from the size of his family, he
got back a curt letter saying that his ``analysis of the
alternative minimum tax's effect on large families was interesting
but inappropriate'' and advising him that it was medical
deductions, not family size, that subjected him to the amT.
</P>
<P>
   Under the regular tax system, medical expenses above 7.5 percent
of adjusted gross income _ the last line on the front page of Form
1040 _ are deductible. Under the amT, the threshold is raised to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still doubting the IRS' math, Klaassen decided to test what
would have happened had he filed the same tax return, changing only
the number of children he claimed as dependents. He found that if
he had seven or fewer children, the amT would not have applied in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the eighth child set off the amT, at a cost of $223. Having
nine children raised the bill to $717. And 10 children, the number
he had in 1994, increased that sum to $1,085 _ the amount the IRS
said was due.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love this country and we believe in paying taxes,''
Klaassen said. ``But we cannot believe that Congress ever intended
to apply this tax to our family solely because of how many children
we choose to have. And I have shown that we are subject to the amT
solely because we have chosen not to limit the size of our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, in papers opposing the Klaassens, noted that tax
deductions are not a right but a matter of ``legislative grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Klaassen turned to the federal courts after losing in tax court.
The opinion by tax court Judge Robert N. Armen Jr. was summed up
this way by Tax Notes, a magazine that critiques tax policy:
``Congress intended the alternative minimum tax to affect large
families when it made personal exemptions a preference item.''
</P>
<P>
   Several tax experts said that Klaassen had little chance of
success in the courts because the statute treating children as tax
preferences was clear. They also said that nothing in the amT laws
was specifically aimed at his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for people who make $200,000 or more, the amT will be
less of a burden this year because of the Taxpayer Relief Act of
1997, which included a provision lowering the maximum tax rate on
capital gains for both the regular tax and the amT to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rebelein and Tempalski, the Treasury Department economists,
calculated recently that people making more than $200,000 would pay
a total of 4 percent less in amT for 1998 because of the 1997 law.
By 2008, their savings will be 9 percent, largely as a result of
lower capital gains rates and changed accounting rules for business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law was passed to catch people who use tax shelters to
avoid their obligations,'' Klaassen said. ``But instead of catching
them it hits people like me. This is just nuts.''

SPORTS COLUMN: RESIGNATION DOESN'T MEAN RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For most of a snowy flight Friday morning, I
considered what was about to unfold, and I couldn't comprehend it.
The Georgetown University sports information director had called
Thursday evening and left a not-so-cryptic message: a major news
conference was scheduled for Friday morning involving coach John
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Off to the airport, off to Washington for what could only be a
retirement. But why? Health? Thompson had collapsed several years
ago. Recently he had some back problems. The only thing wrong now
was his team.
</P>
<P>
   But when Thompson spoke to the news media Friday morning, it
became clear that this was no ride into the sunset. This was not a
retirement, he stressed. ``I'm resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Washington sports talk radio show, caller after caller
seemed stunned and expressed ambivalence to the news. There were
platitudes and detractors. One caller compared Thompson to Adolph
Rupp. ``They both won championships and both were racists,'' he
said. The next caller took exception to the racist
characterization. ``He cared about kids in the inner city,'' the
caller said. ``I appreciated everything he's done for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   At a more immediate level, one caller expressed concern that
Thompson's successor, Craig Esherick, who began as Thompson's
assistant in 1979, wasn't high-profile enough. ``I was hoping for
somebody like Mike Jarvis or Tommy Amaker,'' the caller said.
</P>
<P>
   At McDonough Arena, marketing director Brian McGuire sat behind
his desk in a state of shock. McGuire has spent the last 30 years
at Georgetown. He was an undergraduate at the university and worked
in the alumni relations department.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hoyas reached the regional championship of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in 1980, everyone was
happy and content with 4,000 fans in McDonough. Then Patrick Ewing
signed with the Hoyas and ``everything was different,'' McGuire
said. ``Fourteen thousand, 15,000 fans were showing up to see us
play. There was really no growing period. We did not have slow
growth,'' he said. ``We went to the final eight, then Bingo! _ the
Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what now? McGuire looked across his desk with heartfelt
bewilderment. ``I don't know. This is all new territory for us.
Since 1981-82 we've been big-time basketball, and it's all been
John Thompson.''
</P>
<P>
   I left McGuire's office and went through the doors leading to
the coaches' wing. In Thompson's office sat three generations of
his coaching progeny: Patrick Ewing, Othella Harrington, John
Duren, Michael Jackson, Jaren Jackson, Ralph Dalton. The agent
David Falk sat on the couch nearest to Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The players reminisced and told war stories. Finally, Ewing
asked what time the players were going to start practicing because
he had to start running. ``Two o'clock,'' someone said. ``I'll be
back at 3,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big union president now and he has appointments,''
Thompson said. ``I remember when I said to be here at 3, he'd be
here at 2:45.'' Ewing smiled and said sheepishly, ``I'm still like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the office cleared out I thought that this was part wedding
and part wake. This blustery day marked the sudden end not simply
of an era but of a large chunk of each of their lives. After 27
years, their coach had resigned. Resigned, not retired. Thompson
will continue to work at Georgetown, helping on various projects.
Odds are that he will resurface as a coach, but not at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   When the room cleared, I asked Thompson how he felt. Fine, he
said. Health wasn't the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through a divorce,'' he said. The process of the
divorce was pulling at him in a way he could no longer ignore. Last
season was a disaster; this season was becoming more stressful. ``I
felt like Dagwood,'' he said, evoking the image of the comic strip
character who always seems to be torn in different directions.
``Part of me was running after the bus, the other part was reaching
back to grab my hat. I was going in opposite directions. This year
I was stretching myself like a rubber band.''
</P>
<P>
   So Thompson decided before the Seton Hall game Monday to stop
the stretching. He would resign and turn his entire attention to
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Practice was getting ready to start, and Thompson was beginning
his new, yet to be determined, career. ``I'll be all right,'' he
said. ``Don't worry about me. You'd better worry about Craig.''
</P>
<P>
   Save the syrupy sentiments for a clearer day. This career isn't
over. &QL;

   ECONOMY REWARDS WORKERS WITH A BOOM IN U.S. JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Despite an unsettled global economy, lower corporate profits and
a new round of layoffs, the American economy kept creating jobs at
an astonishing pace in December, adding about 378,000 new
positions. Unemployment fell to 4.3 percent, matching the 28-year
low set last April. Signs of strength in the economy were
impressive and widespread, showing healthy gains in employment and
wages among disadvantaged demographic groups.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998 as a whole, net job growth was nearly 3 million and
unemployment hovered between 4.3 and 4.5 percent. Except for a
period at the height of the Vietnam War, the last time unemployment
was this low for any significant length of time was in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   American consumers scaled back their rate of borrowing in
November, adding $3.9 billion in new debt, the Federal Reserve
reported, compared with $11.9 billion in October. Revolving loans,
which include credit card borrowing, decreased, but auto loans rose
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   HYUNDAI PLANS TO SELL DIVISIONS
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, said it would
sell 11 of its affiliates in an effort to raise more than $5
billion. Hyundai, the largest of the giant family-dominated
conglomerates that dominate the nation's economy, is under pressure
from the government to bring down its debt, now estimated at $36
billion.
</P>
<P>
   LUCENT PREDICTS A ONE-TIME GAIN
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, a maker of telecommunications equipment,
predicted a one-time gain of 97 cents a share in its first quarter,
which ended Dec. 31. The gain reflects an accounting change that
better represents benefit expenses, and almost matches Wall Street
earnings estimates for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   FAA ORDERS TESTS ON PLANES
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order
for special tests on Embraer 145s, Brazilian-built regional jets
heavily used by some U.S. airlines, and Cessna 750s, which are
business jets. The order followed three instances of engine
shutdowns because of suspected oil leaks.

<P>
   WILD DAY FOR BROADCAST.COM SHARES
</P>
<P>
   Trading of shares in Broadcast.com, a Dallas Internet company,
was stopped temporarily Friday on the Nasdaq stock market after the
stock had jumped more than 70 percent in value by 11:51 a.m.
Trading resumed at 1:20 p.m. even though the company declined to
comment on what might have caused such a remarkable surge. The
stock opened at $132, rose to a high of $230.50, and closed at
$197.50, up $65.50 for the day.

<P>
   MENTOR ENDS PURSUIT OF QUICKTURN
</P>
<P>
   Mentor Graphics abruptly dropped its unsolicited offer for
Quickturn Design Systems Inc., clearing the way for Quickturn to
merge with Cadence Design Systems Inc. in a stock swap valued at
about $268 million, or $15 a share. Cadence and Mentor are bitter
rivals in the market for the electronic automated design software
used to fashion new computer chips. Quickturn is a leader in the
related market for computers that can emulate new chip designs.

   MCI WORLDCOM WON'T BUY AIRTOUCH
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom said it had decided not to pursue a bid for
Airtouch, the nation's leading wireless telephone company. Airtouch
has been in merger talks with Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest
local phone concern, which wants to buy the company in a stock deal
valued at about $45 billion. Vodafone Group PLC, a British wireless
carrier, has also proposed buying Airtouch, suggesting a deal worth
$54 billion in cash and securities.

   CUBA SCOFFS AT EASING OF SANCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   In the first official Cuban reaction to President Clinton's
decision on Monday to ease a few elements of the United States'
economic embargo against Cuba, Jose Luis Rodriguez, Cuba's economy
minister, dismissed Clinton's changes as ``crumbs.'' The president
had said U.S. companies would be permitted to sell food and farm
supplies to nongovernmental organizations in Cuba. Most elements of
the sanctions would remain unchanged.

 &HT;    They don't like way Sheikh did shimmy with their cash
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Val Ellicott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Impressing would-be investors comes
easily to Shimmy Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
   A jet-setting international businessman who drives Ferraris and
swings a polo mallet with some of the world's top players, Qureshi
seems a model of successful enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Even his first name _ Sheikh _ hints at membership in an elite
social circle.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone who does business with Qureshi has been happy
with the results.
</P>
<P>
   At least 17 civil lawsuits and one federal bankruptcy action
accuse the Wellington millionaire of bilking partners and clients
or defaulting on loans. Plaintiffs range from one of the wealthiest
men in the country to a bankrupt Cayman Islands bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that he has no business,'' a former friend and
associate, Syed Kazmi, said in a deposition in October. ``He scams
people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi, 47, says such assertions are ``total nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good reputation and so does my family,'' he said.
``We are regular businessmen. Living in America and doing business
here _ lawsuits are part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Abdus Shimveel Qureshi _ ``Shimmy'' to his friends _ was
born in Pakistan but hasn't lived there for about 30 years. He says
his true home is Sweden, where he does most of his business and
where he sponsors a professional soccer team, Orgrytes.
</P>
<P>
   The polo team he finances and plays for _ Escue _ won the U.S.
Open title in April, although Qureshi says he isn't playing these
days because he isn't feeling fit.
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi's wealth and status are so well-established in Sweden
that newspapers there have said his investment decisions ``can
affect the value of the Swedish crown,'' court documents say.
</P>
<P>
   Kazmi told bankuptcy attorneys in October that Qureshi, who was
heavily invested in Southeast Asia, took a drubbing when financial
markets there plunged, forcing Qureshi to sell homes and other
property he had purchased in Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   But Qureshi remains immensely wealthy, Kazmi said in his
deposition. He recalled seeing financial statements reporting
Qureshi's net worth at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He claims he has nothing,'' Kazmi said. ``He's a rich man, I
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi, who said he has a bachelor's degree in economics from
England, has described himself in court papers as a financial
adviser and sometimes travel agency owner whose company, Escue
Management, invests in ``various projects, from real estate to the
stock market.'' ``Sheikh,'' he says, is a family name, not a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply, through his company, Escue Management, he invests
other people's money and executes promissory notes to pay at a
fixed rate of return,'' Qureshi's attorneys wrote in court papers
filed in his 1995 divorce.
</P>
<P>
   State records show Escue was dissolved in October after failing
to file an annual report. But Qureshi said he has no plans to
retire the company and will file the required paperwork to keep it
active.
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi's ex-wife, Carina, said in court papers that Escue
sometimes guaranteed customers a return of 20 percent. In an
interview last week, Qureshi said he has made good on every pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that I have promised my clients I have delivered,
100 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suits filed against Qureshi _ almost all have been
settled privately _ tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   George Lindemann, the billionaire founder of Cellular One, and
his wife, Frayda, took Qureshi to court in April, saying he had
cheated them in a deal to buy their home on Hurlingham Drive in
Wellington for $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi couldn't come up with the entire purchase price, so he
offered 42 polo ponies as collateral on his pledge to make up the
difference later. The Lindemanns agreed, and said Qureshi could
continue using the horses for polo matches.
</P>
<P>
   But when the couple tried to verify the status of their
collateral, they said they received disturbing reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lindemanns have learned that 10 of the horses are missing
from the stable, some have been sold, others traded and still
others have been claimed by third parties,'' attorneys for the
couple said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi's attorney, Jay Jacknin, said Qureshi ultimately won a
court order confirming that the ponies were his. Jacknin said the
suit is being settled based on commitments by Qureshi and the
Lindemanns to divide the horses and pay their own legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   According to property records, the Lindemanns bought the
Hurlingham Drive house back from Qureshi for $2.9 million, then
sold it to Joseph A. Zada for $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have resolved most of my lawsuits,'' Qureshi said.
``Everybody has been paid in full. Now I'm in the position of
chasing after people who owe me lots and lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   A year before the Lindemanns filed their suit, Qureshi bartered
with another wealthy family _ the al-Thanis, who rule the Arab
country of Qatar _ to buy Gulf Union Bank in the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, the al-Thanis agreed to sell Gulf Union to
International Business Holdings _ a Cayman Islands company owned by
Qureshi _ for $4.5 million, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   While Cayman Islands officials were reviewing the deal, Qureshi
named an associate, Kazmi, to run Gulf Union and a subsidiary,
First Cayman Bank. Within three months, Kazmi, acting at Qureshi's
direction, had shunted more than $5 million from First Cayman into
his own account and into accounts held by Qureshi and the
al-Thanis, according to court papers filed by liquidators of the
bank's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi used much of the money to pay off ``certain `investors'
'' whom he had targeted as part of a ``Ponzi scheme,'' the records
say. And the liquidators say he used bank money to pay off a $1.75
million civil judgment entered against him in connection with the
same scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Kazmi used another $830,000 in bank money to buy a house at the
Palm Beach Polo Club in Wellington, court records say.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, Cayman Islands officials announced that
First Cayman was bankrupt. By that time, documents say, ``Qureshi
and Kazmi had departed Grand Cayman.''
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi responded by accusing First Cayman in court papers of
misplacing $1 million he had deposited at the bank. He said other
money he received from First Cayman bank was in the form of loans
and claimed the bank never credited him for $2 million in
repayments.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Palm Beach County lawsuits filed against Qureshi
refer to a Ponzi scheme _ an illegal operation in which money paid
by some investors is used to pay off other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Kazmi also denied siphoning money from the bank. He acknowledged
that Qureshi made substantial withdrawals of the bank's money but
said he assumed Qureshi, whom he had come to regard as a close
friend, would pay it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You trusted him blindly?'' an attorney for the bank
liquidators asked at the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred percent,'' Kazmi said.
</P>
<P>
   The First Cayman case received prominent play in a fax sent
anonymously to an unknown number of Wellington residents last year.
</P>
<P>
   The highly incendiary document includes a long list of people
identified as ``Quraeshi victims'' _ an alternative spelling of the
family name _ and accuses Qureshi and two of his brothers, Shahid
and Sohail, of a wide range of illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The fax also mentions a civil court case filed in March in which
Sohail Quraeshi, who spells his last name slightly differently from
his brother, is accused of bilking a St. Lucie County woman of
$100,000 in an investment deal.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmy Qureshi, responding to a phone call to Sohail, said his
brother did nothing wrong and the case is being settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we're being targeted,'' he said. ``Welcome to
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County criminal court records show no cases filed
against Shahid or Sohail.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmy Qureshi was charged in 1996 with custodial interference
after his wife, Carina, said he took their 3-year-old daughter to
Pakistan and Sweden during their divorce. Qureshi said he'd merely
taken his daughter on a long-planned trip.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was brought back to the United States and the case was
dropped as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Qureshi's
divorce became final in July 1996. He remarried in May.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong divorce had a more lasting impact on Qureshi's
finances, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of investors have demanded immediate return of their
investments which (Qureshi) is not in a position to honor,''
Qureshi's attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the civil suits filed against Qureshi say he defaulted
on loans he used to buy real estate and expensive cars or refused
to pay people who worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   A Lake Worth landscaper, Michael Galvan, said in court records
that he showed up at Qureshi's Wellington estate Feb. 12, 1997, to
demand that Qureshi make good on a $28,582 landscaping bill.
</P>
<P>
   Galvan said he was met by one of Qureshi's relatives and another
man identified only as ``Doug.'' In kicking Galvan off the
property, the two men beat him as Qureshi stood by and watched,
Galvan said in court records.
</P>
<P>
   His suit, filed in November 1997 and settled in October, said
``Doug'' had threatened ``to put two bullets in the back of
Galvan's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Qureshi filed a response denying Galvan was mistreated and
saying he had paid Galvan in full. The response accused Galvan of
threatening to break Qureshi's legs and of conducting a harassment
campaign ``by denigrating him (Qureshi) in public throughout the
town of Wellington and at Palm Beach Polo.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Qureshis have been charged in criminal court in Palm
Beach County in connection with the accusations made in civil
lawsuits. But West Palm Beach police say they investigated Shimmy
Qureshi for fraud in 1992, the same year he moved to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The case was based on claims in a civil suit that Qureshi and
three other men had bilked three Chinese immigrants out of
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants _ Anthony Lee, Susanna Law and Jack Tung _ said
Qureshi conned them out of the money after persuading them to
relocate from Sweden to South Florida to open a restaurant with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the suit was filed, Lee received a death threat
in the mail, but the threat never led to criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   And Sgt. Mike Roggin said his fraud investigation ended when the
immigrants agreed to settle with Qureshi and the others. Exact
terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of the resolution, the attorney for the immigrants
wrote a letter saying Qureshi had settled their claim ``in an
honorable fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Qureshi can sincerely state to his credit that he always
acknowledged the existence of the full debt claimed by Lee, Law and
Tung,'' attorney Frank Shooster wrote. ``Mr. Qureshi always
conducted himself as a complete gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazmi said he has a very different recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no money coming in,'' Kazmi told attorneys. ``I'm
losing my house, losing my sanity. I'm bankrupt. It's all because
of Mr. Qureshi.''
</P>
<P>
   KickerCases against Qureshi
</P>
<P>
   QuickReadAt least 17 lawsuits and a bankruptcy action have been
filed in Palm Beach County against Sheikh Abdus Shimveel Qureshi.

ROBITAILLE'S TOP 20 CLASSICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings' Luc Robitaille has
scored so many huge goals during his 13-year NHL career his name
should be Luc Robiwin.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four of his 500 goals have been regular-season
game-winners. He has 47 more in the postseason and two have come
courtesy of penalty shots.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only left wing in NHL history to produce eight
consecutive 40-goal seasons, and he's currently on a 47-goal pace,
which would be his highest total since he scored 63 in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who turns 33 next month, has a sharpshooter's eye
and a fuzzy memory. He can recall his first goal just fine. But ask
him about his 200th? His 400th? His favorite? and he flails like a
beaten goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Pinning Robitaille down on any particular goal is like asking
the rest of us to describe one specific sneeze. Scoring goals is a
reflex action for the player who became the sixth left winger and
the 27th skater in NHL history to reach the 500-goal milestone. He
got there with two goals in the Kings' 4-2 win over Buffalo on
Thursday night at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   His latest victim, backup goaltender Dwayne Roloson, can take
solace in the fact it wasn't the first time the Sabres had been
buffaloed by Robitaille. The 6-foot-1 forward hasn't reached all of
his milestones against the Sabres, it just seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   His 50th goal (and 100th point) of the 1992-93 season came
against Buffalo on March 15, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres also gift-wrapped his 400th goal, on Feb. 19, 1995,
which Robitaille scored with 20 seconds left to draw the Penguins
even at 3.
</P>
<P>
   And No. 300? The Sabres saw that one up-close-and-personal, too.
On Nov. 7, 1992, Robitaille, taking advantage of a Kings 5-on-3,
chased down his own rebound and launched another shot at goalie Tom
Draper. The puck skipped into the back of the net off the skate of
Doug Bodger, now a Kings teammate but then a mortified Sabres
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   From the memory banks where those three goals were stored we've
withdrawn 17 more, all 20 of them made priceless by No. 20's
Hall-of-Fame-validating score:
</P>
<P>
   _In the first period of his NHL debut on Oct. 9, 1986,
Robitaille beat St. Louis goaltender Rick Wamsley for the goal that
got things rolling. Marcel Dionne picked up his 1,600th career
point with the first assist.
</P>
<P>
   _Robitaille recorded his first game-winning goal and reaped a
sprained right knee, too, on Nov. 29, 1986, in the second period of
a 9-6 win over visiting New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   _On Oct. 25, 1987, Robitaille was hooked from behind on a
breakaway in Winnipeg. Never mind that the Kings hadn't scored on a
penalty shot in three years and it had been a good decade since
Robitaille last had tried one (and missed), Cool-Hand Luc skated in
on Jets goalie Eldon Reddick and smacked the puck inside the left
post for the deciding goal in a 2-1 win.
</P>
<P>
   _It's no small feat to overshadow a mega-star's premiere, but
Robitaille pulled it off on Oct. 6, 1988, when he collected his
99th, 100th and 101st career goals in Wayne Gretzky's first game as
a King, an 8-2 win over Detroit at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   _Gretzky dropped a pass for Robitaille in at the Forum on April
18, 1991, and Robitaille did the rest, beating Edmonton goalie Bill
Ranford in overtime for the Kings' first victory in a second-round
playoff game in nine years and a dozen tries.
</P>
<P>
   _The script never would read any better for the Kings than when
Robitaille returned to his native Montreal on June 1, 1993, and
scored twice to ice Game 1 of the Kings' best-of-seven Stanley Cup
Final against the Canadiens. Who knew Marty McSorley would get
caught with an illegally curved stick and Montreal would win the
next four games and the Kings would miss the playoffs the next four
years?
</P>
<P>
   _The Kings likely would have bowed out before Montreal if not
for Robitaille's goal on May 27, 1993, which drew the Kings even
with Toronto in a Stanley Cup semifinal Game 6 that the Kings had
to win (and did, 5-4 in overtime) to avoid elimination.
</P>
<P>
   _A touch of flu couldn't unglue Robitaille on April 15, 1993; he
scored his career-high 63rd goal in an 8-6 loss to Vancouver at the
Forum and added three assists to surpass Kevin Stevens as the NHL's
all-time leader for points scored in a season (with 125).
</P>
<P>
   _Robitaille didn't look right with a Penguin on his chest and
New York wasn't his kind of town so there was joy all around on
Oct. 12, 1997, when he returned triumphantly to the Forum for his
second go-around as a King.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille marked the occasion by knocking an Ottawa player off
the puck and converting a pass from Aki Berg at the other end for
the deciding goal in a 7-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   _The crease is Robitaille's castle, as Hartford goalie Jeff
Reese was rudely reminded on Feb. 16, 1995, when Pittsburgh
teammate Jaromir Jagr set Robitaille up on four goals in 40
minutes. Robitaille remembers that two of the goals went in off his
skates. The record shows it was the 12th hat trick of Robitaille's
career. He continues to look for his lucky 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he'll find it tonight against Edmonton. Stranger things
have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Luc's flukiest goal? That would have to be the one he scored off
Mike Vernon years ago while sliding across the Forum ice on his
stomach. Robitaille amazed even himself with that one, just as he
continues to impress everybody else.

FISET IS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephane Fiset's season of fits and starts will resume tonight,
when the Los Angeles Kings' No. 1 goalie is expected to play for
the first time in nearly four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, who has battled groin injuries all season, is expected to
be in goal at 7 tonight when the Kings play host to the Edmonton
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   He had said that if asked to play, he would beg off of the
assignment because of the fine play recently of Jamie Storr. But he
said goaltending consultant Don Edwards convinced him that it was
time to get back into action.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Fiset played, in a loss to the Mighty Ducks on
Dec. 13, the Kings (15-21-3) were in a tailspin. But they begin
play tonight with five consecutive wins and seven victories in
their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier (to come back) knowing the team is playing good in
front of you,'' Fiset said. ``You know you just have to do your
job. It's harder when the team is not doing well. You think you
have to save the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Time for a breather (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Fiset plays, it will end a career-high stretch of 10
consecutive starts for Storr, who went 7-3 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Does Storr feel he's proven something with his strong play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people believed in me,'' Storr said. ``As long as the
team and general manager believed in me, that's all that mattered.
The main thing is, I believed in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coach Larry Robinson said he has seen greater maturity this
season from Storr, 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's gotten stronger mentally,'' Robinson said. ``He's
starting to understand himself and the game better. That goes with
experience. The one thing we were always questioning was how well
he could keep his concentration over an extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The question appears to have been answered.
</P>
<P>
   Honors for Luc: The Kings will honor Luc Robitaille, who scored
his 500th career goal Thursday night against Buffalo, with
ceremonies during the first intermission of tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   There will be presentations from the NHL, Robitaille's Kings
teammates and the organization. The Kings flew Robitaille's
parents, Claude and Madeleine, to Los Angeles from Montreal on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The team also flew former Kings star Marcel Dionne to Los
Angeles from Buffalo on Friday. As a 20-year-old rookie in 1986-87,
Robitaille lived in Dionne's house. Dionne scored 731 goals during
his NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: The Kings placed right wing Glen Murray (torn knee
ligament) and center Ray Ferraro (torn knee cartilage) on injured
reserve. ... Winger Donald Audette missed practice because he has a
cold. ... There's an outside chance defenseman Doug Bodger will
play after missing four games with a cervical strain and a bruised
shoulder. ... Individual tickets to Tip-A-King '99, the team's
annual charity event, go on sale Wednesday at the Forum and at all
TicketMaster outlets. The event will be held from 6 to 9:30 p.m. on
Feb. 7 at The Hangar at Merv Griffin Productions in Santa Monica.
All proceeds benefit the Kings Care Foundation. General admission
tickets, priced at $75, include food and drinks. VIP packages range
from $2,500-$5,000. For more information, call (213) 996-0118.

 120 TWIN-ENGINED JETS UNDER CAUTION AFTER 3 HAVE TROUBLE IN FLIGHT 
 (DW) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three twin-engine jets have had an engine shut down
in flight in the last week, probably because a seal weakened by
cold let oil leak out, the Federal Aviation Administration said
Friday. The agency issued an emergency order requiring special
tests on about 120 planes with the engines any time the oil
temperature is below 32 degrees, and prohibiting flight if
excessive leaks occur.
</P>
<P>
   The order affects Embraer 145s, a new model of 50-seat regional
jet built in Brazil that is used heavily by American Eagle and
Continental Express. It also affects Cessna 750s, which are
business jets. All the planes use Allison turbofan engines.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said further orders might be needed as its investigation
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Express flies 38 EMB 145s, from its hubs in Houston,
Cleveland and Newark, N.J. On Tuesday the crew of one of them, on a
flight from Cleveland to Minneapolis, shut down an engine and
diverted to Grand Rapids, Mich., when a sensor in the cockpit
warned of low oil. On Thursday the same problem occurred on an
American Eagle flight from Chicago to Cleveland; it made an
unscheduled landing in Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the third incident could not be determined, but the
FAA said all three planes landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, Continental Airlines said it had received
permission from the FAA to complete a one-time repair that would
prevent oil from leaking even if the seal failed.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Heires, a spokesman at American, said it had begun on
Thursday to keep its 20 EMB-145s indoors at night, or have
mechanics start the engines every few hours during the night. Ned
Walker, a spokesman for Continental, said his airline was
performing the checks of the oil level every morning.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first winter that American has flown the planes.
Continental used them last winter, but this winter has been much
colder in places Continental flies, especially in the Midwest. The
airlines have been buying jets like the EMB-145 for routes where
they previously used turboprop planes, partly because of customer
perceptions that the propeller planes were less reliable,
especially in cold weather, when they are prone to accumulate ice
in flight.
</P>
<P>
   A switchboard operator at Embraer's headquarters in Sao Jose dos
Campos, Brazil, said that no one was in the office there; company
representatives in a sales office in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., did not
return phone messages.

DRAKE SIDELINED BY ELBOW  
 HOPES TO PLAY AGAIN VS. SABRES ON MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Missing four games due to a suspension was a pain in
the back to Dallas Drake. A mysterious pain in the elbow, it turns
out, prevented him from returning to the Coyotes' lineup Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Drake was all set to make his return against the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim, but a sore left elbow, apparently bruised Wednesday during
practice, swelled up badly on Thursday and didn't improve Friday.
The result: an infected bursa, which is a sac of fluid that reduces
friction between tendons and bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he did anything at home,'' Coach Jim Schoenfeld
said. ``He just banged it the other day and it was one of those
residual affects. He called (trainer) Gordie (Hart) and told him
his elbow was sore. Gordie told him to ice it and take some Advil.
A couple hours later, he called again and said it was really
starting to bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake had to have the elbow drained of fluid. He accompanied the
team to Anaheim, but the elbow was still too sore for him to play.
Although he is listed as day to day, he hopes to play Monday, when
the Coyotes return home to meet the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what happened. Seriously,'' Drake said. ``We
didn't even have any contact in practice Wednesday. I don't know if
I fell down or what. If I did, I don't remember falling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the injury could have occurred when he and other
teammates took turns pulling Jeremy Roenick and Oleg Tverdovsky
apart during two scraps that day, Drake shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. I'm a second-bout guy. I just stood there and more or
less watched,'' he said. &QL; 
Block that shot &QL; 
During their 7-1 rout at the hands of Edmonton on Thursday, the
Coyotes were credited with blocking only five shots, while the
Oilers had 11. Usually, though, Phoenix averages in double figures
in that department, a testament to teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think shot blocking is becoming a lost art. There aren't too
many people who do it _ or do it well, anyway,'' Schoenfeld said.
``It should be a last-ditch effort. I don't think it's ever the
first thing you want to do. But it can be a big play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If blocking a shot is the last resort to preventing the other
team from scoring, you've got to make that play. And we've got guys
who can do it extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Sullivan is a very good shot blocker. Jeremy Roenick is a
pretty good shot blocker. Dallas Drake is a guy who will pay the
price to block shots. From time to time, we've had all of our guys
willing to pay that price. If you're looking at a team that's
trying to win a championship, you have to pay a physical price, and
our team is willing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Anaheim's Teemu Selanne made a flippant
remark after diving to the ice to block an opponent's shot, saying
it was his annual first and last attempt of the season. In other
words, the Ducks pay him to score goals, not sacrifice his body.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld's response?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our skill players pay the price, so I don't have to worry
about it,'' he said. ``The thing is, if you think it's somebody
else's job and your job is only this, there are going to be nights
when you don't do your job and that player might come up and score
a big goal. But there are nights when the team may need you to
block a shot, nights when it needs you to throw a big body check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every hockey player should play the entire game as
well as he can. Obviously, some guys are going to be better at some
aspects than the other. Dallas Drake is a better body checker than
you, but you might be a better goal scorer. But you should still
try to check, and he should still try to score.'' &QL;

VIKINGS' GREEN AS GUTSY AS TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. - Everyone loves you when you're 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, means nothing to Dennis Green. Because nobody
loves Dennis Green more than Dennis Green. This is the way it's
always been.
</P>
<P>
   News flash: Revelations that Green paid a former lover to have
an abortion in January 1993, leading to lawsuits and red faces in
the Vikings' hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   News flash: Allegations of sexual harassment against Green after
the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   News flash: In a controversial autobiography, Green claims he's
been unfairly criticized because of his race and complains that
members of the team's ownership group deliberately have undermined
him. He threatens to sue two of the owners for allegedly contacting
Lou Holtz in an attempt to change coaches, thereby harming his
future, unless they sell him their share of ownership. He also
details a plan to buy the entire franchise, upsetting everyone in
Minnesota, including four other NFL owners who want him out of the
league on the next available flight.
</P>
<P>
   News flash: Green, who has led the Vikings to six playoff berths
and 69 wins in seven years, is only 1-5 in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   News flash: Green threatens to resign before the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   News flash: In September, Green receives a three-year contract
extension from the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Observation: You have to be a damn good football coach to pull
this off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got guts,'' Green said Friday. ``One thing I would never
do is quit or give up. We've always been a scrappy, fighting team.
And I've always been that kind of coach.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, over a coaching career that spans 27 years, one that
started in the basement at Northwestern University, where he
snapped a 34-game losing streak, one that landed him at the table
of Bill Walsh disciples in San Francisco, one that led to a
tumultuous tenure in Minnesota, Green hangs on to one irrefutable
piece of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He has never been fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of that because it's a tough business,'' Green
said. ``You have to be lucky because some of the best coaches in
the business have been fired many times.'' &QL; 
Strong motivator &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where does Green fit in this mix? Well, he is excellent at
deferring blame, more than once comparing his results to the lack
of financial commitment from the previous ownership. He is
well-versed in his own accomplishments, and when asked about the
effect of a week layoff, this rattles off his tongue in machine-gun
force:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a football team that earned a bye. We have the best
record going in and out of byes in the National Football League
over a seven-year period of time. So we know how to do the bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, for all the digressions, bravado and icy
relationships with the local media, for all the time he spends
dancing around his own land mines, this much is undeniable:
</P>
<P>
   Green is a masterful motivator. A coach who relates to his
players, defends his players, understands their mind-set and blends
it all into a common cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats every man like a man, sometimes when they don't
deserve to be treated like men,'' Vikings receiver Cris Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
   On nearly every wall of the Vikings' training complex is a
slogan preaching the virtues of oneness. He is a coach who excels
at chemistry experiments. He doesn't just know the pulse of his
team, he creates it. And every Sunday, there is no team that plays
with more spirit or passion than his Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to play football, we like to play hard, we try to be
consistent,'' Green said. ``We have a team that has a mentality
that football is what we like doing, and we're always going to lay
it on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   On his toes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the locals in Minnesota treat the Cardinals as a warm-up
act, Green has been very careful to keep his players focused. After
all, there is this awful playoff legacy trailing Green, a coach who
needed a Hail Mary ending to beat the Giants last year in his first
postseason victory.
</P>
<P>
   If he loses this one . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you have to be lucky to hang around for 27 years and never
get whacked. But for all his talents, Green is a master at staying
ahead of the curve, plotting and planning, making sure his options
are open. In the wake of Mike Holmgren's mind-numbing deal to coach
the Seahawks comes a report that Green has a similar out clause in
his contract; that he may be able to leave the Vikings if another
team offers him the dual responsibilities of coach and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   If I were Jeff Diamond, the current vice president of football
operations, I'd worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more coaches are looking for that blend between the
responsibilities of what takes place on Sunday, which is very, very
demanding _ witness the number of coaches that have been fired the
last five or six or seven years _ and the ability, in the words of
Bill Parcells, to get your own shopping list,'' Green said. ``So I
think that has to be a concern for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A future that has never caught up to Green, a coach who somehow
has shed much poundage and much baggage, a man who knows all about
survival of the fittest. &QL;

MARINE CORPS SUBPOENAS TAPES FROM `SIXTY MINUTES'  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf for clarification. No other changes.)   By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Marine Corps prosecutor has obtained a subpeona seeking tapes
the program ``60 Minutes'' made of an interview with the pilot of
the jet that sliced through cables supporting a ski gondola,
killing 20 people. On Friday CBS filed a motion to throw out the
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena, issued in late December, said the tape, which has
not yet been broadcast, might contain statements that could help in
the prosecution of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The newsman Mike Wallace said Friday that he had interviewed the
pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, several times in preparation for a
report about the Marine Corps' handling of the case. The interview
was to be broadcast on Jan. 24 or Jan. 31, he said; the court
martial of Ashby and Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, the navigator on the
Feb. 3 flight in the Italian Alps, is scheduled to start the first
week of February.
</P>
<P>
   In filing its motion with the officer presiding over the court
martial, CBS said the subpoena violated the news program's
privileges under the First Amendment and that, under the code of
military justice, it constituted an ``unreasonable and oppressive''
action.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the lawyer representing ``60 Minutes,'' said
Friday, ``This is a really extraordinary situation,'' involving not
only a request for material that has not been broadcast _
``outtakes,'' in the jargon of television news _ but in which ``the
party seeking the outtakes is the very party about whom the
broadcast may revolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said, ``I still cannot understand how they could ask us,
in effect, to help them make their case against Rich Ashby.'' He
added that his interview with a senior Marine officer has not yet
taken place, and speculated that the Marine Corps wanted to review
the other interviews before its officer spoke to the program.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Col. Katie Haddock said that the request from Lt. Col.
Carol Joyce _ the trial counsel, or prosecutor _ was made
independently of the Corps' command structure. If the material
being subpoenaed is evidence, she said, ``it is not available'' to
any officers outside the prosecution and defense teams.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said it is extremely rare for any prosecutor to subpoena
the raw information that goes into a news report before the report
is made public.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out, in an interview and in the motion to quash
the subpoena, that Justice Department guidelines require that,
before Federal prosecutors can subpoena journalists, they must have
``reasonable grounds to believe, based on information obtained by
non-media sources, that the information sought is essential of a
successful investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors are also seeking a ``60 Minutes'' interview with
Capt. Chandler Seagraves, who was in the back seat of the jet, an
EA-6B Prowler, at the time of the accident. He was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and Schweitzer each have been charged with 20 counts of
involuntary manslaughter and 20 counts of homicide. Any one count
of involuntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 10 years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the involuntary manslaughter and homicide
charges, the pilot and the navigator face charges of obstruction of
justice and conduct unbecoming an officer in connection with the
alleged disappearance of a videotape made during the fatal flight.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer declined to be interviewed by ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one officer, who supervised the public hearing that led
to the charges, indicated that the prosecution's case may be weak,
in part because the Marine Corps, the Air Force and a Pentagon
map-making agency had made systematic errors that contributed to
the accident. There is evidence that the jet's crew was given
inaccurate information when they planned the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the jet squadron involved in the accident, Lt.
Col. Richard Muegge, was relieved of command in August. Maj. Max
Caramanian, who was the director of standardization and safety for
the squadron, received a letter of reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were dismissed against two other officers.
</P>
<P>
   The accident provoked strong protest in Italy and strained
relations between it and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an electronic warfare jet, was on a low-altitude
training mission out of an air base in Aviano, Italy, when it hit
the cables about 370 feet from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident, local rules set a minimum height
above ground level of 2,000 feet, but everyone in the Marine
squadron said that they believed it was 1,000 feet, and some
material on file in the flight operations center gave an even lower
number for some areas.

UNHEEDED WARNINGS: A SPECIAL REPORT ON THE EMBASSY BOMBING IN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to
Kenya, sent an emotional letter to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright begging for the secretary's personal help.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, a career diplomat, had been fighting for months
for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats
and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot. The
department had repeatedly refused to grant her request, citing a
lack of money. But that kind of response, she wrote Albright, was
``endangering the lives of embassy personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the FBI had been amassing increasingly ominous and
detailed clues about potential threats in Kenya, officials said.
But the State Department bureaucracy still dismissed Ms. Bushnell.
She was even seen by some at the State Department as a nuisance who
was overly obsessed with security, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   Albright took no action. And three months later, on Aug. 7, the
American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were simultaneously
attacked with car bombs. Twelve American diplomats and more than
200 Africans were killed in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has acknowledged that Ms. Bushnell raised
questions about security before the bombing. But a close
examination of events in the year before the assaults, based on
interviews with officials throughout the U.S. government, shows her
concerns were more intense, more well-founded, more specific, and
more forcefully expressed than has previously been known.
</P>
<P>
   The review shows that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA repeatedly told State Department officials in
Washington and in the Kenya Embassy that there was an active
terrorist cell in Kenya connected to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
exile who is accused of masterminding the attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA and FBI investigated at least three terrorist threats
in Nairobi in the year before the bombing and took one seriously
enough to send a counter-terrorism team from CIA headquarters. The
agency ultimately concluded that threat was unfounded, but some
officials believe the inquiry was botched, and the agency's
inspector general is investigating how it was handled.
</P>
<P>
   _ State Department officials brushed aside Gen. Anthony Zinni,
commander of the U.S. Central Command, who had visited Nairobi on
his own and warned that the Nairobi embassy was an easy and
tempting target for terrorists. Zinni's offer to send his own
specialists to review security in Nairobi was turned down by the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ The State Department had all but abandoned the commitment it
made after the 1983 bombing of the Beirut, Lebanon, embassy to
improve embassy security. Department officials had long since
stopped asking Capitol Hill for the money needed to meet its own
standards, and had adopted a strategy of improving the handful of
embassies it believed were at greatest risk. Nairobi was not one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, in a rare interview about the bombing, said by
telephone from Nairobi on Friday: ``This is a tragedy in the real
sense of the word, and it's a tragedy that has caused us to think
differently. We no longer operate under the assumptions that we did
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A report made public Friday by a commission appointed by
Albright excoriated the State Department for failing to safeguard
American missions against terrorist attacks, particularly for the
practice of giving vulnerable missions like the one in Nairobi
lower priority when experience shows they make tempting targets for
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, signed by Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concluded that ``intelligence provided
no immediate tactical warning of the August 7 attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, classified cable traffic and intelligence reports, which
were not included in the public version of Crowe's report, show
that while none of the warnings gathered by American intelligence
in the year before the bombings pointed to a particular act of
terrorism on a particular day, the United States had growing
evidence that the embassy was a target of terrorist plots, and that
terrorists hostile to American interests were active in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were sympathetic to
Ms. Bushnell's concerns. They added that it was impossible to
respond to each terrorist threat it received. Department officials
also assert that even if Ms. Bushnell's requests had been granted,
a new embassy could not have been in place in time to prevent the
attack in August.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were told at the time by the CIA that the
threats in Nairobi had either proved unfounded or had been dealt
with by Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Ms. Bushnell began raising
concerns about the embassy's security soon after her arrival in
Nairobi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She sent two cables to headquarters in December 1997, outlining
the dangers and asking for a new embassy. Her request was not
seriously considered, officials said, when senior State Department
officials met in January 1998 at the State Department to set a
budget for embassy construction in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up on the radar screen,'' said one senior
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Ms. Bushnell to try her end-run with Albright. In
memos sent in April and May, she asked Albright to cite Nairobi's
vulnerability to Congress in seeking more funds for security. In
addition, Ms. Bushnell was lobbying every senior American official
and member of Congress who came to Nairobi. The ambassador would
say, ``How do you like our building? I think it's terrible,''
according to an American official. Ms. Bushnell ``did not want to
be in that building,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the terrorist threats investigated by the CIA
panned out, they focused Ms. Bushnell's attention on just how
vulnerable her embassy was. ``If you know there is a viper's nest
around, then that gives you pause,'' one State Department official
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the global investigation touched off by the
1993 World Trade Center bombing had focused on bin Laden and his
associates. FBI agents from New York were hard at work building a
criminal case against the Saudi exile. At the same time, the CIA
was tracking the group's movements and finances in hopes of
preventing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One trail led to Kenya where the agency discovered that bin
Laden's operatives were living in the country. Intelligence
officials say they briefed Ms. Bushnell about the presence of the
group in early 1997 but told her there was no evidence of a
specific threat against the embassy or American interests in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, American intelligence officials began to
look more closely at what bin Laden was doing in Africa. The CIA
identified an intriguing suspect: Wadih el Hage, a Lebanese-born
American citizen in Kenya who was believed to have close ties to
the leadership of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials prodded their Kenyan counterparts to raid el
Hage's home in Nairobi, an overture that was shared with Ms.
Bushnell and others in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police, accompanied by the CIA and FBI, searched the
house in August 1997. They found his computer, downloaded its
files, and read a letter describing the existence of an ``East
African cell'' of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the letter mentioned recent attempts by American
intelligence to investigate the group's Kenyan operations and
alluded to its role in attacking American soldiers in Somalia a few
years earlier. According to the document, the group had moved a
cache of incriminating files from el Hage's house and hidden them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That reference set off alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   American officials suspected that the missing files might
contain evidence of an upcoming attack by bin Laden's Kenyan
operatives. The working theory, officials said, was that such a
plot would be aimed at another country, with Nairobi used as a
``jumping off point.''
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official said American investigators began a
``somewhat frantic, concerted effort'' to locate the missing files.
``The concern was high enough about something being out there to go
right away,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, a second search was conducted in Kenya
at another location in September 1997. This time, a State
Department official from the embassy joined the CIA, FBI and
Kenyans. No files were found.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI interviewed el Hage, who had moved to the United States,
three times, but he professed to know little of bin Laden or his
activities in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Today, el Hage is in jail in New York, awaiting trial on charges
of lying in those interviews and conspiring with bin Laden to kill
Americans abroad. He has not been directly linked to the bombings
in Kenya, but has been accused of being one of the Saudi exile's
chief lieutenants, responsible for setting up front companies in
Kenya and seeking components for chemical weapons. He has pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CIA and FBI believed at the time that they had
uncovered a potentially dangerous terrorist group linked to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were not told of
this and stress that they were given only a ``fragmentary''
understanding of the reasons for the raid on el Hage's house.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were told only that the CIA was
assisting a criminal investigation by the New York FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time were we told he was connected to Osama bin Laden or
to any threat against U.S. interests in Kenya,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official said: ``If we had known there
was a significant bin Laden network in Kenya we would have gotten
our people the hell out of that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence and law enforcement officials strongly dispute the
State Department's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, said one intelligence official, was
briefed about the presence of bin Laden's operatives in Kenya
``before, during and after'' the August 1997 raid on el Hage's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, intelligence officials said the CIA sent the
State Department numerous reports detailing the activities of el
Hage and others linked to bin Laden in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those reports referred to Osama bin Laden in the first
paragraph,'' recalled one U.S. intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, the CIA's Nairobi-based officers learned
of another possible terrorist threat to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence service of another country, which American
officials declined to identify, turned over an informant to the
CIA. In a series of conversations, the informant said that the
Nairobi branch of an Islamic charity, the Al-Haramain Foundation,
was plotting terrorist attacks against Americans, according to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The informant eventually warned that the group was plotting to
blow up the American embassy in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the CIA's station chief in Nairobi relayed the
threats to the ambassador and other embassy officials, touching off
a dispute between the agencies over what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Senior diplomats at the embassy wanted the CIA to ask the Kenyan
authorities to arrest the group's members immediately. But the
CIA's station chief, uncertain about the credibility of the
informant, initially favored keeping an eye on the group, according
to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats prevailed, and on Oct. 31, the Kenyans arrested
nine Arabs connected to Al-Haramain, and seized the group's files.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States receives thousands of terrorist threats
a year, this one was taken so seriously that the CIA took the
unusual step of sending a team of counter-terrorism specialists
from its Langley, Va., headquarters to Nairobi to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA team, which included an Arab linguist, scoured
Al-Haramain's seized files, but could find no evidence of a bomb
plot. Members of the counter-terrorism team then wanted to question
the Al-Haramain members in jail, to make sure they were not missing
any clues.
</P>
<P>
   But that request set off another dispute, officials said. The
agency's station chief, the highest ranking CIA officer in Nairobi,
refused to ask the Kenyans for access to the Al-Haramain suspects,
insisting that he had pushed his local counterparts far enough. The
station chief said he did not want to strain his relations with the
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials at CIA headquarters urged the station chief to
reconsider, but they said the decision was ultimately his, and he
held his ground.
</P>
<P>
   There were no interviews. Because the documents seized from the
group's offices showed no evidence of a bombing plot, the CIA soon
dropped its investigation. Without any evidence against
Al-Haramain, the agency concluded that its informant was not
credible, officials said. Kenya washed its hands of the group,
ordering the nine deported.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of the counter-terrorism team were furious,
officials said, and complained that their investigation had been
dangerously short-circuited. They felt they were unable to conduct
a thorough investigation without talking to the suspects
themselves. Some team members blamed the decision on the station
chief's lack of field experience; he was a career analyst from the
CIA's directorate of intelligence on his first overseas espionage
assignment. Embassy officials say they were not aware of the
internal CIA dispute, and add that they assumed at the time that it
was the Kenyans who had denied access to the suspects. ``Why would
you not want to interview them?'' asked one State Department
official.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell was told of the findings of the inquiry, and
assured that the threat had been eliminated by the arrests. In
fact, there were some lingering questions. Some intelligence
officials believed at the time that members of the charity were
tied to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   It was, perhaps, another clue about possible terrorist activity
in Kenya. However, the CIA did not circulate any intelligence
reports throughout the rest of the government about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Today, intelligence officials insist there is no evidence
linking the group to the embassy bombings. But they say they now
have evidence that connects them to bin Laden. The agency's
inspector general is examining the case.
</P>
<P>
   A third warning surfaced in November, 1997. Mustafa Mahmoud Said
Ahmed, an Egyptian, walked into the embassy and told CIA officers
he knew of a group that was planning to detonate a bomb-laden truck
inside the diplomats' underground parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interrogation by Kenyan security officials, which
was relayed to the Americans, Ahmed made his own involvement in the
plot clear, saying he had already taken surveillance photos of the
embassy for the attack, which he said was to involve several
vehicles and stun grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA issued two intelligence reports on Ahmed's statements,
but cautioned in its reports that Ahmed may have fabricated his
story, thus downplaying the significance of the warning.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed is now being held in jail in Tanzania in connection
with the Dar es Salaam embassy bombing, and U.S. officials still
aren't sure what to make of his 1997 warning.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings in August and November prompted Ms. Bushnell to
renew her case for a new embassy.
</P>
<P>
   On December 15, 1997, she sent a report back to State Department
headquarters warning that the embassy's location made it
``extremely vulnerable to a terrorist attack,'' and that it had to
be replaced with a more secure building.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, on December 24th, she sent another
cable noting again that ``the embassy's security profile, in a
congested, downtown location, is cause for serious concern,'' and
asked for a comprehensive review of the embassy's security status.
</P>
<P>
   She also asked that State Department officials go back to
Congress to ask for more money in order to fund a new Nairobi
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials were not swayed, arguing that the dangers were
nonexistent or already dissipated. Ahmed's warning, one senior
official said, had been largely discounted as not credible. The
Kenyans had taken care of the more serious threat, he said, by
arresting members of al-Haramain.
</P>
<P>
   In a January 1998 budget review concerning embassy construction
funding, which included Undersecretary of State for Management
Bonnie Cohen and other senior officials, Ms. Bushnell's request was
not seriously considered, officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to her warnings of a worsening terrorist threat,
in a January 1998 cable, Ms. Bushnell was told by headquarters that
other embassy projects had priority, and that a new Nairobi embassy
was not in the State Department's future plans.
</P>
<P>
   The cable said that headquarters agreed that a ``new chancery
would be ideal,'' but that State ``had reviewed the case and
understood her concerns'' and had turned her down. In fact, the
State Department had a long wish list of embassies it eventually
wanted to replace, and Nairobi was not on it.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and State Department officials say that, prior to
the August embassy bombings, State asked Congress to include funds
in its fiscal 1999 budget for only two new embassies _ in Beijing
and Berlin. Those were the only new embassies the State Department
had sought congressional funding for since at least fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell's increasingly insistent demands for a new embassy
were so far out of step with the State Department's plans that
officials at headquarters were beginning to see her as a nuisance
who was obsessed by security, according to one official familiar
with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to the terrorist threats, Ms. Bushnell had other
reasons for concern about security, including street crime and
local political violence.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, the CIA's deputy station chief in Nairobi was
mugged near the building. Ms. Bushnell, officials disclosed, had
been told about a plot to kill her in early 1998 as well. And local
police refused to guard the embassy, and sometimes beat up
political dissidents right in front of the building, according to
an American official.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even similar warnings from other senior government
officials failed to persuade the State Department to change its
mind. Zinni sent a cable to the State Department warning that the
embassy was vulnerable to a terrorist attack after having seen
security conditions at the embassy for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the cable, Zinni offered to send a security team from CentCom
to review security at the embassy, but his offer was turned down by
the State Department because it already was planning to send its
own team to placate Ms. Bushnell. In March 1998, a team from
diplomatic security and the foreign building office, which handles
embassy leases and construction projects, arrived in Nairobi to
conduct a security review.
</P>
<P>
   In March, officials updated the security assessment last
conducted at the embassy in 1994, and found that the embassy was in
compliance with the security standards the State Department had
established for a post facing a medium terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
   Security recommendations made in 1994 had been carried out, the
review found. A week later, the team sent out from Washington
conducted its review, and proposed about $500,000 worth of new
security measures, including the installation of a new fence around
the front parking lot, upgrading perimeter surveillance, and
construction of a fence in front of the embassy's front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   In March, funding for a special roll-down door for the
underground parking garage was approved. Two months later, funding
for a similar door for the front entrance of the building and a new
perimeter fence was approved. But by the time of the attack, only
the garage door had been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the attack, the State Department said it had
been planning to spend about $3 million in 1999 to upgrade security
at the embassy. But officials now acknowledge that most of the
money was earmarked for interior remodeling, and only a small
portion was to go for security. ``We felt they shouldn't bother to
renovate,'' one official said. ``We said they should use that money
for a new building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the bombings, the Clinton administration has also
asked Congress for $1.8 billion to improve security at diplomatic
posts around the world, and to build new embassies in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam. On Friday, the Crowe panel included among its
recommendations that State spend an additional $1.4 a year over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   And just before Christmas, the State Department briefly closed
the embassy in Nairobi after the U.S. was warned that bin Laden and
his group might be ready to strike again.

ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN  
 UPSETS MAKE MARK IN ANNALS OF NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The colonists did it to England. Truman did it to
Dewey in '48. The '69 Mets did it to the baseball world. And the
'80 U.S. Olympic hockey team did it to the Big Bad Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Arizona Cardinals hand a major upset to the Minnesota
Vikings on Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   The oddsmakers, who have installed the Vikings (15-1) as
15{-point favorites, say no, even though one is never wise to give
his grandmother more than 10 points in any NFL game, much less a
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   But history tends to support the oddsmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, when the NFL began its playoff seeding system, only
two of the 64 teams to play in the first round of the playoffs have
reached the Super Bowl. Buffalo did it in 1992, as did Denver,
which won last year.
</P>
<P>
   But even their wild rides came with an asterisk. Buffalo and
Denver each hosted first-round games.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, yes, the 1980 Oakland Raiders won Super Bowl XV,
but at the time each conference supplied only two wild-card teams
and Oakland entered the playoffs with an 11-5 record, which was
tied with four others for the AFC's best mark.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is the best teams tend to win, save for those
rare occasions that could be called ``historic upsets,'' a category
in which a Cardinals win Sunday would fit easily.
</P>
<P>
   When major NFL playoff upsets come to mind, perhaps the first on
the list is Joe Namath's ``guaranteed'' 16-7 win over the Baltimore
Colts, a 17{-point favorite in Super Bowl III. Or perhaps Kansas
City's 23-7 romp over Minnesota in Super Bowl IV.
</P>
<P>
   But were they truly upsets? Was it a disparity of talent that
made them upsets, or did their underdog status stem more from the
public's old-line NFL prejudice against the upstart American
Football League, which became the AFC after a merger?
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. In retrospect and being of sound mind, would you
give a solid team quarterbacked by a healthy Namath 17{ points
against one led by Earl Morrall, with a sore-armed Johnny Unitas
held in reserve?
</P>
<P>
   ``For two weeks we were told how we were going to lose,'' Namath
recalled about his prediction that the Jets would win. ``When you
keep hearing your team isn't going to win, you get angry and
frustrated. Then anger festers. Anger is a good thing to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Namath's prediction came at a Miami Touchdown Club meeting that
wasn't even on his agenda that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed and thought it was a joke,'' recalls Baltimore's
Hall of Fame tight end John Mackey. ``That was our problem. We had
the wrong attitude and decided he was just a quarterback running
his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl IV, Minnesota (12-2) was favored by 14{ points but
fell behind Len Dawson-led Kansas City (11-3) by 20 points at
halftime and never challenged. &QL; 
1940 shocker &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the Jets' upset is indelibly etched in history, Cardinals
owner Bill Bidwill says it still takes a back seat to the Chicago
Bears' 73-0 win in the 1940 championship game over a Washington
Redskins team that had beaten it during the season. Bidwill
attended the title game as a 9-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The score alone makes it the biggest upset,'' he said. ``This
was the two good teams in a championship game. It was bitterly
cold, and my family and I left at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that Sammy Baugh gave his famous quote. Someone asked
him after the game if an apparent touchdown pass he threw but was
dropped on Washington's first drive would have made a difference.
Baugh said, `Yeah, it probably would have been 73-7.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to Bidwill, should the famed 1934 championship
game, historically known as the ``Sneakers Game,'' be overlooked.
The New York Giants (8-5) beat the Bears (13-0) by a 30-13 count on
a frozen field at the Polo Grounds. The Giants tossed the Bears a
curve by ditching their cleats at halftime and donning sneakers. &QL; 
Bad Broncos memories &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In modern times, the biggest playoff upset has to be expansion
Jacksonville's 30-27 wi over Denver (13-3) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe said, ``It's a loss that will
take until the year 2000 to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Due to the hangover that loss provided, the Broncos
dubbed last year's playoff season the ``Revenge Tour.'' Starting
with Jacksonville in the first round, they also exorcised ghosts by
beating Kansas City and Pittsburgh, which beat them during the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The memory still stings so deeply that nobody in the Broncos
organization would agree to an interview this week to talk about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been one of the most successful years in their history
after missing the playoffs,'' said Cardinals vice president of
player personnel Bob Ferguson, who came to Arizona from the same
position in Denver that year. ``I don't know if Denver took them
lightly, but I think Tom Coughlin and those guys believed more in
what they could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver talked about that game for a whole year. I don't know
if they would have won the Super Bowl last year if they had won
that game.'' &QL; 
Colts came close &QL; 
If that isn't enough to give the Cardinals hope, then Coach Vince
Tobin can present them with another example.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin was the Colts defensive coordinator during their
improbable drive to the AFC championship game in 1995, where they
lost to Pittsburgh, 20-16, when a Hail Mary pass fell incomplete on
the game's last play.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, the Colts (9-7 in regular season) went into
Kansas City (13-3) and knocked off a team favored by 12, by a 10-7
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole deal was very similar to the year we've had,''
Tobin said. ``We had to struggle to get into the playoffs and had
to win our last game. We had to play San Diego on the road and then
had to go to Kansas City, which had the best record in the
conference and the home-field advantage . . . a lot of similarities
to our situation now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough, physical game and we played extremely well on
defense. Our mindset was that we could win, because we thought we
were a pretty good team even if our record didn't indicate it. It's
very similar to now. Our team is confident we can win, even though
nobody else thinks so. Our quarterback, Jim Harbaugh, was nicknamed
`Comeback Jim' for leading so many comebacks, just like Jake has
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Minnesota, a four-time Super Bowl loser, also staged
one of the top modern upsets in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Saddled with three losses from strike-team players, and losers
of three of their final four regular-season games, the Vikings
(9-7) played at San Francisco, a 14-point favorite that went 13-2
in the regular season and was armed with Joe Montana. The Vikings
won, 36-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a hard time that week,'' said Vikings Coach Dennis
Green, then a 49ers assistant under Bill Walsh. ``It had rained all
week and we didn't practice well and we were sluggish. Anthony
Carter was fabulous and set an NFL playoff record for receiving
yards that stood until (Buffalo's) Eric Moulds broke it last
week.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco owner Eddie DeBartolo was so incensed by the loss
that he stripped Walsh of the team presidency, which most NFL
insiders say is the reason Walsh resigned after winning the Super
Bowl the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Before their miracle run ended in a 46-10 Super Bowl thrashing
by the Bears in 1985, New England shocked the LA Raiders, 27-20, in
the first round, then stunned a heavily favored Miami Dolphins team
that had beaten them twice that year, 31-14, in Miami, where they
hadn't won since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   See, it can be done. Just not often. &QL;

UNHEEDED WARNINGS: A SPECIAL REPORT ON THE EMBASSY BOMBING IN
KENYA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change ``her first interview'' to ``a rare interview'' in
11th graf. No other changes.) (Eds: A long version has moved as EMBASSY-BOMBS.)

 By JAMES RISEN and BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to
Kenya, sent an emotional letter to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright begging for the secretary's personal help.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, a career diplomat, had been fighting for months
for a more secure embassy in the face of mounting terrorist threats
and a warning that she was the target of an assassination plot. The
department had repeatedly refused to grant her request, citing a
lack of money. But that kind of response, she wrote Albright, was
``endangering the lives of embassy personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA and the FBI had been amassing increasingly ominous and
detailed clues about potential threats in Kenya, officials said.
But the State Department bureaucracy still dismissed Ms. Bushnell.
She was even seen by some at the State Department as a nuisance who
was overly obsessed with security, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
   Albright took no action. And three months later, on Aug. 7, the
American Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were simultaneously
attacked with car bombs. Twelve American diplomats and more than
200 Africans were killed in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has acknowledged that Ms. Bushnell raised
questions about security before the bombing. But a close
examination of events in the year before the assaults, based on
interviews with officials throughout the U.S. government, shows her
concerns were more intense, more well-founded, more specific, and
more forcefully expressed than has previously been known.
</P>
<P>
   The review shows that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA repeatedly told State Department officials in
Washington and in the Kenya Embassy that there was an active
terrorist cell in Kenya connected to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
exile who is accused of masterminding the attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA and FBI investigated at least three terrorist threats
in Nairobi in the year before the bombing and took one seriously
enough to send a counter-terrorism team from CIA headquarters. The
agency ultimately concluded that threat was unfounded, but some
officials believe the inquiry was botched, and the agency's
inspector general is investigating how it was handled.
</P>
<P>
   _ State Department officials brushed aside Gen. Anthony Zinni,
commander of the U.S. Central Command, who had visited Nairobi on
his own and warned that the Nairobi embassy was an easy and
tempting target for terrorists. Zinni's offer to send his own
specialists to review security in Nairobi was turned down by the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   _ The State Department had all but abandoned the commitment it
made after the 1983 bombing of the Beirut embassy to improve
embassy security. Department officials had long since stopped
asking Capitol Hill for the money needed to meet its own standards,
and had adopted a strategy of improving the handful of embassies it
believed were at greatest risk. Nairobi was not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell, in a rare interview about the bombing, said by
telephone from Nairobi on Friday: ``This is a tragedy in the real
sense of the word, and it's a tragedy that has caused us to think
differently. We no longer operate under the assumptions that we did
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A report made public Friday by a commission appointed by
Albright excoriated the State Department for failing to safeguard
American missions against terrorist attacks, particularly for the
practice of giving vulnerable missions like the one in Nairobi
lower priority when experience shows they make tempting targets for
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, signed by Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concluded that ``intelligence provided
no immediate tactical warning of the August 7 attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, classified cable traffic and intelligence reports, which
were not included in the public version of Crowe's report, show
that while none of the warnings gathered by American intelligence
in the year before the bombings pointed to a particular act of
terrorism on a particular day, the United States had growing
evidence that the embassy was a target of terrorist plots, and that
terrorists hostile to American interests were active in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were sympathetic to
Ms. Bushnell's concerns. They added that it was impossible to
respond to each terrorist threat it received. Department officials
also assert that even if Ms. Bushnell's requests had been granted,
a new embassy could not have been in place in time to prevent the
attack in August.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were told at the time by the CIA that the
threats in Nairobi had either proved unfounded or had been dealt
with by Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Ms. Bushnell began raising
concerns about the embassy's security soon after her arrival in
Nairobi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She sent two cables to headquarters in December 1997, outlining
the dangers and asking for a new embassy. Her request was not
seriously considered, officials said, when senior State Department
officials met in January 1998 at the State Department to set a
budget for embassy construction in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up on the radar screen,'' said one senior
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Ms. Bushnell to try her end-run with Albright. In
memos sent in April and May, she asked Albright to cite Nairobi's
vulnerability to Congress in seeking more funds for security. In
addition, Ms. Bushnell was lobbying every senior American official
and member of Congress who came to Nairobi. The ambassador would
say, ``How do you like our building? I think it's terrible,''
according to an American official. Ms. Bushnell ``did not want to
be in that building,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the terrorist threats investigated by the CIA
panned out, they focused Ms. Bushnell's attention on just how
vulnerable her embassy was. ``If you know there is a viper's nest
around, then that gives you pause,'' one State Department official
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the global investigation touched off by the
1993 World Trade Center bombing had focused on bin Laden and his
associates. FBI agents from New York were hard at work building a
criminal case against the Saudi exile. At the same time, the CIA
was tracking the group's movements and finances in hopes of
preventing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   One trail led to Kenya where the agency discovered that bin
Laden's operatives were living in the country. Intelligence
officials say they briefed Ms. Bushnell about the presence of the
group in early 1997 but told her there was no evidence of a
specific threat against the embassy or American interests in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, American intelligence officials began to
look more closely at what bin Laden was doing in Africa. The CIA
identified an intriguing suspect: Wadih el Hage, a Lebanese-born
American citizen in Kenya who was believed to have close ties to
the leadership of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   American officials prodded their Kenyan counterparts to raid el
Hage's home in Nairobi, an overture that was shared with Ms.
Bushnell and others in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police, accompanied by the CIA and FBI, searched the
house in August 1997. They found his computer, downloaded its
files, and read a letter describing the existence of an ``East
African cell'' of bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the letter mentioned recent attempts by American
intelligence to investigate the group's Kenyan operations and
alluded to its role in attacking American soldiers in Somalia a few
years earlier. According to the document, the group had moved a
cache of incriminating files from el Hage's house and hidden them
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That reference set off alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   American officials suspected that the missing files might
contain evidence of an upcoming attack by bin Laden's Kenyan
operatives. The working theory, officials said, was that such a
plot would be aimed at another country, with Nairobi used as a
``jumping off point.''
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official said American investigators began a
``somewhat frantic, concerted effort'' to locate the missing files.
``The concern was high enough about something being out there to go
right away,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, a second search was conducted in Kenya
at another location in September 1997. This time, a State
Department official from the embassy joined the CIA, FBI and
Kenyans. No files were found.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI interviewed el Hage, who had moved to the United States,
three times, but he professed to know little of bin Laden or his
activities in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Today, el Hage is in jail in New York, awaiting trial on charges
of lying in those interviews and conspiring with bin Laden to kill
Americans abroad. He has not been directly linked to the bombings
in Kenya, but has been accused of being one of the Saudi exile's
chief lieutenants, responsible for setting up front companies in
Kenya and seeking components for chemical weapons. He has pleaded
not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CIA and FBI believed at the time that they had
uncovered a potentially dangerous terrorist group linked to bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials insist that they were not told of
this and stress that they were given only a ``fragmentary''
understanding of the reasons for the raid on el Hage's house.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were told only that the CIA was
assisting a criminal investigation by the New York FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time were we told he was connected to Osama bin Laden or
to any threat against U.S. interests in Kenya,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another State Department official said: ``If we had known there
was a significant bin Laden network in Kenya we would have gotten
our people the hell out of that building.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence and law enforcement officials strongly dispute the
State Department's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, said one intelligence official, was
briefed about the presence of bin Laden's operatives in Kenya
``before, during and after'' the August 1997 raid on el Hage's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, intelligence officials said the CIA sent the
State Department numerous reports detailing the activities of el
Hage and others linked to bin Laden in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those reports referred to Osama bin Laden in the first
paragraph,'' recalled one U.S. intelligence official.

NBA SCHEDULES FAR FROM READY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns and the 28 other NBA teams are awaiting word
from the league about their lockout-shortened season, and the
50-game schedules for teams, which initially were expected next
week, may not be released until training camps begin.
</P>
<P>
   And even the schedule for exhibition games and scrimmages still
must be worked out. The Suns will hold some open practices when
training camp begins, probably on Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The league also announced that each team will play two
exhibition games, where possible, with one on the road and one at
home. And there will be no charge for admission to those games.
</P>
<P>
   However, Suns General Manager  &UR; Bryan Colangelo said those games
are subject to availability of buildings. America West Arena is
booked until right before the announced start of the season, Feb.
5, but Colangelo said the club is working on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, it's going to be tough because our
building is so booked up,'' Colangelo said, citing a Disney on Ice
show, a pro wrestling event and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns don't want to toss  &UR; Mickey Mouse, and Colangelo said
the wrestling shows are big money makers for a building that is
owned by the city, managed by the Suns and also occupied by the NHL
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a signed contract is in place, it would be very difficult
to change,'' he said. ``And it would be self-serving to try and
kick someone out. Believe it or not, those wrestling events are
very profitable and successful for the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a date that may be available, and trying to
determine if one of the other events can change their load-in
plans. We may have to go to another facility. We're looking at
that, too.'' &QL; 
The KJ question &QL; 
Although the NBA's salary-cap rules have changed, and thus the Suns
are having to adjust their plans for putting together their team
for the upcoming season, one thing hasn't changed:  &UR; Kevin Johnson
won't be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The club and KJ announced a parting of the ways after last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was made pretty clear . . . that he'll be playing
somewhere else or he won't be playing,'' Colangelo said. ``I saw
that he was in New York, so I assume he's going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached during the lockout, KJ would not comment on the labor
lockout or his plans. &QL; 
Another viewpoint &QL; 
Although fans have been victimized by the now-settled lockout, Suns
Coach &UR; Danny Ainge said they'll eventually benefit from the new
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There shouldn't be as much need to raise ticket prices,'' he
said. ``They've had to do it because of the rising costs, but if
they can control spending it shouldn't hurt the fans, it should
help them.'' &QL;

WHERE IS JORDAN AND WHAT ARE HIS PLANS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BKN-SEASON) 
(mk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan has disappeared. It's not the first time. Usually
when Michael Jordan vanishes, he's overhead, soaring in his
customary Air Jordan, First in Flight fashion. People now are
looking for Jordan because they want an answer to the question they
have been asking since he sank the winning jump shot from the top
of the key in the final game of the 1998 National Basketball
Association championship series in Salt Lake City in June.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the question most prominent in basketball circles is:
Will M.J. or won't M.J. play basketball for profit again? Or is he
retired from the game, the Bulls, the NBA and fans' hoop hearts
once and for all? That is, has he gone finally over the hill,
lugging his mashie and niblick and hoping to triumph over par
instead of torturing people like the Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Chicago Bulls' office elicited this reply: ``He's
not around here as far as we know. There was a rumor he was in New
York. But last we heard he was in the Bahamas playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's agent, David Falk, said by phone Friday that Jordan was
``out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be back until early next week,'' Falk added, ``and he
won't make a decision until he returns. How soon after that will he
decide, I have no idea. I'm not sure he does. But for now, he's
sitting on a $50 million cap with the Bulls, and they can't really
sign anyone until he decides.''
</P>
<P>
   Others yet to be signed by the Bulls include two additional
stars of their recent championship teams, Scottie Pippen and Dennis
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has had quite a long time to consider whether he will
come back but, Falk said, ``things were up in the air with the
lockout. So Michael will make his decision when he feels
comfortable. He wants to be careful and make the right decision for
himself. It's his career, it's his future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas had previously been checked out. A caller to the
hotel where Jordan was supposed to be staying asked for Michael
Jordan. ``Sorry,'' came the reply, ``no one by that name is
registered.'' The caller then asked for the alias Jordan often
uses.
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist said the person registered under that name had
checked out.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the upper reaches of Bulls management said privately
the other day that he did not believe Jordan was going to return to
basketball. Charles Barkley said Jordan had told him that it was
curtains for his career. Billy Hunter, executive director of the
players association, said he believed Jordan probably would be
back.
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan may not tip his hand until the new collective
bargaining agreement is signed in a few days and teams go back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that Jordan's return hinges on whether Pippen
returns to the Bulls. Jordan has never won a championship _ he has
six in the last eight years _ without his smooth forward. Pippen
has said he will never play for the Bulls again because he bears
such enmity toward management, but he has said on more than one
occasion that he would never play for the Bulls again, and has.
(Some believe that Pippen's decision hinges on Jordan's.)
</P>
<P>
   Early last season, Jordan said he would not entertain thoughts
of playing another season if Phil Jackson did not return as the
Bulls' coach. Jackson has made it definite that he will not return.
Jordan, meanwhile, has changed his tune, saying he might play for
another coach if he felt like it.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bulls coach will surely be Tim Floyd, and Jordan has
said he was impressed with what Floyd had been doing _ studying the
Jackson style of play, which would make Jordan comfortable _ and
what Floyd had been saying (Floyd had been effusive in his praise
for Jackson and Jordan).
</P>
<P>
   And then others contend that the perfect way for any great
athlete to go out is when on top. Jordan certainly did that last
season, hitting the winner in the final game. Not only that, but at
age 35, he was the league's leading scorer for the 10th time and
the most valuable player for the fifth time. And the MVP in the
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is playing as well or better an all-round game than he
ever has. While he does not ascend above the hoop as frequently, he
can still lift off when the occasion arises.
</P>
<P>
   And he loves the competition. His late father once said, ``My
son doesn't have a gambling problem, he has a competition
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In a shortened, 50-game regular season, Jordan would not have to
work quite as hard or as often as before. He remains in excellent
shape.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, the lockout and the labor battle have left fans
with a taste of ashes in their mouths. Not only do the Bulls need
Jordan, but the league feels it does. Even rival players hope
Jordan will come back to ease tensions and excite the cash
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may feel some allegiance to the NBA _ after all, it gave
him his global platform _ but, even more, Jordan relishes coming
through when he's needed most.

EVANS GRATEFUL TO THOMPSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - R &UR; ob Evans remembers riding the bus from the Kingdome
in Seattle in April 1984 after Georgetown and  &UR; Patrick Ewing beat
Houston and  &UR; Hakeem (then known as Akeem)  &UR; Olajuwon to win the
Final Four. The bus was filled with assistant coaches, and Evans
was one of them. Now the first-year head coach at Arizona State
after six years at Mississippi, Evans was at Texas Tech back then.
</P>
<P>
   Evans recalled the pride he and other African-American coaches
felt, while also understanding the significance of what just
happened. Which was this:
 &UR; John Thompson had just become the first Black coach to lead a team
to college basketball's national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many of those coaches were beaming,''
Evans said Friday, shortly after Thompson announced he was
resigning as Georgetown's coach after 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Right then, Evans said, he and other minority coaches knew that
if anyone had any lingering doubts about anyone's qualifications,
they were dispelled for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like, `Now people can see we can coach the game,' ''
Evans said. ``Now people can see we can do it right and discipline
kids. Now there are going to be some doors open.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans became the first Black coach at Ole Miss after 24 years as
an assistant. His first coaching job was at his alma mater, New
Mexico State, and he said he first became acquainted with Thompson
by watching Thompson's high school team in Washington, D.C., play.
That began a long friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been around to encourage me, to give me insight
into what to expect,'' Evans said. ``Being a new coach, being an
African-American coach, on and on. He and  &UR; Nolan Richardson and
 &UR; John Chaney and  &UR; George Raveling are really good friends and have
really helped me through some troubling times.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times I'd call John or drop him a line, seek his
counsel or advice, and he always responded. He doesn't always say
what you want to hear, but that's what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, Evans said he was shocked at the news. But, hearing
that Thompson said he was quitting to devote attention to his
troubled marriage, Evans said he understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, you can't have distractions and be
successful,'' Evans said. ``It's a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week
job.'' &QL; 
Different sport &QL; 
Hyped right here, in addition to there and everywhere, after
beating North Carolina, the California Golden Bears promptly went
into hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   Cal lost at home to Oregon in overtime, then played even worse
before escaping with a two-point victory over Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   It took  &UR; Michael Gill's layup with 3.5 seconds left to beat the
Beavers, 54-52. Cal shot 22 percent in the first half, 29 percent
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   A pregame talk in which Coach  &UR; Ben Braun cited the San Francisco
49ers' last-second win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFL
playoffs didn't seem to help much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to really understand what  &UR; Steve Young said,''
Braun said. ``That he didn't hesitate to to go to  &UR; Terrell Owens
just because he dropped four passes. . . . You still have to have
confidence in yourself and in your teammates.'' &QL; 
Declawed &QL; 
The young UCLA Bruins still have a lot of growing up to do. Coming
off their overtime victory over ASU in the friendly confines of
Pauley Pavilion, the bear cubs ventured north to play ostensibly
the weakest team in the Pac-10, Oregon State. They lost, 65-63.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing, in addition to the result, was that UCLA took
41 more shots than the Beavers. 41! But they made fewer than 29
percent, shooting 4 for 27 from three-point range. Freshman forward
 &UR; JaRon Rush was 0 for 7 from beyond the arc. Freshman  &UR; Dan Gadzuric
1 of 9 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our first time on the road, and I think it got to us
tonight,'' Rush said. &QL; 
Stormy weather &QL; 
No, the Weather Channel didn't televise the game between the Red
Storm of St. John's and the Miami Hurricanes. But the way St.
John's approached the game, the forecast was bleak.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm was so flat prior to its 84-79 loss that even a
security guard working at Miami Arena noticed. The guard mentioned
to Coach  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Jarvis that this wasn't the same scrappy, hustling team he saw on
television. Jarvis then suggested the fellow tell the players
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in here and said, `I thought you guys were all that,'
'' forward
 &UR; Ron Artest told the ``New York Daily News.'' ``I don't think he
ever played basketball, but he knew that we had no fire in our
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped St. John's nine-game winning streak. But let's
not sell the Hurricanes short. This is a talented team, and Miami
Coach  &UR; Leonard
 &UR; Hamilton told them they were playing as well as anyone in the Big
East.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sure thing St. John's will be more inspired for the Feb.
3 rematch in New York. Artest said he saw some Miami players
``laughing and stuff, disrespecting us,'' he said, citing  &UR; Dwayne
Wimbley as the main culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see him again,'' Artest said. &QL; 
Standing up to Spartans &QL; 
Just when you think Michigan State has turned the corner, the
Spartans run into a roadblock. In this case, it was Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State is like the neighborhood bully, picking on the
little guys but running away when someone rough and tough stands up
to it. The 12th-ranked Spartans' seven-game winning streak ended
when they lost to the No. 24 Badgers, the fourth defeat in four
games against ranked opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Spartans' first Big Ten game and the third for
Wisconsin, which provided a ready-made excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wisconsin, they played hungry,'' Spartans forward  &UR; Morris
Peterson said. ``They had played two Big Ten games, and I felt like
they had a little advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Preseason All-America point guard  &UR; Mateen Cleaves, who started
slowly this season but had come on strong of late, was 3 for 11
with two assists and four turnovers. &QL; 
No show &QL; 
DePaul is inducting its 1978-79 Final Four team into the school's
athletic Hall of Fame today, but  &UR; Ray Meyer won't be there.
</P>
<P>
   That's like holding an ``Andy Griffith Show'' reunion without
 &UR; Don Knotts.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was the head coach of that team, and a lot of other DePaul
teams. He was the Blue Demons' coach for 42 years, retiring in 1984
with 724 victories, currently the 10th-highest total in NCAA
Division I history.
</P>
<P>
   But he never has gotten over the firing of his son,  &UR; Joey, who
succeeded him as coach. Joey Meyer was fired in 1997 after
successive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too hard for me at this time,'' Ray Meyer explained
to the ``Chicago Tribune.'' ``I know it's (strange) I won't be
there, but that's only one night of my life. I have to live my
whole life. There's no animosity anymore. It would be uncomfortable
for me. . . . So I don't want to subject myself to that.'' &QL;

DAVIS PICKING UP DEVILS WITH HIS `GAR BAGE GAME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Derrick Davis, Arizona State's junior swingman,
is called ``Smooth'' by his teammates for his mellow, quiet
demeanor off the court.
</P>
<P>
   That makes sense because the name fits his playing style like a
very large person who goes by ``Tiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is no klutz, but he isn't the picture of grace, either.
He's a digger, a hard-nosed grinder who likes to play defense and,
at 6-foot-4, mix it up inside with the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough,'' ASU Coach Rob Evans said. ``A tough country
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is ``kind of a throwback, in a sense,'' assistant Coach
Tony Benford said. ``He does a lot of intangibles.''
</P>
<P>
   Things such as diving on the floor for loose balls and
rebounding and defending, which ASU will need in its game tonight
against scrappy Washington State. Scoring? That's a bonus. But in
Monday's overtime loss to UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, someone
resembling Davis and wearing Davis' No. 14 scored 16 points and
generally impersonated a go-to guy. It was, in fact, Derrick Davis,
whose previous ASU high was nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could do it,'' said Davis, who made two three-point
baskets, which matched his total for the previous 13 games. ``I had
to step it up. They were playing hard on Eddie (House). A lot of
people are going to be crowding him, so I figured it was my
opportunity to step it up. Do whatever it takes to win. But we
didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday against Washington, Davis was scoreless until he
connected on another three-pointer with 4:08 remaining. That came
in the midst of nine straight points after the Huskies got to
within 12. ASU ended up winning by 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not looking for him to come out and start shooting
three-point jump shots,'' Evans said. ``That's not his game. His
game is slashing to the basket, his game is defending. It's a
garbage game, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans means that as a compliment. He loves players like Davis.
He might wish they had more talent, but he appreciates and respects
their effort and willingness to get their noses bloodied.
</P>
<P>
   Or their jaws smacked. Against Southern California last week,
USC guard Jeff Trepagnier was so irked at Davis' cloying defense,
he hit him in the jaw. Trepagnier was called for an intentional
foul, although an ejection probably was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me with a cheap shot,'' said Davis, who thought
better of retaliating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that,'' he said. ``You've got to keep your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how sensible, small-town folks think, and Davis is from a
small town _ Abbeville, Ala., located near the Florida panhandle.
It's so small it doesn't have a Web site. He attended Cowley County
Community College in Kansas after failing to register the necessary
ACT score and was a pretty good scorer there last year, averaging
more than 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   But with House, Mike Batiste and Bobby Lazor handling most of
the offense for the Sun Devils, Davis went back to concentrating on
the type of defense his old high school coach instilled in him and
adhering to the fundamentals preached by his father and uncle, both
of whom were high school coaches. He has guarded players that range
from 6-8 forward Alex Jensen of Utah to UCLA guard Earl Watson, who
goes about 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Like fellow juco transfers Alton Mason and Lohnnie Tape, Davis
has found the transition to Division I challenging, both in the
classroom and on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of rough,'' he said. ``In junior college,
everybody wasn't good. Here, everybody's good. But I know now I can
be more aggressive. I'm feeling more comfortable.'' &QL;

WILDCATS TO ADMIT KERR TO EXCLUSIVE CLUB TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN J. PEDERSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Arizona's healthy crop of talented freshmen have seen a
lot this season, but today they'll witness the rarest of events in
Wildcats sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to today's 4 p.m. game against Washington, former Wildcats
great Steve Kerr will become only the second Arizona basketball
player to have his jersey hung from the rafters at McKale Center
and just the fourth athlete in any sport to earn the honor.
</P>
<P>
   At most colleges, having your uniform number retired is the
reward for having an outstanding career, one filled with dozens of
memorable events that grandfathers might tell their grandchildren
some day. But at Arizona, the criterion is simplified yet
incredibly stringent.
</P>
<P>
   Only those players who have been named NCAA Player of the Year
in their respective sport can have their number retired. That short
list includes baseball player Terry Francona, softball great Susie
Parra and Sean Elliot, Kerr's teammate on the Wildcats' 1988 Final
Four team. Softball pitcher Nancy Evans is also on the list, but
her number has yet to be retired.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr, who never did better than being a Second Team AP
All-American but was named the NCAA's Most Courageous Player in
'88, was given a special exception by Arizona athletic director Jim
Livengood because of what he meant to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great decision,'' said freshman Richard
Jefferson, one of a handful of current players that might someday
join Elliot and Kerr above the court at McKale. ``I know a lot
about Steve Kerr and the impact he had on his team.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr was never the best player on the court, from his time at
Arizona when he was called ``Opie'' by Coach Lute Olson and others,
to his pro days where he has won three NBA championship rings with
the Chicago Bulls, hitting the winning shot in the '97 finals.
</P>
<P>
   He never scored more than 30 points in a game, but has been
remembered as one of the most beloved players in school history.
Part of that came from his performance against Arizona State in
'88, just days after his father was killed in the Middle East.
Jefferson considers Kerr an inspiration to himself and his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a guy like Steve Kerr, whose not exactly the most
gifted of players, but he comes out and plays the best that he
can,'' Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Michael Wright often watched Kerr on television with
the Bulls while growing up in the Chicago area. He said he believes
it was a good decision to go away from Arizona's strict policy in
this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves it because of all the things he did when he was
playing here,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr is 12th all-time on the school's scoring list with 1,445
points, and eighth on the assists list with 443. &QL;

EBULLIENT CLINTON SPEAKS TO DETROIT CLUB ABOUT ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add six grafs to end of original text.)  (See related: IMPEACH, IMPEACH-CANING, IMPEACH-ASSESS,
IMPEACH-CAUCUS, IMPEACH-SCENE) 
(JT) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The stock market is in record territory. The economic
expansion just hit its 93rd month, making this the longest
peacetime period of sustained growth in American history.
</P>
<P>
   And if President Clinton needed any more reason to be upbeat
when he stepped before the Economic Club of Detroit Friday, he got
it Friday morning when the Labor Department announced that the
economy had generated a resounding total of 378,000 new jobs in
December, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate moved forward in its impeachment trial, the
confluence of good economic news was just another reminder that
this president remains either the most skillful overseer of the
economy in decades, or the luckiest. If he escapes removal from
office, it will be in no small part because of his high approval
ratings, which are rooted in the nation's long run of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a somewhat cynical view, but the public values leaders on
outcomes, not character,'' said Thomas Gallagher, a political
analyst in Washington for Lehman Brothers. ``That's not to say that
character could never trump outcomes, but with these outcomes the
public doesn't want to change leaders now.''
</P>
<P>
   How much of the credit Clinton deserves is of course a matter of
debate. But he was not shy about claiming some Friday as he spoke
to 1,500 members and guests of the Economic Club of Detroit,
including hundreds of automobile industry executives, union leaders
and most of Michigan's Democratic congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We meet today at a time of an American economic renaissance,''
Clinton declared. He said the current expansion was more impressive
than past ones for several reasons, among them that it had brought
higher real incomes for most Americans and minority-group
unemployment rates that are at the lowest levels since the
government began keeping those statistics in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rising tide that is lifting all boats,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at Cobo Arena, also the site of the North American
International Auto Show, the world's largest new-car exhibit. The
automobile industry is celebrating its second-best sales year ever
and the region's economy is booming. Employers are having trouble
finding workers, particularly for low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, clearly recognizing how important the economy's
performance is to Clinton's survival in office, is making certain
that he is seen presiding over high-profile announcements of the
latest good economic news.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he announced that the federal budget surplus for
1999 would be at least $76 billion, the highest such figure ever in
dollar terms. And Friday, Clinton braved snowy runways in both
Washington and Detroit to spotlight the latest favorable trends.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides insist these are not events stage-managed
solely to divert attention from the impeachment trial. ``The
president obviously understands what's going on in the Senate,''
said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary. ``It's in the
hands of the Senate. He's focusing on his agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 35-minute address Friday afternoon, Clinton said that the
government still faced challenges in dealing with economic matters,
despite the steady flow of good news. He said that the
administration must still grapple with caring for the elderly and
providing an education to equip the nation's young to compete in
the global high-technology economy. He said that many inner cities
and rural areas have yet to share in the benefits of the nation's
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the huge volume and high speed of
international capital flows posed a threat to the stability of
nations around the world, whose problems could spread to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   And he noted that rapid growth posed problems for the
environment that must be met with new investment in
energy-efficient technologies and a reduced dependence on fossil
fuels, which contribute to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting time in which we live, and we should feel
fortunate to be here,'' Clinton said. But he added, ``The
temptation to rest on our laurels and relax because times are good
must be resisted. Good times today can become bad times tomorrow if
you don't stay ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though many of the club's members, who include a number of
auto parts company owners and executives, are Republicans, they
were interested mostly in the economy and said they wanted the
president's impeachment difficulties over as soon as possible.
Heinz Prechter, a big donor to Michigan Republicans and the
chairman and founder of ASC Inc., a manufacturer of car sun roofs,
said that while he was uncertain whether Clinton should be removed
from office, he was sure that the current political furor should be
brought to a quick conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that most of us in leadership positions can
condone what President Clinton has done, but we can't have this
public show go on forever,'' he said. And Prechter praised Friday's
speech. ``I think President Clinton hit all the hot buttons which
are of interest to our industry and our city,'' he said. ``His
speech was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Having finished his formal remarks, the president took several
questions from the audience, screened by his host, Dennis Archer,
mayor of Detroit and Clinton's choice to be co-chairman of the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in the audience wanted Clinton's views on the
impeachment trial playing out in Washington, they were
disappointed. The questions he took concerned alleged dumping of
steel by Japan, Russia and Brazil (he is against it); the new
Europe-wide currency, the euro (he is for it); and increased
spending on the military (he is for it, to a point).
</P>
<P>
   The final question came from a 12-year-old, who wanted to know
the person Clinton had met as president whom he most admired.
Clinton named Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli prime
minister, and Nelson Mandela, human rights hero and president of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hall where Clinton spoke was a small congress of
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   One held a sign reading, ``It's the perjury, stupid,'' a play on
the slogan that gained currency within Clinton's 1992 campaign
team, ``It's the economy, stupid.'' Another sign proclaimed,
``Impeach, Indict, Incarcerate.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were pro-Clinton demonstrators as well, one of whom
held a placard reading, ``GOP: Get Our President.''

MADDEN SELECTS PLUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Second-year quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer will be
named to this season's All-Madden Team by Fox TV analyst  &UR; John
Madden, it was learned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Madden annually bestows the honor upon players who personify a
blue-collar work-ethic and grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fitting,'' said  &UR; Aeneas Williams, the Cardinals five-time
Pro Bowl cornerback who works against Plummer in practice. ``He
made plays the old-fashioned way, by moving around.''
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle  &UR; James Dexter, who also does the type of grunt work
that Madden loves, upon hearing the news about Plummer, blurted
out, ``Awesome!''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, as he does an on-rushing defensive end, took it in
stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' Plummer said. ``It's a fun kind of team. I think
it's just because I've been kind of scrappy, and not afraid to get
dirty.'' &QL; 
Looking good &QL; 
Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin was upbeat Friday after what he called
three great days of practice. The Cardinals got to Minnesota as
healthy as they've been in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as people who are active, we certainly are,'' he said.
``Everybody practiced, and I think that's the first time that's
happened on Friday in probably the last three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the last two or three practices have been great. The
players' attitude, their attention to detail, I couldn't have asked
for more. We've got 48 hours before we play. We've got to retain
that and build our emotions so that Sunday we're ready to go. As
far as what we accomplished this week in practice, I think we
accomplished everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the focus ahead instead of behind is a major
accomplishment in itself, according to Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think each time that you have success it builds your
confidence and builds your ability to think that you can do even
more good things,'' Tobin said. ``That's something that until
you've experienced it I don't think anybody realizes how good you
can be.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
On Friday, Tobin declared cornerback  &UR; Ty Howard, offensive lineman
 &UR; Jerome &UR; Daniels, wide receiver  &UR; Ronnie Anderson and defensive end
 &UR; Jomo Cousins inactive.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who gets up early and has a last-minute craving to
take in the game in person, there are limited spots still available
on a charter plane available through Baker Travel. The package is
priced at $859, including air fare, ground transportation, game
ticket, and one night at the team hotel. Reservations may be made
24 hours a day at 998-8922. &QL;

CARDINALS PLAN TO KEEP TEMPE TRAINING FACILITY  
 NEW STADIUM WOULD FORCE RENT INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB PETRIE  
 and STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The Cardinals have no plans to move from their
Tempe training facility, even though their rent will increase
significantly if they move from Sun Devil Stadium to the proposed
multipurpose domed stadium at Rio Salado Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Team Vice President Michael Bidwill said the economic penalty
for the team moving its games out of Tempe will be addressed in the
lease agreement of the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy and proud of our relationship with Tempe and
happy with the facility,'' Bidwill said. ``We appreciate the things
the Tempe City Council and (former) Mayor Harry Mitchell did 11
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals move from Sun Devil Stadium but continue to
train at their Tempe facility, rent payment will zoom from zero to
$675,000 a year for the remainder of the 25-year lease, which ends
in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the use agreement being negotiated between the
Cardinals and the Rio Salado Crossing Stadium District, the team
wants the district to pay the rent of the Tempe training facility
from sales-tax surplus money raised from the project.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows the stadium district to keep 50 percent of
state sales taxes generated by the project within the district for
up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The team can use sales tax money only if there is a surplus
after the district has paid operating and maintenance costs for
that quarter of the fiscal year, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Gilbert, a Rio Salado board member, said he would be
amenable to letting the team use surplus sales taxes to pay the
Tempe lease.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe paid $6.5 million to help build the $11.3 million training
facility in 1990, with the team picking up the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Cardinals technically pay $181,000 in annual rent
to Tempe, but get all of that back from the city in lieu of the
$4.8 million the team invested in the building, Tempe Deputy City
Manager Pat Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've not paid us a nickel'' in rent, Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Should the stadium vote fail and the Cardinals continue to train
and play in Tempe, the rent will rise to $266,000 a year in 2000,
with the team paying $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   But if the vote passes and the team moves its games to Mesa,
Flynn said, the higher training-facility rent payments will help
make up lost sales-tax money from ticket sales and game day
business from fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they have such an attractive lease vs. a higher
amount if they do their games elsewhere is because of the sales tax
they generate,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals try to move training headquarters out of Tempe,
the lease calls for the team to pay the city a lump sum of $2.3
million, Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone want to train elsewhere if you've got a
world-class facility?'' Flynn asked. &QL;

HIGH WIRE TO PLAYOFFS  
 CARDS MADE RIGHT MOVES OVER 3 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The blueprint to the Cardinals' success could
have been torn up in a hurry three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Had All-Pro cornerback Aeneas Williams gone to Jacksonville and
not re-signed with the Cardinals, the first month of Coach Vince
Tobin's tenure might have been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin and Bob Ferguson, who was assistant to the president at
the time, not only got Williams to return but also persuaded
defensive tackle Eric Swann to re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one gave us a chance to sign either,'' Tobin said. ``It
sent a message to the rest of the football team that the Cardinals
were committed to turning the past around. It was huge for both to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the Cardinals are in the second round of the
NFC playoffs and will meet the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday at the
Metrodome in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, meanwhile, were in disarray at this time a year
ago. But even without stable ownership, they managed to persuade
defensive tackle John Randle, offensive tackle Todd Steussie and
running back Robert Smith to re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota chose to spend money on their own guys and spent
wisely,'' Tobin said. ``They weren't just run-of-the-mill players.
They are great players.''
</P>
<P>
   The credit for the Vikings' signings goes to Jeff Diamond, the
senior vice president of football operations. He also didn't stop
Coach Dennis Green from picking Randy Moss, the controversial
Marshall wide receiver who was the 21st pick overall.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said Diamond insisted on re-signing the players because
he knew it would affect the value of the team, which was up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings finished the regular season with the NFL's best
record and are considered the favorite to get to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, the Cardinals hadn't won a playoff game
since 1947, hadn't been to the playoffs in a non-strike season
since 1975 nor had a winning record since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're the feel-good story of the playoffs. They have the
youngest defense in the league and a second-year quarterback, Jake
Plummer, who is considered a budding star.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a blockbuster trade they made with San Diego last
March, they also have the eighth pick in this April's draft along
with their own selection, No. 21 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let up,'' Ferguson said. ``We have to stick with the
plan. Just because we re-signed Jake Plummer, we can't stop there.
We have to continue to build through the draft. The continuity of
what we're trying to do is keeping the philosophies together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was out of work when the Cardinals hired him. But he
had helped build Buffalo into a Super Bowl team and laid the
groundwork in Denver for the team that beat Green Bay in Super Bowl
XXXII last year.
</P>
<P>
   His first personnel move with the Cardinals was to sign
seven-time Pro Bowl offensive tackle Lomas Brown, whose friends in
Detroit told him he was crazy to join a perennial loser.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals then went to find a quarterback and brought in
Boomer Esiason and Kent Graham. But before they entered the 1996
regular season, the Cardinals had to solve serious salary cap
problems.
</P>
<P>
   To sign first-round pick Simeon Rice, they had to dump two of
three high-priced veterans _ running back Garrison Hearst,
linebacker Seth Joyner and defensive end Clyde Simmons _ because
none wanted to restructure their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   They chose to keep Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved Seth's leadership ability,'' Ferguson said. ``We
would have liked to have kept Seth to this day. . . . Garrison
wasn't healthy yet. He was healthy enough to pass physicals, but he
wasn't himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals surprised many by finishing 7-9 in Tobin's first
season, but they were far from being a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback remained a question mark. Running back also was a
concern. Leeland McElroy, a second-round pick in '96 at running
back, proved to be a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make mistakes,'' Ferguson said. ``We've made
some, and we're going to make some more. We try to hold them to the
minimum, but you can't be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teams were afraid of Plummer's slight build and passed
on him in the first round. The Cardinals took him with the 11th
choice in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day we picked Jake, the perception of the team changed,''
Ferguson said. ``We talked about it a long time. Everyone had to be
on the same page. We wondered, `What if he didn't play well? What
if we wasn't what we thought he'd be?' ''
</P>
<P>
   An injury to Graham allowed Plummer to start the final nine
games last season. Teams aren't very successful with a rookie
quarterback, and the Cardinals finished 4-12.
</P>
<P>
   But everything changed the day last March that the Cardinals
traded down one spot in the draft (from second overall to third)
and picked up San Diego's second-round pick, wide receiver Eric
Metcalf, linebacker Patrick Sapp and a 1999 No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made the deal happen was there were two franchise
quarterbacks (Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf), and there were enough
people who needed them and willing to pay whatever it took,''
Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals used the Chargers' pick on Florida State's Andre
Wadsworth, considered the best defensive player in the draft. Then
they added Vanderbilt defensive back Corey Chavous in the second
round and Arizona State safety Pat Tillman in the seventh. Chavous
has started the past six games and Tillman the first 11.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, running back Adrian Murrell, a 1,000-yard rusher,
was acquired from the New York Jets for a third-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   They helped the Cardinals end the NFL's longest playoff drought
at 15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson gives the credit to owner Bill Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bidwill was willing to listen and take a new direction in
the image of the football team,'' Ferguson said. ``What's really
gratifying is watching Mr. Bidwill's reaction and his family's
reaction and all their smiles.'' &QL;

TWO ARRESTED IN 1997 SLAYING OF SOLDIER AT COLORADO FORT

<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Two soldiers have been arrested in the
1997 stabbing death of an Overland Park man who was killed while
stationed at Fort Carson, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Military police arrested the men Wednesday night after
authorities received an anonymous call about the death of
20-year-old Pfc. Jason M. Chafin.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year-old St. Louis man was being held in Germany, where he
is stationed with the Army, and a 24-year-old Montgomery, Ala., man
was in custody at Fort Carson. Both had been stationed with Chafin
at Fort Carson when he disappeared Aug. 29, 1997. Rabbit hunters
found his body in a ravine about 10 miles from the fort on Dec. 26
of that year.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged, and investigators would not talk about
a motive in Chafin's death.
</P>
<P>
   Chafin had been scheduled to start duty in Kuwait when he
disappeared, but he had said he was afraid he would be killed, his
father said. Michael Chafin didn't know whether his son was talking
about a threat or about dying in military action.

PRESEASON GAME IN MEXICO LIKELY  
 CARDS MAY ALSO PLAY ON MONDAY NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The NFL is expected to inform the Cardinals by
the end of the month that they will meet the Pittsburgh Steelers in
an American Bowl preseason game next August in Monterrey, Mexico,
another indication of the team's newfound popularity.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the Cardinals' first international game since moving
to Arizona in 1988 and the franchise's first since playing in
London in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the Cardinals hadn't had a winning season since
1984 or been in the playoffs since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to playing an international game, the Cardinals are
likely next season to make their first appearance on Monday Night
Football since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see more of that,'' said Cardinals Vice
President Larry Wilson. ``That comes along with winning and having
an exciting team.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is look at the TV numbers generated the
last few weeks here and throughout the country when we've been on.
There is a lot of interest in this football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Channels 5 and 15 in Phoenix televised the Cardinals' games the
past two weeks and recorded the largest number of viewers in
station history.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Cardinals' first-round playoff victory over Dallas
drew a 35.7 rating and a 64 share on Channel 15, which also carried
the Fiesta Bowl. That national-championship game between Tennessee
and Florida State drew a 13.7 rating and 19 share.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lewin, the NFL's senior vice president-broadcasting and
network television, said the Cardinals will get strong
consideration for a Monday Night Football game next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been decided yet, and we won't make those
decisions until the spring, but they have an up-and-coming team and
an exciting young quarterback,'' Lewin said of Jake Plummer. ``The
whole country has taken note of what the Cardinals have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the team was supposed to hear from the league a week
ago about the status of the international game.
</P>
<P>
   A league source said final details still are being worked out,
but that the game is expected to be played the second or third week
of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first NFL game played in Monterrey. However, the
San Diego Padres of the National League have played there in a
40,000-seat baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cardinals are not well-known in Mexico, the
Steelers are the second-most popular NFL team there, according to a
poll by NFL Properties. The Dallas Cowboys are the most popular
team in Mexico and drew 106,424 fans for a preseason game against
New England last summer at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 preseason schedule hasn't been a completed, but a
source close to the Denver Broncos said they will play host to the
Cardinals in the opener next year. The Broncos were supposed to
play the St. Louis Rams, but the Rams have asked for a bye the
first week of the preseason. &QL;

LUYENDYK HAS GALL BLADDER SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's something in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett underwent gall bladder surgery in a Valley hospital
two months ago after first experiencing symptoms before the Oct. 25
NASCAR Winston Cup race at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week at Scottsdale Memorial Hospital-North, two-time
Indianapolis 500 winner Arie Luyendyk underwent emergency gall
bladder surgery after several bouts with back and stomach pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had these pains in my back and stomach for four straight
nights,'' said Luyendyk, who lives in Scottsdale. ``During the
fourth night, it got really bad around my rib cage.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk, who spent one day in the hospital and returned home
New Year's Eve, doesn't believe the operation will prevent him from
competing in the Rolex 24 At Daytona in about 3{ weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to practice two days next week and I'll get a feel
as to how well I am,'' Luyendyk said. ``But I've had worse
surgeries and been able to drive right after. I had surgery for a
hiatal hernia about 18 years ago and drove (in a super vee race)
three weeks later.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk recently announced he is retiring from Indy-car racing
following May's Indianapolis 500. It will be Luyendyk's only Indy
Racing League start of the season, which begins Jan. 24 at Walt
Disney World (Fla.) Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk, however, hasn't ruled out competing in sports car
races, such as the renowned Daytona event. Luyendyk won it for the
first time last year in a Ferrari 333SP, sharing driving duties
with Didier Theys of Scottsdale, Fredie Lienhard and former car
owner Gianpiero Moretti.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk again will suit up with the same team later this month
with only one driver change. Lienhard has purchased the team and
Mauro Baldi has replaced Moretti.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start hurting or something, I can always get out of the
car,'' Luyendyk said. ``But I think I'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should have a good chance to win this race
(Daytona) again. Our biggest competition should come from the
second car on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four drivers in the second car are Jimmy Vasser,
Max Papis and Stefan Johansson. &QL;

PARSONS ENJOYS POST-CAREER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 21 seasons, 526 starts, 21 wins, 20 pole positions and one
NASCAR Winston Cup championship,  &UR; Benny Parsons, deservedly
selected one of the sport's top 50 drivers during last season's
50-year celebration, decided enough was enough.
</P>
<P>
   He retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the perfect time for me to call it a career,'' said
Parsons, who walked away at 47 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, one of stock-car racing's greatest storytellers, didn't
fade into obscurity. Over the past decade, he has solidified a
reputation as being one of the top radio and television analysts in
the racing business, a career that includes an annual six-week
NASCAR Winter Heat Series stint at Tucson Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of talent at these (Winter Heat) races,''
Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Parsons saw a talent named  &UR; Greg Biffle and
recommended the driver to  &UR; Jack Roush.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Biffle drives for Roush on the NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series circuit.
</P>
<P>
   As for Parsons, he has no desire to return to the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make more money driving, but I enjoy what I'm doing
now and I'm in a position to make a good living at it,'' Parsons
said. ``Besides, I'm 57. I can't drive anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If Parsons can't drive, what does that say about today's older
generation still suiting up on Sundays along the Winston Cup trail?
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to read your story,'' Parsons quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else can read what Parsons has to say about various
other topics, such as his top three picks for the upcoming season's
driving title:
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy to pick  &UR; Jeff  &UR; Gordon, but I like  &UR; Dale
Jarrett,'' Parsons said. ``Let's face it, if you had to bet money
on it, you've got to pick (Gordon). But I can make sense picking
(Jarrett).''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' picks for second and third are Gordon and  &UR; Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams have to look at what Gordon's team is doing,''
Parsons said. ``Wasn't it last year about this time when (Gordon)
and (chief mechanic)  &UR; Ray
 &UR; Evernham sat down and mapped out what they wanted to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams have to do that. They have to say, `With hard
work, we can get it done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although Martin put together a terrific 1998 season, a season
that would have put him on the throne in many years, he still
finished runner-up to Gordon by nearly 400 points. Can Martin top
it? Or was the past season his last shot at glory?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the situation, Martin's team ought to get even
better,'' Parsons said. ``Basically, it was a new team with a new
pit crew. They still had phenomenal success.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' sleeper pick?  &UR; Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he count as a sleeper?'' Parsons asked. ``They stunk up
the show a couple of times, but on several occasions, they also ran
well. Right now, they're just lacking consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons on the next venue to receive a much coveted Winston Cup
race:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out and give Phoenix a second race, does that look
good for NASCAR?''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix International Raceway is one of several Winston Cup
facilities owned by International Speedway Corp., whose leader is
NASCAR President  &UR; Bill France
 &UR; Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kansas City is the next site, and after that, there's
going to have to be some decisions made,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons on the the next racetrack to possibly lose one of its
two races:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if France can say, `Look, I took a second race from
one of our tracks,' then that would look good for NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   If NASCAR does pull a second race from one already on the
existing schedule, Parsons hinted it could be Darlington (S.C.)
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who really knows,'' Parsons said. &QL;

Dolphins, Broncos talking good game
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By Fran Blinebury &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   DENVER _ Talk is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you probably couldn't get $1.98 for the Dolphins'
chances of swimming out of Mile High Stadium with a win.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who can do the backstroke in frozen water? And the
weather forecast is calling for a high of 28 degrees at kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Which is probably what coach Jimmy Johnson was saying this week
when he pointed out that his team didn't like living in the cold,
practicing in the cold or playing games in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Johnson was pointing to a map of the United States at
the time and showing us geographically challenged NFL followers
that Miami is way down there at the end of the ponytail called
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jimmy was just being helpful to those of us who might have
other things to do during the three-hour window when the
Dolphins-Broncos playoff game is on TV today. Because his team is a
13{-point underdog to Denver with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Marino-Elway III. Suddenly, this has become Mind
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been saying all week that his tight end Troy Drayton
is doubtful for the game because of a sprained ankle and his most _
maybe only _ dependable wide receiver O.J. McDuffie is questionable
with a sprained foot. These offensive injuries are on top of holes
left in the defense by linemen Jason Taylor (fractured clavicle)
and Tim Bowens (torn biceps).
</P>
<P>
   JJ back up to his old tricks
</P>
<P>
   But just when the Broncos might have been starting to feel like
they would be accused of running down Tiny Tim with a
tractor-trailer as they piled too many touchdown onto their side of
the scoreboard, a funny thing happened. Denver looked at the game
films from last week's playoff victory by Miami over Buffalo and
noticed that in the final minutes of play Drayton and McDuffie were
running their pass patterns at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a bit of subterfuge by Jimmy? Maybe old helmet head
figures that it never can hurt to play the poor-mouth mind games
and catch the Broncos by surprise?
</P>
<P>
   After all, remember the golden days of Jimmy in Dallas, when he
always seemed to have something extra up his sleeve for the
playoffs. If he wasn't complaining about one thing, he was lighting
a firecracker under the Cowboys in another way to get them going.
Remember the time he called up a Dallas talk-radio show on the eve
of an NFC Championship Game against San Francisco and guaranteed a
win?
</P>
<P>
   Then-49ers coach George Seifert said that stunt took brass
ornaments by Jimmy. But it worked, and the brass turned into
another set of gold Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   So here is Johnson back in the postseason and maybe he is up to
his old tricks. Or maybe he is trying to do anything to soften up
the Broncos, who figure to be hungry for revenge against his
Dolphins after losing that 31-21 decision on Dec. 21 on Monday
Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos not to be outdone
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of intrigue, there is another theory circulating
through the Mile High City and this one comes compliments of the
Broncos' owner. Pat Bowlen has been telling people he thinks Denver
coach Mike Shanahan held back the Broncos in the Dec. 21 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for Bowlen's theory is the Broncos didn't have
anything to play for in that game. They had clinched home-field
advantage through the AFC playoffs and, with their hopes for a
perfect season having been ruined the week before by the Giants,
didn't want to unnecessarily give away any extra pages from their
playbook for future opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has shown that when he gets into these types of
situations that he's got things in reserve,'' Bowlen said. ``Things
that he hasn't used yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly a secret weapon, but one of the things Shanahan
might have held back against the Dolphins was a certain Terrell
Davis, the Broncos' 2,000-yard rusher on the season. Davis gained a
season-low 29 yards on 16 carries against Miami but was given the
ball only three times in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the shivering Dolphins can expect to see a lot more of
Davis amid the expected snow flurries at Mile High.
</P>
<P>
   Which might explain why Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe
scrutinized the rosters and the matchup the other day and
proclaimed the Broncos were ``10 to 14 points better'' than Miami.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, produced the predictable reaction. Sharpe's
comments were quickly labeled ``bulletin-board material,'' hung up
in the Miami locker room and were said to have infuriated some
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps that's what got ol' Jimmy playing mind games when he
began to talk about crippling injuries, broken-down lineups and a
team that was afraid to go out into the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he was just telling the truth.

With chips off shoulders, Chandler soars with Falcons
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that the Oilers, as we knew them, have passed into
the yellowed pages of history, let it be noted that the most nearly
perfect performance by a quarterback in the 39 seasons they wore
the derrick decals on their helmets was not delivered unto us by
the ageless George Blanda, the volatile Dan Pastorini nor the
prolific Warren Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the distinction forever belongs to Chris Chandler, whose
brief Oilers tenure _ two seasons _ began with low expectations and
ended with utter ambivalence toward the oft-traveled,
success-starved sulkmeister.
</P>
<P>
   But in between, on one early-fall afternoon in Cincinnati,
Chandler found magic in a football. He attempted 26 passes against
the Bengals and completed 23 of them for 352 yards. Two of the
incompletions were outright drops, and the other was a
what-the-heck, clock-killing bomb at the end of the first half.
Four of the completions, in turn, went for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the next week,'' Chandler whined, ``they were handing out
Steve McNair posters. I mean, what did I have to do to get them to
throw a bone my way?''
</P>
<P>
   No dog jokes here, please.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Chandler should be most grateful for young McNair,
whose throne he was, from the get-go, only keeping warm. The
following season, the Oilers' last in Houston, ended with Chandler
in a deep mope on the bench, suffering ostensibly from a case of
mononucleosis while McNair prepped for the job he was destined to
inherit no matter what Chandler accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Deeming McNair properly primed for their arrival in Tennessee,
the Oilers were delighted to dump Chandler off to the Falcons for
fourth-and sixth-round draft choices, and he was equally delighted
to go. So what if Atlanta would be his sixth dead-end stop in less
than a decade? So what if the Falcons were yet another
laughingstock outpost, a franchise certain to bring out the worst
in Chandler's ``why is everybody always out to get me''
personality.
</P>
<P>
   The team and the quarterback were a matched set _ a loser for a
loser.
</P>
<P>
   But then a mystical convergence occurred. The Falcons had just
hired a coach, Dan Reeves, who had an inkling of what winning was
all about, and Chandler simultaneously experienced a sudden,
unexpected epiphany. In a blinding flash, it occurred to him that
the chips he kept lugging around on both shoulders just might be
part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always angry,'' he admits. ``It was like I couldn't wait
to get into a fight with someone to pout or just blow up. You want
to know when I really became a good NFL player? The day I stopped
trying to prove anything to anyone. I'd dug myself into a hole, and
I decided to dig myself out.''
</P>
<P>
   He could because under many layers of emotional baby fat lurked
a highly buffed athlete. Chandler always had oodles of ability, as
that day in Cincinnati revealed. Jerry Rhome, the offensive guru
who did the most to tap his potential, once told him: ``Chris,
you've got talent, but you don't understand the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, you know the rest. Today, shortly before noon Houston
time, Chandler finally will attempt his first postseason pass after
11 years in the NFL. He will attempt it, of course, against the
49ers, who epitomize exactly what the Falcons and Chandler never
have been.
</P>
<P>
   Champions.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta can claim two playoff wins in its 32 previous seasons;
San Francisco possesses five Lombardi Trophies, that thing they
give to the Super Bowl's victors. But pending the outcome of this
afternoon's NFC semifinal, the Falcons appear to be the stronger
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   The Niners are old and injured, although not too old and injured
to have shoved Green Bay out of the way last week in arguably the
greatest wild-card matchup since the NFL invented the concept. San
Francisco had to participate in that high-profile prelim, of
course, because Atlanta finally had wrested the West title, and
with it, the Georgia Dome-field advantage. The Falcons are 8-0 at
home this season.
</P>
<P>
   They took the most recent meeting here convincingly _ 31-19 _
and they go to war once more behind a general who seems to be at
least the equal of the venerable, venerated Steve Young. Based on
their vastly disparate pasts, comparing Young and Chandler appears
laughable, but Young and Chandler produced almost identical regular
seasons, finishing with respective ratings of 101.1 and 100.9.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was the highest of Chandler's checkered career. Yes,
it must be said Chandler, 33, has arrived, unless he shows us
otherwise in his playoff baptism, which he shouldn't seeing as how
his support system in Atlanta is virtually failsafe between Reeves'
cautious play-calling and Jamal Anderson's prodigious ground
support.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, 20-4 since the middle of last season, have won nine
in a row, most recently a shocking rout of AFC semifinalist Miami,
and no longer wear a fluky look about them. They are a for-real
team with, by all accounts, a for- real quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Stranger things have happened? Maybe, but maybe not.

   An Alaska Airlines 727 jetliner crashed into a mountainside
northwest of Juneau, Alaska, on Sept. 4, 1971, killing all 111
people aboard. Another Alaska Airlines 727 slid off a runway in
Ketchikan, Alaska, on April 5, 1976, killing a passenger and
injuring several passengers and crew. A story Friday incorrectly
reported the airline's crash record.
