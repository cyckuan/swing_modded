<HEADLINE> Iraq Denounces US for Delaying Approval of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today announced the approval
of the detailed measures concerning Iraq's partial oil sale and
importation of humanitarian supplies by the U.N. Sanctions
Committee and denounced the hostile American attitude in delaying
the final endorsement.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) said that the approval of the
measures have been delayed by the United States for quite a number
of weeks and the American position toward the implementation of
the oil-for-food deal agreed by Iraq and the U.N. in May has drawn
 discontent from diplomats within and outside the Security Council
as well as criticism of world media.
</P>
<P>
INA said that 14 member states of the Security Council have
announced their agreement to the implementation of the
Iraq-U.N. oil deal. But the United States tried on purpose to
delay the approval of the details for the implementation of the
oil deal in an attempt to reach its goals, which are irrelevant to
the U.N. Charter and resolutions, it said.
</P>
<P>
Without American objection, Iraq could have started to export
in April a limited quantity of oil in exchange for badly needed
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods, the official news
agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq held the United States fully responsible for aggravating
the sufferings of the Iraqi people under U.N. sanctions imposed
after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq entered the dialogue with the U.N. to clinch the
oil-for-food deal in February. The deal allows Iraq to export oil
worth 2 billion U.S. dollars every six months to pay for food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
With the final endorsement of the details for oil exporting,
Iraq's oil is expected to flow to the world market to help ease
the sufferings of its population.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Urged to Stop Ground Subsidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Geologists warn that Shanghai,
China's largest city will be seriously affected if ground
subsidence, which is averaging 10 millimeters annually, is not
halted.
</P>
<P>
"The future existence and development of this city will be
endangered if we let ground subsidence continue uncontrolled,"
said Zhang Xianlin, director of the Shanghai City Geological
Research Institute, at the ongoing 30th International Geological
Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the phenomenon is mainly the result of excessive
groundwater use and building construction. With a population of
some 13 million, the city's consumption of drinking water and that
used in industry has been on the rise over the past several
decades.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the 1955-65 period showed that the quantity of
groundwater drawn by the city was 200 million cubic meters
annually, causing the ground in urban districts to go down 1.75
meters on average.
</P>
<P>
Even though preventative measures have been taken, the quantity
of groundwater drawn by the city rose from 100 million cubic
meters in 1986 to 140 million cubic meters this year, and the
ground was subsiding 10 mm annually.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 high-rises built in Shanghai over the past ten years
have also contributed ot the ground subsidence, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has taken some preventative steps to
halt the subsidence, such as controlling the amount of groundwater
taken from the shallow layer, pouring water underground, and
drawing water from a deep stratum.
</P>
<P>
A monitoring network will be set up and a local regulation on
controlling ground subsidence is to be published in the near
future, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Health System in Crisis: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's health delivery system
is in a crisis and needs urgent reforms as the country exposes
itself to new ideas aimed at improving the economy, President
Robert Mugabe said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a medical conference to discuss Zimbabwe's health care
system, Mugabe said the recent dispute between doctors and
medical aid societies had shocked the country, with Zimbabweans
wondering whether they should expect health care providers to
behave differently from the purveyors of other goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe medical association and the national association
of medical aid societies have reached a stalemate on medical fees
to be charged to patients.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in many doctors asking for cash from
patients who can claim from their medical aid societies.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, in Zimbabwe there is need for greater
complementarity between the public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the government could no longer shoulder the health
burden alone, hence there is need for alternative sources of
health care providers.
</P>
<P>
''It would appear to me that there is in our country today a
crisis in the provision of health services. Let me further
elaborate and say that we want more and better health care, but
to have such health care we need a system of paying for it that
distributes itself equitably and assures equal access for all the
citizens of our great country,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''in the public sector, the government is
committed to care for the poor, the children and the elderly, and
yet the government cannot without limitation afford an ever
increasing financial burden, neither can the tax payer afford to
pick up the slack.''

<HEADLINE> France Says Five Nuclear Powers Agree on Method of Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- France said today that the five
nuclear powers have agreed upon the method of on-site inspection
of nuclear installations suspected of violating the future
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"In terms of this agreement by the five, an affirmative vote by
30 of the (51-member) executive committee of the future
organization will be necessary for authorizing the start of an
on-site inspection," said French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman
Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said that France has played a "decisive role" in helping
bring about the agreement, but Paris does not think that all the
obstacles to the signing of CTBT has been removed.
</P>
<P>
The United States, France, Britain and Russia first proposed a
24-vote of simple majority out of 51 for authorizing such
inspections. China proposed 34, according to French diplomatic
sources.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that India is still blocking the
negotiations for the final adoption of the CTBT draft text by the
members of a U.N. ad hoc committee in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
India wants the draft text to include a calendar of nuclear
disarmament by the five nuclear powers, which has been rejected by
all the five.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of the Indian delegation Arundhati Ghose
has threatened not to sign the treaty. "We cannot let take away
our right of not to sign the treaty," she said.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign ministry spokesman said that it is the
sovereignty of India not to sign it, but "it is not in the interest
of India to block the transmission of the draft treaty to the U.N.
General Assembly."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Geneva expected the CTBT to be signed during the
next session of U.N. General Assembly from the end of September to
November in New York.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue with Disabled on Hunger Strike Urged in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Senior leaders of Nepal's main
ruling party today urged the coalition government to talk with a
protesting disabled group on its welfare demands.
</P>
<P>
General Secretaries of the Nepali Congress (NC) Sushil Koirala
and Taranath Ranabhat, in their letters separately to Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Social Welfare Minister Lila
Koirala, called on the government to seek a solution to the
disabled's demands.
</P>
<P>
Six members of Nepal National Federation of the Disabled begun
a hunger strike here early this week to press the government to
meet the federation's 34-point demands which it handed over six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The demands include better budgetary allocations, interest-free
loans, free health care, unemployment allowances and job training
for the disabled in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Social Welfare Ministry Thursday issued a press
communique saying that an agreement had been reached earlier for
gradually meeting the group's demands following discussions
between ministry officials and representatives of the group.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, most of these demands, including
financial assistance, disabled allowances and scholarships for
disabled students, have been met and work regarding the
fulfillment of the other demands is underway.
</P>
<P>
But officials of the disabled federation said they want a
written agreement with the government on their demands.

<HEADLINE> Jet Engine Inventor Frank Whittle Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Sir Frank Whittle, the inventor of
the jet engine, has died after a long battle against lung cancer
in the United States at the age of 89, Britain's Royal
Aeronautical Society announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Royal Aeronautical Society said this
afternoon "we can confirm that he has died at his home in
Maryland. He had been ill for some time."
</P>
<P>
Whittle, who was born in Coventry and joined the Royal Air
Force as an apprentice at 16, invented the jet engine in 1928 when
he was a young Royal Air Force cadet and two years later obtained
patent right for this revolutionary invention.
</P>
<P>
Jet fighters entered the World War II in 1944 and by 1949 Sir
Frank's design was in widespread use by Western air forces.
Britain's first plane fitted with a jet engine was the Gloster
E28/39 which made its first flight in May 1941.
</P>
<P>
Whittle is commonly regarded as standing among the great
pioneers of aviation history. Former British Airways chief Sir
Peter Masefield, who is a close friend of Whittle, described
Whittle as "a great man who changed the face of aviation."

BEIJING, august 9 (Xinhua) -- The Atlanta Olympic Games are
over, the 16 gold medals are now history, and we should all start
again, said Fu Mingxia, a gold medalist in women's platform and
springboard diving.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at a welcoming ceremony held by the General
Office of the CPC Central Committee and General Office of the
State Council at the Great Hall of the People here today, attended

different walks of life.
</P>
<P>
"There are still many struggles before us, and we should keep
our eyes on the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney," Fu added.
</P>
<P>
"All the Chinese can rest assured that we will compete hard to
win more honor for our country," she said, speaking on behalf of
all the athletes.
</P>
<P>
China's national anthem, "March of the Volunteers," which was
heard again and again at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, was heard
again today at the Great Hall of the People, as the Olympic heroes
were honored.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hanxiong, the men's weight lifting coach, said that during

HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- SADC countries have failed to
agree on a draft protocol on the free movement of people in the
region and the matter has been dropped from the agenda of the
summit of SADC leaders scheduled for Maseru on August 24.
</P>
<P>
The SADC ministers responsible for home affairs and
immigration were expected to iron out outstanding issues on the
protocol at their June meeting in Botswana and present it to the
summit for signing.
</P>
<P>
However, some provisions in the draft were not immediately
acceptable to all the 12 member states of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive-Secretary Kaire Mbuende and Zimbabwean Home
Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa today told the Zimbabwe National
News Agency in separate interviews the protocol was definitely
not going to be discussed at this year's annual summit.
</P>
<P>
Particularly controversial was the proposed provision making
it a right for a national of any of the SADC countries to move
and settle in any country of his choice within the region.
</P>
<P>
Most of the countries are said to have felt that it should not
be a matter of right for a citizen of any country to settle in
another country, but that the move should be subject to other
considerations.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa and Mbuende said they were confident the protocol
would be signed next year.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Says Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Shift Related To Yunnan Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese geologist says the
continuing upward movement of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau caused the
earthquake in southwest China's Lijiang early this year that
killed at least 238 people.
</P>
<P>
The theory was put forth by Xiao Xuchang, a professor with the
Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, at the 30th International
Geological Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The uplift of the plateau caused the accumulation of enormous
energy in the surrounding layer, and the eruption of the energy
brought about the earthquake," Xiao explained.
</P>
<P>
Located in northwestern Yunnan Province, on the eastern edge of
the plateau, 800-year-old Lijiang was devastated by the quake,
which measured seven on the Richter scale, on February 3 this
year. In addition to those killed, there were 3,800 seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
"We observed the changes in geological activity in the Lijiang
area when the quake took place," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao and another geologist, Li Tingdong, have attracted
attention during the congress for publishing a new theory on the
plateau's swelling.
</P>
<P>
They say that the fast growth of the plateau, which has risen
about 10,000 meters in the past two million years, is resultant
from expansion of terrestrial heat and isostatic adjustment of the
plateau's crust. Qomolangma, or Mount Everest, rose 37 centimeters
during the past 30 years, according to Xiao.
</P>
<P>
The uplift has greatly affected the surrounding areas'
geological structures and climates, he said.

<P>
BELGRADE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic and visiting Assistant American State Secretary John
Kornblum held a meeting here today to discuss the upcoming
elections in Bosnia and other issues concerning regional peace.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the September elections would provide
for the most essential encouragement to the overall normalization
of situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum arrived here late Thursday from Sarajevo, where he
attended a meeting of the forum of the Muslim-Croat federation. He
will then travel to Zagreb after his visit to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Kornblum's current tour is to lay the ground for
a meeting between President Milosevic, Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman and Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic in Geneva next
Wednesday which will be chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher. Kornblum is also entrusted with preparing
Christopher's visit to the Balkan region next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, also attended by NATO Supreme Allied
Commander in Europe Gen. George Joulwan, both Milosevic and
Kornblum expressed their expectation that the elections would
enable a stepped-up return of refugees to their homes and
facilitate a process of restoration of confidence among Bosnian
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The two parties emphasized that it was of great importance to
hold the first post-war elections successfully by implementing the
Dayton agreement consistently and completely, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the role of the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) and current questions regarding
relations between Yugoslavia and the United State.

<P>
The festival is the first of its kind involving child
performers and visual artists from all the country's 10
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Opening the festival, Sports, Recreation and Culture
Under-Secretary Charles Dzimba said the festival had managed to
transcend the artificial divide of former group a (mainly white)
and b schools (predominantly black).
</P>
<P>
Dzimba said it was pleasing to see Zimbabwean children break
socio-cultural barriers as Zimbabwean pupils and not as ethnic
groups, adding that it was from this cross-fertilization of ideas
and cultures that a truly Zimbabwean culture could be built.
</P>
<P>
''Zimbabwe is a multi-cultural, multi-racial society whose
primary objective should be to bring together all these different
cultures, synthesize them and come up with a Zimbabwean culture
that is both developmental and acceptable to all parties
regardless of social background,'' said Dzimba.
</P>
<P>
The festival seeks to help children discover aspects of their
own culture.

<HEADLINE> France Not Recommend a Return from Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- France is not recommending that its
citizens return from the central African state of Burundi as the
United States has done, French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman
Yves Doutriaux said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of French nationals in Burundi was not
high after the withdrawal of French military advisors from the
country in May, and the closing of a French school at Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said France did not want to comment on the
economic sanctions being imposed on Burundi by African countries
neighboring Burundi. But "one should follow very attentively the
effects of the sanctions on the humanitarian situation of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi was completely isolated today after Rwanda decided to
close its borders to join the economic sanctions imposed by the
countries of the Great Lake region -- Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and
Ethiopia. Burundi's border with Zaire has already been closed for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Rwandan Hutu refugees continued to pour into Rwanda
from Burundi today despite the closure of the border, said
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,600 Rwandan Hutu refugees returned to Rwanda on Thursday
after 8,450 others crossed the border on Wednesday, Agence France
Presse quoted United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)
officials as saying in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR officials said the number of refugees expected to
cross the border today would not be less than Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees are living in northern
Burundi. They fled Rwanda in fear of reprisals by the
Tutsi-dominated National Patriotic Front after the genocide in
Rwanda in the summer of 1994, which killed at least half a million
Tutsis and Hutu moderates.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's Tutsi-dominated military staged a putsch late last
month ousting a Hutu president.

<HEADLINE> No U.S. Deaths Are Attributed To Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- No evidence indicated that
anyone in the U.S. has died of the Creutzdeldt-Jakob (C-J)disease
which is on a likely link with "mad cow", according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
British scientists reported in March about 10 cases of C-J
diseases that could be attributed to bovine spongiform
encephalopathy. Scientists with the Federal agency then began
surveying doctors and pathologists in five states to determine
whether there was any evidence of the variant in this country.
</P>
<P>
The agency also began reviewing death certificates to determine
whether there had been any increase in C-J disease, particularly
among people under 30 years old. From 1990 to 1994, the disease
was listed as a cause of death for only two people under 30 and no
link to mad cow was found.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey about 800 neurologists and
neuropathologists in Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon, the San
Francisco Bay area and Atlanta, only 94 deaths were caused by C-J
disease and no one was attributed to "mad cow" disease.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President to Monitor Motorcycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
and Defense Minister Costas Eliades will monitor the final stage
of Sunday's anti-Turkish occupation motorcycle demonstrations at
police headquarters in Nicosia, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Their presence comes amid serious concern over the event, which
the Cyprus government and the U.N. are afraid of causing riots in
the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone, which divides the island into
two parts, the Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Justice and Public Order Minister Alecos Evangelou will
also be in the police operations room to monitor the ride, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
About 120 bikers started a 10-day ride from Berlin last Friday
and will arrive at Limassol port here Saturday morning aboard a
ship from Greece.
</P>
<P>
The following day they will be joined by about 7,000 Greek
Cypriot bikers, and together they will stage a ride along the
buffer zone, and will attempt to ride to northern coastal town of
Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
Both the Cyprus government and the U.N. have warned against
trouble in the buffer zone during the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot press reported that the Turkish troops had
been ordered to shoot anyone who attempts to cross into the
Turkish-controlled northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Police chief Panikos Hadjiloizou, however, said that police
will use all available means to avert any incidents on the
motorcycle demonstration and to ensure the status of the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone is not violated.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP)
has been patrolling along the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone
separating the Turkish troops from the Greek Cypriot National
Guards.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test Ban Talks Still Hang in Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of the Geneva-based
Conference on Disarmament adopting the comprehensive nuclear test
ban treaty by consensus still remains unclear as India continues
to threaten blockage such agreement.
</P>
<P>
Asked after a negotiators' meeting on Friday if India would
block the treaty, Indian Ambassador Arundhati Ghose reiterated her
earlier position: "If they don't change the Entry-Into-Force
clause, we'll have to."
</P>
<P>
However, it is unlikely that the treaty text could still be
opened up for further changes to the Entry-Into-Force issue, says
Dutch Ambassador Jaap Ramaker, who chairs the test ban talks.
</P>
<P>
But Ghose told reporters that she was hopeful that changes
would occur. "We're still talking", she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Indian officials' statements earlier, India
opposes the Entry-Into-Force clause of the current draft treaty
because it includes wording that could lead to UN Security Council
sanctions against India if it refuses to ratify the treaty, an
interpretation with which Ramaker disagreed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats here believe that India is just holding out to
press for some sort of assurances from other countries that no
sanctions will be imposed if the country does refuse to ratify the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that Washington and its allies had
devised a legal stratagem to sidestep India's veto -- a group of
states might be able to present the treaty directly to the UN
General Assembly without a specific endorsement by the disarmament
Conference.
</P>
<P>
But some countries fear such a move could undermine the
credibility of the Conference, which always operates by consensus,
and could set an undesirable precedent for future disarmament
negotiations under the Conference.
</P>
<P>
Iran also expressed the view that the current draft treaty
should not list Israel as one of the members of the treaty's
executive council representing Middle East and South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Ramaker also proposed a modification to the current
draft treaty on the subject of on-site inspections.
</P>
<P>
Under this, international inspections at the site of suspected
treaty violations would go forward only when at least 30 of the 51
nations in the treaty's executive council agreed, rather than by
the simple majority vote suggested by the current draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
The "30" formula was believed to be the outcome of a deal last
week between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that Ramaker was expected to submit a final
report to the Conference on Disarmament early next week.

JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 20,000 local women in
their traditional dresses, joined by a colorful band, marched
through the streets of South Africa's capital of Pretoria to
celebrate the national women's day.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the gathering, President Nelson Mandela said
a new democratic South Africa has marked out significant
milestones toward improving the status of women.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also praised women's role in making South Africa's
history, vowed to free them from the suffering of poverty, and
promised to work for the equity of women.
</P>
<P>
The president made references to the 124 women delegates in
the 490-member parliament, four women cabinet ministers and eight
deputy ministers, five women ambassadors and 15 chairwomen of
parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
"That is a small beginning, but we have made a start. Our aim
is to have half the members of cabinet women," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was joined by African National Congress Women's
League President Winnie Mandela and Deputy-President Thabo Mbeki.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. is planning to hold
joint military exercises in Kuwait, the local press today quoted a
U.S. Defense Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The local Arabic daily Al-RAi Al-Am (Opinion) said
U.S. Pentagon spokesman Scott Kampbell said in a statement to the
paper that ordinary joint exercises with the Kuwaiti army are
planned by the U.S. Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
One or maybe three exercises are scheduled, Campbell was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the reports did not say when and where the exercises would
be held and what kind of military forces would be involved in the
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said last Tuesday that the U.S. was planning to
send reinforcements to its 20,000-strong forces in the Gulf
region due to political tension with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been prevailing between Iran and the U.S. since
Washington hinted at Tehran's involvement in sponsoring terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton Monday signed the D'Amato Kennedy bill
that calls for sanctions on foreign companies which make
investments in the Iranian or Libyan oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has held a total of more than 40 joint military
exercises with the allied countries since the end of the Gulf War
in 1991, of which more than 20 were held with U.S. military
forces.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has signed defense cooperation accords with the U.S.,
France, Britain and Russia. All these agreements call for joint
maneuvers and weapons purchases.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Group of South Korea to Sell Cars in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Daewoo Group, one of the two
leading auto makers of the Republic of Korea, plans to enter the
U.S. light-vehicle market for the first time in late 1997 or early
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the company has
been preparing for its American debut for five years and hopes to
sell 100,000 vehicles a year by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, which is known for its inexpensive small cars sold in
Asia and Europe, is taking a risk with its new U.S. strategy. It
is entering a crowded light-vehicle market that is unlikely to
show substantial growth in coming years, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, Caewoo's chairman, Kim Woo-Choong, said that his
company would follow its successful strategy in Western Europe by
selling its cars directly to consumers, instead of through
traditional dealerships.
</P>
<P>
The "no-dealer distribution" is expected to eliminate the cost
of developing and maintaining a dealership network. But market
analysts said that 100,000 vehicles -- Daewoo's goal for 2000 --
would amount to only about 0.7 percent of the current U.S.
light-vehicle market.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo currently produces nearly one million units a year in
South Korea and predicts it will produce another million overseas
by 1998, the paper said. Investments have been centered in Poland,
Romania, the Czech Republic, Uzbekstan, China, India and Vietnam.
The company has been able to develop an average of three new
models a year for each of its platforms, according to Kim.

<P>
PYONGYANG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's decision to enlist
civilians for a "reserve self-defense force" reflected its
ambitions as a military power, an official newspaper of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said today.
</P>
<P>
Rodong Sinmun (Labor News) said in an article that Japan had
been recruiting only retired "self-defense servicemen" to its
reserve force, but from next year, college students and office
workers will also be able to enlist for reserve service training.
</P>
<P>
The change in Japan's military policy indicated that
reactionary forces in the country still cling to militarism and
are trying to make Japan a big military power, said the article.
</P>
<P>
The approach is aimed at paving the way for large-scale
military expansion at times of so-called "contingency," the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> Dole Makes Up Mind on Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua)-- U.S. Republican presidential
challenger Bob Dole said this morning that he had decided on a
running mate in the November 5 elections, but gave no clue as to
who would share the GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
Dole, talking to reporters aboard his campaign plane en route
to kansas, said only that the person would be "probably an 11" on
a scale of 1 to 10. Tax-cut champion and former U.S. Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp was widely believed as the top contender,
followed by Florida Sen. Connie Mack.
</P>
<P>
Dole said he would probably notify his intended choice this
evening, and proceed with plans to formally unveil his running
mate on Saturday in his hometown of Russell, Kansas.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. Senate Majority Leader has repeatedly noted
that the choice of the running mate is the most important decision
in his campaign. Dole had twice failed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Campaign sources said that Kemp, an energetic campaigner who
has had prickly relations with Dole over the years, had informed
Dole's campaign chief Scott Reed that he would accept the job if it
were offered him.
</P>
<P>
Kemp emerged as a prospect in recent days as Dole and top
advisers looked beyond their existing list for a candidate who
would generate enthusiasm at next week's Republican National
Convention in San Diego and be attractive to independent voters
critical to Dole's chances of erasing President Clinton's healthy
lead. Recent polls show that Dole lags behind Clinton by as many
as 20 points.
</P>
<P>
Kemp is a leader of Empower America, a conservative policy
organization whose leaders also include William Bennett, the
former Education secretary and drug czar.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his work at Empower America, he has made a
healthy living by delivering paid speeches and serving on several
corporate boards.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Expresses Surprise over Japanese Minister's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea expressed surprise
today over a senior Japanese official's remarks on the possibility
of street wars by pro-Seoul and pro-Pyongyang forces in Japan if
war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot but express our surprise over the remarks by a
Japanese cabinet minister which are unfriendly to the
reunification of the Korean Peninsula," said a statement issued
here by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
While delivering a speech at a meeting of business leaders in
Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan yesterday, Japanese Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said, "if war breaks out on the Korean
Peninsula, a mass of refugees are expected to come to Japan."
</P>
<P>
"Street or guerrilla wars are also expected when they, with
organizations in Japan, are internally divided and equipped with
arms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese minister perceived a impoverished Korea after the
reunification of the Korean Peninsula, adding that "we can no
longer guarantee that Korea will not again raise the issue of
compensation for Japan's colonization of Korea."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Foreign Ministry's statement also expressed
deep regret that Kajiyama's remarks "heightened alertness against
ethnic Koreans in Japan who have obeyed the national laws of Japan
and have played a constructive role in the Japanese society."
</P>
<P>
"We urge social leaders of Japan to make an effort to establish
a future-oriented relationship between the two countries based on
the right perception of history and the spirit of friendship," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
Japan's World War II defeat in 1945.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, Japan Fail to Revise Fishery Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan concluded
their two-day fishery talks here today, but failed to narrow
differences over whether the coastal state principle, which allows
coastal states to apprehend ships of any country operating
illegally in their waters, should be introduced.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the second of its kind, South Korea put
forward three major principles which include the establishment of
a new fishing order in Northeast Asia, respect for existing
fishing patterns and impartiality in setting price standards and
the amount of fish caught and consideration of the special
historical relationship between the two countries in connection
with the fishing treaty.
</P>
<P>
Japan, meanwhile, proposed that the two sides come up with a
new fishery pact which guarantees the coastal state principle and
introduces a total allowable catch system, under which ships can
operate in waters of other countries on the condition that they
pay the necessary fees and catch only what their quota allows.
</P>
<P>
Lee Won-hyung, deputy director-general of the Asia-Pacific
Affairs Bureau of the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said after
the talks that the Seoul-Tokyo fishery talks should procced in
harmony with the talks for setting the boundaries of the Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) of the two countries, adding that the fishery
zones cannot be separated from the EEZs.
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, the talks on fishery pact and the demarcation
of EEZs, now under way in separate talks, will have to get
together at some point in the future," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Japan will hold talks in Tokyo on August 13 to
discuss the EEZ demarcations for the two countries under the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
Lee expected that the talks on fishery pact revisions and EEZ
demarcations will last up to two years, considering the
complicated matters involved, although Japan wants to conclude
them as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government said today
in a statement that it could not accept the increasing application
of sanctions legislation by the US in regions outside the American
territory.
</P>
<P>
It said that the US actions represented the application of
unilaterally established sanctions legislation against actions by
companies, including Dutch business, totally outside American
territory.
</P>
<P>
"The extra-territorial legislation flies in the face of
multilateral agreements which have been and are being made on
trade and investment," the statement stated.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the Netherlands had worldwide
trading and investment interests, noting that it is the seventh
largest trading nation and is sixth on the list of international
investors.
</P>
<P>
"Given the Netherlands' position as the third largest foreign
investor in the US, and that of the US as the largest
international investor in the Netherlands, the latter is
particularly vulnerable to American legislative practices such as
the present move," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government declared that it was joining other
countries in actively preparing measures at both European and
national level to enable Dutch interests and rights to be
defended.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chief of Elf Accused of Organized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A magistrate of a court of Paris
has accused former president of the Elf-Aquitaine oil group Loik
Le Floch-Prigent of "organized diversion" of public fund during
his term as head of the largest industrial enterprise of France
from 1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the local daily Le Monde for its
Saturday-Sunday edition, Judge Eva Joly is to summon Prigent for a
new hearing today.
</P>
<P>
Le Floch-Prigent has been detained since July 4 for suspected
abuse of public fund, abuse of confidence and covering of these
acts. He was president of the National Railway Company of France
when arrested.
</P>
<P>
In an ordinance signed by Joly for his detention, Prigent is
accused of "pursuing the aim of enriching his family members and
friends" and taking advantage of the financial structure of Elf
as "tools for organized diversion" of public fund in the file of
Elf.
</P>
<P>
When Prigent was president of Elf, 736 million francs (147
million U.S. dollars) was injected in a zigzag way into
ready-to-wear companies belonging to the Maurice Bidermann group.
</P>
<P>
Some 163 million francs was offered by the Elf-Gabon branch to
Bidermann for real estate operations, in which the ex-wife of
Prigent was suspected of having obtained a department in London as
part of condition for settling her divorce with Prigent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two key players in the financial scandal are now
hiding abroad and have refused to return to France to attend court
hearings.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Sirven, former director of general affairs of Elf and
personal advisor of Prigent, is staying in Switzerland with a
Swiss residential card.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Claude Richard, who is suspected to be the arranger of
several "financial montage" between Elf and Bidermann, is now
hiding in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister: Western Countries Biased against Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister Sevket
Kazan today questioned the Western countries' criticism and
accusations against Turkey's human rights, saying they are biased
against Turkey on the issue.
</P>
<P>
His comments came after western countries strongly criticized
the Turkish government for the recent "death fast" in Turkish
prisons which resulted in 12 deaths.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strikes ended in late July following the mediation
efforts by some Turkish intellectuals and representatives of the
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP).
</P>
<P>
"The West only deals with a specific group of people in
Turkey, but they are indifferent to the really unfair and unjust
issues in this country," said the minister without specifying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government was responding constructively to
some of the Western criticisms, adding that "Of course, we are
not completely indifferent to the comments of the West."
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 leftist inmates launched the hunger strike in May to
protest harsh inmate transfers, inadequate medical care and
restrictions on visitation rights for political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The hunger-strikers ended their strike after the government
agreed to let prisoners stay in the same city where they are on
trial.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Cabinet Approves Amended Election Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Council of Ministers,
in an extraordinary session presided by President Elias Hrawi
tonight, endorsed a revised bill on election just one day after
the previous law was overruled by the Constitutional Council.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet approved the amendment of the election law "at a
supersonic speed" in an attempt to avoid a postponement of the
upcoming parliamentary election, which is scheduled to start on
August 18, diplomatic sources in the Lebanese capital said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the cabinet session held in the Beirut
Presidential Palace, Minister of Agriculture Shawki Fakhoury
announced that the bill, which the Council of Ministers approved
tonight, was identical with the decision of the Constitutional
Council.
</P>
<P>
Fakhoury told reporters that the bill would be immediately
handed over to the parliament after the unicameral house took a
decision earlier today to open an extraordinary general session
next week to discuss the bill.
</P>
<P>
He added that the president, at the beginning of the meeting,
expressed his "complete respect" for the verdict issued by the
Constitutional Council in its capacity as the independent supreme
authority.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister declined to disclose the contents of the
amendment before it was put in front of the members of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out a postponement of the parliamentary election, which
was commonly expected by the Beirut media after the Thursday rule
of the Constitutional Council against the controversial election
law, Fakhouri stressed that "the schedule of the election remains
what it was."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri held an urgent meeting earlier today to
consider the Constitutional Council's verdict.
</P>
<P>
In the verdict published by the local newspapers this morning,
the 10-member court said it has unanimously annulled an article
dividing the country into 10 constituencies, six in Mount Lebanon
and four in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The verdict also cancelled an article banning civil servants
from returning to their jobs if they run the election and fail,
and another extending the next parliament's four-year term by
eight months.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parliamentary members, who lodged the petition
to the court, argued that the law passed by the parliament on July
11 discriminated the Lebanese voters by using dual standards in
dividing the constituencies.
</P>
<P>
"The law, in its second article, discriminates in treatment
among citizens, candidates and voters, in rights and duties,
without stating that this is on an exceptional basis called for
by special circumstances," the Constitutional Council said in the
ruling.

<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Institute of

has discovered another source of cereal food with high protein.
</P>
<P>
According to NIHORT Acting Director Williams Eguage, research
embarked upon at the institute since 1984 has shown that the
seeds of grain amaranth, the biological name for the Nigerian
vegetable (spinach) commonly called "green" in local market,
contain 100 percent protein.
</P>
<P>
The mature seed can be processed into flour for staple food
like amala, pap, cake and bread with high concentration of
protein, carbohydrate and fat, Eguage said.
</P>
<P>
This quality made the grain amaranth cereal a complete and
better digestable food than most other foods, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today called on the international community
to redouble its efforts in addressing the legitimate concerns and
demands of the world's indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the International Day of the
World's Indigenous People, Boutros-Ghali said that discrimination,
oppression and disease have all taken a terrible toll on
indigenous peoples around the world.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted on December 21, 1993, the U.N. General
Assembly proclaimed the International Day of the World's
Indigenous People, which was first observed last year. The
International Day of the World's Indigenous People was marked here
today at a "sacred pipe" ceremony, and songs and dances honoring
the 300 million indigenous people who inhabit areas accounting for
80 percent of the world's biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
"Theres is a unique suffering, compounded by centuries of
misunderstanding, discrimination and neglect," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the world, however, indigenous peoples face similar
problems and similar challenges. Chief among these is the daily
challenge posed by environmental degradation and destruction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The wanton exploitation of territories and lands has had a
disastrous impact, which in some cases threatens their very
existence. Deforestation and pollution of natural resources are
global issues which require urgent and concerted action from the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Decade of the World's Indigenous People,
1995-2004, promotes concrete action in vital areas such as human
rights, protection of the environment, and access to health and
education, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the United Nations system is making great
efforts to strengthen international cooperation and international
understanding on issues of central concern to the world's
indigenous people.

OTTAWA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada today cut its
key overnight rate by a quarter of a percentage point to prod the
sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth time this year that the central bank lowered
its key interest rates. The last rate cut was made just three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The key rate is now in an operating band of 4.0 to 4.50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the bank's rate cut, the Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank
and other commercial banks announced they will cut their prime
lending rates to 6.00 percent from 6.25 percent, effective on
Monday.

<P>
Earlier today, Statistics Canada reported that the national
unemployment rate edged down 0.2 percent to 9.8 percent in July

<HEADLINE> Active Volcano Forces Evacuation of Villagers in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of villagers living in
border areas of central Java and Yogjakarta, 1,200 kilometers east
of Jakarta, were evacuated to safer areas after Merapi Mountain
showed its rising activities Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"More clouds which were spewed from Mount Merapi show that the
volcano has an increasing activity," Antara news agency quoted the
spokesman for the local volcanology office, Atje Purbawinata, as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
"Today the volcano has spewed hot clouds 23 times only in five
hours," he said, adding that the dangerous situation had caused
evacuation of people living in Boyong and Krasak rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Merapi volcano is classified by volcanologists as an
"explosive" type, similar to the volcano which devastated the
Caribbean island of Martinique at the turn of the century, leaving
29,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
Merapi rises to a height of 2,962 meters. To the east it
overlooks the most famous Indonesian monument, the Buddhist temple
of Borobodur, and 30 kilometers to the south the university city
of Yogjakarta, where one million people live.
</P>
<P>
Around 50,000 people live in the immediate vicinity of the
volcano, one of 127 active volcanoes out of 500 cataloged in the
Indonesian archipelago.
</P>
<P>
The region is a geologically unstable area which makes up part
of the Pacific "Ring of Fire."

to Horst Teltschik, vice-chairman of the company.
</P>
<P>
As its economy keeps developing rapidly, China has emerged as

Teltschik is also a head of a German-Chinese project for basic
transport facilities. "We are devoted to long-term cooperation

He acknowledged that technical improvement of automobile
manufacturing starts at the top and then moves downward, not vice

Therefore, China's development strategy for the automobile
industry should include the upper segment, Teltschik said,
suggesting that China should devote more attention to upgrading
technical knowhow.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Call for Reform of Chinese Teaching in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Language experts from Hong Kong
have called for an overall reform of teaching methods of Chinese
language in order to help HK residents learn to speak standard
Chinese as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
They say that although more people in Hong Kong feel the
urgency of learning standard Chinese, schools in HK generally lack
both textbooks and teachers in that area.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at the Fifth International Symposium on
Teaching Chinese as A Foreign Language, which opened in Huairou
County outside Beijing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Putonghua", or standard Chinese pronunciation, should be used
for upper-level courses in order to arouse patriotism among HK's
young, suggested Winnie Y.W. Auyeung Lai, director of the Hong
Kong Putonghua Education and Assessment Center.
</P>
<P>
Students should have a greater chance to study and to practice
speaking putonghua, said Leung Chung Sun from Hong Kong University.
</P>
<P>
Most people in Hong Kong speak Guangdong dialect (Cantonese)
and English, he noted, adding that students in schools have few
chances to speak putonghua.
</P>
<P>
"Such a situation is detrimental to exchanges between Hong Kong
and other parts of China and will also weak Hong Kong
competitiveness in the world," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
"Students in Hong Kong should also learn the simplified Chinese
characters," said Suen Caesar Lun, an assistant professor at Hong
Kong University. He has developed a computer software to help HK
people learn simplified characters and intends to introduced it to
local middle schools this year.
</P>
<P>
A course in putonghua will be given to primary and
middle-school students starting in September, 1998, and it will be
part of middle-school students' graduation exams by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department of Hong Kong is drawing up a new
outline for putonghua teaching.
</P>
<P>
The symposium highlighted the role of teaching Chinese as a
foreign language in spreading the influence of Chinese culture in
the world, attracting some 40 experts from Hong Kong, Macao,
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official on Preparatory Committee's Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The specific method of forming
the Selection Committee is a significant achievement of the fourth
plenary session of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), a senior official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Chen Ziying, deputy secretary-general of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, said that
establishing the Selection Committee is the first step in forming
the SAR government, and choosing candidates for the first chief
executive and the Provisional Legislative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Because Hong Kong people will be involved in the process of
forming the SAR government, this will be the first time for them
to truly participate in democracy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the specific method of establishing the Selection
Committee takes Hong Kong's long-term interests as its starting
point, and the process and the method are both open and democratic.
</P>
<P>
In this way, permanent residents of Hong Kong who are 18 or
older and who support the "one country, two systems" policy and
the Basic law, and who are willing to fulfill the obligations of
the Selection Committee can submit their names, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"This also points to another article of the Basic Law: all Hong
Kong residents shall be equal before the law," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen also refuted the allegation that Hong Kong will become the
same as China's interior areas after 1997, referring to the "one
country, two systems" policy. He said it proceeds from Hong Kong's
history and reality, from the interests of Hong Kong and the whole
country, and has also taken into consideration other country's
economic interests in Hong Kong, especially those of Britain.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that China and Britain will increase
consultations and co-operation on the Hong Kong question and the
British Hong Kong Government will earnestly cooperate with the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR during the final phase
of the transition period, and that the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group will speed up settling of some matters during this period.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the question of permanent Hong Kong residents,
Chen said that this session has approved suggestions on how to
implement Clause Two of Article 24 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Because these suggestions relate to Hong Kong's specific
situation, they will help make Hong Kong society more stable and
reassure the public, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sees Israel's Settlement Policy Harmful to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today that Israel's
decision to resume expansion of Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian territories will have an adverse impact on the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that this
Egyptian stand on Israel's settlement policy is clear, and the
Palestinians, the Arab world and the international community also
hold such a stand.
</P>
<P>
"The settlement policy is a grave danger to peace and stability
in the region and the whole peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks following a meeting between Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who arrived here earlier today
on a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet voted unanimously last Friday to lift the
building restrictions on construction in the Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions were imposed by Israel's late Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin four years ago to pave the way for peace
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's demand for the closure of the PLO offices in
Jerusalem, Moussa said the demand can not be accepted or dealt
with positively.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that all agreements, including the Oslo accords,
must be implemented, and that any measures that impede progress
in Palestinian-Israeli talks must be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Israel demanded Friday that the PLO halt activity in Arab East
Jerusalem before any peace talks could resume.
</P>
<P>
At their talks, Moussa said, Mubarak and Arafat expressed
concern over Israel's settlement policy and the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to continue their meetings to coordinate
their stances on the peace process, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been playing an active role in the peace process as a
mediator between Israel and the Arabs, particularly the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has frequently visited Egypt for consultations with
Mubarak on the developments of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting came as the latest of a flurry of contacts held
between Arab leaders to revive the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It was the third summit Mubarak has held with Arab leaders
since his return from a U.S. visit earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad Wednesday and
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia Thursday to explore ways to resume peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Cairo, Arafat will chair a Fatah Central
Committee meeting to discuss the recent developments related to
peace talks with Israel and the situation in the Palestinian
self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen On Hong Kong Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
described forming the Selection Committee for the establishment of
the first goverment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) as "an historical event for Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
It shows that the majority of the people of Hong Kong will
begin to become their own masters politically, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also the first time for the Hong Kong people to truly
and democratically participate in government and political affairs
on such a large scale," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the closing speech at the fourth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee of SAR here today, Qian, who is chairman of
the committee, said that Britain has had more than 20 governors of
Hong Kong in the past century, but has never consulted the people
there.
</P>
<P>
"To form an organ to choose the chief executive and legislature
by the Hong Kong people themselves was really inconceivable under
colonial rule," he pointed out, while refuting allegation of
"democratic termination of Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, after Hong Kong returns to the motherland, it
will be the start of Hong Kong's true democracy by implementing
participation in government and political affairs by Hong Kong
people," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On forming the Selection Committee, Qian said the principle of
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" must be the case, and that
the Selection Committee is definitely a unit with the people who
love the motherland and Hong Kong as the mainstay.
</P>
<P>
It should be represented as broadly as possible, with people
from various fields, social circles, and types of business, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that in forming the Selection Committee
non-Chinese permanent residents who have made a contribution to
Hong Kong are also welcome, as Hong Kong's status as an
international commercial metropolis should be reflected.
</P>
<P>
There are also people in Hong Kong, who are in favor of Hong
Kong's returning to China but have different views on the path and
pace of democratic development in Hong Kong, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
However, if there is basis of supporting China's sovereignty
over Hong Kong and Hong Kong's stable transition, prosperity and
stability, people should and can sit together and discuss Hong
Kong's affairs, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Reins in Major Geological Hazards (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China has scored some successes
in recent years in controlling major geological hazards that posed
a serious threat to highways and residential areas, such as rock
or landslides, mud flows, and ground subsidence, according the
Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, China held back a landslide at Jipazi in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, protecting navigation on the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, geological departments successfully forecast a
landslide at Xintan, in Hubei Province in central China, and
evacuated 1,317 people in time, with no casualties as a result.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, predicting a landslide helped 488 people in Zhongyang
Village in Sichuan avoid a disaster.
</P>
<P>
With its complex geology, China has many kinds of hazards,
which cost the country billions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, the ministry has done studies in Sichuan, Yunnan,
Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu and other provinces or
autonomous regions that are seriously plagued by geological
hazards, and have marked danger areas where people should be
careful.
</P>
<P>
China has started to control major geological hazards that may
cause casualties or economic losses. A special fund set aside by
the government has supported a survey of 72 geological hazards,
such as karst cave-ins at Tangshan City, ground subsidence at
Tianjin municipality, and rock falls in Chongqing City.
</P>
<P>
The special fund has also been allocated and used to control
landslides or mud flows in Sichuan Province's Douyapeng and
Hanyuan counties and Yunnan Province's Dongchuan City.

<P>
The ministry has made strenuous efforts to deal with the
threats at Lianziya and Huanglashi in the area of the Three Gorges
on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Lianziya (Chain Cliff), a rock mass that is 2.5 million cubic
meters in size, and Huanglashi, a potential landslide that is 18
million cubic meters in size, pose a serious threat to navigation
on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has projects for controlling the two hazards being
done by teams of engineering. The first phase of the Lianziya
project has been finished, while work on controlling Huanglashi is
in full swing. Both projects are expected to be completed this
year.
</P>
<P>
China has also been successful in preventing the ground around
Shanghai, the largest industrial city in the country, from further
sinking. Efforts have been made to control the excessive tapping
of groundwater by pumping water back into the ground and adjusting
the layers that are used.
</P>
<P>
At present, the sinking in Shanghai has almost been stopped,
and sinking in another major city, Tianjin, has also decreased
dramatically.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Isolates Cholera-hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia today isolated two
major northern cities and some other areas in a bid to halt the
spread of cholera which has killed six people and infected 39
others in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the outbreak started in remote Khoetol county in
northern Selenge province which borders Russia. The disease
claimed two lives and infected 31 others in the county. Two of
them are in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The disease spread to the provincial capital, Darhan, the
country's second largest city. Two people, who had earlier left
Khoetol county before the region was isolated, died there,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said at least seven people had been diagnosed as infected
by the cholera in Darhan, which is about 350 kilometers north of
the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator. Four of them were in a
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The government on Friday ordered civil defence troops to
quarantine Darhan, Khoetol county, some other areas of Selenge
province and the city of Erdenet, capital of a neighboring
province.
</P>
<P>
To protect the capital from the cholera, all rail connections
had been cut between Ulan Bator and Darhan, and with Erdenet,
local television reports said.
</P>
<P>
Police in Ulan Bator had been alerted to be ready to limit
travel in and out of the city at any time, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
A temporary ban was declared today (Saturday) on weekend
picnickers crossing the capital's borders. Water supply sources
for Ulan Bator were placed under tight police control, a police
officer said.
</P>
<P>
An emergency committee was formed today by the Health Ministry
to combat the disease.
</P>
<P>
Health officials said the cholera had probably been spread by
contaminated food and warned the public not to drink unboiled
water.
</P>
<P>
In another development today, civil defense officials said
flash floods in the suburbs of Ulan Bator had killed six people
since Thursday, bringing the death toll from floods in recent
weeks to 24.
</P>
<P>
The floods followed rainstorms late on Thursday which destroyed
roads and dozens of felt tents in districts to the northwest of
the capital, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Desertification Document Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A document that was passed here
today by 23 Asian and African countries is expected to help
efforts to combat desertification that plagues much of Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Framework for Action on Asia-Africa Co-operation on
Combating Desertification and/or Mitigating the Effects of
Droughts was passed at an Asia-Africa forum on the topic.
</P>
<P>
The framework suggests actions for combating desertification in
the 23 countries.
</P>
<P>
The forum was sponsored by the United Nations, Japan, and China
and was held from August 5-10. It also called for the secretariat
of the United Nations Convention on Combating Desertification
(CCD) to set up a department of Asian and African affairs, and
regional offices in Asia and Africa to help them develop
technology and seek assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to the CCD secretariat, desertification in Asia
amounts to 1.4 billion hectares and one billion ha in Africa. The
combined desertified land in the two continents accounts for
one-third of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
According to the framework, four priorities include attempting
to eliminate poverty through improving and optimizing different
ecological systems and integrated development of different kinds
of energy, slowing soil degradation through soil conservancy, and
water resources management and afforestation.
</P>
<P>
The other areas of action are construction of a data bank on
combating desertification and drought, information and monitoring
systems, and cooperation in finding effective ways to combat
desertification through laws, setting up organizations, and
exchanges on natural resources management.
</P>
<P>
The forum also developed a nine-point proposal to expand
cooperation and exchanges between Asian and African countries in
combating desertification, such as establishing a
desertification-control demonstration in two specific countries
and setting up a desertification research and technical training
center.
</P>
<P>
The CCD was signed by about 100 countries in 1994, the first
international convention following the United Nations Environment
and Development Summit Meeting held in Brazil in 1992.
</P>
<P>
One billion people in about 100 countries have been threatened
by desertification or drought, including 400 million of China's
1.2 billion people.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Causes Extensive Damage to Kuwaiti Desert: Geologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Farouk el-Baz, director of the
Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University, said today that
the 1991 Gulf War did damage to some 30 percent of Kuwait's
deserts.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the Egyptian-American geologist
who has been here attending the 30th International Geological
Congress, said that he came to the conclusion after two and half
years of research on the impact of the war on the desert.
</P>
<P>
The project was sponsored by the Kuwait Foundation for the
Advancement of Science. Baz made 12 field trips to Kuwait where he
saw the great damage to the environment, and he has called for the
reduction of war and protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
During the war, he said, the two sides used tens of thousands
of tanks and other heavy military vehicles, and a study of
satellite photos along with the field studies showed that military
vehicles destroyed small rocks that protect the sand and soil from
wind erosion, resulting in the formation of many new sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
Mine-sweeping after the war also caused the removal of the
desert pavement.
</P>
<P>
He said that the digging of trenches and building of bermes to
hide military personnel and hardware also exposed the sand, and
the exposure of fine-grained soil, combined with the action of the
prevailing northwesternly wind, moved vast amounts of dust and
sand.
</P>
<P>
The geologist explained that the number of sandstorms in
Kuwait, most of whose territory is desert, is now double the
figure before 1991 and that they often cover roads, farmland, and
the airport.
</P>
<P>
He said the second impact comes from the formation of 240 oil
lakes and two large strips of 12 cm thick hardened layer caused by
oil droplets and soot from the fires from 730 oil wells.
</P>
<P>
The geologist explained that the soil in the strips and the oil
lakes was poisoned, resulting in the destruction of natural
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it is possible that poisonous elements from the
oil may seep downward to pollute underground water.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old scientist, who participated in the Apollo
Program from 1967 to 1972 as a supervisor of lunar science
planning and of lunar exploration and the US-USSR joint Lunar
Cartographic Programs, coordinated the first visit by
U.S. scientists to the deserts in northwest China in 1979 after
China and the U.S. normalized their relations.
</P>
<P>
At present, he is engaged in two projects on finding
groundwater sources in Egypt and Oman by means of remote sensing
technology.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's PM Says His Visit to Iran not against US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan said here today that his visit to Iran is not against the
United States and has nothing to do with Americans.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival at the airport, the Turkey's
pro-Islamic prime minister told reporters that "both Iran and the
United States are friends of Turkey and we would like to expand
our friendly ties with Iran just as we like with the United
States."
</P>
<P>
"Our trip here to the Islamic Republic of Iran has nothing to
do with the United States," said the visiting Turkish prime
minister while answering a question raised by Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said "This is my first foreign trip and I am very proud to
be here."
</P>
<P>
Tehran is the first leg of Erbakan's 10 day trip to four
Islamic countries, which also include Pakistan, Malaysia and
Indonesia. Erbakan is accompanied by a delegation of 250
high-ranking government officials and experts.
</P>
<P>
The United States has expressed displeasure to his visit at
this special moment -- five days after U.S. President Bill
Clinton signed the D'Amator bill which toughens sanctions against
Iran by punishing non-American companies that invest in Iran and
Libya's oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
Despite U.S. pressure, the 70-year-old Turkish prime minister
is to sign a 20 billion dollars gas deal with Iran Monday, which
will be the main agenda during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Based on the accord, Iran will export gas to Turkey for 22
years beginning from 1999.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries will also talk about the
issue on border security between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said: "We believe our ties with Iran should expand as
it should expand with all other countries."
</P>
<P>
After Iran, he added, "I will travel to the Western countries
and a number of other third world countries."
</P>
<P>
"We are here to expand our cooperation not just with respect
to gas but many other areas, such as machinery, power and trade."
</P>
<P>
He said: "I believe that as the main members of the Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO), Iran, Turkey and Pakistan should
use the ECO vehicle to expand ties with other Islamic countries."
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded by Iran, Turkey and Pakistan in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister is expected to hold talks with
Iranian leader Ali Khamenei and President Hashemi Rafsanjani in
the next two days.
</P>
<P>
Iran's First Vice-President Hassan Habibi said: "We are happy
to see Mr. Erbakan in Iran in his first foreign trip after his new
government came to power a few weeks ago."
</P>
<P>
"We have had good ties with Turkey ever since the victory of
the Islamic Revolution in Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "Iran and Turkey should promote peace in the
region as well as maintain secure borders."
</P>
<P>
Iran hailed Erbakan's visit to Tehran today as an important
political and economic victory in its efforts to thwart the
political isolation and economic sanctions by the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The fifth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) is to be held in Beijing October 4 and 5, according
to a press communique issued here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The communique says that the fourth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee was convened here from August 9 and 10 and
heard working reports by the heads of the four panels of the
Selection Committee and approved three documents.
</P>
<P>
These were the specific methods on the formation of the
Selection Committee for the establishment of the first government
of the Hong Kong SAR; a proposal on implementing Clause Two of
Article 24 of the Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR; and a proposal
for provisional use of regional flags and regional emblems of the
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The method of nominating and electing members of the Selection
Committee follows the principles of democracy, openness, justice,
and reason.
</P>
<P>
Those at the meeting expressed the hope that the people of Hong
Kong will be enthusiastically involved in submitting names and
nominating members of the Selection Committee to create a good
beginning for the preparatory work of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
It points out that implementation of Clause Two of Article 24
of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR refers to defining
principles for deciding on qualifications of permanent residents
of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
This will be closely connected to Hong Kong residents' personal
interests and preparatory work for establishing the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has a feasible method for determining rights of
abode for Hong Kong residents after July 1, 1997, according to the
Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China and an
explanation made by the National People's Congress Standing
Committee on implementing this law in the Hong Kong SAR,
benefitting both Hong Kong society's stability and smooth
transition, the press communique says.
</P>
<P>
Those at the meeting said that regional flags and emblems of
the Hong Kong SAR are needed for celebrations for the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland before July 1, 1997 and during the
founding of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
In order to safeguard the dignity of the regional flags and
regional emblems of the Hong Kong SAR and to ensure correct use of
them, the proposal for the provisional method on how to use the
regional flags and regional emblems of the Hong Kong SAR as
approved by the meeting is necessary, the press communique says.

<HEADLINE> Mahdi Accuses Ethiopia of Invading Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Ali
Mahdi Mohamed today condemned the alleged Ethiopian invasion of
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in north Mogadishu, Mahdi said his
faction is sending an official complaint to the United Nations,
the Organization of African Unity, the Arab League and the
Islamic Conference over what he called the unjustifiable attack
on Somalia's soil.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi said Ethiopia is benefiting from the anarchy in Somalia
and called for their total withdrawal, saying, ''if they're
fighting against the fundamentalists, they should confine their
job inside Ethiopia.''
</P>
<P>
''Somalis needs peace, not further disturbance and especially
not from Ethiopia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted yesterday between the Somali National Front
(SNF), formerly of the late Somali dictator Mohamed Siad Barre
and the Al-It-Had Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian planes, backing the SNF, allegedly carried out raids
against the fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
As Chairman of Somali Salvation Alliance (ssa), Mahdi strongly
denied his faction is taking part in the Ethiopian "aggression"
along with its ally the Somali National Front (SNF).
</P>
<P>
This invasion is a purely provocative action by the Ethiopian
government, he said, noting that ''Ethiopia has no right to fight
anybody in Somalia''as the fundamentalists will not come onto
power.
</P>
<P>
He said he received reports that 13 Al-Itihad Al-Islam
officials were killed when the Ethiopian forces destroyed the
largest al-Itihad base at Luq including Mosques in the town.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of civilians at the region of Gredo were either
killed or wounded as thousands of families have fled their homes,
he charged.
</P>
<P>
According to a field radio, Goldogob district has also been
attacked by Ethiopian fighter planes supported by infantry. But
no casualties were reported at this stage, the sources said,
adding the fighting still continues in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian fighter planes had also been seen in el-Barde and
Bakol region of southern Somalia, but no fighting had erupted in
those areas, although dozens of people have started fleeing the
area, said the radio.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- India's paper industry is
faced with a severe crisis following large-scale imports of
writing and printing paper, which has forced paper mills either to
drastically reduce or even to stop production, the Indian Express
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Newsprint Limited based in Kottyam of Kerala
State has become the first victim of this crisis when it stopped
production last week.
</P>
<P>
J.P. Choudhury, chairman of the Titagarh Paper Mills and an
important member of the Indian Paper Mills Association, said here
Friday that almost all the paper mills in the country are carrying
large unsold stock and if no immediate steps were taken the paper
industry would collapse.
</P>
<P>
He demanded raising of the import duty on printing and writing
paper to at least 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Indian Paper Mills Association complained
Friday that the government has ignored the demand of the paper
industry to impose a higher duty on imported paper in this year's
budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's university and
college students have been warned to guard against indiscipline
as such behavior spoiled their employment opportunities on
completion of their relevant courses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the graduation of 802 students at Kwekwe technical
college on Friday, Secretary for Higher Education Mike Mambo said
indisciplined behavior spoiled the students' employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
''Employers will not accept into their organizations persons
with bad references or persons who demonstrated lack of both
self-application and control and respect of rules at their
colleges,'' said Mambo.
</P>
<P>
In apparent reference to the recent violent demonstrations by
students at the Harare Polytechnic and the University of
Zimbabwe, Mambo said such violence only brought these
institutions to disrepute which in turn affected employment
opportunities for the graduates.
</P>
<P>
Mambo said employers want graduates who demonstrate maturity,
diligence, dependability and discipline.

King Hussein did not meet King Fahd during his visit to Saudi
Arabia in February because the Saudi monarch was recovering from
an ailment, but held talks with Crown Prince Abdullah and other
Saudi leaders instead.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the two monarchs will be the first after
the 1990 Gulf crisis when relations were strained as a result
of the perceived Jordanian support for Iraq, which invaded Kuwait
in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Their ties have been improved and given a strong boost since
the signing of a trade accord between the two countries in June.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein's planned meeting with the Saudi leaders is the
latest in a series of intense diplomatic contacts after Netanyahu
proposed the so-called "Lebanon first" option to Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, who categorically rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian side insisted on the link between the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks of negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said a proposal was being floated to convene a
summit of the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Syria, Palestinians, Egypt
and Jordan to strengthen the Arab front in peace negotiations
with Israel and closely study ways and means to unlock the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
They said the summit could be held next week in Alexandria,
Egypt, but Jordanian officials could not confirm the reports.

<HEADLINE> Revenue Chief To Harmonize E. African Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Heads of the respective
revenue authorities in the East African Cooperation (EAC) member
countries will soon meet to seek ways of harmonizing customs
tariffs in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing newsmen at Dar es Salaam Airport on Friday,
Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Jakaya
Kikwete said the agreement to proceed with harmonization
discussions was reached at a tripartite commission meeting in the
cooperation secretariat in Arusha early this week.
</P>
<P>
According to a press report today, the minister who led a
government delegation to mourn the death of former isles leader
Abdulrahman Mohamed Babu, said the commission agreed on the
harmonization of the tarrifs within the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Such a measure would smoothen monetary and commodity
transactions within the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was revived in March this year after leaders of
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania launched the ECA secretariat at
Arusha in northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Harmonization of fiscal policies in east Africa would
stabilize exchange rates and lower the pace of inflation, he
said, adding that full convertibility of national currencies
would on work when traders had confidence in the currencies of
their trading partners.
</P>
<P>
"The tripartite commission meeting has endorsed the
convertability of east African currencies effectively July 1," he
affirmed. The three central banks had been directed to start the
implementation process, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister promised to ensure that the road network
joining the partner states is in good condition, saying the
meeting endorsed the East African Road Network project set to
redefine more than 15 roads.
</P>
<P>
A secretariat for the project would be formed to make sure
that the project was implemented in the appropriate manner, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said the three countries also agreed to introduce a
single passport to simplify the movement of citizens within the
region.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting also agreed on putting a counter for East African
Citizens in each of the airports in the tripartite area," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete further said that the cooperation commission similarly
suggested the introduction of an East African Flag. He added it
also decided that henceforth all commission meetings would be
held in Arusha, Northern Tanzania.

the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region closed here today, with adoption of three documents.
</P>
<P>
The documents involve how to form the Selection Committee for

<HEADLINE> Impending Decree to Boost Nigeria's Manufacturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's federal government is
to promulgate the failed parastatals and companies decree to
promote the development of the country's manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
As part of the government efforts to continue sanitizing the
nation's economy, the new decree will complement the failed banks
(recovery of debts) and financial malpractices in banks decree.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to guarantee national and international
confidence in Nigeria's industrial sector and stimulate
unhindered economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In a message delivered Friday at the opening ceremony of the
ninth national council on industry meeting, Head of State General
Sani Abacha said the federal parastatals decree has become
necessary since industry is the catalyst for the overall economic
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to General Abacha, the industrial sector has the
''potentials to compete in relative importance with the oil and
agricultural sectors in terms of poverty alleviation, employment
generation, wealth creation and raising our national per capita
income.''
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's 1996 budget has an array of
incentives to stabilize the business environment for long-term
and self sustaining growth as a strategy for developing the
manufacturing industry and other key production areas of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Abacha listed 12 priority areas such as foundries, forges,
sugar and sugar confectioneries, grains and cereals, vegetable
oil, livestock and allied products, wearing apparel, leather and
leather products, and building materials with focus on ceramics,
bricks and glass.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Industries Minister Lt.-Gen. Mohammed Haladu
said the major objective of the current government industrial
policy is to increase the local contents of industrial outputs.
</P>
<P>
According to him, identified raw materials will be developed
to substitute current imports and the government, through
policies and incentives materials, encourages established
industries to use such materials.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has shifted its focus from
large scale industries to small and medium enterprises (SMES),
which are believed to be a better instrument for industrial
development in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has budgeted
more than 16.7 million US Dollars for Nigeria's four-year SMES
development program, the minister said, adding that the country's
counterpart cash contribution to the program is 26.25 million
Naira (about 3.1 million Dollars) for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The national council on industry is the highest policy
generating body on industry in the country.

MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) - Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today appointed Alexander Lebed, Secretary of Russian Security
Council, as his new representative in Chechnya, said presidential
spokesman Sergei Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
Lebed replaced Oleg Lobov, who was appointed in August 1995,
when the heavy fighting between Chechen rebels and federal troops
for the control of the Chechen capital Grozny entered a fifth day.
</P>
<P>
Lebed would be the main authority in Chechnya along with Doku
Zavgayev, who is the head of the pro-Russian government in the
republic.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who joined Yeltsin's team and helped him win the
presidential elections last July, has been criticizing Russia's
past policy in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebed, force was not the only way to solve the
Chechen crisis, and only the withdrawal of Chechen fighters from
Grozny could make it possible for a ceasefire and peace in the
republic.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Russian authorities in Chechnya was criticized by
President Yeltsin, who said that they had committed serious errors
in their dealings with the rebel leaders.

the military budget, according to a senior army officer.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces General Ali
Al-Moumen said in an interview with the local Arabic language
daily Al-Anbaa published today that "we have worked out programs
including incentives to encourage Kuwaiti citizes to join the
Armed Forces."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that special budgets should be allocated in order
to implement these plans which he said were aimed at increasing
salaries of the servicemen, granting them more bonuses and
improving social care services for the retired.
</P>
<P>
The living standard of the families of the servicemen are
expected to be improved under the new plans, he added.
</P>
<P>
On troops education, the general said the military authorities
had arranged a contract with the Kuwait University to encourage
the youths in the army to carry out their higher education.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheikh Ahmed al-Humoud al-Sabah said
late July that Kuwaiti soldiers are now possessing high
capabilities to confront dangers and challenges, adding that the
armament budget would not be affected by a planned eradication of
the state budget deficit which is expected to remain at about 4
billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Kuwait army would attract more
youths by providing them incentives to encourage them.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been the world's biggest spender on defense in per
capita terms since its 1991 liberation from the Iraqi occupation,
during which its military plants and equipment were destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkish PM Sets off for Iran Despite US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish pro-Islamic Welfare
Party (RP) Chairman and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan this
morning embarked upon his first foreign visit to neighboring Iran
despite a warning from the United States.
</P>
<P>
This shows the determination of the Turkish coalition
government led by Erbakan for the further development of the
relations with the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, the local press today hailed Erbakan's visit to Iran
as an important political and economic victory in that country's
efforts to thwart the political isolation and economic sanctions
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's foreign trip will also take him to Pakistan,
Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
The main goal of his tour is to establish new economic and
commercial links between Turkey and these countries. Erbakan sees
great benefits in Turks' forging close ties with other Moslem
countries which he feels will contribute to Turkey's development
effort.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, the first stop of his foreign tour, Erbakan wants
to step up cooperation with the Iranian government in many areas
including oil, gas and aviation.
</P>
<P>
During Erbakan's visit in Iran, Ankara and Tehran are expected
to sign a gas agreement worth 20 billion U.S. dollars. The 23-year
agreement will involve the sale of 4 billion cubic meters of gas
annually, which will be increased gradually to 10 billion cubic
meters by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is scheduled to go into effect in 1999 after the
construction of a 260-kilometer pipeline from the Iranian city of
Tabriz to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Turkey and Iran is expected to be
increased from last year's 950 million dollars to 2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan also intends to assure the Iranians that Turks are
friends and neighbors and will remain so irrespective of outside
pressures.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the d'Amato-Kennedy law on
Monday to reinforce embargoes against Iran and Libya by
dissuading foreign companies and individuals from investing
heavily in the oil industries of the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
A senior U.S. senator has urged Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to help find a replacement for Turkey's proposed
20-billion-dollar natural gas deal with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Abdullah Gul, main aide of Erbakan,
said, "Turkey is not in a position to ask the U.S.,'Would you veto
this or not?' on all its foreign policy issues, demanding
permission. Turkey is an independent country. It has its own
interests."
</P>
<P>
Iran attaches great importance to Erbakan's visit, especially
since the U.S. passed the law that would impose sanctions on
countries investing in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati has said that
Erbakan has always adopted a friendly stance toward Iran and
since he is in favor of having cordial ties with the Islamic
states, "we are looking forward to seeing more friendly ties
between Iran and Turkey in future."
</P>
<P>
Velayati made the remarks immediately after the Turkish
coalition government between the RP and True Path Party (DYP) led
by Erbakan won the vote of confidence in the parliament in July.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Aladdin Burujerdi said in the
border city of Meshed Thursday that under the Turkish coalition
government led by Erbakan, the Iranian-Turkish relations would
reach a "turning point."
</P>
<P>
Burujerdi indicated that minor issues of border security could
be easily solved with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
This was a reference to the frequent complaint by Turkey that
the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) use the
Turkish-Iranian border freely to strike at Turkish military and
civilian targets and then escape into Iran where they are said to
have bases and camps.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture prior to Erbakan's visit to Iran, Tehran had
invited Turkish officials in the past weeks to Iran and conduct
their own inspections in the border areas with Turkey following
the complaints by Ankara of the PKK attacks from the Iranian soil.
</P>
<P>
The two sides "also discussed enhancing of security along the
borders of the two countries," the official Iranian news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Some observers here fear that Turkey and the U.S. might be on a
collision course over relations with Iran, since Erbakan and
Washington are adamant in their opposing positions on Iran.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects US Claim of Helping Iraq Export Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
rejected the U.S. claim that Tehran helped Iraq smuggle oil
products through southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Kharrazi, Iranian representative to the United Nations,
was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying that "such
accusations are part of Washington's propaganda campaign against
Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iran will prove the inaccuracy of the baseless U.S. accusations
if the U.N. Security Council's sanction committee considers
necessary, he added.
</P>
<P>
The claim, which was first raised by the U.S. Administration
about a month ago by sending a letter to the head of the U.N.
Security Council's sanctions committee, is as unsubstantiated and
unfounded as its earlier claims, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Washington claimed that ships carrying smuggled Iraqi oil
entered the Iranian coastal waters through the northern part of
the Gulf and the international waters and then proceeded to the
southern part, avoiding the allied forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also claimed that the operation is carried out
with the knowledge of the Iranian government and by charging the
Iraqi ships.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi denied that Iran has violated the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, reiterating
that Iran was compelled to beef up its patrol and coastal units in
Arvand river and the Gulf borders in order to exercise a better
surveillance for effective implementation of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he added, Iran has submitted the registered
cases of violation of Iraqi sanctions with the supporting
documents to the U.N. special committee.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that in a letter to the Security Council's
committee on sanctions on December 16, 1994, Iran reported
several cases of violation of embargo on Iraq including hoisting
of the Iranian flag by smugglers for carrying their shipment.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Lowers Charges for Goods at Aqaba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has decided to lower
charges for handling goods at the south Red Sea Port of Aqaba,
the English-language daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Captain Mohammad Dlabeeh, the new director-general
of the Ports Corporation, the reductions in service charges
approved recently by the cabinet would lower the overall cost for
each 20-feet container to nearly 66 dinars (about 92.4 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Handling expenses were lowered by 20 percent and loading and
unloading charges by 25 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
As to vegetables and fruits, charges were reduced by 42
percent while the reduction for frozen food was 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the lowered charges would make the Aqaba port a real
and strong competitor to all ports on the Red Sea and would
enable it to become a center for vessels and large containers for
re-export to neighboring ports.
</P>
<P>
The ports corporation chief said that many international
companies were holding contacts with the corporation to route
their vessels to Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
He expected that there will be a large increase in handling
volume during the coming period as a result of the lower charges.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of this year, the volume of
exports and imports through Aqaba exceeded 6.5 million tonnes, of
which 3.8 million tonnes were phosphate, fertilizers and potash.
</P>
<P>
Various imports amounted to 2.6 million tonnes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Dlabeeh added that Jordan had agreed with the Suez
Canal Authority officials to take similar reduction on goods
passing through the canal to the Port of Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
"We will soon conduct discussions with Egyptian officials to
arrive at a final agreement with regard to making the similar
reductions," said Dlabeeh.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will start implementing the lower charges in the coming
few days after the cabinet decision is published in the official
gazette.
</P>
<P>
The captain revealed that the corporation would be implementing
many projects to activate the port and such projects will be
announced soon.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Physicals on Malaysia's
Crude Palm Oil (CPO) market closed higher this week on news that
China will issue import licenses to its palm oil producers.
</P>
<P>
The market opened lower on Monday as buyers waited for private
forecaster Ivan Wang's forecast for July's estimated production
and rebounded the next day.
</P>
<P>
But it dropped on Wednesday following bearish data released by
Ivan Wong who reported that end-July production of oil palm is
estimated to increase 2.8 percent to 742,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The market rebounded again on Thursday and saw the August South
close higher at 1,110 ringgit (about 444 U.S. dollars) per ton
this week, compared with 1,090 ringgit (about 436 U.S. dollars)
previously.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed the week lower after
a nine-sen (3.6 U.S. cents) drop on Friday, which erased all gains
made earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
The drop on Friday was due to the lack of buying interests in
the local market and too much supply offered by sellers.
</P>
<P>
The metal finished the week at 15.06 ringgit (about 6.024 U.S.
dollars) per kilogram, compared with 15.15 ringgit (about 6.06
U.S. dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover for the week was 444 tons, against 498
tons previously, with the Europeans, Japanese and locals
accounting for the week's transactions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Malaysian rubber market ended the week slightly
lower as inquiries from overseas were lacking following summer
holidays in major consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
Both September RSS one and SMR 20 dropped by 1.5 sen (0.6 U.S.
cents) each to close at 324.50 sen (about 129.8 U.S. cents) per
kilogram and 303.50 sen (about 121.4 U.S. cents) per kilogram
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Farm Unions Oppose Free Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Organized agriculture in
Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe would +strenuously
resist+ a proposed South African-European free trade agreement
affecting the beef industry in the region.
</P>
<P>
This was said by the Southern African Confederation of
Agricultural Unions (SACAU) in a statement issued in Windhoek,
Namibia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At an urgent meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe on Thursday, SACAU
said it +noted with deep concern+ the mandate of the commission
of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In particular, SACAU has recognized the potential consequences
of this mandate in so far as the production of agricultural
commodities, especially beef, is concerned both in South Africa
and in its adjacent trading partners,+ said the statement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was currently negotiating with the European Union
(EU) about a free trade agreement, but the proposed pact had
already caused some concern in its neighboring countries,
especially in the field of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
SACAU said the mandate would have a +deleterious if not
devastated effect+ upon the beef production sector in southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
SACAU urged the 12 Southern African Development Community
(SADC) countries to study the mandate and inform themselves of
its implications.
</P>
<P>
SACAU said it +wishes to make public its support for South
African agriculture in resisting any form of unfair competition,
subsidized imports or dumping so as to maintain its own beef
production sector+.
</P>
<P>
SACAU also stressed that any agreement allowing subsidized
agricultural production in developed countries to supplant
commercial production in the region, particular in the beef
sector, +must be construed as being contrary to the interests of
agricultural development in the region as a whole and will be
strenuously resisted+.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Hold Mass Wedding Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A free mass wedding ceremony for
2,000 brides and grooms will be held at the Cairo Stadium here on
September 5, a local English-language newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Egyptian young people have applied to get
married at the ceremony sponsored by the Supreme Council for Youth
and Sports (SCYS), according to Egyptian Mail, the Saturday
edition of The Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Several firms have volunteered to contribute to this "national
project" which is intended to alleviate the economic burdens of
some young people, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The SCYS has determined certain conditions that should be met
by brides and bridegrooms to participate in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The bridegrooms should not exceed the age of 35, the paper
said, adding that the couples should be from the low-income
classes who cannot afford a wedding ceremony and who are in need
of financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 couples to participate in the wedding will be
selected from the applicants by drawing lots.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that many people support the idea of mass
wedding as most bridegrooms in Egypt are over-burdened by marriage
expenses, including buying an apartment and furnishing it.
</P>
<P>
But the idea is also facing a strong opposition in this largely
conservative Moslem country.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the mother of one of the brides who had
applied to participate in the ceremony as saying that she could
not imagine her daughter being married in such a way.

<HEADLINE> NATO Enlargement Not to Bring Much Cost: German Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The eastward expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should not cost too much
money, German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said today.
</P>
<P>
Advanced planes and tanks should not be the preconditions for
East European countries to join the NATO, Ruehe told the press
while accompanying Canadian Defense Minister David Collenette to
visit Berlin.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent Pentagon-commissioned report, NATO might
have to pay 42 billion U.S. dollars over the next 10 to 15 years
for its eastward expansion to include four new members -- Poland,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe expressed his doubt over the report, saying that some of
the NATO's 65 commands should be closed in order to reduce the
financial burden of the NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe held talks today with Collenette, who was on a two-day
visit beginning Thursday, on the issue of the NATO's
restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand to Use Tariff Cuts as Bargaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will use its offer to
lower tariffs as a bargaining tool to persuade other members of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to remove non-tariff
barriers on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has decided to use proposed cuts in Thai tariffs as a
chip for bargaining greater market access for Thai farm exports.
</P>
<P>
Observers see the move as a marked shift in the approach to
APEC's trade and investment liberalization plans, which call for
lowering trade barriers voluntarily without bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Basically an agricultural economy, Thailand will focus its
interest on agriculture, which supports the livelihood of three
quarters of the population and is still a main foreign exchange
earning sector.
</P>
<P>
Considering the value added, agricultural products benefit the
country no less than industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan, who oversees economic
affairs, has said "We want to call for mutual benefits. If they
(the other 17 APEC members) give us unsuitable benefits, we won't
give them much either."
</P>
<P>
In particular, Thailand wants to see non-tariff barriers, such
as quotas, and other measures removed on farm goods.
</P>
<P>
In this respect Thailand is concerned about Japanese and South
Korean rice quotas, which will come under particular scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Also targeted would be policies that use product standards,
environmental criteria, public health and anti-dumping taxes to
curb imports, because these hurt Thai agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is now closely watching its counterparts' individual
action plans to be tabled at the APEC senior officials' meeting,
scheduled for August 21 in Davao, the Philippines, to see whether
their plans means rules and regulations will remain obstacles to
Thai exports, including in particular farm products.
</P>
<P>
Thai agricultural exports include rice, rubber, tapioca, sugar,
coffee and fruit.
</P>
<P>
Although APEC's 18 members have said that they want to lower
their trade barriers voluntarily without bargaining, they are
looking at each other's plans and they have agreed that the plans
should be 'comparable.'
</P>
<P>
Some countries such as the United States have not ruled out the
possibility of negotiations in the future.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Malaysia is one of the staunchest opponents
of any form of bargaining in APEC.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization's plans are being drafted for the APEC leaders'
informal meeting in the Philippines in November.
</P>
<P>
Trade barriers would start to fall under the plans from January
1, leading to liberalized trade and investment by 2010 for
developed members and 2020 for developing members.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Workers Calls for Cut in Excise Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's food workers have
called on the federal government to reduce excise tax on products
of the food, tobacco and beverage subsector from 40 to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
John Onyenemere, President of the National Union of Tobacco,
Food and Beverage Employees, said here Friday that the reduction
will go a long way to salvage the deteriorating situation in the
industry and help create employment opportunities for unemployed
Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to assist this sector from
collapse by reactivating them with soft loans so that the workers
sacked can be reabsorbed.
</P>
<P>
The union chief also urged big companies to stop incessant
retrenchment of workers.
</P>
<P>
Due to consumer resistance and lack of purchasing power, the
industry has been distressed for some time after ware houses have
been filled up.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Erbakan's Visit in Defiance of US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran hailed the visit by Turkish
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to Tehran today as an important
political and economic victory in its efforts to thwart the
political isolation and economic sanction by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian press published editorials today, claiming the
arrival of pro-Islamic Turkish prime minister in Iran is a matter
of real delectation for the Iranian nation and authorities.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Iran News said that a red carpet
welcome by the administration of President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani awaits the Turkish prime minister, who is expected to
arrive this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
An editorial by the daily said, "Iran welcomes Prime Minister
Erbakan in Tehran as an experienced politician who commands an
Islamic and independent thinking," adding, "Tehran will do all
that is needed to solidify the government of Prime Minister
Erbakan."
</P>
<P>
Another English-language daily Tehran Times in its editorial,
entitled "Erbakan's Visit Signals Time to Form United Islamic
Front," called on Islamic countries to march ahead shoulder to
shoulder to build a united Islamic front.
</P>
<P>
It said that it is the natural right of Iran and Turkey to
expand mutual cooperation and lay the foundation for multilateral
cooperation involving other regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The editorial praised Turkey's foreign policy, saying "the
Turkish independent foreign policy will definitely be in the
interests of Turkey and other regional countries, especially of
its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
During Erbakan's visit, Iran and Turkey will sign a
20-billion-dollar gas deal. Under the accord, Iran will export gas
to Turkey for 22 years beginning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times claimed the deal is to be signed "in defiance" of
the sanction law signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, regarding the issues of the Turkish Workers' Party
(PKK), Iran News added, "The most significant and caustic issue is
related to claims in some Turkish circles of Iran's alleged
support for the PKK. In the light of its prevailing foreign
policy, Iran is always prepared to investigate such allegations."
</P>
<P>
In the future as in the past, it said, "Iran will never
support terrorists whoever they may be."
</P>
<P>
In return, the editorial said, "Iran expects reciprocation from
Turkey in connection with terrorist groups which occasionally
raise their heads against the Islamic Republic."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Afghanistan on Edge of Hyperinflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Still entangled in ceaseless
fighting among feuding factions after 17 years of war, Afghanistan
is now tottering on the brink of hyperinflation, which is
devastating to its economic life.
</P>
<P>
Economists listed high costs, increasing demand and an
inflationary spiral of rising prices and wages as direct causes
for the country's sky-rocketing prices.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Afghanistan's worst economic disaster is the
result of years of fighting, economic blockade, collapse of social
and economic institutions, absence of appropriate banking and
monetary policies, diminishing domestic production and declining
agriculture yield.
</P>
<P>
The country's currency has been depreciated drastically,
registering almost daily falls from 37.90 Afghanis against one
U.S. dollar in 1978 to 5,500 Afghanis in January this year, and
then to an astonishing level of 15,000 Afghanis in June.
</P>
<P>
That means that the Afghani has lost its value by approximately
396 times during the past 17 years and by more than 2.7 times in
the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Many economists fear that if the present situation continues,
Afghans will have to return to a barter transaction system, which
will be extremely dangerous to those who do not possess any means
of production.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase in money supply has created a yawning budget
deficit, a virtual economic collapse, and increasing inflationary
expectations which will work dreadful economic and social havoc in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Budget deficit is believed to be the mother of all economic
diseases and by the time the situation improves, Afghans will
still have to spend many of their resources on paying debts.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan is now importing almost all consumer items,
including wheat, flour, sugar and cement, and in significantly
larger volumes than the pre-war amounts.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade has been badly affected as its
borders are now under the control of different groups who are
totally independent from the central government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Afghanistan is in a crying need of
strong and stable government capable of implementing effective
monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
However, as a "strong and stable" administration seems to be
still in some far-off future, some economists have recommended the
establishment of an economic council comprising representatives
from all parties involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
They said that this council should be mandated to study the
overall situation in Afghanistan and recommend economic policies
aimed at curbing soaring inflation, reducing deficits, improving
balance of trade and boosting domestic production.
</P>
<P>
They added that the council should also encourage an
appropriate allocation of national resources by various forces and
collaborate with international organizations in the rehabilitation
of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> OECD Forecasts Portugal's GDP Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Portugal's gross domestic product
(GDP) would grow by 2.25 percent this year, and 2.75 percent next
year, according to the latest survey of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the Portuguese government has made great
progress in the economic macro-control, which led to the drop of
inflation rate, the falling of bank interests rate and the
decrease of the budgetary deficit.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's huge public debt still posed as a major problem,
accounting for over 70 percent of the country's GDP, the OECD said.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based organization suggested that Portugal reform the
management over the debt, take concrete measures to reduce the
public expending and crack down economic crimes.

<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The hunger strike staged by 10 Africans without residential
papers today entered its sixth week. The hunger strikers, who are
taking refuge in the Saint-Bernard Church of Paris, are waiting
for a gesture from Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, who has
maintained an intransigent stand on illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Socialist Party, African representatives and
some other associations have called on President Jacques Chirac to
find a "humanitarian" solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- The oath-taking speech by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
was reduced to the strictest minimum Friday in the Kremlin, which
was unprecedented for such an event. Yeltsin looked old, worn
out, and weak due to a cardiac disease which made his health
situation really precarious.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chechen rebels have tightened their stranglehold on
the Caucasus region while Russian troops rolled back on several
front lines.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While Chechens are displaying their force, the return to the
limelight Friday by Boris Yeltsin, who have been invisible since
the end of June, again caused doubt over his capability to rule
Russia. He reduced his inauguration speech to just one minute
with a coarse voice. Gennady Zyuganov said that Yeltsin is no
more fit for work.
</P>
<P>
-- The flow of French money to foreign countries increased in
the first five months this year, with an amount of 266 billion
francs (53 billion U.S. dollars) going abroad in that period and
61.6 billion francs (12 billion dollars) in May alone.
</P>
<P>
One of the causes for the outflow is that France bought large
quantities of foreign goods, estimated at 166 billion francs (33
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Exporters in Thailand to Be Exempted from Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government's Board of
Investment (BOI) has agreed to grant more privileges to
export-oriented projects which ship at least 80 percent of their
products abroad.
</P>
<P>
These projects, classified as the sixth type of special
businesses, will enjoy income tax exemptions for eight years and
100 percent machinery tax exemptions, according to local newspaper
the Nation today.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the BOI gives special privileges to five types of
projects -- transport infrastructure, utilities, environmental
protection and restoration, technology development and basic
industries.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Thai exports in the first six months
grew only 7.1 percent compared to more than 20 percent in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The BOI will shortly seek cabinet approval for these special
privileges to be granted to export-oriented projects.

<HEADLINE> Two Turkish Ministers to Pay Official Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Justice Minister Sevket
Kazan and Education Minister Mehmet Saglam are expected to pay an
official visit to Iraq Sunday and to meet with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, according to the local newspaper Sabah today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the two ministers would extend a message from
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to Saddam on the
settlement to the issue of the Turkish outlawed Kurdish Worker's
Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels often strike at the military and civilian
targets in Turkey and then escape into northern Iraq, where they
are said to have bases and camps.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ministers will also hold talks with Iraqi
officials on the reopening of the Kerkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline and
Turkey's sale of food and medicine to Iraq, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Iraqi sanctions committee under the U.N.
Security Council approved the procedures for implementing the
oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to Resolution 986 of the U.N. Security Council, Iraq
will be able to sell oil worth 2 billion U.S. dollars over six
months and purchase food, medicine and other necessities for its
people so as to alleviate the effect of the six-year long
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

SEOUL, August 10 (Xinhua) -- All seven people aboard the rescue
helicopter which crashed at the foot of the Chiri Mountain in
South Korea's South Kyongsang Province last night were confirmed
dead, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated copter crashed in bad weather deep in the remote
mountain area of the southern part of the country after rescuing
two university student climbers, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Police found the dead crew and passengers among the copter
wreck this morning near a temple some 1.5 kilometers from a
mountain retreat in Sanchong County of the province, the place
where the helicopter picked up the two mountain climbers, one of
them suffering from backpain.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter from a fire station flew to the mountain villa
last night when the mountain climbers called for help.
</P>
<P>
However, communication was cut off between the copter and the
fire station soon after the helicopter took off, the reports
quoted the police as saying.
</P>
<P>
The police attribute the crash to heavy rains and the ensuing
thick fog which blanketed the Chiri Mountain yesterday evening.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's
newly-appointed Prime Minister Barnabas Dlamini was on Friday
inaugurated as the kingdom's 8th prime minister since its
independence in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his inauguration ceremony at his official
residence in Mbabane, Dlamini said the new Swazi government's
agenda would be open and accountable for its deeds, reported +the
Citizen+ daily today.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said open government meant upholding the rule of law
and a willingness to be bound by its obligations.
</P>
<P>
+No one group is beyond the law,+ he added.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini, 54, a former finance minister before taking up an
appointment as a director of the World Bank/International
Monetary Fund's African region in 1992, was appointed as the
prime minister by the monarch King Mswati iii on July 26 to
succeed former prime minister Prince Mbilini Dlamini.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dlamini said the process of consultation, for which
he intended the new government to be known, had already started.
</P>
<P>
+This will be a continued and committed effort on my part to
ensure that our policies and programs are relevant to the
country's needs,+ said the prime minister, adding this was part
of the kingdom's tradition.
</P>
<P>
However, the consultation process would not be an excuse for
indecision, he added.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties have been banned since 1973, and the monarch king rules
the kingdom by royal decree.

<HEADLINE> Plant Useful for Family Planning in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Scientific researchers in Zambia
have discovereds a local plant whose active substance is effective
in family planning, controlling malaria, bilharzia and livestock
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by a team of ten headed by Mohammed
Shehata, a scientist in tropical public health at Zambia's
National Council for Scientific Research (NCSR) Kitwe office in
Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency quoted Shehata, an Egyptian scientist
recruited by NCSR in 1985, as saying that it took his team 10
years to make the discovery in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The plant, endod or phytolacco in scientific terms, is also
available in Ethiopia, the Middle East and the United States. It
grows naturally in near sources of water like rivers, streams and
lakes.
</P>
<P>
The research findings show that berries produced by endod
contain about 25 percent of saponin, an active substance that is
effective in killing snails carrying the bilharzia parasite and
larvae of mosquitoes carrying malaria plasmodium.
</P>
<P>
''Saponin also kills sperms and can be used as a compound for
birth control,'' Shehata said.
</P>
<P>
Shehata and his team have over the years developed a
technology of extracting the substance from endod berries.
Saponin alone can be exported to pharmaceutical companies and
earn foreign exchange for Zambia, according to the Egyptian
scientist.
</P>
<P>
Shehata is heading a team in Chililabombwe of Copperbelt
Province to fight bilharzia which is spreading there with many
pupils of local primarybombwe schools affected.

Lebanese and Syrian positions would ensure the liberation of the
occupied lands and the realization of a just and comprehensive
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi Friday night presided at an
extraordinary cabinet session to discuss the latest developments
on the domestic and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
On the top of the meeting's agenda was a bill revising the
contraversial election law, according to which the next
parliamentary election would be held in Lebanon later this month.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the session, the president briefed the
Council of Ministers on his recent meeting with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad" in Damascus last Monday, Minister of Agriculture
Shawki Fakhoury told reporters at the end of the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the president reaffirmed Lebanon's solid
positions as sollowing:
</P>
<P>
First, the Lebanese and Syrian tracks are one track which has
the same goal, namely, the liberation of lands and the
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Second, there is no room to separate or discriminate against
the Lebanese and Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
Third, Lebanon and Syria, as announced by the president on a
number of occasions, will enter the negotiations with a united
stand.
</P>
<P>
Forth, all what has been circulated on the "Lebanon First" is
unacceptable. Fakhoury said it is "because the unity of the
Lebanese and Syrian positions, in the negotiations and on the
results, ensures the achievements of our goals and the realization
of the two peoples' interests.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated
his conditions for a withdrawal from a 15-kilometer-wide occupied
enclave in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli forces would pull out of the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon only after the
disarmament of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas, deployment of
the Lebanese army on the frontier and guaranteed security for
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Assad announced his refusal of the "Lebanon
First" proposal in Cairo Wednesday after meeting Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
To counter the Israeli initiative, Assad declared "Syria and
Lebanon first, at the same time and in the same steps."

<HEADLINE> Only Peace Talks Can End Chechen Conflicts: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Yeltsin, sworn
in today for the second term, said the Chechen conflicts could
only be ended by peace talks, describing the four-day rebels' raid
on the Chechen capital Grozny as a large-scale terrorist move.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist attacks will be resolutely put down," Yeltsin said
in his first statement since fierce fighting re-erupted on
Tuesday, less than three months after he won a ceasefire during
talks with separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev on May 27.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, even in this difficult situation, I continue to
insist there is no other way to settle the conflict in Chechnya
other than the peace negotiations I began on May 27," said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"I will not allow anybody to talk to the federal authorities in
the language of blackmail," he warned, while delivering
condolences to the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today called for sending
specially-trained troops from the Interior Affairs Ministry and
Federation Security Ministry to quell the Grozny fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government today also said in a statement that it
would make all efforts to halt the Grozny bloodshed and seize
Grozny again as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' raid on Grozny, aimed to destroy a stable Russia
and leading to the escalation of the Chechen war, was an offensive
on the whole international community, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports reaching here said fighting between Russian
troops and Chechen rebels in Grozny raged all day around the
headquarters of the pro-Moscow administration in Chechnya, which
both sides claimed to control late today.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 people have been killed since Russian soldiers
marched into the breakaway Caucasus republic in late 1994 to crack
down on a three-year independence drive.

<HEADLINE> OECD: Finnish Economy to Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Finland would see an economic
rebound next year on the basis of good performance in 1996,
according to the latest report released by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
According to the OECD projections, Finland's GDP growth would
be about 2.4 percent this year due to the reversal of the forestry
goods export boom.
</P>
<P>
The exports growth would go up to about 3.5 percent next year,
with the expectation of this year to rebound across the board,
which would remain well ahead of the OECD area's average growth
rate of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, which was as high as 18.4 percent in
1994, has fallen to some 16.4 percent on average this year, and it
would moderately drop to 15.5 percent in 1997, the OECD forecast.
</P>
<P>
Inflation would remain well below 2 percent, while the current
account surplus, which reached 4.3 percent of GDP last year, could
fall back to 3.0 percent next year, mainly because of the sluggish
outlook in the world forestry market.
</P>
<P>
As for the reasons, the report said that the Finnish current
monetary policy framework, which was based on inflation target and
a floating exchange rate, has strengthened the confidence of the
country's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Finland, one of Europe's fastest-growing economies in 1994-95,
faced a temporary slowdown in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Appeals Motorcyclists not to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has called on motorcyclists, taking part in Sunday's
anti-Turkish occupation ride along the island's ceasefire line, to
avoid at all costs any confrontation with the U.N. and not to
enter the U.N. controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a local festival Friday night, the president said
that the bikers will achieve their objective to inform the world
public opinion about the continuing Turkish occupation of Cyprus'
northern areas if there is no confrontation with the U.N.
peace-keeping forces which controls the 180-kilometer long buffer
zone, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The President warned against any incidents in the buffer zone
because such a development would convey the wrong message, he
said.
</P>
<P>
If there is confrontation, the president said, it would look
as if Greek and Turkish Cypriots cannot live together.
</P>
<P>
Should bikers get through to the buffer zone, they are likely
to be confronted by Turkish troops and possibly anti-ride
protesters, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 120 Cypriot and European bikers started a 10-day ride
from Berlin last Friday and will arrive at Limassol port of this
island this morning aboard a ship from Greece.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, they will be joined by about 7,000 Greek Cypriot
riders, and together they will stage a ride along the buffer
zone, and will attempt to ride to the northern coastal town of
Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
Both the Cyprus government and the U.N. have warned against
trouble in the buffer zone during the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides urged the bikers to hand their protest
petition to the U.N. for free movement in Cyprus and the
withdrawal of Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
This, Clerides believes, would have a better impact on would
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot press reported that the Turkish troops had
been ordered to shoot anyone who attempts to cross into the
Turkish-controlled northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Local police are taking all available means to avoid
confrontation and to ensure the status of the U.N.-controlled
buffer zone is not violated.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Students Warned to Guard Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's university and
college students have been warned to guard against indiscipline
as such behavior spoiled their employment opportunities on
completion of their relevant courses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the graduation of 802 students at Kwekwe technical
college on Friday, Secretary for Higher Education Mike Mambo said
indisciplined behavior spoiled the students' employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
''Employers will not accept into their organizations persons
with bad references or persons who demonstrated lack of both
self-application and control and respect of rules at their
colleges,'' said Mambo.
</P>
<P>
In apparent reference to the recent violent demonstrations by
students at the Harare Polytechnic and the University of
Zimbabwe, Mambo said such violence only brought these
institutions to disrepute which in turn affected employment
opportunities for the graduates.
</P>
<P>
Mambo said employers want graduates who demonstrate maturity,
diligence, dependability and discipline.

<HEADLINE> Giraffes Get Skin Diseases in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- About 80 giraffes in Kabalega
national park of Uganda have been attacked by unidentified skin
diseases, reported +the New Vision+ daily today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gladys Kalema, a veterinary doctor for Uganda wildlife
authority was quoted as saying that the diseases seem to infect
50 percent of adult giraffes while the younger ones are normal.
</P>
<P>
Kalema said she went to the park last month to collect skin
scrapes and biopsies and blood sample for examination.
</P>
<P>
She said the skin samples were sent to Makerere university in
Kampala and another blood sample sent to Zimbabwe for comparative
results.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory results will determine the disease and drugs to be
administered, said Kalema.
</P>
<P>
She said the skin diseases, which appear as round gray
hairless patches with a diameter of about 10 cm do not seem to
have affected the animal's health.
</P>
<P>
The patches tend to be more concentrated on white parts of the
skin especially on the animal's long neck and under the arm pits,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Kemp Accepts Dole's Vice Presidential Offer: CNN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Housing Secretary
and Republican Congressman Jack Kemp has accepted an offer by
U.S. presidential challenger Bob Dole as his vice presidential
running mate, the Cable News Network (CNN) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing Republican sources, the CNN said that Dole had called
Kemp to make the offer and Kemp accepted it.
</P>
<P>
With several new polls showing him trailing President Bill
Clinton by 20 points or more, Dole said that selecting a good
running mate is the most important choice in his campaign to win
the presidency in the general elections scheduled for November.

<P>
Kemp, 61, who served 18 years in the U.S. Congress representing
Buffalo, the state of New York, and was the housing secretary
under the former U.S. President George Bush.

Although he had a difficult relationship with Dole in the past,
Kemp indicated earlier in the day that he would be glad to become
Dole's running mate if he would be offered.
</P>

Dole and Kemp had a long meeting in Washington on Wednesday to
discuss the new strategy of the Republicans in the presidential

<HEADLINE> Gurkha Soldiers Demands Equal Treatment from Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's former Gurkha
soldiers, who had served in the British army, have accused the
British government of violating a 1947 tripartite treaty by
treating them discriminately.
</P>
<P>
A group of ex-Gurkha servicemen told a press conference Friday
that they have requested Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba
to take up their four-point demands with the British government.
</P>
<P>
"We want justice from the British government," said chairman of
 the Ex-Gurkha Association Padam Bahadur Gurung.
</P>
<P>
According to him, under the 1947 tripartite treaty between
Britain, India and Nepal on the Gurkha troops, the Nepali soldiers
in the British army could enjoy the same treatment as their
British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
But actually Gurkha soldiers don't enjoy the privileges granted
to British soldiers, he said,.
</P>
<P>
Former Gurkha soldiers, mostly from northern Nepal's hilly
areas, said that they got pensions barely adequate for survival
after returning home from their service in the British army.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Nepali Gurkhas fought for Britain during World War
II, but they were sent home with 'money just enough to travel
home', the ex-Gurkhas said.
</P>
<P>
According to them, British ex-servicemen with same ranks can
get as much as ten times pensions more than the ex-Gurkhas.
</P>
<P>
When India became independent from British rule in 1947, the
Gurkhas, a part of the then Indian army, was divided with some
units remaining with India and others serving the British army
under the tripartite treaty. The treaty provides no discrimination
between British soldiers and Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government when paying salaries and
pensions to Gurkhas cites the Indian army's pay scale,
maintaining that the 1947 treaty does not allow better facilities
for grouches in the British army than those in the Indian army.
</P>
<P>
The ex-Gurkha soldiers living in Nepal earlier had asked the
British government to meet their four-point demands, including
pensions for World War II veterans, equal pensions for British and
Gurkha soldiers, employment help for children of Gurkhas and
rights to live in Britain for retired Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Some Nepali lawmakers also voiced their support for the
ex-Gurkha soldiers' demands, saying the issue is not only a
Gurkha's problem but one about national pride.

<P>
SEOUL, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Seven people on board a rescue
helicopter are feared dead after it crashed last night at the foot
of the Chiri Mountain in South Korea's South Kyongsang Province,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Police found the wreck near a temple about 1.5 kilometers from
a mountain retreat in Sanchong County of the province, the place
where the helicopter picked up two mountain climbers, one of them
suffering from back pain, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers were sent to the scene but they could not find
any survivors from the scattered remains of the helicopter until
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter flew from a fire station to the mountain villa
last night when the mountain climbers called for help.
</P>
<P>
However, communications were cut off between the helicopter and
the fire station soon after it took off, the reports quoted the
police as saying.
</P>
<P>
The police attributed the crash to heavy rains and the ensuing
thick fog which blanketed the Chiri Mountain yesterday evening.

<HEADLINE> Exchange Rate Change Not Needed: Thai Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Central Bank Governor
Rerngchai Marakanond has said that changes to Thailand's foreign
exchange rate system were not needed.
</P>
<P>
He told a seminar on Friday that the country's economic
fundamentals are still strong, supported by the fiscal surplus for
nine consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Bhe Bank of Thailand governor added that short-term external
debt is still below the country's official foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
Early this month there was a heavy dumping of the baht in the
Hong Kong and Singapore swap markets in speculation of a baht
devaluation, triggered off by a poor Thai exports growth during
the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai said at the seminar of bankers that the slowdown in
the Thai economy in the first half of this year was consistent
with the country's goal of maintaining macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
In his view, although the central bank recently revised its
forecast of the country's economic growth for this year from 8.3
percent to 7.8 percent, this did not signal a recession.

<HEADLINE> Interest Subsidy Expected to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A continuous decline in the
monthly price index will drive out an inflation-beating interest
subsidy paid for long and medium-term savings deposits by the turn
of next year, according to the State Information Center.
</P>
<P>
An appropriately tight macro-economic control policy over the
past three years has enabled China to achieve an economic soft
landing it has envisaged, the center quoted figures released by
the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) as showing.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index was up 7.1 percent in the first half of
this year, much lower than the yearly target of 10 percent,
according to the SSB, which noted that the index for June and July
was as low as 5.9 and 5.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The center forecast the price index at seven percent for the
third quarter and 7-7.5 percent for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the retail price index for the whole of 1996 is
expected to stand around 7.2 percent, the center said.
</P>
<P>
"Under this backdrop, the interest subsidy rate will continue
to drop significantly and down to nothing by the end of this year
or the beginning of next year," the center predicted.
</P>
<P>
China inaugurated the interest subsidy in 1988 to counter the
ravage of inflation, which soared to 21.7 percent in 1994. The
subsidy was suspended in 1991 and reintroduced in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
The subsidy rate, announced monthly by the People's Bank of
China, is calculated on the basis of a general retail price index
published by the SSB and is added to the normal interest rate for
savings deposits of three years and longer.
</P>
<P>
In response to declining price rises since last year, the
central bank suspended the subsidy for new deposits on April
1. The decision was not retrospective.

"Malacanang (the presidential palace) should not push it,
because the senate's initial public hearings in Mindanao have
convinced us more than ever that the (proposed) council will not
work. The government and the MNLF (MORO National Liberation
Front) should hammer out a modified peace formula," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari to attend future senate
hearings, stressing that Misuari's face-to-face meeting with
senators is crucial to drafting a revised peace agreement that
could defuse the tension and spell genuine peace and development
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, some senators have already started to soften their
opposition against the establishment of the SPCPD, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christians in Mindanao have stepped up their protest
in the past few days as the government and the MNLF are reportedly
scheduled to sign the final peace pact on August 28 in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Despite warnings from President Fidel Ramos, the city council
of Zambo Friday announced that it would push through with its plan
to purchase 1,000 rifles to arm its citizens against Muslim
"atrocities" if the SPCPD is set up.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Christians in some cities planned to
stage bigger protest rallies at the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Rejects U.S. Sanction Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government today
rejected the United States' imposition on third countries of its
unilateral laws punishing foreign companies doing business with
Cuba, Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed another law
known as d'Amato act aimed at discouraging foreign investment in
Iran and Libya despite strong opposition from the allies to the
Helms-Burton act he signed earlier in March to enforce sanctions
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Dutch government stressed that the
U.S. extra-territorial laws "overtly violate the multilateral
agreements on world trade and investment."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the Netherlands is the world's seventh
biggest country in trade and sixth in international
investment. Furthermore, it is the third biggest foreign investor
in the United States, which is also the biggest investor in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the country's interests in trade and investment are
extremely vulnerable to these U.S. sanction laws, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It announced that the Dutch government is actively
participating in preparing counter-retaliatory measures among the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Netherlands also plans to develop its own laws to
protect its rights and interests, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Federal Forum Fails to Make Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 9 (Xinhua) - A forum designed to strengthen
the Muslim-Croat federation has failed to yield expected results,
a leading Croat official said today.
</P>
<P>
Kresimir Zubak, who is president of the Muslim-Croat
federation, was commenting on Thursday's session of the forum,
which was also attended by U.S. envoy John Kornblum, international
peace coordinator Carl Bildt and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate
Granic.
</P>
<P>
Zubak said in a statement that Muslims and Croats initially
agreed at the meeting to sign two documents: a general declaration
obliging the Croats to abolish their state "Herzeg-Bosnia" and the
Muslim-led republic government to transfer certain powers to the
federation and a document specifying concrete steps and deadlines
for the implementation process.
</P>
<P>
According to Zubak, the Muslim side later denied "all that had
been agreed".
</P>
<P>
Zubak said that the Croats were "ready to transfer powers from
Herzeg-Bosnia to the Federation if the federal partner applied the
same process to the bodies of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina
at the same time".
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the forum session, Zubak said, the Muslim
side insisted that the declaration include a "condition that
Herzeg-Bosna be immediately abolished", which was rejected by the
Croats.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Croats caught the headlines around the world by
announcing that they would abolish their state. But few people
believe this promise will soon be carried out since there is still
deep mistrust between the Muslims and Croats, who reluctantly
formed the alliance under the pressure of the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will try to induce a
greater flow of exports to the People's Republic of China by
holding an 'Indonesia Opportunities '96' exhibition in Beijing
September 26-30, 1996, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition will be an answer to the challenge being faced
by Indonesia in boosting its exports to China," Susila Budi
Moeffreni, president director of Pt Indo Asean Persada, which is
organizing the event, said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was to be organized in cooperation with the
office of Indonesia's coordinating minister for production and
distribution and China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Relations. It was expected to be attended by 23 companies,
including the national aircraft maker Iptn, Sahid group and Citra
Lamtoro group.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesia businessmen had so far been relying too
much on traditional markets while China with a population of 1.2
billion had remained a potential but untouched market.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between China and Indonesia had expanded
rapidly since the resumption of diplomatic ties in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Direct trade between the two countries in 1989 only reached 890
million US dollars. But last year their direct bilateral trade
was recorded at 3.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The value of Sino-Indonesian export-import in the year 2000 was
expected to reach 400 billion US dollars, official sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China's onshore oil industry has
stepped up foreign cooperation in oil exploration and development
by letting the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell enter the Bohai Bay
Basin to search for oil.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and the Shell
Exploration (China) Ltd signed a contract yesterday in Beijing for
exploration in the Qingshui Block, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The prospecting will be conducted at depths over 3,500 meters,
a depth never before plumbed in China. It is hoped the drilling
will uncover new, multiple kinds of reserves of oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
This contract represents the first foreign participation in
exploring deep underground. It is the industry's 30th foreign
cooperative oil contract. Shell will act as operator in the
563-square-kilometer block, shoulder risks and costs and share
reserves when they are discovered.
</P>
<P>
CNPC executives noted that the 30 contracts are diverse,
encompassing areas such as risk exploration, technical solutions,
and enhancement of oil recovery at old oil fields.
</P>
<P>
"The contrast, to be implemented at Liaohe, whose production
accounts for one-third of the country's total, is significant for
opening new horizons and quickening exploration," said Wu Yaowen,
CNPC's assistant president.

<HEADLINE> Investments Drop Drastically in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Investments in projects approved
by the Philippine Board of Investments in the first semester this
year plummeted by 46 percent from the same period last year to
79.5 billion pesos (three billion U.S. dollars), the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista, who is
concurrently chairman of the Board of Investments, attributed the
drop to a smaller number of big-ticket projects.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1995, the board approved several
capital-intensive projects, including a petroleum refinery, major
telecommunications facilities, and petrochemical and cement
plants.
</P>
<P>
Bautista expressed confidence that the inflow of investments
would accelerate in the second half of the year, as projects
costing at least six billion U.S. dollars are expected to seek
approval of the board before yearend.

<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese quarantine officers have
been asked to keep close watch over fruits and vegetables brought
into the country because some top dangerous pests may hide inside
them.
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean fruit flies and moths eating apple and coffee
bean have been discovered for several times from fruits brought by
foreigners at the Beijing Capital International Airport since
July, according to officials with the State Animal and Plant
Quarantine Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Those insects have been listed as the top dangerous pests in
China, the officials said, so keeping them out of the country is
vital to China's fruit and vegetable production.
</P>
<P>
The moth can completely destroyed fruits of apple, pear and
pitch, and coffee beans. The fruit flies can even cause death of
some 250 types of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The officials warned that the summer is especially key to
quarantine work because the hot and humid environment is good to
breeding of the pests.

FUZHOU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The value of Fujian Province's

<HEADLINE> Chip Industry Shows Sluggishness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The world's semiconductor
industry's leading indicator fell in July for the first time in
three months, a sign that the industry may not be rebounding after
all.
</P>
<P>
But market analysts have questioned the validity of the
book-to-bill ratio, because it only covers North America and South
America, which constitute only one-third of the worldwide chip
market.
</P>
<P>
But the news still came as a blow to some chip stocks on Wall
Street, such as Micron Technology, LSI Logic, Texas Instruments,
and Motorola all went down. However, Intel bucked the trend in
active Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
The book-to-bill ratio, compiled by the Semiconductor Industry
Association, fell to a preliminary 0.85 for July, from a revised
0.88 in June, and significantly lower than the 0.95 analysts had
projected.
</P>
<P>
That means that for every 100 U.S. dollars for chips shipped,
chip companies received only 85 U.S. dollars in new orders.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts had expected the ratio to rise for the third
month in a row. Such a rise would have cemented a widespread
belief that the chip industry is emerging from a slump.
</P>
<P>
New orders for July were 2.81 billion U.S. dollars, 5 percent
below June's 2.96 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Currently, computer memory chips make up about 30 percent of
the chip market. So the decline of chip orders indicated also a
slowdown in the computer industry.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Turn Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street turned
lower near the close today as a discouraging report on
semiconductor sales dampened enthusiasm over a tame inflation
report that sent interest rates lower in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 32.18 to 5,681.31.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 325.15
million shares as against 334.56 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.47 to 353.44, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.49 to 662.10.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.66 to 1,135.85, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.97 to 550.80.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rallied this morning after the Labor Department reported
that wholesale prices were unchanged in July, the latest in a
series of signals that inflation is not threatening a six-year
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond slipped below 6.7
percent for the first time since early April, when inflation fears
were becoming rampant.
</P>
<P>
Despite the good news on inflation and interest rates, however,
the stock market was pulled down by Thursday evening's news that a
widely watched indicator of semiconductor industry performance
fell last month, reversing a gain in June that had revived hopes
for speedier growth of the industry.

<HEADLINE> NATO Has To Pay 42 Bln Dlrs for Eastward Expansion: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) might have to pay 42 billion U.S. dollars over
the next 10 to 15 years for its eastward expansion to include four
new members, according to a Pentagon-commissioned report today.
</P>
<P>
The study said that the estimated cost of adding Poland, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary to the western military
alliance would be just 1 or 2 percent above NATO's current
spending levels. The U.S. share of that would be an estimated 400
million to 750 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
But the report said that NATO would be worth spending the money
considering the benefits the alliance's expansion will have for
both individual countries and European security as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The 42 billion U.S. dollars plan is based on a more modest
"Joint-Power Projection" that would keep most of the alliance's
troops and weapons in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly stated its strong opposition to any NATO
enlargement that would put either nuclear weapons or large numbers
of Western troops in the new member states.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Sanctions Committee Selects "Overseers" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Iraq Sanctions
Committee of the U.N. Security Council decided today on the
selection of four independent experts to supervise Iraq's oil
sale.
</P>
<P>
The experts in international oil trade who will serve as
"overseers" at the U.N. headquarters are Arnstein Wigestrand of
Norway, Maurey G. Lorenz of the United States, Bernard Cullet of
France and Alexandre V. Kramar of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Should there be a need for a fifth overseer as work progresses,
Xie Changxian of China would be recommended by the secretariat for
the post, according to the sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
Tono Eitel, chairman of the committee, has forwarded the names
of the selected experts to the secretary-general for appointment.
</P>
<P>
The selection of the "overseers" is another step forward for
implementation of Resolution 986 adopted by the Security Council
in April 1995. Following the resolution, Iraq is allowed to export
oil worth 2 billion dollars over six months for import of food,
medicine and other necessities so as to alleviate the suffering
caused by the six-year-old economic sanctions.

<HEADLINE> US Official in Russia for Chemical Weapons Ban Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. top arms control
official is visiting Russia to discuss ways of speeding up the
ratification of a three-year-old global chemical weapons ban, his
office said today.
</P>
<P>
John Holum, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
(ACDA), went to Moscow Thursday for a meeting of a special joint
group set up last month to discuss chemical weapons, ACDA
spokeswoman Christie Dragan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will include a trip to the city of Volgograd "to
address issues of chemical weapons production facilities," the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia signed, along with a number of
other countries, the Chemical Weapons Convention in Paris in
January 1993, but neither has ratified it. The convention, which
bans the production, stockpiling and use of poison gas, has not
yet come into effect because only 60 of 65 countries required have
ratified it so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Holum urged the Republican-controlled
U.S. Congress to speed up the procedure for the ratification of
the convention.
</P>
<P>
He stressed he believed the U.S. Congress move would promote
the ratification of the Russian parliament.
