<P>
NEW DELHI, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The 11-day-old ministry led by
Prime Minister I.K. Gujral was expanded today with the induction
of six ministers, including former finance minister P.
Chidambaram, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
Of the six ministers sworn in here today by Indian President
Shanker Dayal Sharma, four are from the Tamil Maanila Congress
(TMC), a major constituent of the ruling United Front.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Nadu-based regional party, which had earlier refused
to joint the Gujral government, on Tuesday decided to rejoin the
government to make it more stable.
</P>
<P>
The other two ministers are from the Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
Among the newly-inducted ministers, P. Chidambaram, M.
Arunachalam, S. Jaipal Reddy were sworn in as cabinet ministers

were ministers of state.

Only Reddy was a new face while the rest had served in the H.D.
Deve Gowda government.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, except for Reddy, are widely expected to get
back the portfolios they held in the Deve Gowda government.
</P>
<P>
With today's expansion, the strength of the Gujral government
has gone up to 40, of which 19 are of cabinet rank and the rest
ministers of state.

<HEADLINE> Progress in Russia-U.S. Talks, Rifts Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States today
reported progress in talks between Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and his United States counterpart, Madeleine
Albright, but said differences remained.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on a document governing Russian-North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) relations, European security
and relations between Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We have somewhat narrowed the differences," Albright told a
joint news conference with Primakov. She added however that there
was still "some way to go."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the talks were successful and will be continued.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the differences between the two sides lay in the
military field.
</P>
<P>
"There are some outstanding issues ... they include mainly
military questions."
</P>
<P>
Russia is trying to strike a deal with NATO so that Moscow will
have a say in NATO's policy-making process after the planned
eastward enlargement of the military bloc.
</P>
<P>
During her last visit to Moscow in February, Albright and
Primakov reached an understanding in principle that a possible
agreement between Russia and NATO should be of legally-binding
nature.
</P>
<P>
Before today's talks, Russian President Boris Yeltsin talked
with Albright by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the document on Russian-NATO relations must be
prepared with due attention.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the understanding reached in the
Russian-U.S. Helsinki summit must be materialized.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. government was committed to constructive
dialogue with Russia and sought to find a solution acceptable to
both sides.

<HEADLINE> US Personal Incomes, Spending Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Personal incomes in the U.S.
increased by 0.6 percent in March, helping to support the second
straight 0.5 percent increase in consumer spending, the Commerce
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that personal incomes totaled 6.75 trillion
dollars at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the month, up from
6.71 trillion dollars in February.
</P>
<P>
The 0.6 percent growth in incomes slowed from the revised 0.8
percent gain in the previous month but surpassed the 0.3 percent
increase in January. The February advance originally was reported
to be 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Private wages and salaries, the most closely watched component
of income, rose 27.7 billion dollars on top of a 48.7 billion gain
in February. It was attributed to an increase in employment and
average hourly earnings, which more than offset a decline in
average weekly hours.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- increased by 0.6
percent after surging 0.8 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumer spending totaled at an annual rate of 5.37
trillion dollars, compared with 5.35 trillion a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The 0.5 percent gain in spending was stronger than the 0.3
percent increase in February but down from the robust 1.2 percent
jump in January.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of the
U.S. economy, was the driving force of the economic growth in the
first quarter when it surged at 5.6 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
However, recent data suggest growth is beginning to slow to a
more sustainable pace resulting from the raising of short-term
interest rates in March by the U.S. Federal Reserve in an attempt
to keep the economy from overheating and sparking an acceleration
in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
saving rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income --
edged up to 5.3 percent from February's 5.2 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The personal income and spending figures were not adjusted for
inflation. When adjusted, disposable incomes rose 0.5 percent, the
same as in February. Spending rose 0.4 percent, twice the 0.2
percent gain a month earlier.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Down Slightly in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending in
March declined slightly from the previous month but several
construction sectors remained strong, U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that total construction spending reached a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 600.1 billion U.S. dollars in
March, down by 0.2 percent from the revised construction spending
in February.
</P>
<P>
The spending on private construction declined by 0.6 percent to
its lowest level since July 1996, the second straight month of
falling.
</P>
<P>
But spending for the construction of residential buildings
reached a record level in the month. The seasonally adjusted
annual rate jumped by 1 percent to 256.6 billion dollars from
revised February levels.
</P>
<P>
Included in this increase was a boom in spending for
single-family houses that increased the annual spending rate to a
record 159.2 billion dollars. However, total spending rates for
multi-family structures saw a slight dip.
</P>
<P>
Construction spending on projects for hotels, motels and
religious buildings also climbed to record annual spending rates,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Public construction spending jumped 0.9 percent from February's
rate to a record high level, as more dollars were spent into
such projects as schools, water supply facilities and conservation
projects.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Denounces Attempt on Tajik </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today deplored the assassination attempt on the life
of Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov, who suffered a minor leg
injury in a hand grenade explosion Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Tajik counterpart, Rafsanjani expressed the
hope that the Tajik president will recover soon.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry also condemned the assassination
attempt and expressed hope that the belligerent Tajik sides will
do everything to safeguard the achievements of the peace talks
until national reconciliation is full in place in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred in the northern town of Khojand on Wednesday
when the hand grenade was thrown at the president's feet and
exploded as he got out of a car.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and 60 others injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack came at a time when Rakhmonov's hard-line government
has been negotiating a peace settlement with opposition groups
that have been waging civil war since 1992 in the impoverished
Central Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
As a mediator, Iran had provided offices and other facilities
for the peace talks between the Tajik government and the
opposition group in the past few months.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Protest at Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Several hundreds of Palestinians
held a demonstration today at the controversial building site of
Har Homa, a new Jewish neighborhood on the southeastern outskirts
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Despite condemnation by the Palestinians and the international
community, the construction at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim), which
started in March, has been continuing under heavy security guard.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators at today's protest called on Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat to hold a
referendum to determine whether the Palestinian people should
continue the peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Council Member Salah Tamari, who also
participated in the protest, urged Arafat to "seriously consider
stopping the peace process" if Israel does not stop the Har Homa
building project.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has suspended political contacts and security
cooperation with Israel since the Israeli government decided to
go ahead with the building of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
A recent Palestinian poll, conducted by the Nablus-based
Palestinian Center for Research and Studies, showed a sharp drop
in support for the peace process from 73 percent to 60 percent
during the past month.
</P>
<P>
This was accompanied by an increase in support for suicide
bombings, with 44 percent of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip
supporting the Tel-Aviv bombing attack in March, compared with 17
percent support for attacks in February-March last year.
</P>
<P>
Support for Hamas, or the Islamic resistance movement, jumped
from 7 percent to 11 percent in Gaza in one month, while the
support for the Oslo accords dropped from 81 percent to 60
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen policemen and 11
demonstrators were injured in clashes following the "May Day"
rally in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out when the Turkish security forces tried to
stop the demonstrators who were destroying a bus with stones and
sticks at the Osmanoglu Street of Piyalepasa Boulevard, said the
agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the demonstrators set fire at a bus and a
garbage truck in Okmeydani after the rally, organized by trade
unions of Turk-Is, DISK and KESK, for the celebrations of the "May
Day" in Caglayan Square in Istanbul. Some 100,000 workers attended
the rally.
</P>
<P>
Security forces used tear-gas grenades and opened fire into air
in a bid to disperse a group of about 150 paraders who set fire at
the garbage truck in the place, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Many people were taken under custody in connection with the
clashes between the police and the demonstrators, said the
agency.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations were held for celebration of "May Day" in
several other large cities such as Ankara and Antalya and ended
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 policemen were on duty today in Istanbul to
prevent possible incidents during the celebrations and the "May
Day" clash last year claimed three lives in the city.

<HEADLINE> WMO: 1996 Was Eighth Warmest Year Since 1860 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 was the eighth
warmest on record since 1860 and the eighteenth consecutive year
with positive global temperature anomalies, according to a press
release of the U.N. Department of Public Information today.
</P>
<P>
The press release was based on an annual statement on the
status of the global climate by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO).
</P>
<P>
The 11-page WMO statement chronicles the major weather events
and significant climate anomalies during 1996, and is based on
continuous observations made over land and ocean by the national
meteorological and hydrological services of WMO member countries.
</P>
<P>
The most predominant feature of 1996 was the extent and
magnitude of heavy precipitation affecting many parts of the
world, notably in southern Europe and parts of northern Africa and
Middle East, which were deluged with record rainfalls early in the
year.
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast to the very dry conditions that characterized
most of the previous decade, the above-normal rainfall brought
welcome relief to those in the Iberian Peninsula. It was also the
second consecutive year with above-normal hurricane activity,
reaching a near-record two-year total, according to the press
release.

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Disease Threatens Europe: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Mad cow disease may be quietly
spreading across the whole Europe because farmers and
veterinarians are failing to report sick cows, according to a
report in the New Scientist magazine.
</P>
<P>
Government officials across Europe reportedly agreed that
ignorance and fear were contributing to the spreading of BSE or
mad cow disease and they urged better checks for the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we have had (unreported) cases of BSE in Belgium,"
the report quoted Emmanuel Vanopdenbosch, head of BSE at the
National Institute for Veterinary Research in Brussels, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that animals with strange symptoms of the
central nervous system had been slaughtered and often ended up on
supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
Bram Schreuder, head of BSE research at the Dutch Institute for
Animal Science and Health in Lelystad, said that 57,900 British
cattle were exported to the rest of Europe for breeding between
1985 and 1990 and at least 1,688 of them should have become sick.
</P>
<P>
The European Union imposed a world-wide ban on British beef
exports last March when the British government admitted possible
links between BSE and its human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozanbican president Joaquim
Chissano today expressed satisfaction over the 6 percent growth
in gross domestic product (GDP) made last year and pledged to
improve the labourers' living conditions as far as possible
this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the International Labour Day celebration today,
the president said that the government will do its best so that
the lives of the labourers will be better than last year,
admitting at the same time that despite economic growth last
year, there was no conspicuous improvement in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Last year, inflation in the country was reduced to 16.6
percent, exports increased 30 percent and agricultural output
value increased 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican prime minister Pascoal Mocumbi also said at the
rally that the government will give priority to education, public
health and employment and will take measures to reduce living
costs and improve labourers' living conditions.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 workers gathered at the Maputo Labourers'
Square to celebrate the International Labour Day today.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Continues to Grow in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's manufacturing activity grew
for the 11th consecutive month in April, a leading business survey
showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers' index published today by the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply rose to a seasonally-adjusted
53.1 last month from 52.8 in March on the index where figures over
50 indicate growth while below 50 show contraction.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that companies continued to raise output to
meet further improvements in order books although the rate of
growth for export orders again dropped due to the sustained
strength of sterling last month.
</P>
<P>
However, there was little sign of inflationary pressure in the
sector as the prices index was unchanged at 40.5.
</P>
<P>
Britain's economy is in a fairly healthy state, with steady
growth, falling unemployment and low inflation, the institute
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Voting is still underway in the country's general election, but
despite the booming economy, voters seem unlikely to give the
Conservative government any credit as all opinion polls indicated
a big victory for the opposition Labor Party.

<HEADLINE> S. African Cabinet Calls for Anti-Mercenary Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africans invloved in
mercenary activity outside the country are to serve 10 years in
jail or pay a fine of up to one million Rands (227,272 U.S.
dollars), Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The South African cabinet, which approved the bill yesterday,
would introduce legislation in parliament, proposing such a
severe punishment and barring illegal mercenary activity abroad,
SABA said.
</P>
<P>
Companies and individuals, who want to offer any
military-related sevices outside South Africa, will in future
have to seek government approval before signing contracts,
National Conventional Arms Control Committee Chairman Kader Asmal
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asmal, also Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry, said he
would also request other countries to implement similar laws.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has been embarrassed at reports
of South African mercenary activity abroad.
</P>
<P>
The best known mercenary recruiting outfit is Pretoria-based
Executive Outcomes, which reportedly deployed its soldiers in
Angola and Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> BMW Chief Warns Against British Opting out of EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Bernd Pischetsrieder, head of the
German leading car manufacturer BMW, has warned that Britain could
lose its role as Europe's main financial center if it stays out of
a single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview today, Pischetsrieder warned
that British manufacturing would be harmed if the country did not
take part in European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt would take over from London as the leading financial
center in Europe, he said. "If Britain should stay out for a long
time at the beginning, I think the financial capital of Europe
will be Frankfurt, not London anymore."
</P>
<P>
Pischetsrieder, whose company owns some shares of British car
maker Rover, stressed that remaining outside a single currency
zone would also hurt British manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
"This is very easily described. BMW will earn more money by
exporting more BMWs to Britain, and Rover will increase its losses
because they are already selling more than 50 percent outside
Britain, which means Britain will be less competitive."
</P>
<P>
"You can't increase local selling prices, so Rover is
accumulating higher losses, and so is everybody else manufacturing
in Britain," he said.

<HEADLINE> World Wheat Production to Be 5m Tons Lower for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Following the revisions for several
countries, world wheat production is now forecast 5 m. tons lower
at 578 m. tons, compared with 580 m. in 1996, International Grains
Council (IGC) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The main changes include lower figures for the EC and United
States, and increases for China and Central/Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Although small adjustments also have been made to forecast
import requirements for some countries, the projection for world
wheat trade remains at 94 m. tons, 3 m. up on 1996/97, IGC said.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast at 581 m. tons, down 1 m.
tons, and world stocks are projected to fall by 3 m. tons. during
1997/98 to 95 m. tons, it added.
</P>
<P>
As far as coarse grains is concerned, world production is
forecast at a record 897 m. tons, compared with 889 m. tons in
1996, according to IGC's announcement.
</P>
<P>
Better prospects for Central/Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine,
the United States and some African countries may be only partly
offset by reductions in output in the EC, Canada and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade in coarse grains will again depend heavily
on developments in Far East Asia, which accounts for around half
of global imports, IGC said.
</P>
<P>
The growth of some 5 percent in annual output of compound feed
in recent years, dominated by demand for pig and poultry rations,
should lead to a further expansion in demand for maize, in
particular, IGC argued.
</P>
<P>
World trade in all coarse grains is projected at 90 m. tons, up
from 88 m. tons this season, it estimated.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Al-Assad Call for Furthering Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad today underlined the need for
pushing forward the deadlocked Mideast peace process but ruled out
an imminent pan-Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held at the end of the meeting in
the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, the two presidents
asserted their firm commitment to comprehensive and just peace on
the basis of restoring Arab rights and the land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
They cautioned that the peace process is going through a state
of stalemate, which should be overcome through "every possible
effort."
</P>
<P>
"Both the Arabs and Israelis want peace," Mubarak said, adding
that just and comprehensive peace has to precede cooperation in
the Mideast region.
</P>
<P>
Hailing Egypt and Syria as the "prop of the Arab nation,"
Al-Assad asserted their keenness on standing up to the current
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al-Assad noted that "we want peace but it has to be
based on restoring our rights."
</P>
<P>
"We have a long way to go but we must go on," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour talks, the presidents continued their
frequent discussions on the need to achieve a just, comprehensive
and durable peace in the region, as well as to close Arab ranks.
</P>
<P>
"Arab-Arab relations are as staunch as they were and contacts
between the Arab leaders are sustained," Mubarak said in reply to
a question if inter-Arab relations are better than they were
before the Arab summit held in Cairo last June.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak opposed holding an imminent Arab summit and stressed
the importance of implementing resolutions of the Cairo Summit
that recommend reconsidering normalization steps with Israel if it
fails to comply with signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
But in case the peace process runs into a dead end, he said,
Arabs will hold such a summit to make resolute decisions. "But I
wish it never happens," added Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Syria had favored a comprehensive Arab summit to confront the
Israeli settlement practice, but Egypt said such a move is still
premature.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Al-Assad deplored that there are "some parties in
the region that would not propel peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president, accompanied by Vice President Abdul Halim
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Shara, flew to the southern
tip of the Sinai peninsula this morning on a lightning visit to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The meeting topped Mubarak's renewed diplomatic offensive to
revive the stalled peace effort as the Arabs become increasingly
disillusioned with what they perceived as a biased U.S. mediation
role in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
Returning from his brief visit to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia last
weekend, Mubarak said he is ready to organize a mini Arab summit
grouping Jordan's King Hussein, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Al-Assad but he made this conditional on Israel's readiness to
take steps to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also offered to host a four-way summit grouping
Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Arafat and King Hussein, on
the condition that Israel halts settlement buildings on Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the
Jewish state, has been a mediator in the peace process which
witnesses stalemates in all tracks.

<HEADLINE> Cashew Nut Industry in Mozambique May Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- If the Mozambican government
continues the policy of exporting raw cashew nut without
processing, the country's cashew nut industry will stop
production this June, warned Secretary-General Soares Mhaca of
the Central-Sindical Mocambicana here today.
</P>
<P>
To export unprocessed cashew nuts will greatly reduce raw
materials for domesitc cashew nut processing industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mhaca made the remarks today at the International Labour Day
rally. Due to lack of raw materials, the cashew nut processing
industry virtually came to a standstill, thus making 1,800 people
jobless, he said, adding that by June this year, an extra 7,000
people will join the army of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
To liberalise cashew nut prices has been one of the
requirements of the World Bank which imposed many preconditions
on Mozambique in support of its reform of the economic structure
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has implemented strict restrictions on raw cashew
nut exports and used to levy a 20 percent export tax in order to
protect domestic cashew nut processing industry. However, under
the pressure of the World Bank, the raw cashew nut export tax was
reduced to below 14 percent last year, giving an impetus to
export to the detriment of domestic cashew nut processing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique once recorded an annual cashew nut output of
210,000 tons and there were as many as 12 cashew nut processing
plants. However, it produced only 60,000 tons of cashew nut
last year.

<HEADLINE> Joint Investigative Mission for Eastern Zaire Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The three members of the
Joint Investigative mission into human rights violations in
eastern Zaire have started their two days of preparatory meetings
in Geneva before traveling to the region on Saturday, a U.N.
spokesman announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press briefing that the Mission
would be briefed by United Nations agencies and non-governmental
organizations and would elaborate the terms of reference for the
Mission and its work-plan.
</P>
<P>
The mission will also hear the views of representatives of the
Zairian government and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo/Zaire (ADFL).
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council, in a presidential statement adopted
on Wednesday, expressed once again its deep concern over
continuing reports of massacres, other atrocities and violations
of international humanitarian law in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Zairian rebels have reportedly taken control of the eastern
half of Zaire in a seven-month campaign to oust President Mobutu
Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council statement underlined the importance of
the Mission, reiterating its call on the ADFL and others in the
region to cooperate with the Mission by ensuring unimpeded
access to all areas and sites under investigation, as well as
the security of the members.
</P>
<P>
The Mission was established by resolution 1997/58 of the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
In opening comments to the meeting in Geneva earlier in the
day, the Officer-in-Charge of the High Commissioner/Center for
Human Rights, Ralph Zacklin, said that the Mission had been
described as a "litmus test of the good faith and willingness of
all parties to cooperate with the United Nations."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader Laurent-Desire
Kabila said here today the march on Kinshasa will continue
despite the pending meeting with ailing President Mubutu Sese
Seko.
</P>
<P>
Briefing local journalists after a meeting with Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe at state house in Harare, Kabila said,
"why not? I think we must go forward. We must liberate Kinshasa
but we are now discussing with others to try and solve the
problem by peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said the meeting between the two protagonists
was scheduled to take place on Friday on a South African naval
supply ship.
</P>
<P>
"I have been told it (meeting) will now be on Saturday because
Mobutu has changed his mind again," said Kabila, sporting his
trademark green safari suit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which the rebel leader said would discuss a
peaceful transfer of power, if held, would be the first
face-to-face between Mobutu and Kabila, whose rebels have seized
more than half of Zaire since October and are advancing on the
capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who arrived here today from his south eastern Zaire
headquarters, said he had come to Zimbabwe to brief Mugabe in his
capacity as the incoming Organisation of African Unity (OAU)
chairman on developments in his country and to seek the southern
African nation's support for their struggle.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who said he had not received an invitation to the
meeting which will be chaired by South African president Nelson
Mandale, said he hoped the two would agree "on the way forward"
for the sake of peace and stability in the region and Africa as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe added, "my own attitude is to wish them well and hope
this meeting will produce some understanding that will lead the
people of Zaire to new peace."
</P>
<P>
Kabila was due to leave Harare immediately after the meeting.

with separate rallies in the capital despite heavy rainfalls.
</P>

A rally, organized by the General Confederation of Trade Unions

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri reiterated here today that neither Syria nor Lebanon
would sign a separate peace with Israel, noting that the two Arab
states will never yield to threats.
</P>
<P>
Opening the third conference of Cancer in the Middle East,
Al-Hariri held Israel responsible for the current stalemate in the
Middle East peace process, and said that the policy of the Israeli
government leads to the deadlock of its negotiations with Lebanon
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the peace which Lebanon wants is a just and
comprehensive one in the region based on the principle of
exchanging land for peace.
</P>
<P>
"This is what Lebanon and Syria uphold," he said, adding that
"we together refuse any attempt to separate the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks from any side and under any slogan or initiative. It
is a firm truth and a national decision which can not be discussed
or disputed."
</P>
<P>
"In confronting the continuous Israeli refusal to resume these
negotiations from where they had reached, we state again that the
peace is our strategic choice because Lebanon is a peace-loving
country and denounces aggression," the prime minister underlined.
</P>
<P>
"This peace choice, however, absolutely does not mean that
Lebanon will accept any (separate) peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our another choice is the resistance against the (Israeli)
occupation, with an adherence to a demand of the Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon according to U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425," Hariri added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Geneva-based
International Organization for Migration (IOM) James Pourcell
praised Angola here today for its resettlement of ex-servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Pourcell told reporters at the end of his four-day visit to
Angola that about 65,200 ex-servicemen and their families have so
far been resettled and given relief materials in the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the pace of demobilizing and resettling fighters of
the former warring parties is slow, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the large-scale demobilization, for which the IOM
needs 28 million U.S. Dollars, may be completed in five months.
</P>
<P>
The IOM will manage to have 100,000 Angolan military
personnel return to the civil life with the support of
10 non-governmental groups engaged in humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said he will visit some donor countries in the near future
in a bid to acquire money.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the visit of Pourcell, who arrived here on April
28, is to raise funds for Angola's demobilization. He will leave
here for Geneva later today.
</P>
<P>
The 55-member IOM, set up in the 1950s, aims to ensure the
worldwide migrants to move orderly. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt Vows to Protect Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government today vows
to continue protecting the workers in the southern African
country whose economy is expected to rise by five percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
"As the government, our concern lies with the welfare,
protection and security of the workers," Zimbabwean Public
Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro said
at a rally here to mark the International Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to maintain constant dialogue
with the labor movement on the welfare of the workers and
industrial efficiency and productivity, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We acknowledge and commend the high degree of maturity shown
by the labor movement of Zimbabwe which is evidenced by an
equally high degree of industrial peace and tranquility upon
which rest investment decisions," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I must, however, hasten to add that retrenchments are on a
downward trend and this is a healthy sign as regards the
performance of our economy as well as positive attitudes in the
field of labor relations," she said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Canadian Consumers Think Now Is Good Time to Buy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- More Canadian consumers think that
now is a good time to make a major purchase, though many of them
felt their financial situation had worsened over the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
Releasing today its Spring 1997 Index of Consumer Attitudes,
the Conference Board of Canada said the index reached 106.9, up
2.1 points over the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
"Low interest rates and the belief that rates have hit bottom
have convinced consumers that now is a good time to buy," said
Paul Darby, director of the economic services of the board, a
renowned private economic think-tank here.
</P>
<P>
Canadian interest rates have been at its bottom for the time
being, with the prime lending rate at 4.75 at the end of March, a
level not seen in over 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The current low rates, combined with the belief that the rates
will not go any lower, have convinced 56.8 percent of respondents
that now is a good time to make a major purchase.
</P>
<P>
However, "labour market weakness continues to hold back further
growth in our consumer index," Darby said.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer balance sheets are still fragile thanks to low real
disposable income growth and historically low interest rates which
are making people want to borrow. The result is high consumer and
mortgage debt levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the board Index of Business Confidence
continues to set records, up 7.1 points to a level of 160.3.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders feel current investment conditions are
excellent and they expect their financial situations to improve.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian businesses feel that economic conditions will improve
over the next six months," Darby added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Thursday maintained the economic sanction which it imposed upon
Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
President of the Security Council Soo Gil Park told reporters
after consultations there was no change with regard to the
economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Every two moths, there is a routine consultation of the
Security Council on the sanctions. Iraq has to destroy all its
chemical, biological weapons and missiles before the council can
decide to lift sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia, France and some other members argue that
sanctions should be eased in view of the progresses achieved by
Iraq in destroying the massive destructive weapons, the United
States and Britain insist that no change can be made.

ALGIERS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed
Attaf today called upon the international community to exercise
pressure on Israel to resume the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast by Radio Algiers, the Algerian
minister attributed the stalemate to Israel's denial of all of its
commitments and accords with the Arab parties.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the only way out of this impasse lies in
Israel's respect of its international obligations, and in the
recruiting of efforts of the international community.
</P>
<P>
He called on the peace process mediators, including the
European Union, to persuade Israel to respect these commitments
and accords, as well as the rights of the Arab countries.

Speaking on the crisis in Zaire, he called upon the concerned
parties to seek a negotiated resolution of the crisis.

LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) today began to repatriate 3,046 Sierra Leonean
Refugees in Liberia by sea, air and road, a report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
About 1,690 refugees are being transported by sea on three
Sierra Leonean government ships and one UNHCR chartered vessel,
while 200 went home on a UNHCR-chartered flight.
</P>
<P>
About 1,150 refugees on the Sierra Leonean-Liberian
border would return home on foot or by truck.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Sierra Leone, each refugee will be provided
with an assistance package comprising two months' food rations
from the World Food Program, a plastic sheeting, two mats, a
jerrycan, a lamp, a kitchen set and two blankets, a UNHCR
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Last February, the UNHCR repatriated some 1,200 Sierra Leonean
refugees by sea and another 200 by air.
</P>
<P>
In March, the UNHCR appealed to the donor community for 17
million U.S. Dollars to help repatriate and reintegrate an
estimated 380,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in west Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Half of the world population
will be urban dwellers by 2006 although the population
urbanization is developing at a slower pace than previously
envisioned, the United Nations Public Information Department said
today.
</P>
<P>
The department quoted a recently released 1996 Revision of
World Urbanization Prospects as saying that some 46 percent of the
world population are now urban dwellers, but the percentage is
expected to raise to half of the population by 2006.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. study, over three fifths of the world
population will be urban by 2030, five years later than previously
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is currently the largest urban agglomeration in the
world, with 27.2 million residents in 1996--more than one and a
half times as large as the world's second largest agglomeration,
Mexico City, with 16.9 million.
</P>
<P>
The Revision updates estimates and projections of urban,
rural and city populations. These figures, which are the standard
and consistent set used by the United Nations systems and
international community, are updated every two years by the
population service.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. figures show that the urban growth rate in the less
developed regions reached 3.4 percent per annum during 1990-1995,
compared with only 0.7 percent in the more developed regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Surgeons at the University of Nigeria
Teaching Hospital in Enugu State have successfully sealed a hole
in the heart of a two-year-old boy, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The operation, lasting more than two hours, was performed last
week by a team of doctors led by Martin Aghaji, a consultant
cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, whose name was not identified, expressed her
joy at the outcome of the surgery, saying that her son's heart
problem was noticed when he was six months old.
</P>
<P>
A hole in the heart will lead to blood flowing from the left side
of the heart to the right rather than the other way round, medical
experts say.
</P>
<P>
The wrong circulation of blood, they say, leaves too much
blood in the heart, thus resulting in too much pressure being
exerted on it, a situation which could lead to the collapse of
the heart.
</P>
<P>
The mother said she once had planned to have the operation
abroad, which would have cost the family two million Naira (about
24,000 U.S. Dollars).

<P>
TEHRAN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Iran has launched a project to
build modern submarines in the southern shore of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the statement while he was inspecting the
Armed Forces Naval Academy Complex in Mazadaran province, northern
Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the official news agency IRNA did not specify how
many submarines are under construction or whether they are
assembled with imported parts or 100 percent home-made.
</P>
<P>
Iranians have been talking about a potential military attack by
the U.S. armed forces deployed in the Persian Gulf as the Clinton
administration accused Iran of involvement in the bombing of
U.S. military complex in Saudi Arabia last June. The attack killed
 19 U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian military forces have already purchased three
submarines from Russia since the beginning of 1990s. The last one
was delivered last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the IRNA report, Rafsanjani stressed that the
security of the nation is the most vital issue and underlined
that naval presence is significant for the progress of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The security, maritime safety and preservation of territorial
waters is the responsibility of the naval forces," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Provides More Funds to Ukraine to Destroy Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States will provide
an additional 47 million U.S. dollars to Ukraine for destroying
the strategic nuclear missiles left by the former Soviet Union,
according to a U.S.-Ukrainian agreement signed today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and his Ukrainian counterpart, Olexander Kuzmuk, at a
ceremony at the Pentagon. The U.S. has already provided 404
million U.S. dollars to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The fund will help Ukraine complete destruction of the SS-19
missiles and begin planning destruction of the more modern SS-24
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine removed all nuclear warheads from its SS-19 and SS-24
missiles last year.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was the third-largest nuclear power in the world after
the Soviet Union disintegrated. "The nuclear forces of Ukraine
were composed of the Strategic Rocket Forces and also of the
strategic weapons that were within the air force of Ukraine,"
Kuzmuk told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint briefing with Cohen, Kuzmuk said, "Once we
renounced our nuclear status and once we took upon ourselves...
Ukraine has done so indeed."
</P>
<P>
Ukraine made a "very bold and progressive" decision to
dismantle its strategic nuclear arsenal, Cohen said. "The people
of Ukraine recognize that security comes from constructive
alliances and not from nuclear weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also accepted an invitation from Kuzmuk to visit Ukraine
this summer.

Vice-President Shangwa Chifamba said today.
</P>
<P>
At a rally marking the International Workers' Day in Gweru of

"We want to see an equitable distribution of Zimbabwe's

He added the cost of living in Zimbabwe has gone up
significantly over the years and that the country's minimum
monthly wage should reach 2,400 Zimbabwe Dollars (218 U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, since such a sum was not feasible, the minimum wage
should now be pegged at 1,200 Zimbabwe dollars (109 Dollars)
while companies and organizations that could afford should pay
more.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to reduce income taxes.

WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross is
going to the Middle East next week, managing to bring the
precarious peace process in the region back on track, the State
Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
"The president and Secretary Albright are sending Ambassador
Ross back again to consult further with the parties on the steps
they're prepared to take to re-energize the process," State
Department spokesman John Dinger told reporters at a news

</P>
<P>
His assessment of the situation there will help the Clinton
administration to make judgement on how "the United States can
best help the parties make progress," he added.

Ross was dispatched to the Middle East in mid-April when
Palestinians rose to protest Israel's breaking the ground in east
Jerusalem to build Jewish housing units and negotiating talks
between the Israelis and Palestinians was suspended thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday that the
United States intended to remain involved in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>

"We have made quite clear that the U.S. will continue to play
the role of broker, but the parties themselves have to give us
more to work with," she said on her way to Moscow.

In a mass rally to mark the International Labor Day in Kitwe

In the privatization process, resources are redistributed,

He assured miners that privatization of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) will inject a new lease of life
in the mines and "bring back economic activity to the
Copperbelt".
</P>
<P>
He attributed loss of jobs in some companies which have been
privatized to overemployment in the past.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged to help street vendors set up their
markets around Zambia.

There have been calls for the removal of the street vendors,

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen
today appointed former Senator Warren B. Rudman as a special
adviser on Gulf War illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made one day after a White House panel
reported to the president that the military investigation into
whether U.S. troops may have been exposed to chemical weapons
during the Gulf War is moving too slowly.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news briefing with visiting Ukrainian
Defense Minister Olexander Kuzmuk, Cohen today told reporters that
Rudman would serve as an "independent overseer" of the collection
of facts.
</P>
<P>
Rudman, who left the Senate in 1992, now serves as vice
chairman of President Bill Clinton's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board.
</P>
<P>
"There still continues to be criticism about the level of
cooperation that is existing. There is some criticism directed at
the department," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Rudman will ensure that "the information is not
being withheld, there is no cover-up."
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf Illnesses said in a
report to the White House Wednesday that Pentagon was too cautious
in drawing conclusions about which troops could have been exposed
to Iraqi chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Although experts are divided over whether exposure to chemical
weapons can cause the kinds of health effects Gulf War veterans
have reported, the panel said troops should have been notified of
any potential exposure to poisons.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hopes New UNSCOM Chief to Boost Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi ambassador to the U.N. has
expressed hope that the newly appointed chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) would boost cooperation with
Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New
York Thursday, Nizar Hamdoun hoped that Ritchard Butler, who will
replace the present UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus on July 1, would
succeed in boosting the cooperation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoun also expressed the hope that the UNSCOM would stop
"issuing political comments and statements and keep committing
to its assigned technical and professional aspects."
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation is the only active way to get closed all
files on Iraq's mass destruction weapons and consequently to get
para 22 of the U.N. resolution 687 implemented, Hamdoun
stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to para 22 of the cease-fire resolution 687 issued
at the end of the 1991 Gulf War, sanctions imposed on Iraq will
be lifted after Iraq fulfills all its commitments to the
U.N. relevant resolutions concerning Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoun informed Annan of Iraq's annoyance for the slow
implementation of the oil-for-food deal signed by Iraq and the
U.N. last May.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S, dollars worth of
oil every six months to buy food and medicine urgently needed in
the country which is hit by the U.N.-imposed sanctions after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing the U.S. of "purposely and
unjustifiably" hampering the ratification in the U.N. Sanctions
Committee on Iraq of food and medicine contracts reached between
Iraq and foreign companies under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat also urged for increasing the number of
experts responsible for revising food and medicine contracts.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.N. Secretary-General, he stressed that he has
began to take measures to expedite the work for getting approved
the trade contracts submitted by Iraq to the sanctions
committee. And he himself would follow up this subject during
the coming days, said Annan.
</P>
<P>
Both Annan and Hamdoun agreed that the UNSCOM should be
committed to its assigned duties defined in accordance with
U.N. resolution 687, which is said to be limited to professional
and technical aspects only.

<HEADLINE> Albright Leaves for Home After Additional Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 2 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright wound up her two-day visit to Russia today
after postponing her departure for additional talks with her
Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The additional talks on Russian-NATO relations were held behind
closed doors at the request of Albright, who delayed her departure
scheduled for 11:00 a.m. Moscow time, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
No details of the talks were available. However, an agreement
between Russia and NATO still seems to remain an open question,
and military issues remain the most thorny ones for mutual
coordination.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here Thursday, held talks with Primakov
soon after her arrival.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the talks, Primakov
said: "There is every reason to believe that the two sides want
the treaty on relations between Russia and NATO to be signed in
Paris on May 27."
</P>
<P>
He said the presidents of Russia and the United States were
interested in "continuing the talks in a constructive direction."
</P>
<P>
During her short visit, Albright also had a telephone
conversation with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who backed the
intention of the two ministers to concentrate on the military
aspects of European security.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Albright that it was important to work in a
thorough way in drafting a document on Russia-NATO relations, and
especially to specify the understanding reached at the Helsinki
summit early this year.

<HEADLINE> German Tennis Star Stich to Retire in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- German tennis star Michael Stich
announced Friday in Hamburg that he will retire at the end of the
season because of a long-time shoulder injury suffered since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Stich climbed to No. 2 rank worldwide in 1993, but he has
dropped to 26th.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Wimbledom titlist and 1993 world champion said he had
thought about retiring after an injury in late 1995. A first-round
defeat at a Barcelona tournament last month triggered his decision.
</P>
<P>
Stich said he will play this year's French Open and Wimbledon
tournaments before ending his career in Germany's Davis Cup
relegation series against Mexico in September.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Stich helped Germany win the Davis Cup. He has won 18
ATP tour singles titles and nine in doubles.
</P>
<P>
Stich's downfall began October 20, 1995, when he tore a
ligament in Vienna playing Todd Woodbridge, the left ankle
twisting as he fell down writhing in agony.

<HEADLINE> Blair Promises to Unite Britain Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new prime minister Tony
Blair today promised to "unite the nation" after 18 years of
Conservative rule and form "a government of practical measures."
</P>
<P>
In his first public speech outside his new home No. 10 Downing
Street, Blair told reporters and a crowd of cheering people, "We
have secured a mandate to bring this nation together, to unite as
one Britain, one nation."
</P>
<P>
A moment before he arrived at the Downing Street, Blair kissed
Queen Elizebath's hand in Buckingham Palace and accepted her
invitation to form a new government after John Major handed in his
resignation as prime minister to the Queen.
</P>
<P>
"For 18 years, 18 long years, my party has been in opposition.
It could only say, it could not do. Today we are charged with the
deep responsibility of government," the youngest British prime
minister of this century said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, enough of talking. It is time now to do."
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old new prime minister said he realized the huge
responsibility on his should and promised "a government of
practical measures in pursuit of noble causes."
</P>
<P>
"The victory is a mandate for new Labor and not a return to the
past," he pledged, adding "The New Labor government will govern in
the interests of all people."
</P>
<P>
He also paid tribute to his rival and former prime minister
Major, saying he was a man of "decency and dignity."
</P>
<P>
Major had earlier left Downing Street. Before his departure,
he said in his farewell speech that he would resign as the
Conservative Party leader when a replacement was chosen.
</P>
<P>
With all but 26 of the 659 seats counted, the Labor Party was
on course for a majority of almost 180 seats, ensuring Blair a
comfortable majority in the parliament for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Turnout among the 44 million voters was 71.3 percent -- a
record post-war low. In the 1992 election, 77.7 percent of the
electorate voted.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Following are business briefs from
the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates(UAE) is seeking more
investors for a mobile telephone satellite to expand the range of
telephone coverage in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Thuraya (chandelier) satellite venture has already
attracted seven shareholders from the UAE and other Arab
countries and more are expected to contribute this year, the
daily "Emirates News" quoted officials in charge of the project
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have conducted negotiations with new potential subscribers
from inside the Arab world and outside it", said the officials
from the UAE state-run Etisalat telecommunication company which
owns 26 percent of Thuraya to become the biggest shareholder of
the satellite.
</P>
<P>
"We expected them to announce their contribution to the
project after July", they said at MIDCOM, an international
telecommunication exhibition in Abu Dhabi, the UAE's capital.
</P>
<P>
"This will enable us to secure more funds for the project and
at the same time promote the satellite. This means that the
designed coverage areas will be expanded", they added.
</P>
<P>
New shareholder could come from India and other south and
southeast Asian countries, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The Thuraya satellite, the first in the UAE and the fifth in
the world, would cover the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey,
Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Southern Europe and possibly
parts of southeast Asia, they said.
</P>
<P>
This means coverage could extend to South Korea, Thailand,
Indonesia, Singapore and other Asian countries, depending on the
market demand.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The prospect for the 7,000-year-old Egyptian textile
industry is gloomy as it has been cramped by hikes of cotton
price and lack of renovation.
</P>
<P>
Some even fear that the long-time industry is approaching the
verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The volume of textile exports, which represent about a quarter
of overall Egyptian exports, slumped by 21 percent to 2.5 billion
pounds (740 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 from 3 billion pounds
(880 million dollars) in 1995, according to a report by the
Committee of Industrial Production and Energy.
</P>
<P>
The limping industry is now fighting a losing war with its
fierce rivals in South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Turkey and
Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt failed to compete with the top 10 textiles exporters
whose collective exports reached 95 billion dollars in 1994, or
73.8 percent of the world's total textile exports.
</P>
<P>
Nor is it made to the list of the biggest 10 clothes
exporters, which distributed 81.7 billion dollars worth of
garments to the world markets.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A symposium on means of activating and stimulating
Egyptian exports will be held Sunday on the sidelines of the 22nd
International Conference of Statistics and Computer Science, the
English-language newspaper The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Supply, Internal and External Trade Ahmed
Goweli will inaugurate the symposium which will discuss the role
of the state bodies in promoting Egyptian exports.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Trade Representation Sector Ahmed Khalid Hamdi and
some other government officials will attend the forum.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian government-sponsored structural adjustment
and economic reform programs are beginning to pay off, the latest
edition of the English weely Al-Ahram quoted an International
Monetary Fund (IMF) representative in Egypt as saying.
</P>
<P>
The representative, Arvind Subramanian, told the weekly just
days before an Egyptian government delegation is scheduled to
head for Paris for talks with leading donor country and
organizational officials, that "overall, the economy continues to
maintain a very sound and robust performance as fiscal
consolidation continues."
</P>
<P>
Since Egypt began implementing the IMF-inspired structural
adjustment and economic reform program in 1994, macro-economic
indicators have provided evidence that the first steps to reform
have already begun yielding results.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, by last February, had declined to 5.4 percent and
the budget deficit dropped to 0.8 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
These gains, however, should not be mistaken for the idea that
all roads will lead to increased reform, Subramanian said, adding
that the Egyptian government still needs to introduce a package
of reforms that will generate more investments and assure the
level of efficiency and productivity.

<HEADLINE> Autonomy of Minority Nationalities Fruitful in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The system of regional autonomy for
minority nationalities has been successful in China since Inner
Mongolia became the country's first autonomous region on May 1,
1947.
</P>
<P>
In Inner Mongolia, where Mongolians, Han Chinese, Manchus and
people of the Ewenki, Oroqen, Daur and Hui ethnic groups live
together in an area of 1.18 million sq km, the number of cadres of
ethnic minorities has soared to 169,700 from 7,000 shortly after
the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
People of minority nationalities now account for 44 percent of
the leadership at various levels in Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs of China's autonomous regions, prefectures, counties
and banners are all from the local ethnic minority groups, no
matter how small their populations are.
</P>
<P>
Respecting the languages and customs of different ethnic groups
and developing education in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities
are major indicators of equality among all nationalities.
</P>
<P>
In areas where the autonomy of minority nationalities
is practiced, one or more local languages are used.
</P>
<P>
At the congress of the Communist Party of China, the National
People's Congress and the meeting of National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, documents are
written not only in Han Chinese but also in the languages of seven
minority nationalities -- Mongolian, Tibetan, Uygur, Kazak,
Korean, Yi and Zhuang.
</P>
<P>
The Party and government have over the past decades attached
great importance to economic development in areas inhabited by the
ethnic minorities. Since the beginning of the reform and opening-up
drive in the late 1970s, the relatively more developed areas of
China have launched massive programs to assist the five autonomous
regions of Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Ningxia and Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
In Tibet most of the 62 projects supported by other parts of
the country have already been completed.
</P>
<P>
As the 21st century approaches, China's 55 ethnic-minority
nationalities are catching up with the rest of the country
rapidly.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Seizes Record High Pirated Laser Disc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Custom seized 116,000
pieces of pirated laser disc, the largest number ever captured, in
a raid upon a local factory.
</P>
<P>
Custom officers searched a workshop in the New Territory
Thursday and found the big batch of pirated disc, estimated to be
4.6 million HK dollars (590,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The pirated products were shipped into Hong Kong for sale, said
a Custom officer.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong custom launched more than 1,000 actions last year to
crack down on piracy and infringement on intellectual property
right. The confiscated laser disc amounted to one million pieces,
with a market value of 47 million HK dollars (6 million US
dollars).

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Last-minute disputes over tax cuts kept the White House and
republican leaders from closing a historic agreement to balance
the budget by 2002, extract deep savings in Medicare and provide a
net tax cut of 85 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- After climbing steadily for more than two decades, sexual
activity among American teenagers has declined, the first drop
since the federal government began tracking the information in
1970, according to a new government survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Justice Department said the Immigration and
Naturalization Service was falling further behind in processing
the record number of immigrants seeking citizenship.
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair and the Labor Party triumphed by a historic
margin in Britain's national election, ending 18 years of
conservative rule.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate Commerce panel approved a measure that would cap
product-liability damage awards and set other limits in injury
suits, launching a Republican effort to revive the issue after
Clinton vetoed a similar bill last year. Separately, the Senate,
99-1, passed a bill to shield volunteers from liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
-- Yeltsin urged the U.S. to give "concrete meaning" to
assurances given in Helsinki that the planned expansion of NATO
into former Warsaw Pact nations won't threaten Russia. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright met with her Russian counterpart in
Moscow, but made little progress on a charter allowing Russia
consultations with NATO.

<HEADLINE> Major Drugs Trial Opens in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hanoi People's Court today began
the high profile trial of 22 people alleged to be involved in the
country's biggest drug case.
</P>
<P>
Among the 22 accused, 11 were Vietnamese police officers and
border guards, including the Interior Ministry Police Captain, Vu
Xuan Truong.
</P>
<P>
The scandal dates back to January 1995 when two Lao nationals
were arrested in Vietnam after they were found in possession of 15
kg (30 pounds) of heroin.
</P>
<P>
One of the men offered information which led to the arrest of
about 30 people, and gained the informant a reprieve from
execution.
</P>
<P>
The trial, expected to last 10 days, would be much longer than
normal trials in the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been plagued by drugs problems in recent years,
with new statistics showing that 200,000 of the country's 75
million population take drugs.
</P>
<P>
The government, which started a three-year anti-drug campaign
last year, is now struggling to control the spread of drug use and
trafficking in major cities, including Hanoi and the Ho Chi Minh
City.

<HEADLINE> Record Field for HK's Tsing Ma Bridge Marathon Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A record field of over 5,500 local
and international runners are making their final preparations for
the historic Swire Group Tsing Ma Bridge Marathon and 10K-km Race
slated for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The field comprising over 900 marathoners and 4,600 10-km
runners, will inaugurate the Bridge -- the world's longest
suspension bridge carrying both road and rail traffic -- in a
spectacular style, the organizers claimed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 international runners from 15 countries and regions
have arrived in Hong Kong to compete in the landmark event.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's national champion Peter de Vocht, 36, leads the men's
race, boasting a personal best time of two hours, 14 minutes and
54 seconds he created in 1992.
</P>
<P>
While for the women's division, it is Germany's Susan Bitzer, a
31-year-old pharmacist, who came out to be the hottest favored for
the title. Bitzer's personal best is 2:41:00.
</P>
<P>
But both felt the warm weather and higher humidity in Hong Kong
 pose a threat to their efforts for a better show.
</P>
<P>
"I'm used to cold climate and the temperature back to my home
town in Germany was just five degrees centigrade," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We had a snowfall two weeks ago and temperature at early
morning was below zero," said the former cross country skier.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to run or even to improve the personal best,"
admitted De Vocht. But he promised to give his best shot here.
</P>
<P>
Tsing Ma Bridge, the Kap Shui Mun Bridge and the Ma Wan viaduct
 which connects them form the Lantau Link, which is one of the key
 projects in Hong Kong's New Airport Core Program project.
</P>
<P>
Tsing Ma Bridge has a main span of 1,377 meters long and a
total length of 2.2 kilometers. A grand opening ceremony was held
 at the Bridge to celebrate the completion of construction of the
Lantau Link.

<HEADLINE> New Round of Fighting in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- At a time when the faction
leaders of Mogadishu are outside the country, the Somali capital
is experiencing a new round of fighting. One of the heaviest
clashes has taken place between the militiamen of Hussein Mohamed
Aidid and those of his south Mogadishu rival, Mr Osman Hassan Ali
Atto last night.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have again fought over the control of the
hostile strategic junction of k-7 linking Mogadishu to the
southern regions and the k-5 street near the headquarters of the
Somali Red Crescent Society and the former Care International
Compound. Both sides are reported to have suffered casualties.
However, hospital sources confirm the death of three people while
more than seven were treated of gun shot wounds.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Dr Hassan Jis Memorial Hospital recorded the death
of a militiaman who was among the war victims they admitted into
the hospital last night. The doctors further more said that the
fighting last night has caused no heavy casualties since it was
taking place at late time when everybody was indoors.
</P>
<P>
Even though the intensity of the fighting has eased early in
the morning, the exchange of sporadic heavy shelling has
continued until 10:00 local time in the morning. The vibration of
the shelling from mortar rounds, the Russian made m-3, d-30 and
85 mm artillery rounds have however shook the walls of the nearby
residential areas of Hodon and Hawlwadag districts of south
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 12 people are believed to have died in the
renewed armed confrontations between the supporters of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid and those of Osman Ali Atto since the beginning of
the week. The reason for the renewed clashes between the two
sides is not yet known, however Osman Atto's faction has accused
Hussein Aidid's side for igniting the war. And as usual there's
no word yet from Hussein Aidid's side over the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Specialists with Foreign Credentials, Now A New Force in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- With the growing economic bond
between Hong Kong and the mainland, a new breed of management
executives with both China background and internationally
accredited academic credentials is being nurtured.
</P>
<P>
The HR Education Group of Hong Kong disclosed today that about
90 percent of its students taking the Murdoch MBA Program taught
in Chinese have Chinese mainland background. The fact highlights
the formation of a new pool of China specialists in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Murdoch University and the HR Group jointly offered
the first MBA program with China components in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Dean of the Business
School at Murdoch University Alan G. Davison said, "With the
impending handover of Hong Kong back to China, a stream of
management talents from the People's Republic of China are finding
their ways into the Hong Kong business community."
</P>
<P>
"Armed with an in-depth knowledge of the PRC's political and
economic environments and with worldwide recognized academic
credentials, these China specialists are popular recruits for Hong
Kong companies, particularly mainland corporations based here.
Their growing number is having an increasing impact on Hong Kong's
business world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Key Hong Kong business sectors, including finance and banking,
manufacturing and construction, trading and retailing, are
competing to recruit these executives for senior management
positions.
</P>
<P>
So far Murdoch's MBA programs in Hong Kong have recruited over
230 students.

<HEADLINE> UAE Seeks More Subscribers for Thuraya venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 2 (Xinhua) The United Arab Emirates(UAE) is
seeking more investors for a mobile telephone satellite to expand
the range of telephone coverage in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Thuraya (chandelier) satellite venture has already
attracted seven shareholders from the UAE and other Arab countries
and more are expected to contribute this year, the daily "Emirates
News" quoted officials in charge of the project as saying.
</P>
<P>
" We have conducted negotiations with new potential subscribers
from inside the Arab world and outside it", said the officials
from the UAE state-run Etisalat telecommunication company which
owns 26 percent of Thuraya to become the biggest shareholder of
the satellite.
</P>
<P>
" We expected them to announce their contribution to the
project after July", they said at MIDCOM, an international
telecommunication exhibition in Abu Dhabi, the UAE's capital.
</P>
<P>
"This will enable us to secure more funds for the project and
at the same time promote the satellite. This means that the
designed coverage areas will be expanded", they added.
</P>
<P>
New shareholder could come from India and other south and
southeast Asian countries, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The Thuraya satellite, the first in the UAE and the fifth in
the world, would cover the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey,
Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Southern Europe and possibly
parts of southeast Asia, they said.
</P>
<P>
This means coverage could extend to South Korea, Thailand,
Indonesia, Singapore and other Asian countries, depending on the
market demand.
</P>
<P>
"Each shareholder may be responsible for marketing and
delivering the Thuraya personal communications services in his
home country. Other service providers who are not shareholders
now may also be considered (of being shareholders)," the Etisalat
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Etisalat said earlier that the services of Thuraya project,
the biggest telecommunication contract in the Middle East region
would include voice, data, fax and messaging.
</P>
<P>
The 850-million-dollar contract will be awarded in July and
the satellite will be put into orbit in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Three companies are competing for the deal after the French
Alcatel telecommunications giant has just been excluded. They are
Aerospatial of France, and Hughes and Locheed of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said at the MIDCOM that the Swedish
telecommunication company Ericsson would likely win a subcontract
to provide mobile phones for Thuraya. However, the speculation can
not be proved so far.

enterprise to promise to invest in the park. It will invest 3.6
million US dollars in telecommunications equipment.

<HEADLINE> Booming Township Enterprises In South Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in south
China's Guangdong Province have scored a good start in the first
quarter of this year, by producing 65.4 billion yuan worth of
industrial output, or a year-on-year 23.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Lin Jianrong, a township enterprise
administrator, as saying that the province's governments at all
levels have been developing township enterprises as one of the
most significant sectors in the rural economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Lin attributed the boom of the province's township enterprises
to the emphasis on the industrial sector at all levels of the
province's governments.
</P>
<P>
Lin took the city of Shantou as an example. The city has helped
its township enterprises win more shares in the domestic market by
holding product shows and economic cooperation seminars in China's
hinterland, and collected a domestic trade volume that rose by 15
percent as a result.
</P>
<P>
Zhongshan, a city in the Pearl River Delta, sponsored an
economic seminar in Hong Kong at the beginning of the year, and
secured a contractual overseas investment of 429 million US
dollars for 146 projects, as well as another 341 million US
dollars for 175 export trade contracts. The city's township
enterprises have been flooded with orders, some of which cannot be
filled out until year end.
</P>
<P>
Chaoyang city invested 265 million yuan into 103 pioneering
enterprises for expansion, equipment purchases, and renovations,
which led to an added output value of more than 80 million yuan in
the first two months.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Guangzhou, Zhaoqing, and Zhanjiang have all
laid out blueprints or specific priority policies to promote
township enterprises, Lin said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos to Make Special Pitch for Mindanao's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos would make a
special pitch for Mindanao, the southern Philippines, to foreign
investors during his forthcoming visit to the United States,
Mexico and Panama beginning May 6.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing at the Presidential Palace today, Ramos urged the
members of his delegation to make extra efforts in bringing to the
foreign investors' attention the latest positive development in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
A lot of investment opportunities in Mindanao await businessmen
because of the enhanced peace and order situation and the
formation of several economic growth centers there, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the Moro National Liberation Front signed a
peace agreement last September, bringing to an end a 24-year-old
war which seriously damaged the economic development there.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also pointed out that foreign investors must be made
aware of Mindanao's large unexpected resources that could be
developed for the mutual benefits of the country and the
investors.
</P>
<P>
He assured joint ventures in the South will gain profits
because of the booming East ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) Growth Area, which is composed of Brunei and parts of
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN also includes Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam besides
the four countries mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
Together with President Ramos in the trip are First Lady
Amelita Ramos, three cabinet members, six lawmakers and some 86
businessmen.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Use of ISO Environmental Management Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to expand the use
of the standards of the International Standards Organization (ISO)
in environmental management, in a bid to get enterprises to put
resources to rational use and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, has approved
the establishment of a committee to promote this work. The
committee, whose members are leading officials from some 30
central government departments, will be headed by the director of
the State Bureau of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the standards, called ISO 14000, is to improve
management, and curb pollution and waste. Experts here held that
the standards will enable the country's environmental protection
to work more scientificly and effectively, and will coordinate the
development of the economy and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the SBEP said that China still has many
poorly-equipped factories, which contribute to pollution and waste
a lot of energy.
</P>
<P>
"The standards will help them to control pollution and waste in
the whole production process, while reducing the impact of human
activities on the environment," they said.
</P>
<P>
The standards are applicable to both modern factories and
outdated ones, sources said, revealing that four modern
enterprises have received ISO 14000 certificates, while another 22
are awaiting certification.
</P>
<P>
China started implementing the standards from April 1 this
year.

HONG KONG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's property transactions
in April were more than those in any previous months, with the
number of deals surging 57 percent to some 25,300 and a total
value of 106 billion HK dollars (13.59 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>

20,910 deals registered in October 1991 and 20,600 deals in April

</P>

The substantial increase in registration values was attributed
to the pre-sale of several big developments while two-thirds came
from government-subsidized Home Ownership Scheme projects, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Estate agents forecast that May transaction volume figures
would fall sharply as a result of the market's abrupt correction

BONN, May 2 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Further Market Declines Expected in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 2 (Xinhua) --The Philippine stock market fell
further Friday with its composite index sliding 42.52 points to
2,605, and analysts expect more declines in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive trading day the market suffered a
sharp decline.
</P>
<P>
The market crash started Tuesday when the 30-stock Philippine
composite index nose-dived 128.87 points, or 4.54 percent, to
2,708.44, the lowest level in two years.
</P>
<P>
After the biggest single-day drop in two years, the Central
Bank of the Philippines imposed the 20-percent limit on bank
lending to the property sector.
</P>
<P>
And as property is used as collateral for a loan in the
country, the central bank also ordered that banks should not lend
more than 60 percent of the appraised value of that property.
</P>
<P>
Despite the swift action by the central bank, the market fell
another 60.27 points, or 2.23 percent, to close at 2,648.17
Wednesday. There was no trading session on Labor Day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Poor earnings of some big companies, including blue-chip
companies, in the first quarter and a possible economic slowdown
in the country could be partly attributed to the nose-dive in the
market, but the main reason for the sharp fall is investors' fear
of a property-related crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the property index has
tumbled 17 percent while the overall market is down 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that investors have become increasingly concerned
that the Philippines could be hit by problems similar to those of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, years of excessive bank lending, estimated at over
30 percent of total portfolios, has led to over-supply of housing
units and a large amount of bad loans. In the capital Bangkok,
some 50 billion U.S. dollars worth of property is unsold,
abandoned or under construction. The number of vacant units in the
capital ranges from 385,000 to 400,000 at present.
</P>
<P>
With the collapse of a real estate bubble in Bangkok, banks and
finance companies are now struggling with 15.5 billion dollars of
bad loans.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, a central bank survey indicates that bank
lending to the property sector only accounted for 11 percent, but
individual bank exposure to the sector is as much as 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predicted slower sales and earnings from many
of the property companies in the coming years. All Asia Securities
Management Corp. estimated in a property report that total new
supply will exceed total new demand by 211 percent in the year
2000 for residential developments, and by 142 percent for
commercial developments.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts still doubt that the Philippines is headed
for a Thai-style crisis as the problems, such as bank lending to
the property sector and property-related bad loans, are not as
serious as in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government also denied that a Thai-style crisis
would occur in the Philippines, saying that the higher U.S.
interest rates should be blamed for the market fall.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to allay fears of investors, President Fidel
Ramos told a press conference Wednesday that the nation's economy
is "very sound" despite the market decline and the pullout of some
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"The pullout of some foreign investments in the equity market
is because of the rising interest rates in the United States,
meaning the investors have a better destination to go to because
of the promise of higher returns," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, many analysts believe that the market will continue to
suffer from an overhang from the poor corporate earnings and the
property sector concerns in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Trading will continue its bearish mode as market players wait
for fresh economic news and earnings of corporations in the
country, they said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, foreign fund managers are still waiting for the fate
of key interest rates in the United States with the next meeting
of the Federal Open Market Committee scheduled for May 20, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they said, the market is unlikely to make a quick
recovery in less than two weeks.

<HEADLINE> China to End Free College Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Tuition-free education for college
students will soon end in China as the country's remaining 368
free colleges and universities begin charging students fees this
year.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,032 colleges and universities in China, 664 stopped
providing free education last year and implemented the tuition
payment system, today's China Daily quoted a spokesman of the
State Education Commission (SEC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The State will continue to provide loans, subsidies,
scholarships and work-for-study activities to those
financially-strained students to help them finish their college
study, said Zhao Jianjun, an official of the SEC's Financial
Department.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates show that about 20 percent of China's three
million college students come from financially-strapped families,
with an average monthly per capita income below 200 yuan (about 24
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
These students will be subsidized with State aid, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
He said that students specializing in agriculture, forestry,
water conservancy, education and geology, who are willing to work
in these fields after graduation, can receive special
scholarships, since the State is encouraging more students to
enter these sectors.
</P>
<P>
In China, the tuition system was first experimented in 40
colleges and universities in 1994 in an effort to reform free
college education that was a strain on State coffers, according to
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, each student is required to pay 1,500
yuan each year for tuition.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities can slightly adjust the tuition
standard according to their conditions, with the approval of local
educational administrations, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The system is also intended to unify various fee collection
standards in different colleges and universities, and stop those
unauthorized overcharges.
</P>
<P>
In the past, some colleges enrolled students who failed college
entrance exams because they paid money to the schools.
</P>
<P>
The money-based learning system resulted in a relatively poor
academic standards in these schools and created unfair competition
among students, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Such practice will be totally abandoned with the nationwide
implementation of a tuition system starting this fall semester, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Major Announces Readiness to Quit as Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- John Major, who was ousted out of
power in Thursday's general election, announced today he would
step down as the Conservative Party leader.
</P>
<P>
Before departing to Buckingham Palace to hand his resignation
as prime minister to Queen Ilizabeth, Major told reporters
emotionally outside No. 10 Downing Street, "When the curtain falls
it is time to get off the stage."
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped a new Conservative leader would be found
fairly quickly "to lead the party through opposition in the years
ahead" but that he would remain at the Conservative service until
a replacement was chosen.
</P>
<P>
With all but 29 seats counted, the Labor Party was on course
for a landslide majority of almost 180 seats, ensuring Tony Blair
to govern Britain for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The defeat was on a scale unseen for 165 years with six cabinet
ministers, including Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Defense
Secretary Michael Portillo, losing their seats.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives were also left without any members of
parliament in Scotland and vast swathes of south-west England,
where the center-left Liberal Democrats inflicted most damage.
</P>
<P>
But Major said the Conservatives could be proud of their
achievements during the past 18 years and promised they would be
back.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the former Conservative prime minister Margaret
Thatcher expressed her disappointment today to the crushing defeat
of John Major.
</P>
<P>
"She is hugely disappointed. She has no plans to make any
further statement. She stayed up late into the night watching the
results," the local media quoted the Iron Lady's press secretary
Elizabeth Buchanan as saying.

KUNMING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
has introduced a computer software system in its 35
poverty-stricken counties to help them increase grain output and
plant high-return cash crops.
</P>
<P>
The system, named "Computer Agricultural Expert" and using
artificial intelligence, can provide advice on agriculture,
technology and economics, including seed strain selection and
fertilizer saving, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the province plans to earmark 4.3
million yuan (about 500,000 US dollars) as a special fund for this
system every year.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has been developing software in the field since 1992,
and has scored remarkable achievements in some pilot counties. In
Ninglang, an autonomous ethnic-minority county, the average
per-unit area yield of maize rose 9.3 percent, that of paddy rice
climbed 11.5 percent, and that of apples grew approximately 30
percent, figures show.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also plans to spread the use of an
agricultural technology database from this year on.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British Industry
(CBI) urged the imcoming Labor government to stick to what it
promised to do during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Labor's landslide victory of the General Election,
Adair Turner, Director-General of the CBI, said today: "The CBI
congratulates Labor on its historic election victory and on
forming the new Government."
</P>
<P>
Turner also said: "We welcome Labor's specific commitments on
inflation, personal tax and departmental spending levels, its
focus on the vital importance of improving an education system and
thus workplace skills, and its determination to ensure the
completion of the European Single Market."
</P>
<P>
However, Turner said, the challenge for the new government is
to maintain the economic background against which business can
succeed.
</P>
<P>
"Labor has pledged that it will, and now has the chance to
prove it," he added.
</P>
<P>
In opposition, Labor leader Tony Blair and his colleagues have
been keen to seek the views of business. Turner said: "CBI now
looks forward to working with them in Government to ensure that
the key messages are not lost."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the policies where CBI has concerns, Turner said
the priority is now to ensure that the government reflects
business interests in the detail of implementation.
</P>
<P>
"This will be vital with respect to the level of the minimum
wage, the extent and nature of the windfall tax and the details of
union recognition proposals," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Kohl Visits Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
arrived in Port Douglas on Queensland's far north coast late today
for an official visit to Australia.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, accompanied by a 60-member delegation of German business
executives, was met by federal Industry Minister John Moore,
representing Prime Minister John Howard. He will spend the weekend
at Port Douglas.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's visit is part of a concerted push by Germany for closer
integration with the fast-growing Asia-Pacific economies. He will
travel to Canberra Sunday ahead of official talks with Howard next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the visit represented a major

Howard is expected to discuss with the chancellor Australia's
greenhouse reduction proposal. He planned to raise the issue with
every foreign leader he could find ahead of a global summit in
December in Japan at which an international agreement on stronger

Australia is opposing binding targets on the grounds it would
significantly harm the economy because of its heavy reliance on

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Increase Cotton Growing Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set a target of growing
28,000 hectares of cotton this year, 83,000 by 2000 and 120,000 by
2010, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, cotton areas stood at 15,000 hectares, including 3,500
hectares of hybrids, with an average yield of 1.2 to 1.3 ton per
hectare compared to an average productivity of 0.7 tons for other
varieties.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's annual yarn output is expected to reach 50,000 tons
by the year 2000 and to be doubled ten years later, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The current yarn production of 4,000 tons a year can only meet
10 percent of the demand of Vietnam's textile industry, which has
to spend 120 million U.S. dollars annually importing textile
materials including cotton, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong said the foremost task is
to give growers access to more cotton varieties, particularly
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1997 and 1998, a loan from the International
Monetary Fund would be used to build modern cotton processing
plants in key cotton growing provinces in Vietnam's central
highlands and the south.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Leaves for Meeting With Mobutu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela today left capital Pretoria for Pointe-Noire, Congo where
he will accompany Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to have
face-to-face peace talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Mandela told reporters that he
believed the Mobutu-Kabila talks, to be held on a South African
naval ship off the African coast later today, would result in
some "forward movement" in Zaire's peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If I was not positive, I would not be going," he said, adding
that both Mobutu and Kabila want a settlement and are aware of
the importance of the forthcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kabila reportedly said yesterday while visiting Harare,
Zimbabwe that his forces will continue to march on Kinshasa
despite the planned peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He also said he had been told the talks had been postponed to
Saturday because "Mobutu had changed his mind again."
</P>
<P>
However, South African presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana
said this morning that the talks will still go ahead today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Foreign Minister Alred Nzo reportedly will meet
Mobutu in Pointe-Noire before accompanying him to the South
African naval ship SAS Outeniqua.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad met Kabila in Luanda, Angola
this morning before departing for the ship talks.
</P>
<P>
United Nations special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun and Congolese
President Pascal Lissouba will also attend today's talks,
informed sources said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Seeks End to Zairean Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Zaire deserves a better deal through
negotiated political transition and an end to anarchy,
Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim
said here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to put an end to the war and negotiate a
transition that will create a new order in Zaire," said Salim who
arrived here to attend the Summit of African First Ladies on
Peace scheduled for May 5-7 in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite acknowledging that the Zairean rebels, led by Laurent
Kabila, have a military advantage over President Mobutu's force,
Kabila stressed that it was only by peace talks that the crisis
could be best resolved.
</P>
<P>
The OAU secretary-general said he believed that African women,
through mobilization and effort of the first ladies, could
contribute meaningfully towards resolving various social problems
emanating from the crisis in their countries, particularly the
problems of war refugees.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 African countries have indicated their desire to
participate in the summit and about 30 first ladies will lead
official delegations to the conference.

<HEADLINE> British Labor Party Wins in General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Labor Party swept to
power early Friday, beating the ruling Conservatives with a
biggest ever victory in the general election.
</P>
<P>
With all but 30 seats counted, Labor has so far gained 417
in the 659-seat lower house, beating the Conservatives on a
scale unseen in 165 years. Six cabinet ministers, including
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo, lost their seats.
</P>
<P>
"A new dawn has broken, has it not? And it is wonderful. We
always said that if we had the courage to change then we could do
it. And we did it," Blair, the 43-year-old would-be British prime
minister told a large crowd of cheering supporters with a broad
smile early Friday morning in the Royal Festival Hall on the bank
of the River Thames.
</P>
<P>
"Today on the eve of this new millennium the British people
have ushered in this new era of politics," said Blair, who became
the Labor leader three years ago after his predecessor died of a
sudden heart attack and has reformed his party to a "new Labor"
since.
</P>
<P>
"We will work with business to create that dynamic and
enterprising economy we need and we will work with all our people
for that just and decent society the British people have wanted
for so long," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the main reason for Blair to win a landslide
victory was that voters wanted a change as they were fed up with
the 18-year rule of the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the sleaze and sex scandals of senior government
officials and the division of the Conservatives over Europe, which
dominated the election campaign, have turned the traditional
voters away.
</P>
<P>
Even though Prime Minister John Major himself was re-elected
member of parliament in his Huntingdon constituency, he looked
shocked to see the terrible result and conceded the defeat.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we have been comprehensively defeated. Let us not
pretend to ourselves it was anything other than what it was," said
Major, who had remained optimistic and confident to win the
election till the end of the 46-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
Although Blair won a comfortable victory in the election, his
inexperience in government office will put him in the uncharted
water immediately and test his ability as head of government.
</P>
<P>
The toughest early test will be in foreign arena when
Blair goes to three summits in June and July -- the European
Union, the Group of Seven industrialized nations, and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"It's just a new beginning, not an end," one of Blair's
close aides said early Friday.

Comrade Peng Zhen for a long time presided over the work of the
NPC Standing committee, and made painstaking efforts to establish
and improve the system of people's congress. As early as in 1951,
he pointed out that "the system of the people congress is China's
fundamental political system, the basic organizational form for
the whole people to run the country, and the best, most effective,
and most important form for us to follow the mass line in work
concerning political power."
</P>
<P>
During the new historical period, he put forward the principle
that the people take the future and destiny of the country of the
Chinese nation into their own hands through the system of the
people congress, and this is guarantee for people's fundamental
interests. It is also a reliable guarantee for China to withstand
various risks; The NPC Standing Committee, conducting its work in
accordance with responsibility entrusted by the Constitution,
should, first, not neglect its duty, and second, not overstep its
authority; It must, in the course of its work, strictly abide by
the principle of democratic centralism, exercise its power and
make decisions as a collective, seek unity of thought in the
process of developing a democratic style of work to the full, and
implement a high degree of centralism based on a high degree of
democracy; It must also continuously consolidate the building of
its organization and system to make its performance more
systematic and standardized step by step.

Comrade Peng Zhen was in charge of the work of China's
political science and laws. He implemented the CPC Central
Committee's principles and policies in this regard in a creative
way and made significant contributions to establishing and
improving of the institutions, regulations and ranks of the legal
system, maintaining national security and social stability, and
guaranteeing a smooth progress of socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
After the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, he
devoted all his wisdom and energy to eliminating the grave evil
results caused by the "Great Cultural Revolution" which had
"smashed the systems of public security, procuratorate and court,"
and to rehabilitating, improving and strengthening the legal work
and contingent.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he was appointed director of the Trial Guidance
Committee of the "two counter-revolutionary cases" of the Lin Biao
and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques and guided the trials
of the two cases. He secured the great success of the trials of
the two cases by determining a basic principle of "strict division
between the wrongdoings by a number of Party members and people
and the counter-revolutionary crimes," insisting on using facts as
the basis and laws as the criterion and acting strictly in
accordance with the law.

He summed up the historical experience of the work of political
science and law and made an overall exposition on the tasks,
principles, policies and contingent building of the work in the
new era. He pointed out: The fundamental tasks for the work in the
new era are: serve the socialist modernization drive under the
guidance of the four cardinal principles; crack down on the crimes
that severely jeopardize public order, and crimes that sabotage
the economy, firmly fight against criminal activities that
endanger the efforts to promote socialist cultural and ethical
progress, and ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up and
the four modernizations drive; deal with the criminals who
seriously damage public order severely and promptly in accordance
with the law; educate, help and rehabilitate juvenile delinquents
in a compassionate, patient and meticulous way like parents
treating their children who contract epidemic diseases. He pointed
out: the work of the political science and law must be fully
dependent on the leadership of the Party, closely rely on the
masses of the people, combine the specialized organs with the mass
line, and oppose and overcome mysticism; great efforts must be
made to improve the political and professional proficiency of the
people working in political science and law.

<P>
He said that Comrade Deng Xiaoping had stated that adherence to
"one central task and two basic points" (taking economic
development as the central task and upholding reform and opening
up policy and the four cardinal principles) is the basic line of

<HEADLINE> France Counts on Britain's Labor for Cooperation over Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- France today hoped Britain's Labor
Party of Tony Blair, which has won a historic victory over the
Conservative Party in the general election, to offer more
cooperation over European construction.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of European Affairs Michel Barnier said that
the victory of the Labor Party will allow France to "win an ally
for constructing the social dimension of Europe."
</P>
<P>
"This is an election which is naturally important for the
British themselves, who have turned the page of 18 years of
Conservative management, as well as an important election for all
European countries," said Barnier.
</P>
<P>
France will hold its general election on May 25 and June 1, in
which the Maastricht Treaty of the European Union on the launching
of the monetary union will become one important element for
voting. Now the debates about it are underway between the ruling
center-right majority and the left-wing oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Barnier said that the new government will give Britain more
force in a series of important events over European construction
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that Tony Blair sees European construction in
a more positive way (than John Major) for the interests of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, First Secretary of the French Socialist Party Lionel
Jospin congratulated the Labour Party for what he called "a
magnificent victory" in the general election.
</P>
<P>
French Communist Party national secretary Robert Hue said that
the victory of the Labor Party is a "satisfying result for all
those who fight against ultra-liberalism."
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain has experienced a "horrible social purge"
under the Conservative Party from 1979.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed doubt over whether Blair will bring about
"big changes in all the fields of economic and social policy,"
adding "to put an end to Thatcherism is an important thing."

-- The International Labour Day became a real festival for the
British Labour Party, whose leader Tony Blair will be Britain's

</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair will have little time to wait to decide on one of
the most explosive questions in Britain -- whether to join the
European single currency, Euro. With only six weeks away from the

reform of European institutions, Blair is expected to take a
prudent position on the Euro because of the strong opposition by
the British to the monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the victory by the Labour Party of Tony Blair, the
revolution brought to Britain 18 years ago by the Conservative
Party under Margaret Thatcher is irreversible. In 18 years,
Britain has experienced the changes of a century by abandoning its
state welfare and adapting itself to the rules of free market.
</P>
<P>
-- The British Labour Party will announce its government today
in which Tony Blair will have four heavy-weight ministers: Robin
Cook as foreign secretary, Gordon Brown as chancellor of
exchequer, David Blunkett as education secretary, and John

Comrade Peng Zhen performed immortal feats for the victory of
the Chinese revolution and the founding of the People's Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, Comrade Peng Zhen held
leading posts in the Party and the state for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
In early years after the founding of the People's Republic, he
served as a member of the Central People's Government, deputy
director and secretary of Leading Party Members' Group of the
Politics and Law Committee under the Government Administration
Council, and later head of the Politics and Law Group of the Party
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1954, he served as vice-chairman of the Standing
Committees of the First, Second and Third National People's
Congresses, as well as vice-chairman of the Second, Third and
Fourth CPPCC National Committees.
</P>
<P>
At the Eighth CPC National Congress and the First Plenum of the
Eighth CPC Central Committee held in 1956, he was elected a member
of the Central Committee, Political Bureau and Secretariat of the
Central Committee, assisting Comrade Deng Xiaoping to run the
Secretariat of the Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, he served concurrently as
secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, and also served
as mayor of Beijing from 1951 to May 1966.
</P>
<P>
During the 17 years after the founding of New China, as a
member of the collective leadership of the Party and the state
headed by Mao Zedong, he made painstaking efforts for and made
outstanding contributions to the building of the Party and the
political power, economic construction, political and
legal work, united front work, work concerning ethnic minorities,
ideological and theoretical work, and work in science,
education, culture and foreign affairs, as well as the
construction and development of the national capital.

During the process of liberating Beijing Comrade Peng Zhen did
a good job of combining the consistency of principles with the
flexibility of tactics. Relying on the working class and the
laboring masses and uniting with all the non-Communist parties and
personages without party affiliation, as well as with
intellectuals and all other forces that could be united with, in a
short period of time he cleaned up the filth and mire left over
from the old society and established a new social order in
Beijing, achieving a great social and historical change that shook
the world.
</P>
<P>
Before Liberation Beijing was a consumer-oriented city mired in
destitution and devastation. Shortly after the liberation of
Beijing, Peng Zhen emphasized that restoration, transformation and
development of production should be taken as the central task for
Party organizations, government bodies and military units and the
citizens in Beijing; all the other work should be arranged around
and subordinated to this central task.
</P>
<P>
He explicitly pointed out that the construction of the capital
should serve the cause of the people and production, as well as
the Party Central Committee and departments of Central People's
government. By 1951 Beijing's economy had fully recovered and
topped the previous records.
</P>
<P>
With the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means
of production, Beijing achieved rapid progress in economic
construction, and changed from a consumer-oriented city into a
production-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he entered the city, Peng Zhen started working on
urban planning for the capital, and in 1956 put forth the guiding
principle that "urban planning should be conducted from a
long-term perspective, with the prospects for socialism taken into
consideration and room left for development by future
generations." In 1958 Peng Zhen led the construction of ten major
buildings and the planning for the construction of the Tiananmen
Square.

<P>
In the course of socialist construction, Peng Zhen not only
cherished people's enthusiasm for building socialism, but also
stressed "we must and can only do our work by practically and
earnestly following the objective law."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that investigation and study were essential for
avoidance of ideological mistakes in terms of line in socialist
construction. Ernestly practicing what he advocated, Peng Zhen
went down to the countryside and factories to listen to the
opinions of the masses, and made investigations and study.
</P>
<P>
Planning meticulously and making painstaking efforts during the
17 years, Peng Zhen made great contributions to building the
capital into a modern socialist city.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Peng Zhen had always paid respect to knowledge and
talents, and attached utmost importance to the development of
scientific, educational and cultural undertakings. He emphasized
that Beijing was the national cultural center with a cluster of
higher education institutions, and it was of great significance to
run such institutions well.
</P>
<P>
He led the formulation of a decision on improving the educating
quality of middle and primary schools in Beijing. Showing great
concern over the healthy growth of the young, he made speeches to
college graduates in the capital for many consecutive years. In
the speeches, he encouraged the graduates to conscientiously take
the inevitable historical road, integrate themselves with workers
and peasants and steadfastly follow the Communist Party,
whole-heartedly serve the people and socialism.
</P>
<P>
Peng Zhen put forward the idea of "developing literature and
art for the broad masses of people in cities", urging writers and
artists to go down to the factories as they had gone down to the
countryside to reflect the new age after a victory nationwide had
been achieved.

<P>
During the "Great Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976), Comrade
Peng Zhen was wrongly criticized and cruelly persecuted by Lin
Biao and Jiang Qing and their like, and was stripped of all his
posts inside and outside the Party and lost his personal
freedom. Even under these circumstances he still persisted in
studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, summed up
historical experience, was concerned about and thought deeply
about the future and destiny of the Party and State, and fought
resolutely against Lin Biao and Jiang Qing and their like. After
the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the CPC
Central Committee announced that "all the charges, slanders and
libels imposed on Comrade Peng Zhen during the 'Great Cultural
Revolution' should be repudiated."
</P>
<P>
Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out at the first meeting of the
Central Committee he attended after his rehabilitation: "We must
adhere to holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought, otherwise there will be chaos in the ideology of
the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic
groups, as well as on the entire revolutionary front, which will
 sadden our own people and gladden the enemy. Great attention must
be paid to the ideological trend of liberalization. But our
determination to expand democracy within the Party and people's
democracy must never waver, nor should we waver in our resolve to
adhere to the correct ideological line of seeking truth from
facts, emancipating our minds and using social practice as the
criterion of testing truth.
</P>
<P>
In September 1979, Comrade Peng Zhen was elected at the Fourth
Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee as a member of the CPC
Central Committee and a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee. Later he was re-elected a member of the 12th
CPC Central Committee and a member of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee. In 1980 he was appointed secretary of the
Politics and Law Committee of the CPC Central Committee. At the
Second Session of the Fifth National People's Congress (NPC) in
June 1979, Peng Zhen was elected vice-chairman of the NPC Standing
Committee and concurrently chairman of the NPC's Law Committee.

<P>
He also raised the idea of "weeding through the old to bring
forth the new", which meant the remodeling of traditional drama forms
and their improvement in the course of remodeling.
</P>
<P>
He often went deeply into education, science and technology,
literary and art circles to make many friends and solicit
opinions. He respected and united with older intellectuals, and
cared for and cultivated younger ones, attaching great importance
to giving full scope to their role in socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, when the cultural field was already seriously affected
by the ``Left''tendency, Peng Zhen pointed out clearly that
political issues must be differentiated from academic and art
issues; the truth must be tested by social practice; everyone, no
matter what one's station in life is, must uphold the truth and be
ready to correct mistakes -- and all are equal before the truth.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Peng Zhen gave prominence to the building of the ruling
party, regarding it as crucial to the success of all socialist
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
In 1950 he raised before the whole Party the issue of
preventing corruption in the Party under the new circumstances,
noting that to ensure that the Party should never become corrupt
depended on: first, political, organizational and ideological
purity; second, close contact with the masses and supervision by
the masses; third, criticism and self-criticism; and fourth, the
system, laws and discipline.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that an important principle in ensuring that no
disaster would happen to the Party was reliance on a collective
leadership and adherence to democratic centralism. He required
Party organizations and members in Beijing to "stand in the
forefront of revolution and construction", and to "set the highest
standards for our work that can possibly be met."
</P>
<P>
He said that shortcomings and mistakes in work must be
acknowledged, and what was right and what was wrong should be
admitted honestly. This was the nature of the Communist Party. One
should tell no lies, conceal no shortcomings or mistakes, still
less gloss over one's faults, conceal one's faults for fear of
criticism, or hold back unpleasant information.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out emphatically that bureaucracy did enormous harm
to people and would lead to the destruction of the country. He
also warned that all Party members and cadres, especially leading
cadres, should resolutely get rid of the bureaucratic style of
work characterized by being divorced from the masses.

At the First Session of the Sixth NPC in June, 1983, Peng Zhen
was elected chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. In the new
historical era, as an important member of the collective
leadership of the Party and State with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at
the core, he participated in a series of policy-making decisions
of the Party and State, thereby making great contributions to
bringing order out of chaos, and to establishing and implementing
the Party's basic line of taking economic construction as the
center and adhering to the four cardinal principles and reform and
opening-up, to building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
and to the reunification of the motherland and the unity of all
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized time and again: "The focus of the work of the
State should be resolutely shifted to socialist economic
construction and modernization drive, and all work must center
around and serve this focal point"; "The four cardinal principles
reflect the historical development laws independent of man's will
and are a decisive choice made by hundreds of millions of Chinese
people in their long-term struggle"; "To adhere to the four
cardinal principles under the new historical circumstances, it is
imperative to combine the universal truth of Marxism with the
concrete practice of China's socialist construction, and to blaze
a path of socialist construction with Chinese characteristics";
"The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is
critical and revolutionary, and socialism in essence requires
constant reform, development and improvement"; Reform and opening
up "is a reflection of objective laws and a conclusion drawn from
the summarization of the practical experience of our country in
the past 30-odd years. It will not change"; "Without developing a
commodity economy, the Chinese economy can not be
rejuvenated. This should be perceived from a strategic perspective
and be adhered to firmly".
</P>
<P>
In his later years, in spite of his advanced age, Peng Zhen
often went down to the grass-roots for investigation and study. He
was greatly concerned about the development of the special
economic zones and he inspected them repeatedly. On an inspection
tour of Shenzhen and Zhuhai in 1987 he pointed out that "The
special economic zones are successful and the direction is
right. Special economic zones should be allowed to pilot
experiments and reform bravely. The special economic zones must
vigorously develop the social productive forces and an
export-oriented economy, adhere to the four cardinal principles,
continue reform, open up wider and further revitalize themselves."

Comrade Peng Zhen was for a long time in charge of and led the
work of building socialist democracy and legal system. In 1954 he
participated in drawing up New China's first Constitution, and
made a profound exposition at the First Session of the First
National People's Congress on the basic legal principle that
everybody is equal before the law as defined in the Constitution.
He presided over the work of drafting some other laws, including
the Criminal Law. When he was persecuted during the "Great
Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976), Peng made an in-depth study of
the building of China's democracy and legal system. He worked
untiringly day and night after the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC
Central Committee, and took charge of formulating seven important
laws in three months, including China's first Criminal Law and the
Law of Criminal Procedure. In 1980 he personally directed the
revision of the Constitution, as vice-chairman of the Committee
for Revision of the Constitution. Since 1979, a series of basic
statutes were drafted under his guidance, involving the state
institutions, civil and criminal laws, lawsuit procedures, and
economic and laws involving overseas, which have laid solid
foundations for China's socialist legal system. He put forward
many important ideas for the building of China's socialist legal
system, pointing out that the Chinese people handled affairs by
relying mainly on policies during the revolutionary war, while
they not only relied on policies but also on laws in doing their
daily work after the people took over the country's political
power. This was a historic shift; A sound building of a socialist
legal system must be centered on economic construction, and
efforts must be made to adhere to the four cardinal principles and
reform and opening-up, and serve the building of socialism with
Chinese characteristics. The work of legislation must be done
under the guidance of Marxism, and by taking China's conditions
into account, summing up China's own practical experience, and
meanwhile learning from what benefits the Chinese people from the
ancient and modern, China and elsewhere, he added; state
institutions at all levels must handle affairs strictly according
to laws, let the masses of people know the laws through publicity
and education, as this is the reliable guarantee for law
observation and enforcement. "In China," he said, "the Party leads
the people in laying down the Constitution and laws, and it also
leads the people in observing and implementing them. Therefore the
Party must define its activities within the limits permitted by
the Constitution and laws."
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the Party's leadership, strictly abiding by laws in
handling affairs, and obeying to people's will are unified, he
added.

<HEADLINE> DPRK: Japanese Shrine Visit Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The undisguised visit of Japanese
politicians to the "Yasukuni Shrine" shows the extent of danger
Japan's militarization has reached, the Rodong Sinmun newspaper of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) noted today in a
commentary.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper is referring to the April 22 visit by 223
Japanese dietmen including two ministers to the shrine, where
top-level Japanese war criminals are honored.
</P>
<P>
Having made full military preparations for overseas aggression,
the Japanese politicians are now working hard to lay ideological
and moral foundations for it, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
They regard the visit to the shrine as an important lever in
their efforts to revive militarism, which becomes all the more
dangerous with the government encouragement, the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the paper said, the leaders of the Japanese
conservative parties are scheming to let foreigners visit the
shrine as a matter of duty during their tour of Japan, imbuing the
world people with Japanese militarist "outlook" and "philosophy,"
said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese politicians' visit to the shrine and efforts to
build Japan into a military power have invited the vigilance of
the neighboring countries that demand them to ponder over the
consequences, warned the commentary.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Undertake Export Promotion Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Association of
Manufacturers (KAM) is scheduled to implement an Export Promotion
Program for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Local paper the Daily Nation today quoted KAM Chief Executive
Z. Kahura as saying that the program would focus on
non-traditional, especially agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
KAM has been organizing workshops in Nairobi and Eldoret to
sensitize the public on the benefits of the program and one more
workshop was scheduled to be held in the southern port city of
Mombasa next month.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at helping agricultural sector increase
food production by fostering linkages between the sector and the
agro-processing, food processing and related sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
The program will also assist related sectors in improving
quality, design and presentation of their products for specific
markets, said the KAM official.
</P>
<P>
The strategies for reducing costs to enhance competitiveness
will also be addressed by the program which will be implemented
on a 50 percent cost sharing basis between the companies being
assisted and the program, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The program will be restricted to private companies and KAM
will be in charge of the implementation through the cooperation
with the members.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Gloomy Prospect for Egyptian Textiles Industry (I) (by Hou Jia) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The prospect for the 7,000-year-old
Egyptian textile industry is gloomy as it has been cramped by
hikes of cotton price and lack of renovation.
</P>
<P>
Some even fear that the long-time industry is approaching the
verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The volume of textile exports, which represent about a quarter
of overall Egyptian exports, slumped by 21 percent to 2.5 billion
pounds (740 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 from 3 billion pounds
(880 million dollars) in 1995, according to a report by the
Committee of Industrial Production and Energy.
</P>
<P>
The limping industry is now fighting a losing war with its
fierce rivals in South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Turkey and
Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt failed to compete with the top 10 textiles exporters
whose collective exports reached 95 billion dollars in 1994, or
73.8 percent of the world's total textile exports.
</P>
<P>
Nor is it made to the list of the biggest 10 clothes exporters,
which distributed 81.7 billion dollars worth of garments to the
world markets.
</P>
<P>
The industry, first initiated by the ancient Egyptians,
blossomed in 1927 after it was declared a nationally strategic
industry in Egypt. Its heyday came in 1949 when Egypt exported
textiles for the first time.
</P>
<P>
In fact, economists say it could have done a lot better given
the availability of high-quality cotton, the low-cost and skilled
labor if not for the rising prices of local cotton.
</P>
<P>
However, the cotton prices which soared 75 percent in the
past couple of years, have sent the cost higher and cramped the
operations of the public and private spinning factories alike.
</P>
<P>
Now, thousands of workers nationwide are waiting to pack up
after their textiles factories incurred appalling losses and banks
slammed the door in their face, refusing to float those sinking
ships.
</P>
<P>
According to Al Mousawar magazine, 31 public sector companies
have accumulated 1.2 billion dollars of losses, of which 400
million was reported last year alone.
</P>
<P>
The overdraft loans from bank also topped 4 billion while the
factories have to pay 250 million dollars in interest annually to
creditors.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the industry's woes, Moetz Billah Abdel Maqsoud,
Chairman of the Chamber of the Textiles, said that the industry
has been given a dazzling blow over the past three years when the
cotton price went wild.

<P>
"Consequently, the production cost helplessly increased," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The same argument was upheld by Magdi al-Aref, director-general
of the Textile Industry Support Fund.
</P>
<P>
"The appalling rise in textiles production cost frightened
customers and persuaded them to seek cheaper products from India
and Pakistan late in the past two years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of textiles industry in Egypt worsened when
textiles factories were forced to pay a minimum 10-12 percent
interest rate for the loans from banks to redress their course.
</P>
<P>
In one of the most endangered textiles factories, Qafr al-Dawar
Company for Weaving and Textiles that is also one of the largest
in the country, financial imbalance reached 26.5 million dollars
and overdrafts amounted to 140.3 million dollars, according to the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
The magazine also said the company's losses amounted to 102.9
million dollars, of which 85.3 million dollars were incurred under
its former board, which was later referred by the Public
Prosecution for investigation.
</P>
<P>
To avoid its imminent collapse, proposals include immediate
government intervention, bigger financial help, and partial sale
or rent of the factory and its facilities.
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Egypt's textiles industry used to find loyal
clients in the eastern European countries, which would import
Egyptian textile products for good prices, irrespective of
quality. Now, the situation is entirely different.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, only six Egyptian companies realized the threat
and made swift plans to modernize their equipment and machines,
while others were swiftly thrown out of the foreign market because
of the poor quality they offered, said Samir Ragab, Chairman of
Sinai Company.
</P>
<P>
The hard-hit companies were caught off guard as their managers
failed to raise investment funds to finance purchasing modern
machines, said Ragab.
</P>
<P>
The ordeal worsened when textiles stocks in their storehouses
were piling high while the workers' wages soared to more than 20
percent of the production cost.
</P>
<P>
The mess deterred banks from providing loans, and thus these
companies failed to raise fund to purchase cotton and make its
machines run again.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the vicious circle is broken, the industry can not
survive," Ragab lamented.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, which is among Egypt's largest foreign
currency earners and a huge job-provider, is vital for the
country's industrial and economic structure, said the report of
the Committee of Industrial Production and Energy.

HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The prices of petrol, diesel and

the Zimbabwe Dollar and the political tension in the Middle East,
had necessitated the hike.

NEW DELHI, May 2 (Xinhua) -- India has expressed regret at the
U.S. decision to continue to place it on a "priority watch list"
under the U.S. "Special 301" trade law provisions, the local press

The spokesman said the World Trade Organization, of which both
India and the United States are members, provides an appropriate

(0.77 dollars) jump, as exporters are already struggling to boost
Thai products' competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready to Face Japan at WTO Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will probably face Japan's
second complaint to the panel of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) after the country rejected the suit, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Japan was reported to have officially forwarded a car dispute
to the WTO Dispute Settlement Board, complaining that Indonesia's
national car policy gives import and luxury tax exemptions to a
domestic car maker.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard that we have rejected Japan's proposal," Director
General for Foreign Economic Relations Sumadi Brotodiningrat said
here Thursday, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
It will take three weeks to one month for Japan to submit a
second claim to the WTO and Indonesia could not reject the second
claim, he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the grace period, we will prepare everything for such a
possibility," he said, adding that Indonesia will use
internationally reputable lawyers if the country has to face Japan
at the WTO panel.
</P>
<P>
Japan on Wednesday officially asked the WTO to form a panel to
arbitrate in a dispute over Indonesia's controversial national car
policy, trade sources said here.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States and the European Union have held a
series of bilateral talks with Indonesia after lodging a complaint
with the WTO in October last year in an attempt to get Jakarta to
remove measures which the three claim are discriminatory and
against multilateral trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government announced its national car policy in
February last year, under which domestic carmakers can enjoy tax
exemption on condition they raise the local content ratios in
their cars up to 60 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
The tax breaks were granted solely to Pt. Timor Putra Nasional,
a company controlled by President Soeharto's youngest son.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is considering using a
Myanmar port on the Andaman Sea as an alternative route for Thai
goods being shipped to markets in Europe, according to Thai Deputy
Prime Minister and Industry Minister Korn Dabbaransi.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Industry Ministry is looking at two Myanmar ports --
Tavoy and Bokpyin -- and the Island of Kawtaung as part of a study
due for completion by the end of this year, Korn was quoted today
by local newspaper the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's choice will depend on economic viability and related
infrastructure requirements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar authorities have responded positively to the idea and
expressed "readiness" to develop the port which Thailand chose, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Korn will have further talks with his Myanmar counterpart later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 75 percent of Thailand's Europe-bound goods through
the Malacca Strait, shipping the goods through the Andaman Sea
would save time and cost.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Parliament Urged to Ratify Election Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino
warned today that his government will have to resign if the
parliament fails to pass the election law.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting European Union (EU) special envoy
Franz Vranitzky, former Austrian prime minister, Fino said that if
the Democrats-dominated parliament does not ratify the bill, his
government will soon face a crisis and Albania will fall back into
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Fino has warned that his all-party
interim government may resign.
</P>
<P>
He asked Vranitzky to help mediate between the Democrats and
the nine parties for a peaceful Albania.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between Socialists led by Prime Minister Fino and
Democrats led by President Sali Berisha are increasingly tense
when the general election date of June 29 is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also urged the 6,000-strong Italian-led
multinational force to guard arms depots and other military
facilities. A Tuesday blast at an arms depot killed 27 people.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 people have been killed since the nation was
engulfed by riots in January over the collapse of fraudulent
investment funds. Most of the arms depots were looted by armed
protesters.

<HEADLINE> Kasparov Gears up for Rematch Against IBM Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian chess genius Garry Kasparov
will take the challenge from a smarter IBM computer for a rematch
scheduled to kick off in Manhattan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The world chess champion, 34, said that "a computer will always
be beatable" because he can figure out its modus operandi and its
weaknesses after about 10 games against any computer.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kasparov won the first faceoff by 4-2 against the
Deep Blue machine which was first developed by five computer
scientists and an American chess grandmaster in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the IBM team revamped the chip-stuffed IBM chess
whiz with a computer brain transplant that allows it to think
twice as fast as its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
Deep Blue scans 200 million moves per second, and examines 50
billion chess positions in the average three minutes allowed per
move by match rules.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov who will initiate the first game, may pocket in
700,000 US dollars should he eventually win the nine-day rematch
from the 64 black and white squares.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeks Trade Liberalization Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants trade ministers of
the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to develop
rules in selecting which industrial sectors should be liberalized
first, according to a senior trade official.
</P>
<P>
Vitoon Tulyanonda, deputy director general of the Business
Economics Department of the Thai government was quoted by the
local press as saying the ministers must identify which sectors
should be liberalized before the 2010 deadline for developed
members and 2020 deadline for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from APEC members are to meet in Montreal,
Canada, next week.
</P>
<P>
Thailand believed that clear criteria should be established to
create understanding among the members of the concepts and
approaches of early sectorial liberalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sectors should not duplicate those which have already been
determined by the World Trade Organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
APEC members should not only choose sectors that would yield
results but should also select those which would create a positive
impact on technology and economic cooperation, such as technology
transfer and human resource development.
</P>
<P>
Vitoon noted that some countries, like Australia, have proposed
early liberalization of the energy sector while others have sought
to open sectors such as textiles and agriculture.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Panama and the United States
will start formal negotiations on June 1 to establish a
multinational anti-drug center at the Howard U.S. Air Force Base
in the Panama Canal, a Panamanian official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Eduardo Ritter, president of the Transition Commission on
the Panama Canal, told the press that preparations for the formal
negotiations will be finished in the last days of May.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, who is representing Panama in the contacts with
U.S. ambassador John Negroponte on the matter, said the two
countries will appoint their negotiating teams in the next few

The two countries have reached agreement in principle on most

The main dispute is the number of U.S. troops to be deployed in
the anti-drug center. Panama prefers a reduction, while the United

<P>
The U.S. also wants to retain its communications facilities on
the Galeta Island and two buildings in Corozal, Panama City, from

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (57-58) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (57-58) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What are the characteristics of Hong Kong as a free
port?
</P>
<P>
Answer: A free port refers to an economic area that is
completely open to the outside and free for entry and exit,
including the freedom to establish enterprises, free trade, free
shipping, free exchange of currencies and the free flow of capital
and personnel.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been a free port for more than 150 years. In
comparison with other free ports around the world, Hong Kong has
the following characteristics:
</P>
<P>
1. Fairly big in area. Hong Kong is a free port city covering
the Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the "New Territories." Other
free ports are confined to a small section of a particular city or
area such as the Hamburg free port and the Rotterdam free port.
</P>
<P>
2. A high degree of opening. Hong Kong allows a free flow of
all kinds of capital, which can be invested in all industries and
business lines.
</P>
<P>
3. All-encompassing in functions. Hong Kong has a comprehensive
economic structure in which trade, financial, shipping, real
estate, manufacturing, retail, tourist, and information industries
are all highly developed. Other free ports tend to focus on one
particular industry such as processing, transfer trade, offshore
banking or tourism.
</P>
<P>
4. Big economic strength. Despite having only a population of 6
million living in an area of 1,000 square km, Hong Kong is a
well-established center of international economic activities.
</P>
<P>
With the enactment of the Basic Law, factors contributing to
the economic success of Hong Kong as a free port has been
enshrined in law. This will ensure that Hong Kong continue to
enjoy its unique superiorities.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will the status of Hong Kong as an international
shipping center change after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Absolutely not. The reason are as follows:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, Hong Kong's status as an international shipping center
has resulted from a combination of factors, including advantageous
geographical location, a good sea port, a vast economic hinterland
(that is, the mainland), and extensive international economic
relations. These factors will not change after the transfer of
government there in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, according to the Basic Law, Hong Kong will maintain
its status as a free port and retain its free trade system after
1997. The Hong Kong SAR will participate in relevant international
organizations and international trade agreements such as the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade
Organization) as a separate customs territory. Its trade with the
rest of the world will further develop, and this in turn will
promote the development of its shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Hong Kong SAR will maintain its previous systems
of shipping management and shipping regulation. With authorization
from the central government, the Hong Kong SAR may handle ship
registering, allow foreign ships to enter and leave its port in
accordance with law except foreign warships, and permit private
shipping and the free operation of shipping-related businesses and
private container terminals.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Xu Yinsheng was
reelected as president of the International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF) in the ITTF Biennial General Meeting here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Xu, Chinese former world champion who took the ITTF top seat
after former president Lollo Hammarlund died of lung cancer in
1995, was the only one nominated for this position.
</P>
<P>
Adam Sharara, general secretary of the Canadian table tennis
association, was elected as the ITTF deputy president.
</P>
<P>
The meeting vetoed a resolution that world championships be
seperated into team and individual events.
</P>
<P>
The ITTF Athletes Commission had proposed that the world
championships be held annually with team events in even years and
individual events in odd years.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also rejected a proposal to change the service
rule, giving an OK to these players who partly hide the ball while
serving.
</P>
<P>
This proposal suggested that in service the ball be struck
between the front of the service body and his end line. At
present, the ball can be partly hidden by the body of the server.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Mar May Day Celebrations in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 1 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes involving neo-Nazis
marred the International Labor Day celebrations today in Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the western German state of Lower Saxony, about 300
neo-Nazis clashed with about 50 left-wing extremists in the town
of Hannoversch Muenden. Some 40 neo-Nazis were detained and one
police officer was injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 4,500 policemen were deployed in the eastern
state of Saxony to prevent neo-Nazis from reaching the city of
Leipzig and disrupting the traditional May Day trade union rally
which was attended by an estimated 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had taken some 150 rightists, mostly young
males, into temporary custody in and around Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
At one point in Leipzig, about 150 left-wingers hurled rocks
and fireworks at police, who were trying to keep them apart from a
small group of skinheads.
</P>
<P>
Police also prevented right extremists from holding marches in
the nearby town of Halle, and in Aschaffenburg and Alsfeld in the
state of Hesse.
</P>
<P>
In Dortmund, police took 46 supporters of the rightist National
Democratic Party of Germany into temporary custody and seized from
them a number of unconstitutional propaganda materials.
</P>
<P>
In the German capital of Berlin, violence broke out at two May
Day demonstrations. Bottles, stones and fireworks were hurled at
police from a crowd of 6,500 left-wingers in central Berlin.
Police responded with water cannon and detained about 70
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB) Dieter
Schulte warned at a mass rally in Hamburg that a social explosion
could only be avoided by a sharp reduction in mass unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Leipzig, leader of Germany's largest trade union
IG Metall, Klaus Zwickel, accused the Bonn government of doing
nothing against the record unemployment in Germany which currently
stands at about 4.5 million.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Falls on Softer Economic Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell here today
after touching a new 4-year high against the yen.
</P>
<P>
Based on the new economic data, foreign exchange traders
reasoned that the likelihood the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates at its May 20 meeting has decreased. The prospect
of rising rates has been a major force helping to push the dollar
higher.
</P>
<P>
The dollar hit an intraday high of 127.47 yen, the strongest
since August 1992, before retreating to settle in New York at
126.51 yen, down from 127.06 yen Wednesday. The dollar cost 1.7217
marks, down from 1.7303.
</P>
<P>
There was little movement in the pound ahead of the conclusion
of the British elections. Sterling strengthened slightly to 1.6242
U.S. dollars from 1.6237 U.S. dollars Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday:
5.8050 French francs, down from 5.8300; 1.4695 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4728; 1,703.00 Italian lire, down from 1,710.00; 1.3872
Canadian dollars, down from 1.3963.

NEW YORK, May 1 (Xinhua) -- The technology sector of the New
York Stock Exchange advanced for the fourth straight session, but
blue-chip shares suffered some profit-taking today.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 32.51 points to 6,976.48.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-8 margin,
with the volume totaling 459.34 million shares, down from 556.07
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures were mixed, with money moving from the
blue-chip sector to technology issues and other areas that haven't
recovered as fully from the market recent slide.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 2.81 to 798.53, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 1.23 to 415.71.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.74 to 1,270.50, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.59 to 558.50.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Friday's report on the April wage levels, investors
moved to secure some gains from a three-day rally that added 270
points to the Dow and boosted it above 7,000 for the first time
since mid-March, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Investors are concerned that without some sign of moderation,
the central bank will raise rates repeatedly, potentially choking
company profits.

<HEADLINE> UK Shares End Election Day at Record Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 1 (Xinhua) -- British shares on the London stock
market ended the session at a new closing high although trading
volumes were thin on a nervous election day while markets in both
Frankfurt and Paris closed for the May Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index finished 9.0 points higher at a new record
close of 4,445.0 points, although only 0.7 points above the
previous closing record of 4,444.3 reached on March 11.
</P>
<P>
However, trading volumes were moderate as many institutional
investors stayed away ahead of the UK general election result, due
out early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
A marginally stronger-than-expected UK purchasing managers'
report earlier today had little impact on trade, dealers said.
