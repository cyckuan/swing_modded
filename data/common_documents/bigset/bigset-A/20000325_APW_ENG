   The New York Yankees looked in midseason form. So did the
Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series champions hit nine homers Friday, including two
each by Ricky Ledee, Jorge Posada and Clay Bellinger, as the
Marlins received their second straight pounding, falling 19-0 to
the Yankees in Melbourne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, Mike Coolbaugh and Rafael Bournigal also homered
for the Yankees, who have struggled offensively much of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, who were outhit 18-4, have been outscored 35-0 in
their past two games as they deal with an outbreak of mumps that
has infected six players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to erupt in front of you people (the media), I'm
not going to embarrass myself or you guys, but maybe later it'll be
a different story,'' said Florida manager John Boles, whose team
had the worst record in the NL last season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kerry Wood worked to get back into midseason form,
throwing two innings in a minor league game for the Chicago Cubs in
Mesa, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In his second outing of the spring since undergoing
reconstructive elbow surgery last April, Wood allowed three runs
and five hits to a Triple-A team of the Milwaukee Brewers. But the
good news was he hit 94-96 mph on the radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like my velocity was where it was last Saturday,'' Wood
said. ''I would have liked to have thrown more strikes with the
fastball and have more command. Unfortunately I didn't, but I think
we got some good accomplished out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a rough one today, but the arm feels good and we got
some work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year, threw 15 pitches in each
inning before the sides changed. He threw 25 fastballs and five
changeups.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this stage of the rehab, the number of runs he gives up,
the number of hits he gives up is irrelevant to his velocity, his
mechanics and how he feels physically,'' GM Ed Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kissimmee, Fla., Greg Maddux allowed his first run of the
spring, pitching six strong innings in the Atlanta Braves' 8-2 win
over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The four-time Cy Young winner allowed five hits and one run.
Maddux has given up eight hits, one run, walked two and struck out
14 in 15 innings as he prepares for the regular season opener on
April 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really worried about the numbers,'' he said. ''Whether
my ERA is one or 10, it's not important. What's important is
feeling like you can throw all your pitches at any count with
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
Reds 5, Blue Jays 4
</P>
<P>
   At Sarasota, Fla., Ken Griffey Jr. drove in two runs with a
double and a single, and Kimera Bartee hit a game-winning single in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 6, Astros 5
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Todd Hollandsworth, competing with Devon
White for the starting job in center field, went 3-for-4 with a
grand slam.
</P>
<P>
Twins 2, Expos 1
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Brad Radke tuned up for opening day by
allowing one run in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Devil Rays 7, Royals 3
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Steve Trachsel allowed two runs in four
innings and Herbert Perry went 3-for-4 with three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Red Sox 7, Rangers 1
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Brian Rose allowed one run in 4 1-3 innings
and Jose Offerman drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals 4, Orioles 1
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., St. Louis starter Andy Benes left after 3 1-3
innings with stiffness in his right shoulder. ''It's stiff not
sore. It's sort of a dead-arm thing that happens in the spring,''
Benes said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ex Worker Charged in Car Wash Slay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- A fired car-wash employee accused of
gunning down six co-workers was charged Friday with five counts of
capital murder and one count of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayne Harris, 28, was being held on $6 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was fired from the Mi-T-Fine Car Wash on March 17 after
he was arrested for allegedly exposing himself to two women there.
Authorities said he returned to the car wash three days later and
opened fire on his former co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was arrested Tuesday at a home in Dallas, about seven
mile southeast of Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Harris could face another murder charge in the death of Sandra
Gaye Scott, police spokesman Lt. David Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Irving woman disappeared in November, and her
body was found Tuesday with a gunshot wound to the neck in an
Irving ditch. Harris, whose telephone number was on Scott's pager,
had been a suspect in her disappearance for months, but police
haven't found enough evidence to file charges, Tull said.

<HEADLINE> Adirondacks see more applications for communication towers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Environmentalists fear the proliferation of
communications towers will transform some views of the Adirondacks
from a picturesque scene into a still from ''The Jetsons''
futuristic cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Applications to erect five more of the communication towers and
to upgrade others in the state-protected forest have surfaced since
the beginning of the year and that's a serious concern, according
to the Adirondack Council, an environmental advocacy group. One in
the early stages of planning would place the first tower on the
summit of a scenic mountain where no road reaches -- yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many instances these are transmitting to the trees,'' said
Adirondack Council spokesman John Sheehan. ''There are no people
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   More of the 100-to-200-foot towers in the mountain park are
aimed at blanketing coverage for cell phones and other
communications, rather than the 75 percent minimum set by federal
law, Sheehan said. The number of requests for towers is only likely
to increase, he said, with the growing demand for high-definition
television and other technology.
</P>
<P>
   But worse of all, Sheehan fears the Adirondack Park Agency that
regulates development in the park doesn't have a clear idea of how
many towers are already added to the landscape. That's because he
said the environmental group has been unable to obtain a map of
these towers from the state agency for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a map exists, although it is two years old, said John
Banta, director of planning for the Adirondack Park Agency. Banta
said the agency keeps track of towers and tries to make sure any
new communications equipment is added to an existing tower or
erected to a tower near other towers. He said he isn't sure how
many new proposals have been submitted recently, but said cellular
technology has created an increase in applications in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel who handle the issue for the agency weren't available
Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't know of any tower proposals that have been
rejected. The agency, however, tries to limit the effect of these
towers on the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest recent proposal -- for three towers -- isn't for
cellular phone companies, but to provide emergency communications
to a county's hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are not a lot of people there, but if you're one of them
the tower is important,'' said David Wickerham, administrator for
Saratoga County which plans to erect three towers in its northern
towns.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged terrain, high treeline and valleys of the Adirondacks
require the new towers, he said, in order for residents to get
quick and reliable ambulance, police and fire service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the recent proposals would add a cellular telephone tower
in the Northampton area, one would add another phone tower near
Lake George, and the three would be in northern Saratoga County,
Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Saratoga County towers would be on top of Mount
Anthony, a mountain 60 miles north of Albany with a sheer cliff
side and no roads to the summit. That would change if the tower is
built.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the effect on the scenery of the tourist area,
environmentalists have pushed for so-called pine-tree towers. These
are towers that are camouflaged to blend in with the scenery, often
in the guise of a pine tree.
</P>
<P>
   But that is expensive. Saratoga County officials said the
designer towers could cost twice as much as the $1.1 million
budgeted for the towers and have an environmental drawback. That's
because cellular phone equipment can't simply be added at a later
date to a tower that is camouflaged and that could force another
tower to built.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an extreme drawback, we think,'' said Robert Stokes, a
town supervisor on the county committee running the tower project.
</P>
<P>
   Before any tower is built or expanded, however, several
environmental reviews will be conducted, said Jennifer Post,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
The agency has a say in any development in the state park through
the state Adirondack Park Agency, she said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki names top aide to new post  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki's top in-house political
adviser and communications director, Zenia Mucha, has been named to
a new post as the governor's senior policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Mucha's place as director of communications for the
governor is Michael McKeon, 36, a former reporter with the Times
Union newspaper of Albany who has been the governor's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   It was also announced Friday that Thomas Doherty, 37, an
assistant secretary to the governor in charge of patronage
appointments, has been promoted to a deputy secretary's job in the
administration. While Doherty will continue to oversee the
governor's appointments process, he will also be in charge of
regional affairs for the administration in his new post, McKeon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty and the governor's other two deputy secretaries, Jeffrey
Lovell, 43, and Deborah Konopko, 42, will have their salaries
boosted to $135,000 a year, up from the $118,000 they are currently
paid, McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon's salary is also being raised to $135,000 a year, up from
$118,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha, 43, will stay at her current $147,490-a-year salary,
McKeon said. As part of her duties, Mucha will continue to oversee
the communications office.
</P>
<P>
   No replacement for McKeon as press secretary has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion for the blunt-spoken Mucha could mean she is less
visible on the public stage. During her more than six years with
Pataki, she has been something of a lightning rod for critics of
the administration. She is considered one of Pataki's closest
confidants and wields enormous power in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a Republican state assemblyman, Thomas Kirwan of
Orange County, suggested the governor should fire Mucha. Kirwan
said he had heard Mucha was threatening to have him challenged in a
primary because he had supported Sen. John McCain in New York's
presidential primary over Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the governor's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha, who served as Pataki's campaign manager in his successful
1998 run for a second term, said Kirwan's charges were ''a sad
commentary that people will say or do anything to get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said Mucha, who was a top aide to then-Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato before going to work for Pataki in 1994, would be focusing
more on long-term policy issues in her new post.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has tremendous confidence in Zenia and wants to
add to her portfolio,'' McKeon said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani reaction on shooting shadows Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Political experts differ on how Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's reaction to the latest shooting of an unarmed
black man by police will affect his Senate campaign against Hillary
Rodham Clinton, but one says ''he can inflict the worst damage on
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a theme touched on Friday in an editorial cartoon in
the Times Union newspaper in Albany in which a caricature of the
New York City mayor appeared over a caption reading: ''The biggest
threat to the Giuliani campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   And, writing in the New York Post, columnist John Podhoretz, who
called Giuliani ''the greatest mayor in this city's history,'' said
that ''in his response to the police killing of Patrick Dorismond,
Rudy Giuliani has screwed up, and screwed up big time.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Giuliani's quick move after the Dorismond shooting
on March 16 to defend the police and make public information about
the victim's criminal record, including sealed juvenile records.
Democrats and some Republicans have said the mayor should have been
calling the Dorismond family to express his condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ''His actions have aggravated tensions in the city and have
helped drive a wedge between police and the communities they
serve,'' Clinton said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson questioned the mayor's sanity and city Comptroller
Alan Hevesi called the mayor's actions ''inhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, I think it was a mistake,'' Republican operative
Nelson Warfield, a New Yorker who helped run Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Others would acknowledge a mistake and move on, but I just
don't remember the last time Rudy Giuliani acknowledged any kind of
a mistake,'' said Warfield, who is not involved in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican Kieran Mahoney, a top political adviser to Gov.
George Pataki and other New York Republicans, said he saw no damage
to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is anybody surprised ... he is what he is,'' Mahoney, who is
not involved in the Senate race either, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see this as a reinforcement for both candidates, but nothing
new for either ... In politics, it's the new and different stuff
that changes things and there's nothing new or different about any
of this,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Severin, another New York GOP political operative not
involved in the race, said he felt there was no lasting damage for
Giuliani, and perhaps even an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''They walk away from this with Rudy having re-certified his
credentials as someone who will crack down on crime, support the
police and make the streets safe,'' Severin said. ''Mrs. Clinton
looks like she's soft on crime, sort of a knee-jerk liberal and
she's on the stage with Al Sharpton. That's a good trade for Team
Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Severin said the key undecided voters in the race tend to live
in the suburbs around New York City and in traditionally
conservative upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk to Rudy is that he is seen as too tough on crime with
these voters, which for these voters is probably like being too
thin or too rich,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman William Powers said he didn't believe the
controversy over Giuliani's handling of the Dorismond case would
have any effect on the race and maintained it was getting little
attention outside New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't read about it in any of the upstate media,'' Powers
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Warfield said Giuliani's reaction gives ammunition to the
Clinton camp because ''temperament is the guy's Achilles' heel ...
He can inflict the worst damage on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My fear is that in this circumstance, he goes beyond being
tough and into being ruthless and there's not much of a vote out
there for ruthless,'' Warfield added. ''It takes his greatest
strength and makes it into his greatest weakness. Voters don't like
mean candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Former state Democratic Chairman John Marino, a New York City
public relations executive with no connection to the race, said
''there has to be some concern in the Giuliani camp that he might
have gone over the line here and hurt himself.''
</P>
<P>
   While Marino said it is too early to judge the political
fallout, he maintained that ''what's bad for Rudy is that there's
been a tremendous focus on him'' and attention has shifted away
from the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my opinion that in the end, the last person in this race
to have the focus on them is the person in the most jeopardy,''
Marino said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino said that was the case in 1994 when his old boss, Mario
Cuomo, lost the governor's race to Pataki and again in 1998 when
then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato lost his bid for a fourth term to
Democrat Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   One key question is whether the issue helps energize black
voters that polls show are overwhelmingly on Clinton's side, but
who traditionally turn out at much lower rates than white voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every election we are reminded of that slumbering giant of New
York politics -- the minority vote. If anyone is ever able to
energize the minority vote, then the world will be a different
place,'' Republican Severin said.

lawyer over the weekend to discuss the case. Earlier Friday, lawyers for the
6-year-old boy's Miami relatives had proposed the appointment of an independent
arbitrator to determine if sending Elian back to Cuba or allowing him to stay
here would be better for the child. But Doris Meissner, commissioner of the

decided the proposal did not merit flying to Chicago on Saturday, said the

Tension Around FDA Drug Approval
</SUBHEAD>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is coming under renewed
scrutiny after a number of widely used medicines have been linked to deaths or
serious illness. Critics say the agency moves too quickly and puts the drug
industry's interests ahead of patient safety. As evidence they point to seven
drugs that have been pulled from the market or severely restricted in the past
three years. FDA officials insist their system works, but they stress all the
side effects cannot be known until after a drug is approved, and is taken by
tens of thousands of patients.

Clinton Urging Peace in South Asia

   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Concerned about terrorism, security is tight as
President Clinton visits Pakistan on Saturday to urge a retreat from nuclear
weapons and a lowering of dangerous tensions with India. The president will
spend just five hours in Pakistan -- after spending five days in India -- a sign
of U.S. unhappiness about Gen. Pervez Musharraf's October coup and his refusal
to set a timetable for national elections and a return to democracy. For its
part, India rejected Clinton's plea to sign a nuclear test ban. The same outcome
is likely in Pakistan, at least in the immediate future, White House officials

<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Duke made it easy for Florida, unraveling
in a surprising late-game collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Nelson scored 15 points and Mike Miller added 10,
including four crucial free throws in the final minute, as
fifth-seeded Florida upset the top-seeded Blue Devils 87-78 on

</P>
<P>
   Florida outscored Duke 13-0 in the last four minutes.
</P>

   Just how stunning was it? Duke (29-5) had won 26 straight games
in the East since 1986 and was 21-3 as the top seed.
</P>

   Nelson and his teammates played to win and atoned for Duke's
70-65 win over the Gators in the 1994 Final Four. Overshadowed by
Duke's freshman wizard, Jason Williams, Nelson outplayed his
counterpart decisively. Williams scored 13 points, but he took 20
shots, hitting just six and went 1-for-9 from long range.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really excited,'' said Nelson, who hit three 3-pointers
and had four assists and only one turnover. ''Duke was the No. 1
team in the country. To beat Duke is a great feeling. But we have
to focus because we want to reach the mountaintop. We have a few
more games to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils lost because they couldn't shoot straight from
long range, converting just 3-of-19 3-pointers after going 2-for-17
against Kansas in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there were tears in the Duke locker room afterward.
They didn't last long, though, and that's understandable. Duke has
been to 12 Final Fours and the program excelled this season despite
the departure of four players to the NBA after last year's loss to
Connecticut in the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been as gratifying of a year as I've ever had,'' Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ''The loss to Florida isn't going to
change that. If you expect me to feel bad, you're crazy. What a
journey my kids have given me this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected end to the journey came after the Gators
rebounded from a 74-69 deficit with 5:39 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, which went five minutes without a basket in the first
half, went cold again when the game was on the line, missing six 3s
and not getting a basket for the final 4:45.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got good shooters,'' said Duke's lone senior, Chris
Carrawell, who finished with 16 points. ''We went out firing all of
our bullets. That's all you can ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's loss left the tournament with only one remaining top
seed, Michigan State in the Midwest Regional. Arizona was knocked
out in the second round in the West, and Stanford was eliminated in
the second round in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils, who committed 22 turnovers, were not bothered
so much by the Florida press as they were own mistakes and errant
shots. They committed 22 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they seemed set to finally take control after Williams
hit a 3-pointer with 6:37 left for a 73-66 lead. But Nelson hit a 3
for Florida and Teddy Dupay's three-point play tied it for the 12th
time, 74-74, with 4:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3 by Dupay, who had 12 points, and a layup by Brent
Wright gave the Gators the lead for good, 79-78 with 2:08 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge win confidence-wise,'' said Udonis Haslem, who had
13 points for the Gators. ''But at the same time, we came here to
win two games, and we've only won one.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Blue Devils continued to fire and miss, the Gators,
who used 10 players and switched from the press to a zone defense
in the final three minutes, calmly hit six straight free throws in
the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hoped we had fatigued them enough,'' Donovan said. ''I
wanted to wait as long as I could to switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Battier led Duke with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 40-33 at the half, Duke scored seven straight points in
the first minute of the second period to tie the game for the fifth
time.
</P>
<P>
   Nate James missed a chance at a three-point play to start the
run, but Battier converted the third offensive rebound off the
missed free throw and then hit a layup for the tie.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma St. 68, Seton Hall 66  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Oklahoma State did a great job defending
the 3 and is one win away from the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Cowboys held Seton Hall to 7-of-34 shooting
from 3-point range and beat the 10th-seeded Pirates 68-66 Friday
night in the East Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (27-6) will meet fifth-seeded Florida, which beat
top-seeded and top-ranked Duke 87-78, on Sunday for a berth in the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Cowboys advanced this far in the NCAA
tournament was in 1995 when they reached the Final Four for the
first time under coach Eddie Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates (22-10), who needed overtime in each of their first
two wins in the tournament, played without injured senior point
guard Shaheen Holloway. The Pirates are the third of three Big East
teams to lose in the round of 16. Syracuse and Miami also fell in
the regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the 3-pointer has been of the Cowboys' strengths all
season as they were eighth in the nation, allowing 29.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They were even better against Seton Hall, which was 23-of-44 in
the first two games of the tournament, including an East
Regional-record 15-of-30 in the second-round upset of second-seeded
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway sprained his left ankle eight minutes into the victory
over Temple. Ty Shine replaced him and scored a career-high 26
points, including the game-winning 3-pointer with 18 seconds left
in overtime. Holloway, who didn't practice all week, didn't dress
for the game and had to settle for a role as a cheerleader and
extra assistant coach in his final college game.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Mason had 16 points for the Cowboys, and Brian Montonati
and Fredrik Jonzen added 15 each.
</P>
<P>
   Rimas Kaukenas led the Pirates with 17 points and Darius Lane
added 16, but he was 7-for-24 from the field, including 2-for-18
from beyond the arc. Shine, who was 7-for-10 from 3-point range
against Temple, had 11 points on 4-for-16 shooting, including
2-for-10 on 3s.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates were right there until the end and Oklahoma State
needed some good interior defense as well to hold them off.
</P>
<P>
   Jonzen, a 6-foot-10 sophomore center, blocked Kaukenas on a
rebound layup with five minutes to go and also threw away Al Harris
with 1:40 left and Seton Hall within 60-57.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Alexander was 4-for-6 from the free-throw line for the
Cowboys over the final 16 seconds, holding off Seton Hall with his
last one with 0.5 seconds to play that made it 68-66.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gottlieb had 12 assists for Oklahoma State, well above his
8.6 average for the season, and the Cowboys committed just six
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall was trying to reach the regional final for the third
time ever and the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mason hit a shot from just inside midcourt just after the
halftime buzzer that would have given Oklahoma State a 38-36 lead.
The Cowboys claimed the horn went off with time remaining on the
clock. The officials reviewed a replay and ruled the shot was late.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Leader Forced From Square  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- A crowd demanding better government
forced President Luis Gonzalez Macchi from a downtown square Friday
evening amid a hail of sticks and stones when he tried to address
them.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Macchi made a surprise appearance before a largely
youthful crowd of thousands that had gathered peacefully outside
Congress to demand an end to perceived ''mismanagement'' of
government.
</P>
<P>
   The president, accompanied by his wife and bodyguards, spoke for
about two minutes to the participants, who gathered under the
rallying theme of ''citizen power.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking the microphone, stones and sticks were thrown from
the crowd. Television footage appeared to show one stone bouncing
harmlessly off his forehead as he was forced away.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plaza is also mine,'' the president angrily responded
before withdrawing with his retinue.
</P>
<P>
   He did not appear hurt, and authorities had no comment on the
hostile reception he received. Police did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Macchi had just told the crowd how he had joined
demonstrators in a ''struggle for democracy'' on the same plaza
nearly a year ago. He assumed the presidency on March 28, 1999 amid
a weeklong political crisis that forced the ouster of his
predecessor, Raul Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   The rally came during a series of public demonstrations and
events remembering that upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complain Gonzalez Macchi's government has not fulfilled
promises to help Paraguay's lagging economy recovery from a
five-year slump. Some during the rally spoke of uncompleted
reforms.

<HEADLINE> Tulsa 80, Miami 71  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Finally, a regional final for Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Golden Hurricane advanced to the final eight
for the first time Friday night, beating sixth-seeded Miami 80-71
in the South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can put Cinderella on us if you want to, but our players
and teams have shown through the years that they can play with
anyone,'' Tulsa coach Bill Self said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tulsa will play in the a regional final for the first
time Sunday, the Golden Hurricane are no stranger to the later days
of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa (32-4) has advanced to the Sweet 16 three times since 1994
but had never advanced farther. To get there this time it took a
second-round victory over second-seeded Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa will play North Carolina for a spot in the Final Four. The
eighth-seeded Tar Heels beat Tennessee 74-69.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't been in many close games, we needed an experience
like Cincinnati,'' Self said. ''Miami outplayed us until the
eight-minute mark, but they ran out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a group effort by Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Kurtz, at 6-foot-10 the only Tulsa player who could
match up with Miami's size, scored all of his 17 points in the
second half and provided the key steal and dunk that snuffed
Miami's only lead with about 10 minutes left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Coley also scored 17 points for Tulsa and Greg Harrington
had 14, Marcus Hill 13 and Tony Heard 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have high expectations for myself,'' Kurtz said. ''We spread
the floor, opened it up and my teammates found me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami (23-11) had never made it this far in its three previous
tournament appearances and was noticeably nervous in the opening
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Hemsley, who averaged 22 points in Miami's two tournament
victories, slammed the ball at midcourt before pregame
introductions, sending it high into the air.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates were just as tight as the Hurricanes turned it
over 13 times in the first half as Tulsa built a 25-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite giving up the size, Tulsa outrebounded Miami 41-37 and
gave the Hurricanes no second chance points in the first half.
Tulsa had won 25 games this season by double-figure margins and
appeared on the verge of another rout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen a group of guys play together as they do,''
Miami's Vernon Jennings said. ''They just didn't let us get into
doing what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami recovered in time to close the gap to 31-25 at halftime on
Hemsley's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes hit 10-of-17 from the arc and Jennings' 3-pointer
give Miami its first -- and only -- lead at 46-43 with 10-35 to play.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted all of 45 seconds. Tulsa answered with Hill's jumper,
and Kurtz intercepted Jennings' pass and finished a fast break with
a dunk to retake the lead at 47-46.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz scored six more as Tulsa built the lead to 61-50 on
Heard's two free throws with 5:21 to play. Miami never again cut it
below eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we were a step slower tonight and you can't have
that against a team like Tulsa,'' Miami coach Leonard Hamilton
said. ''They are probably the fastest team we faced all year ... I
think our team was worn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who hired Self as an assistant at Oklahoma State in
the late 1980s, hugged his former protege at midcourt when the game
ended. Miami (23-11) finished one victory short of a school record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very proud of what these guys accomplished this year,''
Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings and Mario Bland led Miami with 17 points each. Hemsley
had 13 on 4-of-10 shooting before fouling out in the final minute.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 8, Mighty Ducks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Peter Schaefer scored twice
and added two assists as the Vancouver Canucks jumped back into the
Western Conference playoff race Friday night with a 8-1 win over
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, which had its largest margin of victory this season,
improved to 6-1 in seven home games and moved into a tie with
Anaheim for ninth place with 76 points.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, playing its third game in four nights, lost its second
straight. The Mighty Ducks have just one win in nine games north of
the Canadian border, including a pair of losses in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bertuzzi also scored twice for the Canucks, who have seven
games remaining. Anaheim has six left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer ended a 13-game scoring drought with the only goal of
the first period at 6:37, then added the eventual game-winner at
11:07 of the second. The Vancouver rookie matched his single-game
career high for points with an assist on Mark Messier's 15th goal
three minutes later. He also assisted on Bertuzzi's second goal
with 1:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer scored his first goal after scooping up a loose puck at
center ice. He beat Kevin Haller down the right side before cutting
hard through the crease and sliding the puck past Guy Hebert on the
far side. Schaefer, who has 15 goals this year, scored for just the
fourth time on home ice.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya tied it with his 38th goal just 27 seconds into the
second, but Vancouver broke the game open with four unanswered
goals to end the period.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer and Messier started Vancouver's second-period surge
before Matt Cooke and Andrew Cassels scored less than one minute
apart to give the Canucks a 5-1 lead. Anaheim pulled Hebert after
Cassels' goal in favor of Dominic Roussel.
</P>
<P>
   Markus Naslund converted a two-man breakaway with Trent Klatt at
3:44 of the third. Bertuzzi scored twice in the final three minutes
to round out the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Potvin made 17 saves for Vancouver, which outshot Anaheim
30-18.

<HEADLINE> North Carolina 74, Tennessee 69  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Even in a down year, North Carolina still
found a way to make the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cota spurred a late second-half comeback, then he and
freshmen Joseph Forte and Julius Peppers hit six straight free
throws in the final 34.9 seconds, giving the Tar Heels a 74-69
victory over Tennessee and another stunning upset.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-seeded North Carolina (21-13), fresh off beating the
South's top seed Stanford, overcame a 51-42 deficit by holding the
fourth-seeded Volunteers (26-7) without a field goal for nearly the
last seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels are headed to the regional final for the sixth
time in 10 years. They'll play seventh-seeded Tulsa (32-4), which
has never gotten this far. The contrast could be a factor as North
Carolina has made the Final Four every time it has made the final
eight since 1991, winning it all in '93.
</P>
<P>
   The winning rally kicked into top gear when Forte drilled a
3-pointer and Jason Capel hit a layup to get North Carolina within
64-62. Cota made a running jumper in the lane, then hit another
floater over Ron Slay to make it 66-64 with 2:00 left.
</P>
<P>
   Forte, who scored 22 points and broke Sam Perkins' school record
for points by a freshman, held the ball too long on North
Carolina's next possession and forced up a jumper with the shot
clock winding down. It was blocked, but went straight to Peppers,
who appeared to have redirected it into the hoop before the buzzer.
TV replays showed he got it off in time, but it was waved off.
</P>
<P>
   Any controversy was avoided after Slay missed a wild layup and
threw down Forte as they went for the rebound. North Carolina coach
Bill Guthridge screamed for an intentional foul, but didn't get it.
Forte hit both free throws with 34.9 left.
</P>
<P>
   Peppers, who is missing spring football practice thanks to the
Tar Heels' NCAA run, was fouled after rebounding a 3-point miss by
Tony Harris and the 57-percent free throw shooter drilled both with
26.7 seconds to play to make it 70-64.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's scoring drought, which left them without a field
goal since 7:15, ended with 13.6 seconds left when Harris made his
first basket of the night, a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   But Cota hit two free throws with 11.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Black scored off a rebound for the Volunteers' final
points, then the Tar Heels answered with a long inbounds pass to
Max Owens that led to a two-handed dunk and a wild celebration by
the Carolina fans in the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cota had 11 points, seven rebounds and five assists, ending his
streak of having 10 assists in three straight NCAA games. Brendan
Haywood also had 11 points before fouling out with 8:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   Black led the Volunteers with 17 points. Vincent Yarbrough had
13 and Slay added 12. Isiah Victor had 11.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which set a school record for victories, was trying
to reach the final eight for the first time. This was the
Volunteers' first appearance in the regional semifinals since 1981,
back when it was a 48-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Their bid to prove that the Tennessee men can be as dominant as
the Tennessee women got off to a slow start as North Carolina led
by seven early. Then, the Vols' speed and athleticism carried them
to a 22-7 run and a nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Capel kept the Tar Heels close by scoring the last five points
of the first half, putting North Carolina within 39-36.
</P>
<P>
   A slow start in the second half nearly doomed the Tar Heels,
especially after Haywood fouled out. Guthridge made a risky move by
leaving in the 7-footer after he picked up his fourth foul at 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina came into the tournament having lost three of
four and eight of 15. Now, they've already carved a spot in the
school's glorious history and could become a sentimental favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge already is doing something predecessor Dean Smith
never did. Smith's only No. 8 seed, in 1990, lost in the regional
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   With the 21st victory, North Carolina avoided its fewest wins
since going 18-9 in 1969-70.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Uneasy By Lawmaker's Touch  </HEADLINE>
By GREGG AAMOT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Please, don't touch the body.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jesse Ventura and state lawmakers took after each other on
the air Friday over the governor's prickly reaction to being
touched by a female lawmaker during a televised forum.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said on his weekly radio show that lawmakers would be
''passing sexual harassment laws'' and he ''would be paying hell
for it'' if he had done the touching.
</P>
<P>
   During the forum on KTCA-TV on Wednesday night, Ventura took
umbrage with Republican Rep. Carol Molnau after she touched him
several times during a debate about proposals for funding
transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   Molnau tapped the governor's leg and patted him on the arm to
emphasize her points, prompting Ventura to exclaim: ''Don't.
Please, please, I'm not touching you.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, some lawmakers were sporting stickers that said
''Don't touch me'' and snickering about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   During airtime granted legislators each week to rebut Ventura's
hourlong show, Molnau said she was just trying to get Ventura's
attention. She said she stopped the touching when he protested, and
she joked that she didn't know the former professional wrestler
known as ''the Body'' was ''that fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people think that a touch on the sleeve or a touch on the
shoulder or a pat on the back is a good thing,'' she said. ''But
for the governor, I guess it's not a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said Molnau touched him about four times and he was
uncomfortable about it. He also said he was disappointed that
lawmakers made light of his sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sexual harassment is not a one-way street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Dean Johnson, a Lutheran pastor who took part in
the radio program with Molnau, said he didn't think her actions
constituted sexual harassment. Johnson also pointed out that
Ventura has resorted to name-calling when lawmakers haven't agreed
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The office of governor is the highest political office in our
state, and it deserves honor and respect,'' Johnson said. ''But
governor, you have to earn it, and you have to keep it for your
term of office.''

   DENVER (AP) -- Moments after swearing in new recruits at the

department doesn't suffer the much-publicized problems of New York

</P>
<P>
   ''I think we are suffering from the same problems affecting
other departments,'' the acting police chief said Friday. ''We're

We want to prevent those things from happening.''

prosperous cities in the nation under Mayor Wellington Webb.
</P>
<P>
   While crime has dropped 25 percent from 1992 to 1998, city
police are in the spotlight more than at any time since the 1950s
and '60s, when 54 cops -- the so-called ''burglars in blue'' -- were
charged with robbing homes and businesses and cracking safes. Many
of them went to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cops would stand watch outside businesses and homes while
colleagues stole dresses and appliances and cracked safes,'' said
historian Tom Noel. ''With perhaps a million dollars in ill-gotten
gains, it made Denver the U.S. crooked cop capital.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, a federal judge sent federal marshals into police
offices to seize records and fined them $10,000. Webb personally
intervened to arrange a payment of $400,000 to relatives of a man
killed in a drug raid on the wrong house.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Police Chief Tom Sanchez was ousted in the fallout
from the SWAT raid. Police also have been criticized for allegedly
using excessive force during arrests and while controlling Super
Bowl victory rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts to prevent New Year's Eve rioting were so
effective that downtown was virtually empty. One television anchor
man waved a flashlight, mimicking police, and called it ''Denver's
laser light show.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Ed Thomas, a policeman himself for 22 years,
said action is needed to avoid a return to the 1960s. ''There have
been some serious missteps in the police administration,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what the misconduct is, the police are always
exonerated,'' said community activist LeRoy Lemos, who has led
protests over the killing of Mexican immigrant Ismael Mena in the
botched drug raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are outraged that there was so much coverup and lack of
valid information from the police department from the beginning.
... They operate under a shroud of cover, put out misinformation
and go on character-assassination rampages.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mena case, police initially denied they had gone to the
wrong house and only admitted their error after Webb made it
public. An independent investigator filed perjury charges against
the officer who organized the raid.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, city attorneys have drawn the ire of a
federal judge who ordered them to release 3,000 internal-affairs
files to attorneys representing a man in a police-brutality
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled the city had violated his earlier orders to hand
over the documents, and he fined Denver $10,000. City attorneys
have appealed, contending they were complying with the order.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of problems began in 1997 when officers were
caught by a TV news camera beating Gil Webb Jr., whose vehicle
smashed into a patrol car and killed an officer. Webb is serving
prison time after being convicted of vehicular homicide, assault
and driving a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 29, Mena, 45, was shot to death after officers broke
into his bedroom in a so-called ''no-knock'' raid. The SWAT team
was cleared in the shooting itself.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting prompted a public outcry over no-knock raids. A
panel assembled by the mayor is considering a temporary ban.
</P>
<P>
   The department also has been criticized for hiring a man who
admitted using cocaine and LSD. The man, Ellis Johnson II, 40, was
sworn in Friday.

<HEADLINE> DeLorean Ousted From Estate  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) -- John Z. DeLorean, whose high-profile
automobile career collapsed after his arrest on cocaine charges,
has been evicted from his 434-acre estate.
</P>
<P>
   The three-story brick Georgian mansion, DeLorean's home for
nearly 20 years, was sold at a court-ordered bankruptcy auction
earlier this year for $15.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the 75-year-old DeLorean watched as movers loaded
furnishings into vans. The items are to be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes his adult children will prevail in their appeal
to prove they had a lifetime claim to the property. He declined to
say where he would be living.
</P>
<P>
   DeLorean quit General Motors in 1973 as vice president in charge
of North American car and truck operations and later launched his
own car company in Northern Ireland. DeLorean produced nearly 9,000
DeLoreans, a stainless-steel sports car with gull-wing doors.
</P>
<P>
   The company collapsed after he was arrested in 1982, accused of
conspiring to sell $24 million of cocaine to salvage his venture.
He used an entrapment defense to win acquittal, but wrestled with
40 other legal cases in the ensuing years, and his debts grew.
</P>
<P>
   He declared bankruptcy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in January approved the sale of the estate to a
golf course developer. The sale price was equal to about half of
DeLorean's total debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''But for circumstances out of his control, he could have been
one of the most successful industrialists this country has ever
seen,'' said attorney John J. Trombadore, who represented DeLorean
in his 1985 divorce from model Cristina Ferrare.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Pastor Faces Charges  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A 75-year-old Rwandan clergyman accused of taking
part in the massacre of refugees in his homeland has been deported
to Africa to face an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, is the
first person arrested on U.S. soil to be turned over to a U.N.
tribunal, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Don DeGabrielle in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused of luring refugees into his Rwandan church, where
they were massacred. If convicted, he could get life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana has been charged with genocide and crimes against
humanity by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, based
in neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in 1996 in Laredo, where he had been living. His
flight from Texas left Thursday for Tanzania, DeGabrielle said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope and expect he will receive a fair trial,'' the
prosecutor said. ''The tribunal was set up under the microscope of
the entire world. All the nations that are U.N. members had
participation of the establishment of rules and fundamental
principles the tribunal would employ.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who has represented
Ntakirutimana, did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   The path was cleared for Ntakirutimana to be turned over to the
tribunal when the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 24 rejected without
comment his argument that he could not be extradited because no
treaty exists between the United States and the tribunal. Congress
passed a 1996 law that allows Ntakirutimana's extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana was serving as pastor of a church at Mugonero,
Rwanda, in 1994 when Hutu militants killed more than 500,000
people, primarily minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Ntakirutimana urged a large group of group of
Tutsis, including children, to seek refuge in a church and hospital
complex, then took part in a daylong gun and machete attack that
left hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
   He also is accused of evacuating Hutus from a church-hospital
complex in the village of Bisesero and instructing the execution of
the remaining Tutsis, DeGabrielle said. One witness reported seeing
him shooting.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Texas legally under a permanent resident visa. In
Laredo, where one of his seven grown children lived, Ntakirutimana
worked part-time in a health food store.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-pastor returns to Africa at a time when Rwanda is facing
its worst political tumult since 1994. The country's president
resigned Thursday in the wake of further debate over ethnic
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that the army's commander-in-chief and
current vice president, Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, could ascend to the
presidency. Victory by Kagame's forces in July 1994 stopped the
genocide by the Hutu extremist government.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Tournament Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NICHOLSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida knocked off the top seed of them all, leaving the
unpredictable NCAA tournament even more wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Nelson scored 15 points and the Gators scored the final 13
points to beat Duke 87-78 on Friday night in the East Regional
semifinals in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's loss left the tournament with only one remaining top
seed, Michigan State in the Midwest Regional. Arizona was knocked
out in the second round in the West, and Stanford was eliminated in
the second round in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been as gratifying of a year as I've ever had,'' Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ''The loss to Florida isn't going to
change that. If you expect me to feel bad, you're crazy. What a
journey my kids have given me this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke (29-5), ranked No. 1 in the final AP poll, had won 26
straight games in the East since 1986 and was 21-3 as the top seed.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Gators (27-7) will play Oklahoma State on
Sunday for a spot in the Final Four. The third-seeded Cowboys beat
10th-seeded Seton Hall 68-66.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really excited,'' said Nelson, who hit three 3-pointers
and had four assists and only one turnover. ''Duke was the No. 1
team in the country. To beat Duke is a great feeling. But we have
to focus because we want to reach the mountaintop. We have a few
more games to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South Regional in Austin, Texas, seventh-seeded Tulsa
beat sixth-seeded Miami 80-71, and eighth-seeded North Carolina
edged fourth-seeded Tennessee 74-69.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Michigan State will play second-seeded Iowa State
in the Midwest final in Auburn Hills, Mich., and sixth-seeded
Purdue will face eighth-seeded Wisconsin in an all-Big Ten West
final in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Duke failed to advance to the Final Four for the fourth time in
the last five years after making six appearances and winning two
titles in a seven-year stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils were 3-for-19 from 3-point range after going
2-for-17 against Kansas in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Battier led Duke with 20 points, 15 in the second half.
Chris Carrawell finished with 16 and freshman point guard Jason
Williams added 13 on 6-of-20 shooting, 1-for-9 from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, which went five minutes without a basket in the first
half, went cold again when the game was on the line, missing six 3s
and not getting a basket for the final 4:45.
</P>
<P>
   Duke seemed set to take control after Williams hit a 3-pointer
with 6:37 left for a 73-66 lead. But Nelson hit a 3 and Teddy
Dupay's three-point play tied it at 74 with 4:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3 by Dupay and a basket by Brent Wright gave the Gators
the lead for good, 79-78 with 2:08 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge win confidence-wise,'' said Udonis Haslem, who had
13 points for the Gators. ''But at the same time, we came here to
win two games, and we've only won one.''
</P>
<P>
EAST
Oklahoma St. 68, Seton Hall 66
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Mason scored 16 points and Oklahoma State held Seton
Hall to 7-of-34 shooting from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Montonati and Fredrik Jonzen added 15 each for the Cowboys
(27-6), who advanced to the final eight for the first time since
1995 when they reached the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Rimas Kaukenas led Seton Hall (22-10) with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, who needed overtime in each of their two wins in
the tournament, played without senior point guard Shaheen Holloway.
He sprained his left ankle eight minutes into Seton Hall's
second-round victory over Temple.
</P>
<P>
SOUTH
North Carolina 74, Tennessee 69
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cota spurred a late second-half comeback, and combined with
Joseph Forte and Julius Peppers to hit six straight free throws in
the final 34.9 seconds for North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Forte scored 22 points to help the Tar Heels (21-13) advance to
the final eight for the sixth time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, which beat Stanford in the second round,
overcame a 51-42 deficit by holding the Volunteers (26-7) without a
field goal for nearly the last seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
Tulsa 80, Miami 71
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Kurtz scored all 17 of his points in the second half to
help Tulsa advance to its first regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Coley also had 17 points for Tulsa (32-4), which was
playing in the round of 16 for the third time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jennings and Mario Bland each scored 17 points for Miami
(23-11), which fell one victory short of a school record.

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Webber had 29 points and 14
rebounds and Nick Anderson added 28 points and 11 rebounds as the
depleted Sacramento Kings held off the Detroit Pistons 113-103
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had only eight players the final 2{ quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Vlade Divac went out with a strained knee seven minutes into the
game, Corliss Williamson was ejected in the second quarter and the
injured Jon Barry and Predrag Stojakovic didn't dress.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Kings 40 wins, the most since the franchise
moved to Sacramento for the 1985-86 season. Their magic number for
clinching a playoff spot is three.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill scored 35 points and had nine rebounds for the
Pistons, who had won three straight on the road and seven of nine
under interim coach George Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Stackhouse added 24 points for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams had 15 points and 10 assists for Sacramento and
reserve Lawrence Funderburke added 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had six 3-pointers and his final one, with 1:36
remaining, put the Kings ahead 106-97.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve guard Darrick Martin made two 3-pointers early in the
fourth quarter as the Kings assumed a 94-86 lead with 7:35
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After Williamson picked up two technical fouls and was ejected,
the Kings responded with a 17-4 run in the second quarter. Anderson
hit two 3-pointers in the spurt and had the last five points,
putting the Kings ahead 50-40.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson scored 13 first-half points and had eight rebounds,
while Webber -- hurting the Pistons inside and outside -- added 12
points, helping the Kings take a 54-52 lead into the break.
Notes: Hill scored 20 points in the first half. ... The Kings had
12 first-half turnovers, five by Webber. ... The Kings are the
league's highest scoring team and Detroit is second. ... Sacramento
made 10-of-28 3-point attempts.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 96, Warriors 83  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Already missing Arvydas Sabonis, the
Portland Trail Blazers got another scare when Steve Smith had to be
helped off the court in an otherwise routine victory Friday night
over the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, who twisted his ankle and left the game for eight
minutes in the first half, returned to score 21 points as the
Blazers won 96-83, sending the Warriors to their sixth consecutive
defeat at home.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Stoudamire had 26 points, eight assists and eight rebounds
for Portland, which shot 50 percent and went 8-for-11 on
3-pointers. The Blazers never trailed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis, who sprained his right foot Wednesday night against
Detroit, did not make the trip and is expected to be sidelined for
an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Farmer had 18 points for the Warriors, who have lost four
straight overall, Vonteego Cummings had 17 and Larry Hughes added
14 despite leaving the game for the last 3{ minutes of the first
half after getting kneed in the jaw while having a shot blocked by
Portland's Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, making his first start of the season, had 12 points, 10
rebounds and five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 54-44 at halftime, Portland increased its margin to as
many as 18 points in the third period and led 77-62 entering the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and O'Neal had to be separated by officials after Farmer
committed a flagrant foul on O'Neal and they tangled under the
Portland basket in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors pulled to 83-72 with 8:15 remaining on a foul-line
jumper by Hughes, and Cummings scored the next four points to pull
Golden State within seven with 5:30 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith responded with a 3-pointer to begin a 6-0 run for the
Blazers and the Warriors did not threaten again.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire had 12 points and Smith, who injured his ankle when
he stepped on Jason Caffey's foot while playing defense, added nine
as the Trail Blazers took a 10-point halftime lead. Farmer had 14
points in the first half for Golden State.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Golden State's Donyell Marshall was ejected after getting
two quick technicals with 4:43 left in the game. ... Erick Dampier
missed his fifth straight game for the Warriors with a sprained
right wrist. He also has been sidelined for 43 games this season
with left knee problems. ... Billy Owens missed his third straight
game for Golden State with right knee inflammation. ... The
Warriors are 2-18 against Pacific Division foes this season. ...
The Trail Blazers swept the four-game season series from the
Warriors. ... Before the game, Portland coach Mike Dunleavy watched
on a TV in the locker room as his son and Duke lost to Florida in

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Karl Malone scored six points in the final two
minutes, including a turnaround jumper with 6.2 seconds left
Friday, lifting the Utah Jazz to a 98-95 victory over the Seattle
SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz led 96-95 when Malone hit a baseline jumper over Horace
Grant. Vernon Maxwell had a chance to tie the game, but his 3-point
attempt with 2.3 seconds left was short and Utah controlled the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Malone led the Jazz with 21 points and 12 rebounds as all of
Utah's starters scored in double figures. The Jazz won for the 12th
time in the last 13 games. The Sonics dropped their third straight
home game.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton scored 28 points, Vin Baker added 25 and Maxwell
added 18 for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   John Stockton had 15 points and 10 assists for the Jazz. His
bounce pass to Jeff Hornacek for a layup gave the Jazz a 96-93 lead
with 35 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's jumper cut the deficit to a single point before Malone
closed out the Jazz win.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's two free throws tied the game at 83 with 5:48. The game
seesawed the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Down 74-65 early in the fourth period, the Jazz retook the lead
with a 10-2 run sparked by Greg Ostertag with five points for a
75-74 lead with 9:52 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 73-65 after three periods. Payton and Baker took
turns leading Seattle. Payton scored eight straight points,
including back-to-back 3-pointers, and Baker scored 10 straight
points at one stretch for a 66-56 lead with 3:58 left in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's performance in the first half was a big improvement
over its lackluster play recently. The Jazz have been one of the
NBA's best teams since the first week in February, winning 18 of
their previous 21 games and 11 of their past 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics outscored the Jazz 25-16 in the second period and led
45-42 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ruben Patterson missed his first game of the season. He did
not dress because of a sore Achilles' tendon. ... Rashard Lewis
made his third start of the season. He and Payton are the only
Sonics who have played in all 69 games. ...Vin Baker played 21
minutes in the first half and did not get a single rebound.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 109, Suns 101  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 40 points, his fourth
time reaching the 40-point plateau in the last seven games, and the
Los Angeles Lakers held on for a 109-101 victory Friday night over
the crippled Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the fifth straight by the Lakers, a mini-streak they
began after having their 19-game victory string ended by
Washington. The loss ended a five-game winning streak by the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns never led, but they made it close at the end, narrowing
the gap to 104-101 on Todd Day's 3-pointer with 41 seconds
remaining. But Kobe Bryant made three free of four free throws and
Robert Horry made two free throws for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who made 10 of 13 free throws and was 15 of 29 from the
floor, had 14 rebounds. He also made six straight shots in the
fourth quarter to help the Lakers keep the Suns at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant added 28 points for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway led the Suns, playing their first game since
losing Jason Kidd to an injury, with 25 points. Cliff Robinson
added 22 in the loss, and Rodney Rogers had 16 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 79-71 heading into the final period and the Suns
got no closer than five points, at 89-84 with 7:05 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd had surgery on his left ankle Thursday after injuring it
just before halftime the previous night in a 114-93 win over
Sacramento. Phoenix lost another key player, Tom Gugliotta, earlier
this month to surgery on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' biggest lead was 12 points, the last time at 87-75
with 9:54 left in the game. The Suns then began to chip away at the
lead, but the closest they got was three points in the closing
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was up 51-45 at halftime as O'Neal scored 13 of his
15 first-half points in the opening quarter and Bryant had 13 in
the second quarter. He scored 17 in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, looking like he was trying to pick up the slack left
by Kidd's absence, scored 12 points in the first half and Robinson
had 10.
</P>
<P>
Notes: When the Suns lost Kidd and Gugliotta, they lost a combined
28 points, 15.1 rebounds and 12.4 assists a game. Kidd was
averaging 14.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and an NBA-high 10.1 assists.
Gugliotta's numbers were 13.7 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.3 assists.
... The Lakers have won 12 straight at home and their 31 victories
tie Indiana for most home victories.

<HEADLINE> Students Flock to Overseas Study  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES HANNAH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- The slayings in Costa Rica of an Antioch
College undergraduate and a former student may worry parents, but
the popularity of studying abroad is booming and experts say the
benefits far outweigh the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shouldn't put a damper on the idea of overseas study,''
said Gary Rhodes, director of the University of Southern
California's clearinghouse for study abroad. ''In general, travel
in most of the world is very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky., and Emily Eagen of
Ann Arbor, Mich., were found March 13 along a highway near the
Costa Rican coast town of Cahuita. The two 19-year-olds had been
shot. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. students who study abroad has more than
doubled in the past 15 years, jumping from 48,483 in 1985-86 to
113,959 in 1997-98, according to the Institute of International
Education.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the places where students study have become
more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of U.S. students who study in Europe has fallen
from nearly 80 percent in 1985-86 to 64 percent in 1997-98. U.S.
students studying in Latin America more than doubled, from 7
percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were 2,973 students who studied in Costa Rica in 1997-98,
up dramatically from the 499 there 10 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Warren, the dean of students at Antioch College east of
Dayton, said Latin America is a popular location for many Antioch
students who work and study abroad, in part because it's relatively
close.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of students that are interested in Latin
American culture, Latin American politics, Latin American
history,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Deidre Thomas, a junior at Wittenberg University in Springfield,
spent three months in Ecuador last year, living with a family and
working as a teacher's aide at a special-education school.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents were freaking out -- me being near Colombia,'' she
said. Colombia has been the scene of killings and other crimes by
drug traffickers, rebels and militias.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 21, of Bowling Green, Ky., said she felt uncomfortable
only once, when she and some other girls were at a fiesta and some
of the men were drinking. She and her friends left.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said she would never discourage students from going
abroad because of potential danger. She said she was inspired by
the Ecuadoran people, who are generous even though they have little
to give.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came back feeling very materialistic, threw open my closet
and gave half my clothes to Goodwill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hoffa, who has written ''A Parent's Guide to Study
Abroad,'' said he does not believe study overseas is any riskier
than studying in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''When something happens overseas, there is sometimes a
knee-jerk reaction that overseas is more dangerous,'' Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the programs I know of err on the side of counsel and
warning,'' he said. ''It's in nobody's interest to send students in
harm's way.''

<HEADLINE> Vegas Murder Trial Has It All  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Sex, violence, thievery, millions in buried
silver, dueling pathologists and an old-line casino clan pitted
against a former topless dancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Ted Binion murder case has it all, and details of the wild
west saga begin unfolding when the trial opens Monday. In a city
where the offbeat is the norm, this one has the locals riveted.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim the former casino boss was killed in a plot
cooked up by his girlfriend, Sandra Murphy, and a contractor, Rick
Tabish, to steal his buried treasure of $5 million in silver bars
and coins.
</P>
<P>
   Binion was the youngest son of the late gambling legend Benny
Binion, who hit town from Dallas in 1947 with a wife, five children
and a suitcase stuffed with $2 million in cash that bankrolled his
downtown Horseshoe hotel-casino.
</P>
<P>
   Ted, the younger of two brothers, lost his gaming license in
1998 over allegations of drug use and ties to a mob figure. His
lifestyle was something short of exemplary, his association with
live-in girlfriend Murphy volatile.
</P>
<P>
   The two partied with the social elite, and she shopped at the
town's swank stores. But the relationship unraveled amid rumors
Murphy, a 28-year-old former topless dancer, was having an affair
with Binion's friend, Tabish, 35, a Missoula, Mont., contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The day before he died, Binion, 55, decided to yank Murphy from
his will and bounce her from his house and his life, said his
attorney, Richard Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation ran rampant when Binion was found dead at his posh
home Sept. 17, 1998. The Clark County Coroner's office ruled the
death was due to an overdose of heroin and an antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't satisfy Becky Behnen, Binion's sister and now the
owner of the hotel-casino. Suspecting her brother's death bore
Murphy's fingerprints, Behnen hired private investigator Tom
Dillard, a tenacious former Las Vegas homicide detective.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pressed for the investigation because I felt this was a
homicide,'' Behnen said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark County Coroner Ron Flud agreed, ruling in March 1999 that
the death was not an accidental overdose.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came as Murphy wrangled in court with the Binion
family over a slice of Ted's $50 million estate.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the estate quizzed Murphy and Tabish about
valuables allegedly missing from the Binion home and their reported
affair. They refused to answer more than 200 questions, saying it
might incriminate them. The prize in the civil action was Murphy's
inheritance of the $900,000 Binion home, its contents and $300,000
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's former lawyer, Oscar Goodman, dropped her to run
successfully for mayor. The civil case is on hold, pending appeals
and the outcome of the murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time as the civil court battle was unfolding,
Tabish, Michael Milot and David Mattsen were facing theft charges
for attempting to dig up the silver bars and coins Binion had
buried in the desert 60 miles west of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Tabish knew where to go because authorities say he built the
underground vault. Binion had allegedly refused to pay Tabish the
$13,000 promised for his work, according to an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The three were arrested when sheriff's deputies stumbled on the
heist-in-progress in the pre-dawn hours, two days after Binion was
killed. Murphy also was charged later in the theft.
</P>
<P>
   In June, police arrested Murphy and Tabish and charged them with
killing Binion. Murphy was released on $300,000 cash bail provided
by an elderly man she met in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors believe Binion was forced to ingest a lethal amount
of heroin and Xanax, then was suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   Cyril Wecht and Michael Baden -- two of 12 medical experts on the
panel that examined President Kennedy's assassination -- are
expected to testify, Wecht for the defense, Baden for the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys claim the powerful Binion family orchestrated
the arrest of Murphy and Tabish to keep the inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been up against the Binion money machine ever since the
inception of this case,'' said lawyer John Momot. ''It's her and I
against the state of Nevada, private investigators and the money
behind the casino.''
</P>
<P>
   Behnen paints a different portrait of Murphy, who she said made
numerous telephone threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threats were very vivid, like 'I'm going to take a shotgun
and shoot you and blood is going to splatter and your brains are
going to be all over the sidewalk.''' Behnen said.
</P>
<P>
   Tabish attorney Louis Palazzo said it's all a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''A great majority of the case was prepared by a private
investigator, rather than police,'' he said. ''They can't produce
any evidence at all that Rick was present, much less agree on the
cause of death.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Mulls Break on Gas Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax breaks are still on the minds of
congressional leaders trying to find a political solution to rising
oil prices, but the House and Senate are approaching the question
in much different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., introduced a pair of
gas-tax bills this week. One would roll back until January the
4.3-cents-a-gallon increase imposed in 1993. The other would enact
a temporary ''tax holiday'' and suspend the 18.4-cents-per-gallon
federal gas tax if pump prices top $2 a gallon this year.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, meanwhile, already have backed away from
plans to reduce gas taxes as a quick way of easing the price
crunch. GOP opponents said there were no guarantees the meager
relief would be passed on to customers, and eliminating the tax
would take billions of dollars from critical road and bridge
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House
Republican, outlined the new House approach in a speech Friday:
attack the Clinton administration's policies as incapable of
reducing U.S. dependency on foreign oil and pass a package of tax
breaks and other legislation to increase domestic oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ''When America looks outside our borders for more and more of
the energy it needs, when we become more and more dependent on
foreign product, we slowly weaken our national security here at
home,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP plan described by Watts would:
</P>
<P>
   --Enact tax credits for marginal or low-producing oil wells,
permit producers to expense geological costs and rental payments on
tax returns and allow independent producers five years to ''carry
back'' past losses on their current tax returns. Other tax
proposals would modify the way oil production is treated by the
alternative minimum tax and scrap limits on net taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   --Open more federal lands to oil production in an environmentally
responsible way, explore the potential of the vast Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and reduce royalties where federal
mineral holdings are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   --Require the Energy Department to report to Congress and
President Clinton by July 4 on recommendations to enhance domestic
oil production.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Lott's proposed gas-tax rollbacks already have
encountered significant opposition from Democrats and Republicans,
even though revenue for highway projects would be replaced by
transferring cash from the projected budget surplus. Sens. John
Warner, R-Va., George Voinovich, R-Ohio, and Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
are among those opposing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to shortchange the American public, and it's
shortsighted,'' Baucus said.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.3-cent rollback has political appeal for Republicans
because Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote that
allowed the increase to pass the Senate seven years ago. Lott would
probably need to get 60 votes to overcome parliamentary roadblocks
in the Senate, however, and that always is difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very skeptical,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle,
D-S.D. ''I wonder where the money comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration insists that Congress, at
administration urging, already passed sufficient tax relief for
domestic oil producers when coupled with the opening of more areas
to production, such as the deeper waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
Also, the administration hopes the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, meeting this week in Vienna, Austria, will
increase production by 2 million barrels a day to bring supply and
demand back into balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for a significant increase,'' said David
Goldwyn, assistant energy secretary for international affairs. ''We
are, and have been, concerned about domestic production.''

<HEADLINE> Working Seniors To Get Refunds  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For thousands of senior citizens who work, the
check will be in the mail soon after legislation lifting the Social
Security earnings limit becomes law, as expected this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are working hard to ensure that Social Security
beneficiaries who are affected by the new law will have money in
their pockets quickly,'' Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, scheduled for final passage in the
Republican-led House on Tuesday, will repeal a Depression-era law
that would reduce Social Security payments by $1 for every $3 a
beneficiary between the ages of 65 and 69 earns in wages over
$17,000. President Clinton said he will sign the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   Because the repeal is retroactive to Jan. 1, about 415,000
working seniors or dependents will get refunds for the money
already deducted this year from their Social Security checks -- a
total of $1.4 billion or an average of $3,500 per person.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton signs the bill by mid-April, Apfel said the checks
should be sent by early May and monthly benefits adjusted by June.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal directly affects 800,000 Social Security recipients
who are working this year and another 100,000 who haven't sought
benefits because they have jobs. With the earnings test eliminated,
Apfel said each of these people could receive an additional $6,700
in Social Security this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 7.5 million people between the ages of 62 and 70
who receive Medicare, Social Security or both will get notices from
the Social Security Administration describing the new law and how
it could affect them.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, said Archer is ''glad the SSA is moving quickly to
make seniors whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer first introduced a bill to repeal the limit in 1970 and
the concept has always had broad support, but until this year it
was always used as a ''sweetener'' added to more controversial
legislation that failed to pass. This year, Democrats and
Republicans alike found the measure irresistible as both parties
court the elderly vote for the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Employers facing a tight job market are also clamoring for more
workers and there are many jobs in retail and services that are a
perfect fit for people over age 65.
</P>
<P>
   ''The earnings test is counterproductive in an economy in which
employers want and need the skills and talents of older workers,''
Apfel said. ''It is an outdated policy.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 5.

<HEADLINE> Russian Centre Shows New Icons  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Religious art was in official disfavor in the
Soviet Union, and American visitors to Soviet Russia often tried to
pick up bargains in painted religious icons, an art form that goes
back more than a millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian Cultural Centre in Washington is lodged in the
building that used to hold the Soviet visa office, where Americans
went for permission to visit Russia. And beginning Monday, the
center will host an exhibit of icons by a painter who carries on
the ancient tradition today, Alexander Sokolov. It's a joint show
with his wife, Maria Veshnyak, who paints in a more recent and
realistic style.
</P>
<P>
   She comes from a family of painters and specializes in
landscape, but her subjects include monasteries, churches and other
religious subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Icon painting in the traditional style continued under the
Soviets, but it was a private thing, like baptism,'' Natalie
Batova, the center's director, said in an interview. ''I was
baptized.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet era, members of the Communist Party had to profess
atheism, and a religious background hindered professional
advancement. Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, made a
career in the KGB, however, even though he was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Now Batova shows off her center's own icon of St. Nicholas,
revered by many Russians as a patron of education. Teaching is
among the center's jobs, and Batova stopped to greet a Russian
language class on the way from her office to the reception room
where the icon hangs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ordered it last year, and when it came in, we couldn't tell
it from an old one,'' she said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Painters base icons on ancient traditions, emphasizing symbolism
and spiritual values. The figures' ritual gestures and stiff
figures make no attempt at realism. The art is being actively
revived and the demand among Russians is so great that schools for
icon painters are being set up.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov entered the movement early when he became founder of a
new school in Poland and has since taught in Japan as well as
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Batova also displayed a Russian Orthodox church calendar for
this year, decorated with reproductions of brightly colored icons
painted by Sokolov.
</P>
<P>
   A biographical note by critic Irina Yazykova calls Sokolov ''one
of the outstanding modern iconographers of Russia.'' She cites an
image of the ''Virgin of the Inexhaustible Cup'' that he painted
for a Russian monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ''This icon became very popular,'' she wrote, ''not only because
this icon heals the illness of drinking but because it is a
creation of heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The icon shows the Virgin Mary, with a cup in front of her and
an image of the child Jesus emerging from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Classical Iconography'' and ''Traditional Russian Realism''
will be at the Russian Cultural Centre, 1835 Phelps Place N.W.,
Washington, until April 6. Admission is $5.

<HEADLINE> White House E-mails Probe Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department criminal prosecutors must
appear in closed session next week to argue for a delay of a court
hearing in a civil lawsuit over missing White House e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth scheduled the closed session
for Thursday after the department argued in court the hearing could
interfere with a criminal investigation that it announced this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said last week that computer errors
made it impossible to search thousands of White House e-mails
covered by subpoenas from congressional officials and grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   The messages also were sought by plaintiffs in the civil case
before Lamberth. Lawyers for the conservative legal organization
Judicial Watch filed the $90 million lawsuit against the government
contending the White House improperly obtained and used FBI
background files.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had been scheduled to respond Friday to
allegations that e-mails related to the files were withheld from
the plaintiffs, who sought a full hearing on the matter with
witness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Justice Department lawyer James Gilligan told Lamberth
the criminal investigation now under way should take precedence
over the civil case. The criminal probe, announced Thursday, will
focus on the missing e-mails and allegations by some contract
employees that they were threatened with arrest if they discussed
the problem publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth said he would not grant ''an open-ended, indefinite
stay'' in the civil case but asked prosecutors to meet in a closed
session Thursday to make their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch's Larry Klayman argued that ''even a stay of one
day would be inappropriate,'' because the Justice Department is
hiding the e-mails ''to get past the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The allegation that our strategy is to delay is false,''
Gilligan responded.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall's Holloway Sits Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Sidelined by a sore ankle, Seton Hall
senior point guard Shaheen Holloway was a helpless spectator Friday
night as Oklahoma State beat the Pirates in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was disappointing to see my team lose because they played
well enough to win,'' Holloway said after the Pirates' 68-66 loss
in the East Regional semifinals. ''It's tough. It's a moment I've
waited for all my life, and not to be able to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who sprained his left ankle early against Temple in a
second-round game, was replaced by backup Ty Shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shine, a sophomore, scored a career-high 26 points, hitting
7-of-11 from 3-point range in Seton Hall's upset of second-seeded
Temple. But he could not come up with that same magic against the
Cowboys, scoring just 11 points on 4-of-16 shooting. Shine also had
seven rebounds and three assists in his first start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said he had about 15 hours of therapy daily to get
ready for the Oklahoma State game. Thursday was his first day
walking without crutches. Although Holloway said he had increased
lateral movement, he did not take part in Thursday's 50-minute
practice.
</P>
<P>
   He did not come out for the start of his team's pre-game warmups
Friday night, emerging from the locker room about 15 minutes later
wearing a sweatsuit with his injured foot in a cushioned boot.
Holloway sat slumped in his chair, chin in hand, watching his
teammates go through their pre-game drill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I found out earlier so I had time to think about not playing.
I shot around and tried to get ready but I knew I couldn't go,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for Holloway, Seton Hall might not have made it as
far as it did.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates defeated Oregon 72-71 in overtime in the first round
when Holloway drove the length of the court and hit a shot high off
the glass for the winning basket with 1.9 seconds remaining.
Holloway finished with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, the Pirates' career assist leader, averaged 13.2
points and 5.6 assists and shot 40 percent (48-of-119) from 3-point
range.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Iranian Hostage Awarded $341M  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former hostage Terry Anderson says he's
pleased by a $341 million damage award Iran was ordered to pay for
his nearly seven years of captivity in Lebanon, even though it's
uncertain whether he will ever be able to collect the money.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's treatment was ''savage and cruel by any civilized
standards,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said
Friday in ordering Iran to pay the damages to Anderson and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Iran to pay $24.5 million to Anderson, $10
million to his wife, Madeleine Bassil, and $6.7 million to their
daughter, Sulome. The judge also ordered the Iranian Ministry of
Information and Security to pay them $300 million in punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the evidence was conclusive that Anderson, then
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was
kidnapped in 1985 and ''imprisoned under deplorable, inhumane
conditions'' by agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran, known as
the Hezbollah, or ''Party of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm delighted with the judgment,'' Anderson said in a
telephone interview. But he was uncertain whether he would ever
receive the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be lovely if we could get the full settlement,'' he
said, adding that the purpose of the lawsuit was ''not to make us
rich but to punish Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls seeking comment from Iran's mission to the United Nations
were not returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson previously ruled Iran in default for failing to defend
against the lawsuit by Anderson, the longest-held American hostage
in Lebanon. Anderson now is a journalism professor at Ohio
University.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling said, ''The ... conduct with which both
defendants (Iran and its ministry) are charged, savage and cruel by
any civilized standards, would surely merit'' an award of punitive
damages intended to punish and deter misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the punitive award is to ''vindicate the interest
of society at large in the collection and dissemination of complete
and accurate information about world conflicts,'' Jackson wrote.
The threat of terrorism makes newsgathering more difficult and
costly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's lawyer, Stuart H. Newberger, said he was happy ''that
Judge Jackson has recognized the serious damage to Mr. Anderson and
his wife and daughter, both physical and emotional. ... All of
American media was hindered and harmed by the targeting of a
leading journalist in one of the hottest areas of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's case was the latest to come to trial under a 1996 law
that allows Americans who are victims of terrorism in foreign
countries to sue in U.S. courts if the State Department lists those
nations as sponsors of terrorism. Iran has been on the list since
1984.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Jackson ordered Iran to pay $65 million in
damages to David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio and Frank Reed, who were
held hostage with Anderson, and to the wives of Cicippio and Reed.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Clinton administration has made it difficult for
them to collect.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress last month, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said the administration was ''looking at various
funds'' containing money owed to Iran that might be tapped. ''But
we have to do it in some way that does not harm our overall foreign
policy interests,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The former hostages contend the United States holds hundreds of
millions of dollars of frozen, non-diplomatic Iranian assets,
including former commercial properties and money from U.S. arms
bought by Iran but never delivered.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Friday, ''There are no assets blocked other than diplomatic
properties,'' and they cannot be touched because of international
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said last week it was time for the United States and
Iran to ''enter a new season in which mutual trust may grow.'' She
said ban on import of carpets and other goods would be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was held captive for 2,454 days, the longest of the
captives in Lebanon. He was abducted at gunpoint in March 1985 and
released in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wrote that Anderson was chained and blindfolded, fed
only bread, cheese and water, moved from cell to cell numerous
times, and feared many times he would be executed.
</P>
<P>
   The evening of his release, he ''saw the stars for the first
time since his capture,'' the judge said. Anderson's wife and child
also suffered as a result of his kidnapping, he added.

<HEADLINE> Homophobia Said Common in Military  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Activists are welcoming efforts to stop
harassment of homosexuals in the military, saying it's about time
officials ''finally acknowledged'' the longstanding problem.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen announced Friday he's creating a
special committee to look into the problem after a Pentagon
inspector general's survey found that anti-gay speech and
harassment is commonplace in the American military, especially
among young enlisted troops.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five percent of those surveyed said they believed
anti-gay comments are tolerated on their base or aboard their ship,
and 37 percent said they had personally witnessed or been the
target of harassment -- such as hostile gestures, graffiti or
physical assault -- based on perceived homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, co-executive director of the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network -- an advocacy group for gays in the military
-- said the results of the survey expose a problem her organization
has sought to draw attention to for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad that Pentagon leaders finally acknowledged that
problem today,'' Benecke said. ''I welcome all serious efforts to
address anti-gay harassment,'' including Cohen's establishment of a
committee to seek new solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Maine Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said she was still reviewing the report but
applauded Cohen's decision to set up the working group ''to assure
fairness in the military ... ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found a widespread belief among troops that the
current ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military --
which Vice President Al Gore says he would eliminate if he were
elected president -- is not working. President Clinton himself has
said the policy, forged by his administration in 1993, is now ''out
of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the new military and civilian panel he's creating
will draft a plan for measures to improve the policy's
implementation. And he put military chiefs on notice as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report shows that military leaders must do more to make it
clear that harassment based on sexual orientation violates military
values,'' Cohen said in a memorandum to the services' civilian and
uniformed leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's policy, set in law by Congress after a
heated political battle, says gays and lesbians may serve in the
military so long as they keep their sexual orientation to
themselves and military commanders may not inquire about it.
Pentagon policy still bars open homosexuals from serving in
uniform. Although the policy was designed to make it easier for
gays to serve, an increasing number have been discharged in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's key findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Eighty percent of the 71,500 members of the Army, Air Force,
Navy and Marine Corps surveyed said they had heard offensive speech
or jokes or derogatory names or remarks about gays in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   --Thirty-three percent said they heard it often. It was reported
most common among junior enlisted troops and most frequently in the
Marine Corps and least in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   --Of the offensive behaviors or actions reported as directed
against gays, offensive speech was the most common. It was
mentioned by 89 percent of those who reported witnessing or
experiencing some form of harassment. Hostile gestures were
reported by 35 percent; threats or intimidation by 20 percent;
graffiti by 15 percent, vandalism of personal property by 7 percent
and physical assault by 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Less than 50 percent said they had received training on the
''don't ask, don't tell'' policy. About 50 percent of all service
members surveyed said they believed the policy was at least
moderately effective at reducing harassment of gays.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen ordered the survey last December. It was done on 38 U.S.
military bases and aboard 10 Navy surface ships and one submarine
from Jan. 24 to Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was forced to take a closer look at how the gay
policy is being implemented after the bludgeoning death last July
of a gay Army private, Barry Winchell, at Fort Campbell, Ky. His
killer, a fellow private, was convicted and sentenced to life in
prison.

<HEADLINE> Papal Visit Spotlights Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel (AP) -- To Christian faithful the world over,
the biblical town of Nazareth is a living shrine, revered as the
place where a virtuous young woman named Mary learned that she
would give birth to the son of God, and where that boy -- Jesus --
grew to manhood.
</P>
<P>
   But for the people of this workaday Arab hill town, old gospel
stories tend to take a back seat to economic worries, religious
tensions and quarrels with the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   So while Pope John Paul II's brief visit here today is giving
rise to a certain amount of civic pride, it's also an occasion for
Nazarenes to air all manner of grudges and grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Sensibilities are still raw after a bitter Muslim-Christian
quarrel over plans to build a large new mosque in the shadow of the
Basilica of the Annunciation, the site where the Bible says the
angel Gabriel appeared to Mary with the news that she would give
birth to Jesus, ''the son of the highest.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's visit is timed to coincide with a Roman Catholic
feast day commemorating the event, and several thousand faithful
were to attend a celebratory papal Mass in the Basilica of the
Annunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Nazareth's Muslim community -- which accounts for more
than two-thirds of the town's population of 70,000 -- said they had
no objection to the papal stop, but that no special concessions,
such as any muting of the call to prayer, would be made.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because we have a big guest, do we stop going to
prayers?'' asked Salman Abu Ahmed, leader of the local Islamic
movement. He said he would have been happy to help greet the pope,
but that no one from the Israeli government or the Vatican had
invited him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are being ignored when we should be respected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ahmed and others, though, said perceived slights by either
side would not necessarily lead to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the eve of the papal visit, about 4,000 worshippers
gathered for noon prayers -- the biggest of the week -- at the site
of the controversial planned mosque. When church bells rang out in
the midst of a reading of Koranic verses, the imam simply waited
for the pealing to end, then continued.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of past tensions, though, Israeli security officials
privately expressed some worries over the Nazareth stop. The pope
was to spend almost all his time inside the basilica, and was being
brought into the city center from his helipad by the shortest
possible route.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the pope's visit to Nazareth prompted some grumbling
from a few rabbis, who complained that making Jewish security
officers work on Saturday was a desecration of the Sabbath, the
biblically mandated day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Some local Christians said they hoped the pope's message of
religious tolerance and peaceful resolution of disputes would be
heeded -- but held out little hope for an improvement in their daily
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel pressure -- there is always a sense of fear,'' said
Suher Mazawi, a Christian souvenir vendor whose shop looks out over
the plaza where the mosque is to be built.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth businessman Taha Mohammed Ali, a Muslim, said he
thought it was too late for reconciliation. ''What happened can't
be mended,'' he said. ''It's like a piece of glass -- when broken,
it can't be whole again.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign visitors who came to try to catch a glimpse of the pope
-- or simply to make a pilgrimage to Nazareth in this millennial
year -- called the tensions unfortunate. But Claudine Wagner, a
38-year-old doctor from Metz, France, saw no reason they should put
a damper on the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a great moment,'' she said. ''I have something in common
with all Christians around the world -- this is the power of it.''

<HEADLINE> Sickened Nuke Workers To Get Money  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Energy Department official says Clinton
administration agencies have resolved their disagreement over
expanding an offer of financial aid to sickened workers at nuclear
weapons plants.
</P>
<P>
   The administration already has proposed a $17 million
compensation offer for some workers who have been fighting serious
illnesses because of on-the-job exposure to dangerous levels of
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But other exposed workers have not yet been offered
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   During a congressional hearing Thursday, Deputy Energy Secretary
T.J. Glauthier confirmed that the idea of expanding the
compensation program had drawn dissent from the Office of
Management and Budget and the Justice and Defense departments. But
as of this week, he said, ''Those agencies have dropped their
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The government does not yet know how many of its weapons plant
workers were sickened over the last 40 years by materials they
handled without proper protection.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has proposed spending $17 million to
compensate:
</P>
<P>
   --Workers at any nuclear weapons facility who contracted deadly
beryllium disease because of contact with that dangerous material.
</P>
<P>
   --Workers at the Paducah (Ky.) Gaseous Diffusion Plant who were
exposed to plutonium and other radioactive materials.
</P>
<P>
   --Some Oak Ridge, Tenn., workers who contracted radiation-related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The offer did not include Paducah's sister plant in Piketon,
Ohio, prompting an outcry from workers there who suffer from cancer
and other illnesses that can be caused by radiation exposure.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning Glauthier before the House Commerce
Committee's energy and power subcommittee, Rep. Ted Strickland,
D-Ohio, whose district includes Piketon, said he was still unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier ''still would not say definitively, unambiguously,
that this compensation package would be extended to the Piketon
workers,'' Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier said the Energy Department moved quickly upon
confirming that Paducah workers were exposed to dangerous levels of
plutonium but were never warned or given any special protection.
</P>
<P>
   The department is still examining the extent to which some
plutonium-laced uranium was handled at the Piketon plant, and the
repercussions to workers' health.
</P>
<P>
   So much evidence of Paducah exposure was available, Glauthier
said, ''We felt we could propose compensation at the Paducah site.
The question was, should we delay and do both later.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine H.S. Weary of Attention  </HEADLINE>
By DAN ELLIOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The first anniversary of the Columbine
High School massacre will be a very public affair.
</P>
<P>
   Although the families, students and others in the Columbine
community are hoping for a quiet remembrance, authorities are
bracing for a crowd of up to 100,000 for services in the Denver
area April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kaufman of the Jefferson County School District said the
crowd estimate is based on the turnout in Oklahoma City for the
first anniversary of the 1995 federal building bombing that left
168 dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to say it would be a lot less than that, but we just
don't know,'' he said. ''This is a story that will not go away.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the nation's worst incident of school violence. Dylan
Klebold and Eric Harris killed 12 classmates and a teacher before
taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very public, horrible murder, and it's been public
for a whole year, and I think in a way it will help the world to
see Columbine again a year later. And then maybe we can move on,''
said Sue Petrone, whose son, Daniel Rohrbough, was one of those
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events will include a school assembly for students and
staff, a public remembrance at the Capitol in Denver and a
community service and candlelight vigil in Clement Park, near the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens will call for a statewide moment of silence at
11:21 a.m., the moment the attack began.
</P>
<P>
   ''The program was designed, first, to let the kids have some
privacy in the morning,'' said the Rev. Don Marxhausen, a member of
a panel of students, teachers, parents and others working on the
anniversary plans.
</P>
<P>
   The planning has been difficult for those who have been in the
media spotlight since the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know a lot of kids who have been hounded by the press. They
are really sick of it,'' said student body president Mike Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and TV crews have to find a delicate balance between
being sensitive to victims and getting the story, said Bob Steele,
ethics program director at the Poynter Institute, a journalism
education center in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's inescapable that journalists intrude to some extent on
the private space and the sensibilities of people who are still
grieving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said many students wanted to exclude the public from
the anniversary events so they could hold a quiet remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people, particularly those most directly impacted, feel
very traumatized by some of the things they have read, some of the
things they have seen and the continual barrage, as they feel it,
of the media,'' said Jo Anne Doherty of the Jefferson Center for
Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   On the anniversary, classes will be canceled and attendance at
the assembly will be optional for students and staff. After the
assembly, students and staff will be allowed to wander through the
building, to ''be where they want to be,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for the day is ''A Time to Remember, a Time to Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, victims' families and educators have pleaded for
restraint and understanding from the public and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're sitting in your living room and watching
television, and I know this from personal experience, and you see
flashes of Columbine, and for me, people running past my lifeless
son lying on the sidewalk, it can be very traumatizing,'' said
Petrone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would do all of us a lot of good if we did not have to look
at the two individuals who destroyed and shattered so many lives.''

Former Hostage Awarded $341M
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former hostage Terry Anderson says he's pleased by a $341
million damage award Iran was ordered to pay for his nearly seven years of
captivity in Lebanon, even though it's uncertain whether he will ever be able to
collect the money. Anderson's treatment was ''savage and cruel by any civilized
standards,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said Friday in ordering
Iran to pay the damages to Anderson and his family. The judge ordered Iran to
pay $24.5 million to Anderson, $10 million to his wife, Madeleine Bassil, and
$6.7 million to their daughter, Sulome. The judge also ordered the Iranian
Ministry of Information and Security to pay them $300 million in punitive
damages.

spokesman Armando said. Gutierrez said family members will meet with their
lawyer over the weekend to discuss the case. Earlier Friday, lawyers for the
6-year-old boy's Miami relatives had proposed the appointment of an independent
arbitrator to determine if sending Elian back to Cuba or allowing him to stay
here would be better for the child. But Doris Meissner, commissioner of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, rejected the idea.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Microsoft Corp. faxed a detailed proposal to

judge warned he will deliver his verdict Tuesday absent progress in secret
settlement talks in Chicago, people close to the case said. Government lawyers
decided the proposal did not merit flying to Chicago on Saturday, said the
sources. Dow Jones news service, citing anonymous sources, reported late Friday
that Microsoft agreed to separate its Internet browser software from its
dominant Windows operating system. The government has alleged that Microsoft
illegally bundled its browser software with Windows to compete with software

Clinton Urging Peace in South Asia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Concerned about terrorism, security is tight as
President Clinton visits Pakistan on Saturday to urge a retreat from nuclear
weapons and a lowering of dangerous tensions with India. The president will
spend just five hours in Pakistan -- after spending five days in India -- a sign
of U.S. unhappiness about Gen. Pervez Musharraf's October coup and his refusal
to set a timetable for national elections and a return to democracy. For its
part, India rejected Clinton's plea to sign a nuclear test ban. The same outcome
is likely in Pakistan, at least in the immediate future, White House officials

<HEADLINE> Of Biblical Curses and Sainted Fish  </HEADLINE>
By HUGH A. MULLIGAN, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   KORAZIM, Israel (AP) -- In handouts and bus schedules, government
press officials invariably referred to the site of the pope's Mass
on the Mount of the Beatitudes as ''Korazim.'' They probably were
seeking a better modern image for the town that Matthew says Jesus
cursed and promised a worse final judgment than Sodom for ignoring
his teachings after he cured the blind and sick there.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims and press trudging to the altar site through the mud
after heavy rain and some sleet soaked the lovely hillside
overlooking the Sea of Galilee may have been reminded of the Gospel
words ''Woe unto thee Korazim.'' The weather delayed the Mass there
by an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chill and the mud, nearly 100,000 came to the
hillside where Jesus, trying to escape the crowds, preached his
Sermon on the Mount to an audience of only 12 faithful followers.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On the way back from the Galilee to Jerusalem, the Pope first
had to contend with a religiously correct logistical problem: Who
would fly him on the Sabbath? The Air Force is not permitted to
violate the sanctity of the day, except for an actual combat
mission. With the wisdom of Solomon, rabbis and government
officials decided to make the pilot a cop for the day, since the
law allows the police to go about their rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The heavy rains that soaked the Galilee hillside where John Paul
II celebrated Mass may have answered the prayers of local
fishermen. They grumble their catch has not been very good lately
because a two-year drought has shrunk the fresh water Sea of
Galilee to its lowest level in over a century. Their most
marketable catch among the 40 species in the six-mile long lake is
still St. Peter's fish, named for the Gospel passage about Peter,
at the bidding of Jesus, hauling in a trout-sized fish with a coin
in its mouth to pay the Temple tax.
</P>
<P>
   The sainted fish was reported to be on the menu for the lunch
Franciscan nuns served the pontiff after the Mass. Then the man
wearing the shoes of the fisherman made his way along the shore
where Jesus, in the Gospel accounts, performed many of his deeds.
There, the accounts say, Jesus recruited his first Apostles, fed a
crowd of 5,000 with five barley loaves and two fishes, calmed
torrential waves, walked on water and cooked breakfast for his
disciples after ordering Peter, who had had no luck all night, to
lower his nets once more, resulting in a catch of 156 good-sized
fish.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that breakfast, so the faithful affirm, that Jesus
chose Peter as the first pope of his church. Now, two millennia
later, Peter's successor made a painful pilgrimage, hobbling on a
cane, to pray at the lovely lakeside chapels memorializing these
Gospel passages. His last stop in Galilee was at Capernaum, the
reputed site of Peter's house, which Jesus used as the headquarters
of his early ministry after curing the fisherman's mother-in-law of
a chronic fever.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''NO SHORTS, NO DECOLLETAGE'': The Pope encountered such signs
at several shrines and monasteries along the way. Franciscan Rev.
Xavier Geiser, from Hamilton, Ohio, who has spent most of his
priestly life in the Holy Land, wishes that warnings to pilgrims to
dress modestly were less bluntly worded: ''We friars joke that some
tour groups get so confused the men get back into the bus and take
off their jockey shorts.'' In the chilly weather, the problem of
appropriate attire never came up.

<HEADLINE> Thousands gather for farewell to Patrick Dorismond  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sobs drifted through a Brooklyn funeral home as
more than 2,000 people paid their respects to Patrick Dorismond,
the unarmed man fatally shot last week during a scuffle with an
undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
   A largely Haitian crowd of family, friends and supporters
attended Dorismond's wake Friday at the Andrew Torregrossa and Sons
Funeral Home. Dorismond, 26, was the son of one of Haiti's most
beloved singers, Andre Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   His corpse dressed in a white suit, Dorismond was surrounded by
about 20 large flower arrangements, many in the shape of crosses or
hearts. The name ''Patrick'' was spelled out in green and white
flowers above the coffin and a large wooden crucifix hung nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The somber atmosphere changed as the number of mourners grew,
becoming louder and more outspoken with Haitian flags flying above
the crowd. Some protesters called for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
resignation over his controversial response to the death.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has come under fire for releasing information from
Dorismond's police record, including sealed juvenile files, and for
not visiting Dorismond's family. Giuliani did not attend the wake.
</P>
<P>
   One mourner, Blaise Lambre, described Dorismond as ''a person
who just enjoyed life,'' and he blamed Giuliani for failing to show
sympathy for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Picture somebody you grew up with, played in the same building
with, did everything with,'' Lambre said. ''I'm angry at the fact
that he died ... It was wrong. To me, it's murder, simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, who worked as a security guard, was shot during a
scuffle with police in Manhattan last week after an undercover
officer allegedly approached him as part of a drug sting.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Rodney, co-chairman of Haitian-American Alliance, said
the family was ''weak and broken over this,'' but had put aside
their anger for a time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very solemn and mournful moment and we're all just
grieving,'' Rodney said.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Al Sharpton and police brutality victim Abner Louima, a
Haitian immigrant, were among those at the wake.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has happened too much and it's only happening in our
community,'' said Sharpton. ''We must ask God to give us strength
that in Patrick's name this can stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton led a prayer and spoke directly with the Dorismond
family. ''We've come tonight to share your pain but we commit that
we will fight with you until we get justice,'' he said. ''Some of
us were born in Haiti, some were born in Brooklyn, some in Alabama,
but we are all in the same boat now.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the funeral home, about 500 protesters
voiced their anger over Giuliani's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Giuliani must go'' the crowd shouted as they carried signs
with sayings including ''Justice for Patrick Dorismond'' and ''Down
with racism.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters spilled into the street for some time, blocking
traffic as they waved signs and chanted.
</P>
<P>
   At the wake, City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who is considering a
run for mayor, said he had met with the Dorismond's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every decent New Yorker feels most deeply the loss of this
family,'' he said. ''This is a heartbreaking time.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Seigel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said Giuliani should have been there too.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a difficult moment for the city. It's a time for us to
reflect, to pray, to wonder why we're so divided,'' Seigel said.
''The mayor of the city of New York should be here tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Neighbors Fight Shooting Range  </HEADLINE>
By GILLIAN FLYNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- When a bullet pierced the wall of
the game room in her home and narrowly missed a 10-year-old boy's
head, Dawn Ruel's first thought was: drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet, however, was from a shooting range nearly a mile
away.
</P>
<P>
   Stray bullets have found their way into garage and living room
walls in the secluded subdivision of cul-de-sacs where Reul lives
in the village of Peace Dale.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been hurt. Still, the town wants to permanently shut
down the 51-year-old site over the objections of the owner and they
have asked the General Assembly for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep getting bullets embedded in our houses and they could
be embedded in one of our children's heads,'' Reul said. ''A lot of
people are frantic here.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Frisella, owner of the Peace Dale Shooting Preserve,
voluntarily closed the site in December after a series of heated
town meetings. He wants to reopen at least one rifle range before
hunting season in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want me to make it 100 percent safe,'' Frisella said.
''There is no such thing as 100 percent safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The property was rural and undeveloped when the range opened.
Hundreds of homes have been built within a couple of miles of the
property since.
</P>
<P>
   The subdivision where Reul lives was developed five years ago
and residents were told to expect to rifle shots. They didn't
expect the bullets; four have been found lodged in houses in recent
years and at least two came from the firing range.
</P>
<P>
   The 210-acre preserve has four shooting ranges. Banks, some of
them 35 feet tall, are behind each range and patrons are supposed
to aim into the banks to keep bullets from straying, but some have
ricocheted.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a hidden agenda here,'' said Rick Wilson, a hunter
and longtime patron of the range. ''People are using this as an
excuse for noise abatement.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has no oversight over shooting ranges. National Rifle
Association guidelines are followed voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   At South Kingstown's request, state lawmakers have filed
legislation that would create a licensing system for the ranges,
providing some government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the town plans to go to court if necessary to keep
the range shut down until a full safety inspection is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Resident Kevin Plummer acknowledges the shooting range was there
first, but says no business should be valued more than human life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm convinced that an outdoor shooting range that discharges
more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition in the course of a year is
just never going to be safe in the midst of a residential
community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kitchen Musical a Hit in S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
BY SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- On stage, four chefs chop, slice and
dice. Bits of cabbage and onions fly. Pots boil, and soon a cooking
aroma fills the theater.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than culinary tips in an oddball South Korean
musical called ''Nanta,'' or ''Wild Beating.'' The performers beat
knives and kettles, pots and pans -- just about any utensil found in
a kitchen -- to a frenzied, infectious rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a huge hit in South Korea. Under the title
''Cookin''', it has played well in Tokyo, Disney World in Florida
and Scotland's Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and producers are setting
their sights on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe our show has a universal appeal because the kitchen
is a natural place for percussion music. There, you can find more
items to beat than anywhere else,'' said director Choi Chul-ki, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Nanta echoes ''Stomp,'' an American show in which performers
fashion music with trash cans, broomsticks and other items from
city streets.
</P>
<P>
   While ''Stomp'' is built around a distinctive African-American
beat, ''Nanta'' borrows its heart-thumping rhythm from Korea's
lively -- but fading -- traditional farmers' percussive music.
</P>
<P>
   The rhythms are unique to Korea and have deep roots in the
country's villages. Decades ago, anthropologists found rural
housewives used the rhythms when they ironed clothes by pounding
them on rocks with sticks. Similar beats were heard when maids
chopped with knives while preparing a village feast.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of the 80-minute musical is simple. A restaurant
manager gives his three chefs one hour to prepare a wedding banquet
with the help, or handicap, of the manager's bumbling cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in loose traditional cotton outfits, the chefs make a
solemn bow before a gargoyle-like Korean kitchen god. Then they sit
and tease delicate beats out of rice bowls with chopsticks and
spoons.
</P>
<P>
   When the show gets rolling, the cooks appear in sleeveless
T-shirts and barrel through rhythms with cleavers and knives on
chopping blocks, water-cooler bottles and trash cans at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   Butcher knives flash in strobes. Vegetables fly everywhere,
sometimes into spectators' laps. A rock band booms.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was especially difficult to find rhythms with kitchen
gadgets because they did not have the kind of elasticity that
traditional instruments have,'' said Cho Hae-sun, 29, who plays a
female chef.
</P>
<P>
   Nanta is a stark departure from traditional Korean musical
shows, which emphasize grace and decorum.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Korean nobles stressed the delicate ritual of cuisine,
and they celebrated with musicians who twanged sleepy tunes on
zithers, spinning out oration that could last hours.
</P>
<P>
   Nanta gets inspiration from a different crowd: the irreverent
festivals thrown in villages to mark the autumn harvest, when
farmers would engage in vulgar clowning, jokes at landlords and
bang crudely built drums and gongs.
</P>
<P>
   True to that tradition, Nanta adds a hearty helping of circus
and slapstick comedy. Chefs juggle dishes, breathe fire and joust
with broom sticks.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, two chefs argue over who should dispose of the
trash. The rubbish bag lands in the laps of people sitting in the
most expensive seats of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Nanta debuted in late 1997 and has attracted 350,000 viewers to
become one of the longest-running shows in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so Korean and at the same time very modern. I came with
my son and his children, and all of us loved it thoroughly,'' said
Choi Bong-shik, a 65-year-old taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out with four performers, the show has recruited 10
more young actors so performances can be staged simultaneously at
different locations.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Nanta will start touring in Asia, Europe and the United
States. The musical's creator, PMC Whan Performance, is negotiating
to take the musical to Broadway early next year.

<HEADLINE> More Ugandans Found Dead  </HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Buried in the dirt floor of an abandoned
house, police have found a new horror linked to a Ugandan doomsday
cult: the hacked and strangled bodies of 153 people, including 59
children.
</P>
<P>
   The house was 20 miles away from the cult's compound, where at
least 330 members died in a fire March 17 in a makeshift church --
deaths authorities first believed were a mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the latest discovery at one of four sites being
investigated, authorities are treating all the deaths as homicides.
And they say some of the cult's leaders may have escaped.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was definitely murder,'' chief police spokesman Assuman
Mugenyi said after the bodies -- which apparently were buried six
weeks ago -- were found Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police had at first thought the adult victims in the church
inferno were willing participants, and had considered only the 78
children who died there murder victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''But now we have discovered these people who were murdered.
Things have changed,'' Mugenyi told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The house where the 153 bodies were found is near the
southwestern town of Rukungiri and had been used as a meeting place
for members of the sect, known as the Movement for the Restoration
of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Police went to the house as part of a nationwide investigation
into the cult's properties and activities.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, they found three mass graves dug into the dirt floor of
two rooms. Some victims were strangled, others hacked to death.
</P>
<P>
   After they had been examined by pathologists, the bodies were
reburied in two mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   Police were continuing to investigate other districts where the
sect was believed to have branches. Mugenyi said the group had
branches in at least four districts in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The police spokesman said it was still not known if the cult's
leaders were among the dead from the fire in Kanungu, 220 miles
southwest of the Ugandan capital, Kampala. If they were still alive
they have probably left the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated death toll in the March 17 blaze has ranged from
150 to 600, and the cause has been attributed to gasoline, a bomb
or both. Later, six bodies were found in a nearby pit latrine.
</P>
<P>
   Minister of State for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi, who
visited Kanungu on Wednesday, said two top sect leaders may not
have died in the inferno as had initially been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Cledonia Mwerinde, a 40-year-old former prostitute, and Joseph
Kibweteere, 68, who was also known as ''the prophet,'' may both
have left the compound before the fire, Mbabazi said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a 17-year-old cult member who had slipped away from the
church before the fire said Kibweteere was not there at the time.
Local residents also reported seeing Mwerinde leave the compound,
Mbabazi said.
</P>
<P>
   Two leaders' bodies have been positively identified -- the
manager of the sect's farm and ''a priest.'' A number of the
group's leaders were former Roman Catholic priests, lay workers and
nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Various reports put sect membership anywhere between 1,000 and
5,000 in Uganda, a country of 21 million. The group was legally
registered as a non-governmental organization.

<HEADLINE> New Deadline for Elian's Relatives  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal government issued a new ultimatum to
Elian Gonzalez's Florida relatives Friday, telling them they have
until noon Monday to agree to a speedy appeals process -- or the boy
will be returned to Cuba, the family spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez said family members will meet with their
lawyer over the weekend to discuss the case. Beyond that, Gutierrez
said: ''We will not comment right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The government had issued an ultimatum on Thursday to the
relatives: agree to a speedy timetable for their appeal of a
federal court decision against them or the agency would
''immediately move to revoke'' Elian's status in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a federal official close to the case confirmed
that the new conditions from the Justice Department give the
family's lawyers until April 3 to file an expedited appeal. The
previous deadline had been March 31.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the boy's relatives do not agree to the new
deadline, the federal government will begin the process Thursday of
returning Elian to his father in Cuba, according to the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials dealing with the case and Elian's family and
their attorneys were to meet on Tuesday -- only if the family
rejects the April 3 deadline -- to discuss ''the return of Elian to
his father,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno confirmed a new deadline and
repeated that ''our goal is to reunite Elian with his father in a
fair, prompt and orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of this moment , (the boy's Miami relatives) have not
agreed to comply with these terms,'' Reno said in a statement
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to try to reach an agreement with Elian's
Miami relatives ...'' she concluded, offering no details of the
Monday deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, lawyers for the 6-year-old boy's Miami relatives
had proposed the appointment of an independent arbitrator to
determine if sending Elian back to Cuba or allowing him to stay
here would be better for the child. Attorneys for the Florida
relatives said an arbitration process could begin April 3 and be
completed within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an option that we are prepared to entertain,'' she
said. ''Our goal here is to reunite Elian with his father and to do
that as quickly, as promptly and as orderly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatums came in the wake of a federal judge's decision
this week affirming the U.S. government's decision to send the boy
back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal to the INS, attorney Kendall Coffey said the
boy's relatives had offered to abide by an arbitrator's decision.
Coffey suggested former Sen. Bob Dole or Sen. George Mitchell for
the position.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the INS would agree at last to provide a day in court to
this small child, the result would be not only a fair determination
of what's right for Elian, but a much faster resolution than is
possible through further court battles,'' Coffey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the denial by INS officials, Coffey said the
family's appeal of the federal court ruling would be filed by April
3.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, journalists and other observers criticized the
arbitration offer, saying it was another attempt to draw out the
boy's U.S. stay. During a live roundtable program broadcast by
Cuban state television, panel members also said they were
disappointed the boy's time in the United States could now be
extended for at least three more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida on Nov.
25. His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat capsized
during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The case quickly became a tug-of-war between the Cuban
government and U.S. family members who oppose the Cuban
government's Communist ideology and want to raise the boy.

<HEADLINE> NRC blasts, Con Ed defends 1997 inspection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says
Consolidated Edison's 1997 inspection of its Indian Point 2 nuclear
power plant was weak and incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   But Con Edison defended the inspection Friday, saying it was
''thorough and prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRC, in a document available on its Web site, also cited Con
Ed's ''particularly inadequate'' assessment of the tubes in the
plant's steam generators -- one of which cracked last month, leading
to a minor release of radioactive steam.
</P>
<P>
   The accident shut down the plant and prompted the first alert in
its 26-year history.
</P>
<P>
   In a report called a ''lessons-learned evaluation,'' Ashok
Thadani, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory
Research, said that if Con Ed had done a more thorough job, it
would have been able to predict ''an increased probability of tube
leakage or rupture'' by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The report is part of the NRC's examination of its own actions
in granting Con Ed extra time between inspections. An inspection
that had been scheduled for June 1999 was put off, at Con Ed's
request, for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Before granting the request, the NRC asked Con Ed to project how
well its equipment would be working in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, according to the report, Con Ed simply assumed that
since structural integrity was fine at the inspection in 1997, it
would be fine at the next inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the report says, ''the physics of the process and
service experience suggest that both the number of cracks and their
rate of growth will increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The February leak is being blamed on water stress corrosion
cracking -- superheated, highly pressurized water corroding the
nickel-alloy tube from the inside. According to the NRC, Con Ed
concluded last year that the rate of growth in stress corrosion
cracks first found in 1997 ''would be considered minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This conclusion is not credible,'' the NRC said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed spokesman Joseph Petta said Friday that its 1997
inspection ''used the most sophisticated technology and analysis
available at the time. ... We submitted all required inspection
documentation, which was reviewed and subsequently approved. We
believe all our actions were thorough and prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   A public meeting at the Indian Point plant in Buchanan has been
scheduled for Wednesday night, during which the NRC will release
findings on what happened the day of the leak and how Con Ed
responded. The investigation into the cause of the leak is being
done by a separate NRC team.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hopes To Ease Asia Tension  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Worried about the risk of war in South
Asia, President Clinton headed for a diplomatically difficult visit
to Pakistan on Saturday to urge a retreat from nuclear weapons and
a lowering of dangerous tensions with India.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the airport at the end of the week's wide travels in
India, Clinton made a brief stop at a school for blind children in
Bombay. He spent a few minutes greeting children, then reboarded
his motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   After five days in India, the president was spending just five
hours in Pakistan -- a clear sign of U.S. unhappiness about Gen.
Pervez Musharraf's October coup and his refusal to a set a
timetable for national elections and a return to democracy. Clinton
had considered skipping Pakistan but decided to make a quick stop
to raise U.S. concerns with an old ally.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism is high on the list of concerns, prompting intense
security for Clinton's visit. Military jeeps with mounted machine
guns patrolled Islamabad and troops stood guard throughout the
capital. An estimated 5,000 soldiers and thousands more police were
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first presidential trip to Pakistan since Richard
Nixon's in 1969. Clinton will be allowed to address the Pakistani
people on live television after he meets Musharraf at a government
building in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plea for restraint in Pakistan is the same message he
brought to India -- with little apparent result. India rejected
Clinton's plea to sign a nuclear test ban and begin to give up its
nuclear program. The same outcome is likely in Pakistan, at least
in the immediate future, White House officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult for either country to do something that is
perceived as for us, a gift to the United States,'' a senior
administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   At his final stop in India, Clinton said, ''Friends don't have
to agree on every issue. They just have to have an honest
relationship about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombay gave Clinton a glimpse of the crushing poverty in which
hundreds of millions of Indians live. His motorcade rode by slums
where families stood atop shacks with rusty, corrugated tin roofs
in hopes of seeing the president. He stopped at a workshop for the
blind to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a remarkable week,'' Clinton told business
leaders at Bombay's stock market. He said the United States and
India had built ''a new partnership on a higher level'' after 22
years of strain since the last presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he found within India the seeds of a brighter
future for the developing world -- examples of women progressing
toward equality, different races and castes getting along and new
technology driving hopes for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He urged India to lead the way ''away from the proliferation of
dangerous weapons, toward the proliferation of new ideas, new
companies and new technologies, away from the kind of racial and
ethnic tensions that we see in the trouble spots in South Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's whirlwind tour of the subcontinent, which included an
opening stop in Bangladesh, was taking a toll. He appeared to nod
off before speaking in Hyderabad, a high-tech city, and then
delivered an address in Bombay with his hand propped up against his
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had branded South Asia perhaps the most dangerous place
in the world because of the nuclear rivalry between India and
Pakistan and a half-century feud over the Himalayan territory of
Kashmir that has triggered two wars.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are higher than ever now because India and Pakistan
both conducted nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are worried that border skirmishes could escalate
into war -- particularly if Pakistan is emboldened by a false belief
that the United States would step in on its side. Pakistan has been
a steady ally of the United States, particularly during the Cold
War when it was a front-line state for U.S.-backed Afghan
resistance fighters who were battling the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, smaller and economically weaker than India, wants the
United States to mediate the Kashmir dispute. India opposes the
idea, and Clinton says he cannot intervene unless help is requested
by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration specifically wants Pakistan to move
toward democracy, renew dialogue with India over Kashmir, combat
terrorism, help end regional violence and de-escalate its nuclear
program.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Plan To Shift Aides  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Their presidential nominations assured, Al
Gore and George W. Bush are planning to shift some of their
campaign aides to the national political parties, paring their own
payrolls while packing the committees with loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   While spokesmen for both campaigns said it hasn't been decided
which staffers will be transferred, party officials said Bush
finance director Donald Evans and top Gore strategist Michael
Whouley were likely to move. A top Gore fund-raiser, Eileen
Kotecki, also is likely to shift to the Democratic National
Committee, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Republican consultant Ed Gillespie said candidates want
the parties to be populated with people they know.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know your approach to the campaign, you want to reward
loyalty to people who were with you in the toughest of times, and
they helped you win and secure the nomination,'' Gillespie said.
''You have faith in their abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   By moving campaign staff to the parties, both candidates can
reduce their payrolls and spending. It's especially important for
Gore. Unlike Bush, the vice president accepted federal funds for
his campaign and therefore can spend no more than $40.5 million
during the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the presidential candidates can ensure that their
supporters are in control of the party apparatus, with its
multimillion-dollar campaign treasury and its legions of
grass-roots activists. In the closing weeks of the 1996 campaign,
some top Republican officials appeared to write off presidential
nominee Bob Dole's chances and to shift their attention to
protecting the GOP majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns also plan to transfer their fund-raisers to the
parties. The Democrats hope to raise $100 million and the
Republicans $172 million this year, much of it to be spent on issue
ads on behalf of their presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Evans helped Bush smash all fund-raising records, bringing in
more than $73 million for the campaign. Kotecki and veteran
fund-raiser Peter Knight are expected to lend their talents to the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the eventual transfer of campaign staff, the DNC
had reserved slots in advance. Because Gore has been vice president
since 1993, he has already worked with the party hierarchy and most
of the current officials are expected to remain in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a hostile takeover, it's a friendly merger,''
Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said.
</P>
<P>
   DNC General Chairman Ed Rendell, for example, accompanied Gore
on a fund-raising tour Thursday. At a luncheon in Cincinnati, Gore
heaped praise on Rendell, a former mayor of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He used to be called America's mayor,'' Gore said. ''Now,
maybe, we should call him America's chairman. He's doing a
tremendous job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign aides are discussing who will move to the
Republican National Committee and which positions they will occupy
there. A senior Bush adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the governor's loyalists will eventually head every major RNC
department, though chairman Jim Nicholson and other top party
officials will not be asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a natural merging of the nominee and the party
organizations as you become the nominee,'' Bush campaign
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. ''It's important to have a united
team for the 2000 election.''
</P>
<P>
   As an added incentive to ensure that the party hierarchy is full
of candidate loyalists, all the Bush campaign needs to do is look
at 1996, when polls showed Dole heading for defeat. Some GOP
leaders turned their attention from the presidential campaign to
the congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since Dole won the nomination, I've been saying our first goal
is to elect Bob Dole president. But it's not our only priority,''
then-RNC chairman Haley Barbour said. ''If Clinton is re-elected,
heaven forbid, the last thing the American people want is for him
to have a blank check in the form of a liberal Democrat Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Replica of 'Amistad' To Sail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MYSTIC, Conn. (AP) -- More than 160 years after the slave ship
Amistad was commandeered by its 53 African captives, a replica of
the schooner is ready to tour the world spreading the story.
</P>
<P>
   The 129-foot schooner was to be launched today into the Mystic
River before American and Sierra Leone dignitaries and descendants
of the Amistad captives, whose story was told in a 1997 Steven
Spielberg movie.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was to be christened with water from Cuba, Long Island,
N.Y., and Sierra Leone, all locales where the Amistad sailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It symbolizes not only the historic effort for freedom but the
struggle that remains for us to make our society and world a better
place for our children,'' said Clifton E. Graves Jr., a board
member of Amistad America, the nonprofit organization in charge of
the project.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year, $3.1 million reconstruction -- aided by a $2.5
million state bond-- took place at the Mystic Seaport, a replica of
a 19th century New England seaport.
</P>
<P>
   The slaves took control of the original Amistad near Cuba in
1839 and tried to force the two Spaniards who had bought them in a
Havana slave market to sail them back to Africa. The ship wandered
up the East Coast before landing on Long Island. The slaves were
jailed and several trials followed.
</P>
<P>
   An 1841 U.S. Supreme Court ruling freed the slaves, whose cause
had been taken up by white abolitionists and former President John
Quincy Adams. The 35 Africans who survived returned to their
homeland in 1842.
</P>
<P>
   The replica will begin sea trials June 1 and make its maiden
voyage to New York City on July 2. Voyages abroad are being
planned.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Probe Mars Gore Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New criminal investigations of Al Gore's fund
raising and his campaign chairman are increasing legal problems for
the vice president's White House bid at a time when he is
vulnerable on ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   Likely Republican nominee George W. Bush snapped up the
opportunity to argue that probes of Tony Coelho and missing White
House e-mail messages make the best argument for a change of
command.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way to make sure we get rid of all these
investigations is to change administrations,'' Bush said Friday in
Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fired back warning shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you set yourself up as a holier-than-thou politician, it
doesn't take a very big pinprick to deflate you,'' said Democratic
consultant Dane Strother. ''If George Bush is going to throw
stones, he better make certain he's in no way in a glass house.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pair of developments could add to Gore's vulnerability
among voters on ethical matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will resonate with previous scandals of the Clinton
administration that they want to hear less about,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho is under a criminal investigation being handled jointly
by the Justice Department's public integrity section and the State
Department inspector general, according to an administration
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's lawyer, Stanley Brand, said the former California
congressman is being investigated for financial transactions he
made while serving as head of the U.S. exhibition at the Expo 98
world's fair in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   With a $300,000 personal loan, Coelho built a
Portuguese-American memorial wall sculpture and formed the
Luso-American Wave Foundation to help repay the costs. A State
Department inspector general's report said taxpayers could be
responsible for any unpaid bills and cited mismanagement of the
pavilion by Coelho and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   At a Macomb, Mich., middle school Friday, Gore spoke in support
of his campaign chairman. ''Tony Coelho is doing a terrific job day
after day. He will continue to do a terrific job,'' he said,
declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Coelho said he had no immediate plans to leave the
campaign. Then the House Democratic whip, he quit Congress in 1989
amid questions about his personal financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   In a case even closer to Gore, court papers this week made
public the Justice Department's criminal inquiry into White House
computer breakdowns that made it impossible to search thousands of
incoming e-mails in response to law enforcement and congressional
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, by Justice's campaign fund-raising task
force, will focus on the missing 1996-99 e-mails and allegations
that White House officials threatened contract employees with
retaliation if they revealed the problem, the court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that ethics issues could be a problem for
Gore in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Pew poll, more than half the respondents said that
if they were told Gore took part in unethical fund-raising
practices during the 1996 presidential campaign they would be less
likely to vote for him. Four in 10 said that if they were told Gore
was part of a scandal-ridden Clinton administration they would be
less likely to support him.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some voters felt that by electing Gore they would be
perpetuating continuing investigations and continuing questions
about ethics and whether wrongdoing occurred, they would probably
vote for Bush,'' said Kohut, the poll director.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president inherits questions about the Clinton-Gore
campaign's fund-raising in 1996. A federal jury's recent conviction
of Gore friend Maria Hsia for arranging more than $100,000 in
illegal donations during that campaign resurrected the issue --
including the vice president's attendance at a political
fund-raiser in a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not free of fund-raising questions, either. The Texas
governor, who has raised a record $73 million, stumbled over news
during the primaries that his supporters, Sam and Charles Wyly,
spent $2 million -- under the name Republicans for Clean Air -- on
attack ads against Republican rival John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show, however, that better than half of the
respondents still consider both Bush and Gore honest and
trustworthy.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Seeks New Ties With U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- For nearly a quarter-century, Egypt has
received billions of dollars in American aid -- first in return for
making peace with Israel and later for nudging other Arabs to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the Middle East peace process Egypt pioneered in the 1970s
may be nearing completion, leaving the most populous Arab state to
ponder a new niche for itself that would safeguard its pivotal role
in the region and maintain U.S. support.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel makes peace with Syria and Lebanon, quieting the last
active Arab-Israeli war front, the focus of America's foreign
policy will likely shift -- and Egypt's visibility in Washington
will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian commentators say President Hosni Mubarak is looking to
reshape relations with his largest foreign backer. Mubarak, who has
visited the White House nearly 30 times since his first trip in
February 1982, left Friday for Washington. He was to meet with
President Clinton on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in the interest of the American and Egyptian sides to
formulate a new basis for their relations -- one that respects the
interests of both and broadens areas of agreement,'' Makram
Mohammed Ahmed, editor of the pro-government weekly magazine
al-Mussawar, wrote Thursday. His writings are believed to reflect
Mubarak's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining close ties with the United States has long been at
the heart of Egyptian policymaking. American economic and military
aid since the late 1970s has oiled the country's transition from a
socialist, centrally planned economy to a buzzing emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   But John Voll, a Middle East expert at Washington's Georgetown
University, said Egypt must prepare itself for aid cuts and for
more scrutiny of its human rights record. Egypt now receives $2
billion in annual U.S. aid, second only to Israel's $2.88 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up to this point, most Americans, I think, have been quite
happy to see Egypt as an absolutely essential part of the peace
process,'' Voll said. ''But once the peace process is over, reports
of significant human rights violations in Egypt will become much
more visible and provide a much larger portion of the news about
Egypt that Americans read.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Egypt wants the United States to make up for scheduled
reductions in economic aid with a larger slice of U.S. foreign
investment, easier terms for getting its products into the American
marketplace and more joint enterprises ensuring the transfer of
U.S. technology to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Salama Ahmed Salama, an Egyptian political analyst, said Egypt
must make further changes if it is to remain a regional powerhouse
and to continue receiving substantial U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''With U.S. help, Egypt must now transform itself into a state
that is capable of establishing a democratic and a liberal system
in which human rights are respected while economic and
technological progress is achieved,'' Salama said. ''If not, it'll
become a relic.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, under emergency laws since 1981, has been regularly
criticized by human rights groups for reports of systematic police
torture and restrictions on the work of non-governmental groups and
on establishing political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The government has cracked down on Muslim insurgents for most of
the 1990s. And Coptic Christians, who make up about 10 percent of
Egypt's 65 million people and generally live in peace with the
Muslim majority, complain of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's government, often angered by criticism of its human
rights record, says the emergency laws are needed to deal with
armed Muslim groups and drug traffickers. Copts, it says, are
accorded the rights enjoyed by their Muslim compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   To the annoyance of Egyptian officials, human rights questions --
particularly relating to the Copts -- have been raised by U.S.
congressmen and activists during Mubarak's past visits to
Washington. That's unlikely to change this time, though Mubarak and
Clinton can be expected to play up their strong friendship of
recent decades.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Attacks U.S. Foreign Policy  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan is seeking to fashion the
Reform Party into a ''peace party.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan wrote hawkish speeches for President Nixon during
bombings of Vietnam. But as a presidential candidate, he is
promising to pull all U.S. troops out of the Balkans by the end of
his first year in office and all American troops out of Europe by
the end of his first term.
</P>
<P>
   Even sanctions against Iraq are excessively harsh for Buchanan,
who now styles himself as ''anti-interventionist.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One day our children shall pay the price of our callous
indifference to the children of Iraq,'' he said at a peace
conference near San Francisco on Friday night. He didn't say what
he thought the proper course of action was.
</P>
<P>
   Political reforms, such as revamping the campaign finance
system, were at the heart of the agenda when Ross Perot formed the
Reform Party in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But as Buchanan seeks the party's presidential nomination, he is
projecting his own views onto it.
</P>
<P>
   The former Republican delivered a sharp critique of the
''neo-imperial foreign policy'' of both major parties. He called
Vice President Al Gore ''an acolyte of the New World Order, ever
ready to cede American sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   But he reserved his harshest criticism for Texas Gov. George
Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has exhibited neither absorbing interest nor any
extraordinary aptitude for foreign policy, to put it
magnanimously,'' he said in a speech to more than 150 antiwar
activists. Many laughed at the remark.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said U.S. ''meddling'' overseas will lead to terrorism.
''Have we not suffered enough not to know that interventionism is
the incubator of terrorism?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said his newly adopted party could serve as ''a peace
party'' working to keep America out of ''the religious, ethnic and
territorial wars of less fortunate lands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party ''will become a noninterventionist party, a
peace party, that will reach out to Americans of right and left who
reject the Third Way imperialism being forced upon us by the elites
of both Beltway parties,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by conference organizer Justin Raimondo as ''the
leader of the American antiwar movement,'' Buchanan drew chants of
''Go Pat Go'' from audience members.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks after his address, Buchanan said the West should not
''walk away'' from the situation in Kosovo, but instead should get
its European allies to police the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can be the peacemaker of the world, or we can be the
policeman who goes about night-sticking troublemakers until we,
too, find ourselves in some bloody brawl we cannot handle,'' he
said. ''Let us use this transitory moment of American power and
pre-eminence to encourage and assist old friends and allies to
stand on their own feet and provide and pay for their own
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan told reporters that the Vietnam War merited U.S.
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we were at war with the Soviet empire,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Gets $650K in Campaign Funds  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The latest round of dueling campaign fund-raisers
was a study in switches -- Vice President Al Gore on Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's home turf, Bush in President Clinton's old
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was in Houston on Friday night, collecting $650,000 for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not in the business of giving advice to Mr. Gore, but if I
were I would tell him to look elsewhere for votes because Texas is
Bush country,'' said state Republican Party spokesman Robert Black.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the GOP presidential nominee-to-be, mined campaign cash in
Clinton's native Arkansas, pulling in about $350,000 at a campaign
fund raiser at a Little Rock hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Arkansas, people either loved Bill Clinton or they hated
him,'' said Chris Carnahan, executive director of the Arkansas
Republican State Committee. ''I think Gov. Bush is probably going
to carry Arkansas in the general election, especially lined up
against Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore sounded well aware that he was trespassing in ''Bush
country'' as he addressed some five dozen patrons at the home of
trial lawyer Denman Heard and his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by fresh orchids and the Heards' antique Chinese
porcelain and silks, Gore did not call his GOP rival by name,
referring only to ''the other side'' and ''Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   He thanked contributors for being ''willing, right here in this
state, to take the stand you're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We fight for the working people, for those who don't have the
resources,'' Gore said. Republicans, he added, ''draw from the
wealthiest, most powerful and well-heeled.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic national chairman Edward Rendell addressed
longstanding Republican gripes that trial lawyers made rich by what
many in the GOP consider frivolous lawsuits contribute huge sums to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Black, the Republican spokesman, said ''the trial lawyer
establishment in Texas is very powerful and, at this point, has
complete control of the state Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before Gore, Rendell asked the guests, many of them
trial lawyers, to think of the 100 most important consumer safety
advances in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eighty to 90 percent of those safety advances came from
litigation, so I think we are proud as a party to have the support
of the trial lawyers. It is nothing we apologize for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Gore's second fund-raiser in Houston, guests paid $15,000 per
person for a dinner of stuffed quail, ''which is appropriate
because, as we've said, Bush is Dan Quayle without the
experience,'' cracked Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore brought his party a total of $1.7 million during this
two-day swing through Cincinnati, Detroit and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other side is always going to have more resources and yet
we've got to try to have a level playing field,'' he told Houston
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Gore lashed out at Republicans in a written
statement from the White House timed to coincide with the 11th
anniversary of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was remarkable that ''Republicans in Congress have
responded to the recent rise in oil prices by again proposing to
drill in the Arctic refuge.''
</P>

   ''They would irrevocably destroy one of the last truly wild
places in America to enrich their friends in the oil industry and
secure less than half a year's supply of oil. President Clinton has
used his veto before to protect the Arctic from drilling and, if
necessary, is prepared to do so again,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Under Fire For Iraq Policy  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Friends and foes alike have publicly
criticized the United States for its Iraq policy, saying the Iraqi
people were suffering largely because of the U.S. hard line on
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In a heated Security Council debate Friday, the United States
countered that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was to blame for any
hardships because he had prolonged sanctions by refusing to give up
his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Deputy U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham said the
United States would try to improve its record in implementing the
U.N. humanitarian program for Iraq, which allows Baghdad to sell
its oil through U.N.-monitored sales.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is releasing $100 million of the more than $1 billion
in contracts for equipment purchases it had blocked and is
reviewing ways to process contracts faster, Cunningham told the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was also ready to approve a doubling in the
amount of spare parts Iraq can buy to repair its dilapidated oil
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the initiatives were welcomed, nearly every council
ambassador said the United States had to do more to enable the U.N.
oil-for-food program to better care for Iraqis, who have lived
under sanctions for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''This 'embargo generation' is a lost generation,'' said French
Ambassador Jean-David Levitte.
</P>
<P>
   ''How ironic is it that the same policy that is supposed to
disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction has itself become a
weapon of mass destruction -- the deaths of innocent children,''
said Malaysian Ambassador Agam Hasmy.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been barred from selling oil on the open market since
sweeping sanctions were imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The U.N. oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to provide for
Iraqis suffering under the measures, which cannot be lifted until
Iraq has rid itself of its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   While more than $6.7 billion worth of goods have arrived in Iraq
since the relief program began, the United States has held up over
$1 billion in contracts for equipment to rebuild Iraq's aging
electricity, oil and water industries.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says it wants to make sure the equipment isn't used
to help Saddam rebuild his weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But several ambassadors, even those more friendly to Washington,
said the United States was taking its concerns too far, no matter
how legitimate the threat of so-called ''dual-use'' imports.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dual-use concerns need to be kept focused and realistic,''
Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler said in urging the United States
to better weigh the humanitarian impact of its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the criticism leveled at the United States, however,
came from countries more friendly with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said it was ''inadmissible'' to
think that Iraq would resume cooperation with weapons inspectors
with almost daily U.S. and British airstrikes in the northern and
southern no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
   Even Secretary-General Kofi Annan indirectly criticized the
United States in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in danger of losing the argument or the propaganda war
-- if we haven't already lost it -- about who is responsible for the
situation: President Saddam Hussein or the United Nations,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Tightens Grip on Coverage  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Joan Rivers will cloak her Sunday afternoon
Academy Awards fashion gabfest in the same outfit she did last year
-- basic blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, as well as Internet sites and hosts of other TV shows
that compete with the official broadcast of the Oscars show, face
tougher restrictions each year from the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences on what they can show and when they can do it.
</P>
<P>
   They are barred from broadcasting live from the Shrine
Auditorium red carpet during the half-hour leading up to the
ceremony, giving ABC's official preview show a monopoly from 5 p.m.
to 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No photos or video footage of the ceremony can be used anywhere
during the broadcast, according to an agreement drawn up by the
academy that threatens permanent loss of press privileges or legal
action for violators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year we were live on Yahoo! throughout the event,'' said
David Poland, editor of the movie Web site roughcut.com. ''This
year, we were not invited to do that again. There is definitely a
tightening over there.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who will bring news and gossip from the Oscars to the
world were coping.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take it as a compliment,'' said Rivers, whose E!
Entertainment Television pre-show airs from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Sunday. ''They can't do what we do. We're just a little bitty show
that every (actor) enjoys stopping by .... We have a good time,
they have a good time. Go and be well.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland said the academy has the right to control access. And
Joel Sucherman, multimedia editor for usatoday.com, noted that
Oscar rules are still more relaxed than those imposed by sports
leagues over game highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our audience is really going to hit us hard on Monday morning,
when they're coming back into the office,'' Sucherman said. ''As
long as by 7 or 8 in the morning we're able to have a little
highlights package, I'll be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy has already had its share of publicity this year. It
lost ballots (new ones were sent), Oscar statues were stolen (and
then found in a trash bin) and a Web site claimed it had an
insider's list of nominees (it didn't).
</P>
<P>
   But the academy got really steamed when The Wall Street Journal
polled a few hundred Oscar voters ahead of time to predict the
winners in Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think right now The Wall Street Journal is beginning to
sense that they have done a geeky thing in the journalism world,''
academy executive director Bruce Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did what journalists try to do in any newsworthy situation,
which is to place calls and seek information, and there was this
explosive reaction,'' responded Amy Stevens, entertainment editor
of the newspaper's weekend section.
</P>
<P>
   The academy sent letters to its members asking them not to
discuss their picks, but one of the members, retired actor Norman
Alden, said his didn't arrive until after he'd talked with the
Journal. He was one of five academy members quoted by name in the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't mean to cause anybody any pain or misery or upchuck
about it. It was a purely legitimate mistake,'' said Alden, 75,
whose credits include ''The Adventures of Rin Tin'' and ''Ed
Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, academy executive administrator Ric Robertson
defended the half-hour pre-ceremony blackout as making ''complete
business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Oscars are big business.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday's official pre-show, with hosts Meredith Vieira of
''The View,'' model Tyra Banks and MTV's Chris Connelly,
advertisers are reportedly forking over as much as $425,000 for a
30-second spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The academy has watched E! make a great success in terms of
viewership and buzz by doing the fashion pre-show for the last
several years,'' said John Higgins, deputy editor of Broadcasting &AMP;
Cable magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''So they said, 'Hey, other people are making a business of this
and it's our show. Why should that money and those viewers go to
somebody else?''' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Spots during the ceremony itself are going for up to $1.3
million each for a record $62.4 million, according to Advertising
Age magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Finances aside, some observers say the academy's sense of
self-importance is overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ''The academy should maybe open its eyes and realize the Oscars
aren't that important to everyone in the world. It's just the
bloody Oscars, for heaven's sake,'' said Joe Saltzman, journalism
professor at the University of Southern California.

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Prepares for G-8 Summit  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan (AP) -- Until recently, about all there was to see in
this small town on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa was a
nice beach, a picturesque shrine up on the hill and a peaceful --
though somewhat run-down -- main street.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are reporters camped out in front of city hall.
Protesters hang out in the parks. Come summer, the whole town will
be overrun by world leaders -- not to mention riot police.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, ostensibly, is that Nago has been named host for
July's G-8 summit -- three days of discussions by leaders of the
industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   But that could all turn out to be more of a subplot.
</P>
<P>
   Along with being named summit host, Nago has been chosen as the
future home of a sprawling, multibillion dollar heliport for the
U.S. Marines. And that has put it at the center of a decades-old
debate over the U.S. military presence in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Nago as summit host -- guaranteeing it several
important construction projects -- Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi had
hoped to diffuse opposition to the base. Many in Nago fear the
heliport will bring pollution and the potential for accidents and
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Although Okinawa accounts for less than 1 percent of Japan's
area, roughly half the 52,000 U.S. troops in Japan, including
nearly 15,000 Marines, are stationed here.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tokyo and Washington agree that the presence is an
essential factor in maintaining stability in Asia, and neither
wants the number of troops reduced.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate his desire to make the Okinawa summit work
despite the controversy, Obuchi arrived here today to meet
townspeople and inspect the new beachside convention center where
the talks will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa's governor, a conservative, has welcomed Obuchi's
overtures, and has also tried to play down tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a chance for the world to see Okinawa,'' Gov. Keiichi
Inamine said recently. ''It is just a three-day event, but the
long-term economic impact is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Inamine has said he would like to see the U.S. presence
streamlined, and he has been at odds with both Tokyo and Washington
over the proposed heliport in Nago.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a summit visit by President Clinton -- the first
by an American president since Okinawa was returned to Japanese
administration in 1972 -- would allow him a firsthand look at the
enormous military presence on the island, Inamine says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want him to go to the bases to see for himself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa has long paid a heavy price for Japan's greater good.
</P>
<P>
   Used as a last-ditch line of Japan's defense against the Allies,
Okinawa was one of the bloodiest battlefields of World War II.
Roughly a third of its civilian population died.
</P>
<P>
   One of Obuchi's stops today was a monument to the more than
200,000 people who died in the Okinawa fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the summit is held here this July, it is my hope that the
world will hear Okinawa's appeal for peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa was governed by the United States from 1945 until 1972.
Having missed out on Japan's postwar economic boom, it remains the
country's poorest region.
</P>
<P>
   In a break with past governors, who tended to focus on the
bases, Inamine has made improving Okinawa's economy his top
priority since assuming office last year.
</P>
<P>
   He has also demanded a 15-year time limit be imposed on the U.S.
military's base lease. After that, he wants it to be used as a
commercial airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the minimum requirement,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have said they cannot accept a time limit.
Tokyo, meanwhile, is hoping the Okinawans will back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't see the G-8 summit as a deadline'' on the heliport
issue, said Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for Obuchi. ''It's not that
we have to solve this issue before the summit.''

<HEADLINE> Bermuda Cargo Ship Search Called Off  </HEADLINE>
By RAYMOND HAINEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -- After hours of fruitless searching,
Canadian ships called off the hunt for more survivors after a cargo
ship sank in the high seas off Bermuda. Twelve sailors still
missing in the Atlantic were presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, 13 sailors from the 31-member crew of the ship
Leader L were rescued in a dramatic operation, with Canadian and
U.S. aircraft dropping life rafts to survivors bobbing in the sea.
Six bodies were recovered from the ship, which sank hours after
placing a distress call Thursday, 400 miles northeast of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   By evening Friday, several hours had passed without finding more
bodies or survivors, and Canadian aircraft and navy ships called
off the search, said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Allison von
Hagn of the Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't found anyone since the last deceased crew member,
and that was morning,'' von Hagn said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian navy destroyer Iroquois was taking the survivors
and the dead to Bermuda and was expected to arrive this afternoon,
von Hagn said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio transmissions from the Leader L continued until just
seconds before it went under Thursday night, suggesting some crew
may never have escaped the vessel, said Lt. Cmdr. Glenn
Chamberlain, spokesman for the Canadian Forces and Coast Guard
Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   The ship sank after the Leader L placed a distress call saying
that a 45-foot steel hull plate had come loose and water was
flooding into the hold.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian C-130 aircraft crew that had flown to the scene
watched as the bow of the foundering 776-foot ship dipped into the
water and the Leader L slid into the sea at a 45-degree angle -- all
within 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Sea King helicopters hoisted 13 survivors from
lifeboats and open water and ferried them to the Iroquois. All 13
were reported in good condition, Chamberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the survivors, at least six were found in two lifeboats that
had been dropped by Canadian and U.S. C-130 aircraft well before
the helicopters could arrive. ''It was a lifesaving decision,''
Chamberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   The four Canadian Sea King helicopters operated from a
five-vessel task force that had been en route to military exercises
in the Caribbean. The task force was to continue to conduct the
exercises after the survivors and victims had been taken to
Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The force diverted to the disaster site at top speed, and the
rescue operation began in darkness with gusty winds and 15-foot
waves. Rescuers were lowered from the hovering choppers into the
ocean, where they placed survivors on lifts and hoisted them up.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Leoninus Shipping of Greece, the Panama-registered
Leader L was carrying salt from Spain to New York. At least some of
its crew were Filipino and Greek, Chamberlain said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Worried about the risk of war in
South Asia, President Clinton began a diplomatically difficult
visit to Pakistan on Saturday amid heavy security and little
fanfare. He brought admonitions to Pakistan's military rulership to
retreat from nuclear weapons and lower dangerous tensions with
India.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rode in an unmarked plane from India, and was met at the
airport by six nearly identical presidential limousines in an
apparent attempt to disguise his exact whereabouts from potential
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   There was no formal arrival ceremony, but Pakistan's foreign
minister and protocol chief joined the U.S. ambassador to meet
Clinton's plane.
</P>
<P>
   After five days in India, the president was spending just five
hours in Pakistan -- a clear signal of U.S. unhappiness about Gen.
Pervez Musharraf's October coup and his refusal to a set a
timetable for national elections and a return to democracy. Clinton
had considered skipping Pakistan but decided to make a quick stop
to raise U.S. concerns with an old ally.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism is high on the list of concerns, prompting intense
security for Clinton's visit. Military jeeps with mounted machine
guns patrolled Islamabad and troops stood guard throughout the
capital. An estimated 5,000 soldiers and thousands more police were
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first presidential trip to Pakistan since Richard
Nixon's in 1969. Clinton will be allowed to address the Pakistani
people on live television after he meets Musharraf at a government
building in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plea for restraint in Pakistan is the same message he
brought to India -- with little apparent result. India rejected
Clinton's plea to sign a nuclear test ban and begin to give up its
nuclear program. The same outcome is likely in Pakistan, at least
in the immediate future, White House officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult for either country to do something that is
perceived as for us, a gift to the United States,'' a senior
administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   At his final stop in India, Clinton said, ''Friends don't have
to agree on every issue. They just have to have an honest
relationship about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombay gave Clinton a glimpse of the crushing poverty in which
hundreds of millions of Indians live. His motorcade rode by slums
where families stood atop shacks with rusty, corrugated tin roofs
in hopes of seeing the president. He stopped at a workshop for the
blind to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a remarkable week,'' Clinton told business
leaders at Bombay's stock market. He said the United States and
India had built ''a new partnership on a higher level'' after 22
years of strain since the last presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he found within India the seeds of a brighter
future for the developing world -- examples of women progressing
toward equality, different races and castes getting along and new
technology driving hopes for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He urged India to lead the way ''away from the proliferation of
dangerous weapons, toward the proliferation of new ideas, new
companies and new technologies, away from the kind of racial and
ethnic tensions that we see in the trouble spots in South Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's whirlwind tour of the subcontinent, which included an
opening stop in Bangladesh, was taking a toll. He appeared to nod
off before speaking in Hyderabad, a high-tech city, and then
delivered an address in Bombay with his hand propped up against his
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had branded South Asia perhaps the most dangerous place
in the world because of the nuclear rivalry between India and
Pakistan and a half-century feud over the Himalayan territory of
Kashmir that has triggered two wars.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are higher than ever now because India and Pakistan
both conducted nuclear tests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are worried that border skirmishes could escalate
into war -- particularly if Pakistan is emboldened by a false belief
that the United States would step in on its side. Pakistan has been
a steady ally of the United States, particularly during the Cold
War when it was a front-line state for U.S.-backed Afghan
resistance fighters who were battling the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, smaller and economically weaker than India, wants the
United States to mediate the Kashmir dispute. India opposes the
idea, and Clinton says he cannot intervene unless help is requested
by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration specifically wants Pakistan to move
toward democracy, renew dialogue with India over Kashmir, combat
terrorism, help end regional violence and de-escalate its nuclear
program.

police have found a new horror linked to a Ugandan doomsday cult: the hacked and

away from the cult's compound, where at least 330 members died in a fire March
17 in a makeshift church -- deaths authorities first believed were a mass

Papal Visit Spotlights Tensions

   NAZARETH, Israel (AP) -- While Pope John Paul II's brief visit here Saturday
is giving rise to a certain amount of civic pride, it's also an occasion for
Nazarenes to air all manner of grudges and grievances. Sensibilities are still
raw after a bitter Muslim-Christian quarrel over plans to build a large new
mosque in the shadow of the Basilica of the Annunciation, the site where the
Bible says the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary with the news that she would give
birth to Jesus, ''the son of the highest.'' John Paul's visit is timed to
coincide with a Roman Catholic feast day commemorating the event, and several
thousand faithful are to attend a celebratory papal Mass in the Basilica of the

Former Hostage Awarded $341M

million damage award Iran was ordered to pay for his nearly seven years of
captivity in Lebanon, even though it's uncertain whether he will ever be able to
collect the money. Anderson's treatment was ''savage and cruel by any civilized
standards,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said Friday in ordering
Iran to pay the damages to Anderson and his family. The judge ordered Iran to
pay $24.5 million to Anderson, $10 million to his wife, Madeleine Bassil, and
$6.7 million to their daughter, Sulome. The judge also ordered the Iranian
Ministry of Information and Security to pay them $300 million in punitive
damages.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Ed Cota spurred a late second-half comeback, then he
and freshmen Joseph Forte and Julius Peppers hit six straight free throws in the
final 34.9 seconds, giving the North Carolina Tar Heels a 74-69 victory over
Tennessee and another stunning upset. Eighth-seeded North Carolina (21-13),
fresh off beating the South's top seed Stanford, overcame a 51-42 deficit by
holding the fourth-seeded Volunteers (26-7) without a field goal for nearly the
last seven minutes.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations Pass Strike Deadline  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bargainers for US Airways and the Association
of Flight Attendants seemed near agreement early Saturday on a new
contract to avert a strike against the nation's sixth largest air
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three hours past a strike deadline, there was an air of
expectation at the Washington hotel where talks have been taking
place. Union spokesman Jeff Zack said negotiators were working on
final details of a prospective accord. The company declined
immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the union and airline agreed to keep talking beyond a
12:01 a.m. deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Accordingly, US Airways has extended the time for declaring a
shutdown of the airline,'' US Airways officials said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the airline have been trying for more than three
years to resolve their differences. US Airways had said earlier
that it would halt operations rather than try to weather a strike.
</P>
<P>
   At airports across the country US Airways attendants had held
candlelight vigils, awaiting the midnight strike deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain hopeful,'' said Association of Flight Attendants'
president Pat Friend.
</P>
<P>
   Under strict secrecy orders from the National Mediation Board,
which is overseeing the talks, neither side in the dispute provided
a read-out on the progress negotiators made Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some minor contract issues have been settled, but pay and
pensions remained big sticking points, Friend said at a news
conference earlier in the day at Reagan National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airline had faced a possible 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday walkout
by flight attendants authorized by federal mediators.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 US Airways flight attendants are working under a
contract that expired at the end of 1996. It gave them their last
pay raise, 4 percent, at the beginning of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Off-duty US Airways attendants picketing Friday at Reagan
National said they were ready to walk off the job if they don't get
pay and retirement benefits they want.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Viar, 33, a US Airways attendant for a decade, expressed
frustration at going without a raise while company executives take
home millions. ''They make enough to give us a raise. Definitely,''
said Viar, a mother of three who lives in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The starting salary for US Airways attendants is $17,145 a year.
Those at the top of the pay scale earn $36,918.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways officials, who have promised to shut down operations
rather than try to weather a strike, said they were offering the
flight attendants a chance Friday to discuss alternative ways to
design a new pay and benefits formula similar to what unions for
other US Airways workers have agreed to. The company has been
trying to bring labor costs in line with its biggest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to shut down this airline. We understand the
hardship that this would cause our company and our customers,''
said US Airways spokesman David Castelveter.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney released a statement Friday
saying the labor federation is prepared if necessary to help flight
attendants, who have only a limited strike-pay fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''The AFL-CIO and its affiliates will do whatever it takes to
assure that ... flight attendants prevail in their struggle for
simple justice,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute agreement or extension of bargaining could avert a
disruption of US Airways flights. President Clinton also can order
a halt to transportation strikes for 60 days, and more talks, but
the White House so far has announced no plans to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, US Airways was completing shutdown preparations. An
internal memo to employees said that in the event of a flight
attendants' strike, the airline's other 35,000 workers should
report to work if scheduled Saturday and expect to be ''busy with
activities related to the shutdown,'' including helping passengers
rebook flights. It said that those who refuse to cross picket lines
would forfeit pay.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways let passengers know early this week that if it halts
operations, other major airlines and Amtrak have agreed to honor
its tickets as long as seats are available.
</P>
<P>
   A US Airways shutdown would hit hardest in the East, where the
airline controls a third of the market. Amtrak has said it has
extra passenger coaches standing by for major routes linking
Boston, New York, Washington and points to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Many nervous travel agents stopped booking US Airways flights,
but some hopeful weekend travelers were taking their chances.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wetherall, 27, visiting the United States from South
Africa with a friend, was in the US Airways line at Washington's
airport on Friday to pick up tickets for a Saturday flight to
Orlando, Fla., despite the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they're going to be paying for our accommodations here
if they don't sort it out,'' Wetherall only half-joked.
</P>
<P>
   The only US Airways flights that would not be affected are
regional commuter airlines that operate under a service agreement
with the airline, using the name US Airways Express. They would
continue to fly.

<HEADLINE> Feeling Better, Pops Back With Pitt  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Willie Stargell is heavier now than when
he played. He walks and talks more slowly. As he watches prospects
at the Pittsburgh Pirates' camp, he depends on a golf cart with his
No. 8 on the side to transport him from field to field.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Stargell is more Grandpops these days than Pops, his
nickname when he single-handedly willed the Pirates to an
unexpected World Series title as a 38-year-old first baseman with
gimpy knees in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But for a 60-year-old man who nearly died only a few months ago,
Stargell looks very much alive, very much in charge, very much in
control.
</P>
<P>
   Asked recently by several concerned ex-teammates how he felt, he
said, ''I haven't felt this well in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The sigh of relief from Pirates fans was heard all the way back
to Pittsburgh, where he remains the most popular living Pirates
player -- a beloved reminder of the days when the town was called
the City of Champions.
</P>
<P>
   To Stargell, living is the operative word.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell, who returned to the Pirates in 1997 as a special
assistant to general manager Cam Bonifay, has been in deteriorating
health for several years because of a kidney disorder that requires
dialysis several times a week. Dialysis is required when the organ
is failing.
</P>
<P>
   But an infected finger, and not the bad kidney, hospitalized him
for six weeks last fall and nearly caused him to die.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell was cutting meat at his Pittsburgh apartment late last
season when he was distracted by his TV and looked up. When he
looked down, he had sliced not the meat, but his right index
finger.
</P>
<P>
   To Stargell, the cut did not appear serious. After the bleeding
stopped, he bandaged it, sat down, and finished his meal.
</P>
<P>
   But, several days later, after the finger swelled and began to
hurt, he was admitted to a Pittsburgh hospital. The diagnosis: a
severe infection that was quickly spreading throughout his body,
attacking his organs.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a month and a half in the hospital, including two weeks
in intensive care, receiving antibiotics and around-the-clock care.
About half of the infected finger was amputated.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates strictly guarded Stargell's privacy and declined to
reveal the nature of his illness, and Stargell still dislikes
discussing his health. When his hospitalization finally was
reported, the Pirates received sacks of letters and get-well cards
from fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank them very much for their support,'' Stargell said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of these same fans respectfully approach Stargell at
the Pirates City complex for a picture or a scrawled signature. He
almost always accommodates them, though he occasionally shoos away
someone if he is in the midst of evaluating a player.
</P>
<P>
   Stargell still has not totally regained his strength, and his
movements are more stilted than before. But, according to general
manager Cam Bonifay, his eye for talent was not affected by his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Willie Stargell knows baseball,'' Bonifay said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Stargell has returned to work, Bonifay continues to
rely heavily on his ability to assess young talent. This weekend,
Stargell will fly to Arizona to watch spring training there.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, not even a brush with death could get Willie Stargell
off the baseball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no greater icon for Pirates baseball and
professionalism than Willie Stargell,'' Pirates owner Kevin
McClatchy said.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Greg Maddux and Livan Hernandez tuned up for their
opening-day starts, Kerry Wood took the next step in his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux allowed one run -- his first of the spring -- in six strong
innings of the Atlanta Braves' 8-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates
in Kissimmee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The four-time Cy Young winner has given up eight hits, one run,
walked two and struck out 14 in 15 innings as he prepares for the
regular-season opener on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really worried about the numbers,'' he said. ''Whether
my ERA is one or 10, it's not important. What's important is
feeling like you can throw all your pitches at any count with
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, 19-9 a year ago with a 3.57 ERA, his highest since 1987,
is pretty close to where he wants to be heading into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to get more confident with my changeup. My slider was
good today. That's a plus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Hernandez pitched seven scoreless innings and Bobby
Estalella hit his fifth home run of the spring as San Francisco
beat Oakland 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed three hits and three walks while striking out
five in his longest outing of the spring. Robb Nen, who has been
bothered by elbow soreness, pitched a scoreless ninth for his first
save of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''He threw the ball well,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said of
Nen. ''He had a good slider and good control. It was his best
outing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood tried to get back into form, throwing two innings in a
minor league game for the Chicago Cubs in Mesa, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In his second outing of the spring since undergoing
reconstructive elbow surgery last April, Wood allowed three runs
and five hits to a Triple-A team of the Milwaukee Brewers. But the
good news was he hit 94-96 mph on the radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like my velocity was where it was last Saturday,'' Wood
said. ''I would have liked to have thrown more strikes with the
fastball and have more command. Unfortunately I didn't, but I think
we got some good accomplished out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a rough one today, but the arm feels good and we got
some work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year, threw 15 pitches in each
inning before the sides changed. He threw 25 fastballs and five
changeups.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this stage of the rehab, the number of runs he gives up,
the number of hits he gives up is irrelevant to his velocity, his
mechanics and how he feels physically,'' GM Ed Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   In Melbourne, Fla., the New York Yankees hit nine homers,
including two each by Ricky Ledee, Jorge Posada and Clay Bellinger,
as the Florida Marlins received their second straight pounding,
falling 19-0 to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, Mike Coolbaugh and Rafael Bournigal also homered
for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, who were outhit 18-4, have been outscored 35-0 in
their past two games as they deal with an outbreak of mumps that
has infected six players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to erupt in front of you people (the media), I'm
not going to embarrass myself or you guys, but maybe later it'll be
a different story,'' Florida manager John Boles said.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
Reds 5, Blue Jays 4
</P>
<P>
   At Sarasota, Fla., Ken Griffey Jr. drove in two runs with a
double and a single, and Kimera Bartee hit a game-winning single in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 6, Astros 5
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Todd Hollandsworth, competing with Devon
White for the starting job in center field, went 3-for-4 with a
grand slam.
</P>
<P>
Twins 2, Expos 1
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Brad Radke tuned up for opening day by
allowing one run in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Devil Rays 7, Royals 3
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Steve Trachsel allowed two runs in four
innings and Herbert Perry went 3-for-4 with three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Red Sox 7, Rangers 1
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Brian Rose allowed one run in 4 1-3 innings
and Jose Offerman drove in three runs.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals 4, Orioles 1
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., St. Louis starter Andy Benes left after 3 1-3
innings with stiffness in his right shoulder. ''It's stiff, not
sore. It's sort of a dead-arm thing that happens in the spring,''
Benes said.
</P>
<P>
Diamondbacks 7, Rockies 6
</P>
<P>
   At Tucson, Ariz., Damian Miller singled in the tiebreaking run
as Arizona defeated Colorado for the fifth straight time this
spring.
</P>
<P>
White Sox 6, Brewers 5
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix, Jose Valentin tripled, singled and scored twice
against his former team as Chicago won its seventh straight game.
</P>
<P>
Padres 8, Angels 4
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., John Roskos, fighting for a roster spot,
tripled, doubled and scored two runs, and Tony Gwynn went 3-for-3
with his first homer of the spring.
</P>
<P>
Phillies 6, Tigers 3
</P>
<P>
   At Lakeland, Fla., Hideo Nomo, Detroit's opening-day starter,
was roughed up for six runs in 5 2-3 innings in his next-to-last
spring game. Kevin Sefcik hit a grand slam and Pat Burrell had a
solo homer.
</P>
<P>
Giants (ss) 9, Mariners 4
</P>
<P>
   At Scottsdale, Ariz., Jay Canizaro had four hits and drove in
two runs and Jeff Kent homered for San Francisco. Alex Rodriguez
hit his fourth home run of the spring for the Mariners.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Women's Tournament Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   If North Carolina's Nikki Teasley ever again doubts her value to
the team, all she has to do is look at the Tar Heels' record
without her.
</P>
<P>
   Teasley took a leave of absence for more than three weeks in
January, and the Tar Heels struggled. Oh, did they struggle, losing
six of seven games in that stretch, including a 43-point rout by
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Then she came back, and just like that, North Carolina became a
different team. The fifth-seeded Tar Heels (20-12) are in the round
of 16 in the NCAA tournament for the seventh time in eight years
and will play top-seeded Georgia (31-3) tonight in the West
Regional semifinals at Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard to sit back and to see them lose those games,''
Teasley said. ''Being out, I saw how important I was to the team
and how important they were to me.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I came back, I just kind of had the mentality that I want
revenge from everybody we lost to, as well as making a statement
that we are a great basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   With Teasley back, North Carolina reached the ACC tournament
finals, where the Tar Heels lost to Duke despite her 31 points. She
has averaged 15 points and 8.5 assists in her two NCAA games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Nikki's game since she's been back is the best she's
ever played,'' coach Sylvia Hatchell said. ''I don't know if she'd
be the player she is right now if she and the team hadn't gone
through what we went through.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Rutgers (24-7) plays 11th-seeded
Alabama-Birmingham (21-12) in the other West Regional semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Regional play began today with games in the East and Mideast. In
the East at Richmond, Va., it was top-seeded Connecticut (32-1)
against fifth-seeded Oklahoma (25-7) and second-seeded Duke (28-5)
against fourth-seeded LSU (24-6).
</P>
<P>
   In the Mideast at Memphis, top-seeded Tennessee (30-3) played
fourth-seeded Virginia (25-8) and second-seeded Notre Dame (27-4)
met third-seeded Texas Tech (27-4).
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest Regional is tonight in Kansas City, where top-seeded
Louisiana Tech (30-2) plays fourth-seeded Old Dominion (29-4) and
second-seeded Penn State (28-4) plays third-seeded Iowa State
(27-5).
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina will need another big game from Teasley -- and
from several of her teammates as well -- to get past Georgia.
Georgia made the Final Four last year, mainly because of twins
Kelly and Coco Miller. They're still the leading scorers, but the
Lady Bulldogs are getting strong contributions from others now,
making them even more difficult to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Their only loss in the last 18 games was to Mississippi State in
the semifinals of the Southeastern Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ever been in a hide-and-seek game, where you thought you
had a pretty good hiding place but you were scared they were going
to find you?'' Georgia coach Andy Landers said. ''That was kind of
us last year. This year, you can't find us.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has been to the Final Four five times under Landers but
has yet to win it all. Landers frowned when forward Angie Ball was
asked if the players were motivated by the desire to get their
coach a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my last crack, so for me I'm going to leave everything
out there on the floor,'' Ball said. ''I think our objective all
year was to win the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Landers let her answer. Louisiana Tech coach Leon
Barmore politely broke in when two of his players, Betty Lennox and
Tamicha Jackson, were asked about the importance of extending their
coach's career by winning in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore announced last week he would retire when the season
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to talk about that,'' he said. ''The game's
too important to the kids. This isn't win one for the Gipper junk.
This is win one for Louisiana Tech and for the seniors and I've
asked them not to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge facing Iowa State and Penn State might be
staying awake until the game, which will begin around 9:30 p.m.
local time. The Iowa State players at least had a diversion because
they could watch their men's team play Michigan State in the
regional finals. The Penn State players were on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't know what they're going to do,'' Penn State
coach Rene Portland said. ''But I think the excitement is going to
keep me awake for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Sutton Maintains Lead at Sawgrass  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Hal Sutton wasn't backing down.
Tiger Woods wasn't giving up.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton shot his second straight round of 3-under-par 69 on
Friday to maintain The Players Championship lead after two rounds
on the fast, dry and difficult TPC Stadium Course at Sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   One stroke behind were Tom Lehman and Omar Uresti, who each shot
68. Fulton Allem shot 7-under 65, the best round since the late
Payne Stewart had the same score in the final round two years ago
to finish fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking another shot back is Woods, who shot his second straight
71 and felt good about his chances for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very pleased with the way I'm hitting the golf ball, the
way I'm putting it,'' Woods said. ''It's just that sometimes you
get bad breaks and things just don't go your way. But overall, I'm
very pleased with my position.''
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, is Sutton, who has spent the entire week refuting
the theory that the sight of Woods on the leader board is enough to
demoralize even the hardiest of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old Sutton had other problems to worry about in the
second round, especially when his tee shot plunked in the water on
No. 18. But he overcame that by dropping in the rough and hitting
his third shot to 15 feet, then sinking the putt to save bogey.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked a streak of birdies once he made the turn to the
front side. He made birdie putts of 18, 18 and 40 feet to go to
5-under, then made another birdie on No. 6 to finish at 6-under,
four strokes ahead of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only person I can control is myself, and I'm out of
control half the time,'' Sutton said. ''I'm certainly not going to
be able to control somebody else in what they do. I'm going to work
on trying to do the best I can with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman also took a me-first attitude after a round in which he
made three birdies, an eagle and just one bogey on a course that
was playing at an average of 3.2 strokes over par.
</P>
<P>
   He's not buying into the theory that Woods, who has won 10 of
the last 16 tournaments he has entered, is invincible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was always raised to think there are two cardinal sins in
sports,'' Lehman said. ''One is underestimating your opponent, and
the other is overestimating your opponent. Both ways don't do you
any good in terms of your own performance.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Woods, the biggest challenge this weekend should be
overcoming this course, which dried out as the day wore on,
bringing abundant sunshine and gusty winds.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the wind made things extra difficult on a course that
the tour actually tried to tame a bit after last year, when
conditions flared out of control and only two players finished
below par.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying to get it right on the edge of where it is
very tough, but fair,'' Sutton said. ''When you have dry, gusty
conditions like that, it can get out of hand before you know what's
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to play into the hands of the best player in the
world. Despite a handful of bad breaks -- including a great drive on
No. 4 that landed in a divot and resulted in a double bogey -- Woods
was as optimistic as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm right there in the hunt with a chance to win, and that's
where you want to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, he was ready for the weekend to begin.

<HEADLINE> Police: Young Sisters Were at Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Two little girls, ages 2 and 14 months,
apparently spent at least three days home alone after their father
died in a car crash and police couldn't reach their mother away at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Linda and Arianna Hoell were found by authorities at their
apartment early Friday, a day after police reached their mother on
the aircraft USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. Police spokesman Larry Hill
said they were checked at a hospital and turned over to relatives
until their mother arrives in Norfolk, probably today.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Gary G. Hoell, 27, was one of three people who
died in Tuesday's accident. Police did not identify him immediately
because he was not carrying a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   When police were able to contact Hoell's wife, she asked about
the children. Hill said officers and friends who went by the
Hoells' apartment on Thursday didn't find anyone there, but two
officers eventually saw the girls through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, police found evidence that the girls may have been alone
since Tuesday night. Open packages of crackers, pancake mix, flour,
macaroni and cheese and milk suggested that Linda, the 2-year-old,
had tried to feed herself and her sister.
</P>
<P>
   She also had changed Arianna's diapers, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Police initially believed the girls might have been abandoned by
someone who was supposed to be caring for them. Now they believe
Hoell may have left his daughters alone, perhaps planning to return
a short time later, Hill said.

<HEADLINE> NAACP: Remove Confederate Image  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The NAACP is calling on Gov. George W.
Bush to remove an image of the Confederate flag from the Texas
Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said Bush should push for the
removal because it's the morally right thing to do -- not because
the civil rights group may organize a tourism boycott on Texas
similar to one in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope the governor does not need the NAACP to appeal to
him, but that his heart would appeal to him,'' Mfume said. ''The
intolerance the flag represents should not be condoned in any
public building.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume spoke Friday at a regional conference of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bledsoe, president of the Texas chapter of the NAACP, on
Friday reissued his call for Bush to remove the Texas plaque,
calling it ''a symbol of racism, division, and hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, has said he is
studying the request. When asked in South Carolina about that
state's flying of the Confederate flag from the state Capitol, Bush
said voters should decide the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bush's office did not return messages seeking
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NAACP called for an economic boycott of South Carolina
in January, 92 organizations have withdrawn from regional and
district meetings that were scheduled to be held there, Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   He said South Carolina will set the stage for how other states
deal with the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are successful in South Carolina, more states will be
inclined to do the same thing,'' Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP and others contend the flag stands for racism and
slavery, while supporters say it honors their Southern heritage.
South Carolina is the only state that flies the flag from its
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the image of the Confederate flag is on a plaque in
the entryway to the building that houses the state's two top courts
-- the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The plaque
also quotes Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Another plaque includes
the seal of the Confederacy.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Gov. Decries Lack of Funds  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal funding that states use to clean up
seized methamphetamine drug labs has dried up, leaving communities
with a legacy of toxic chemicals and no money to get rid of them,
Idaho's Republican governor complained today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time a meth lab is shut down, we're left with a toxic
time bomb. And the more labs that we put out of business, the more
time bombs are left ticking,'' Gov. Dirk Kempthorne said in the
GOP's weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration told state and local
agencies this month that cleanup funds that were supposed to last
until the end of September have been used up. It can cost as much
as $10,000 to dispose of the chemicals and equipment left over from
each drug lab.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine, also known as meth or speed, ''remains one of
the most dangerous substances America has ever confronted,'' White
House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey told a congressional
committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while ''substantial progress'' had been made in the
fight against illegal drugs during the past year, methamphetamines
have a ''serious potential nationally to become the next 'crack'
cocaine epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempthorne said an alliance of federal, state, and local law
enforcement has had great success in breaking up meth labs in
Idaho, which saw a 74 percent increase in the number of labs shut
down last year. But more seizures means toxic materials to clean
up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The criminals who produce meth are reckless, leaving behind
extremely poisonous and environmentally hazardous byproducts,
Kempthorne said. In one Idaho case, he said, a suspect was caught
dumping chemicals out the window of a house that was next door to a
church preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Idaho, law enforcement agencies in several other
states including Utah and Oklahoma are searching for replacement
funding.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, which led the nation last year in meth lab
seizures, per capita, DEA officials are working with
representatives of local agencies to find other funding. One
possibility is the DEA's asset-forfeiture fund, but use of that
money requires DEA involvement at the beginning of a meth
investigation and the likelihood that assets will be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating has written a letter to Attorney
General Janet Reno asking her to work with the DEA to find an
additional $500,000 needed by his state's Bureau of Investigation
to continue their cleanup program through June.
</P>
<P>
   Kempthorne said the Clinton administration should revise its
proposed budget for the coming year because it currently lacks any
money for the cleanup efforts. He added that the House should
address the situation next week when it's scheduled to take up an
emergency appropriations bill for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When states can't clean up meth labs, I'd say that constitutes
an emergency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Weiner, spokesman for McCaffrey's policy office, said the
administration was increasing its anti-drug spending by $1 billion
next year and that its initiatives had shown results in curbing
overall drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine can be made from cheap chemical ingredients
found in most stores. Kempthorne said criminals often mix their
meth recipes in toilet bowls so they can flush away the evidence if
there is a raid.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy, a methamphetamine that increases heart rate and body
temperature to sometimes dangerous levels, is often used at
''raves,'' all-night dances where young people may mix the drug
with alcohol, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Department of Health and Human Services
reported in an annual survey that for the first time since it began
examining the drug ecstasy in 1996, use among 10th- and
12th-graders had increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no room for drugs in our society,'' Kempthorne said,
''Not as a deadly enterprise, and not as a toxic legacy.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Turn Attention to Parties  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Their primary foes vanquished, George W. Bush
and Al Gore are turning their attention to the political parties
and making plans to shift loyal supporters to the organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Bush adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Texas governor's loyalists eventually will head every major
Republican National Committee department, though the RNC chairman,
Jim Nicholson, and other top party officials will not be asked to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore has worked closely with party
leaders for seven years, but still is going to put his campaign
veterans in key posts. ''This isn't a hostile takeover, it's a
friendly merger,'' Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said.
</P>
<P>
   While spokesmen for both campaigns said no decision had been
made on who to transfer to the political party committees, party
officials said Bush finance director Donald Evans and top Gore
strategist Michael Whouley were likely to make the move. A top Gore
fund-raiser, Eileen Kotecki, also is likely to shift to the DNC,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican consultant Ed Gillespie said candidates want the
parties to be populated with people they know.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know your approach to the campaign, you want to reward
loyalty to people who were with you in the toughest of times, and
they helped you win and secure the nomination,'' Gillespie said.
''You have faith in their abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   By moving campaign staff to the parties, both candidates can
pare their payrolls and reduce their spending. It's especially
important for Gore. Unlike Bush, the vice president accepted
federal funds for his campaign and therefore can spend no more than
$40.5 million during the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the presidential candidates can ensure that their
supporters are in control of the party apparatus, with its
multimillion dollar campaign treasury and its legions of grassroots
activists.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns also plan to shift their fund-raisers to the
parties. The Democrats hope to raise $100 million and the
Republicans $172 million this year, much of it to be spent on issue
ads on behalf of their presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Evans helped Bush smash all fund-raising records, bringing in
more than $73 million for the campaign. Kotecki and veteran
Democratic fund-raiser Peter Knight are expected to lend their
talents to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the eventual transfer of campaign staff, the DNC
had reserved slots in advance. Because Gore has been vice president
since 1993, he already has worked with the party hierarchy and most
of the current officials are expected to remain in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign aides are discussing who will move to the RNC and
which positions they will occupy there. ''It's important to have a
united team for the 2000 election,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   As an added incentive to ensure that the party hierarchy is full
of candidate loyalists, all the Bush campaign needs to do is look
at 1996, when polls showed GOP nominee Dole heading for defeat.
Some Republican officials appeared to write off Dole and shift
their attention to protecting the party's congressional majorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since Dole won the nomination, I've been saying our first goal
is to elect Bob Dole president. But it's not our only priority,''
then-Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour said at
the time. ''If Clinton is re-elected, heaven forbid, the last thing
the American people want is for him to have a blank check in the
form of a liberal Democrat Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Congressional Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are eager to hold down
retirements this fall, especially because 23 members already have
announced plans to leave, compared with seven Democrats. But they
are worried about New York Rep. Amo Houghton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, chairman of the House campaign committee, told
the GOP leadership recently that Houghton has yet to give him a
firm answer about his plans, according to party sources who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, R-Va., also said he knows of no other potential GOP
retirements, these sources added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Houghton, 73, said he would make up his mind
about his plans by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I have been loyal to the leadership,'' he said, adding
that the issue of running again was a ''personal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton, a moderate Republican, represents a district along New
York's southern tier. First elected in 1986, he won his last race
with 68 percent of the vote. Democrats are poorly positioned to win
the seat even if he retires, though. The district is a Republican
one, and the Democratic farm system appears weak.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are quickly closing ranks behind state Rep. Tim
Johnson of Illinois, the winner of a hotly contested four-way
primary last week for an open House seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's our guy, We are doing everything possible for him,'' said
Jim Wilkinson, a spokesman for the GOP campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson emerged from one of the more complicated political proxy
wars in recent years -- a battle that Illinois Gov. George Ryan won
over House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Rep. Tom Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won the nomination with 44 percent of the vote in a
four-way race. Runners-up included state Rep. Bill Brady, whom
Hastert had supported, as well as Sam Ewing, whose father is
retiring and hoped to keep the seat in his family.
</P>
<P>
   The contest disrupted a longtime friendship between Ewing and
Hastert, and Democrats say they are hoping to snatch the seat away.
</P>
<P>
   Former congressional aide Mike Kelleher won the Democratic
primary. ''They came out of the primary with their most
conservative candidate. We think in a moderate district like that
one we could be competitive,'' said Erik Smith, a spokesman for the
Democratic campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   There is more GOP internal struggling going on in New Jersey,
where Democratic freshman Rush Holt is viewed as vulnerable. Former
Reps. Dick Zimmer, who gave up the seat to run for the Senate in
1996, and Mike Pappas, who lost to Holt in 1998, are vying for the
nomination, and the GOP leadership has been split for weeks over
the contest. Now a group of moderates has circulated a letter to
fellow Republicans declaring that Pappas is ''unelectable.'' To
buttress their point, they sent around a videotape showing Pappas
singing a ditty on the House floor called ''Twinkle Twinkle Kenneth
Starr.'' Holt made effective use of the performance in his winning
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas' campaign chairman, Jack Grimes, denounced the
circulation of the tape as ''negative politics,'' and suggested
Zimmer had a hand in it. The Zimmer camp denied it.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices are rising, and so is the political maneuvering
around the issue.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have retreated on their plan to seek gasoline
tax relief -- but only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is expected to come up this coming week in the Senate,
notwithstanding a provision in the Constitution that gives the
House sole power to originate tax legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of the Senate GOP proposal calls for a
temporary gas tax ''holiday'' of the 4.3 cent-per-gallon surtax
that was imposed in 1993. Vice President Al Gore broke a pair of
tie votes in 1993 that passed that provision into law, a fact that
Republicans are expected to emphasize.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP proposal also provides for a suspension of the entire
18.6 cent federal tax if gasoline prices rise above $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the gasoline tax goes into a trust fund that pays
for highway construction, and Republicans are expected to propose
using money from the projected non-Social Security budget surplus
so the highway fund is protected. The gas tax relief would be
scaled back if it appeared the surplus wasn't big enough to
accommodate the change.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Senators may get to vote on two proposed constitutional
amendments this week that deal with the First Amendment's free
speech guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will seek a vote on a proposal, backed by more than
50 senators, to permit legislation to outlaw flag desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina may propose an
alternative. It would allow Congress to pass laws limiting the size
of campaign contributions for federal races and permit states to do
the same for state or local races.
</P>
<P>
   Neither proposal is expected to achieve the two-thirds majority
necessary to pass.

<HEADLINE> Icon Paintings Exhibited in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Religious art was in official disfavor in the
Soviet Union, and American visitors to Soviet Russia often tried to
pick up bargains in painted religious icons, an art form that goes
back more than a millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian Cultural Centre in Washington is in the building
that used to hold the Soviet visa office, where Americans went for
permission to visit Russia. Beginning Monday, the center will host
an exhibit of icons by a painter who carries on the ancient
tradition today, Alexander Sokolov. It's a joint show with his
wife, Maria Veshnyak, who paints in a more recent and realistic
style.
</P>
<P>
   She comes from a family of painters and specializes in
landscape, but her subjects include monasteries, churches and other
religious subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Icon painting in the traditional style continued under the
Soviets, but it was a private thing, like baptism,'' Natalie
Batova, the center's director, said in an interview. ''I was
baptized.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet era, members of the Communist Party had to profess
atheism, and a religious background hindered professional
advancement. Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, made a
career in the KGB, however, even though he was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Now Batova shows off her center's own icon of St. Nicholas,
revered by many Russians as a patron of education. Teaching is
among the center's jobs, and Batova stopped to greet a Russian
language class on the way from her office to the reception room
where the icon hangs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ordered it last year, and when it came in, we couldn't tell
it from an old one,'' she said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Painters base icons on ancient traditions, emphasizing symbolism
and spiritual values. The figures' ritual gestures and stiff
figures make no attempt at realism. The art is being actively
revived and the demand among Russians is so great that schools for
icon painters are being set up.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov entered the movement early when he became founder of a
new school in Poland and has since taught in Japan as well as
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Batova also displayed a Russian Orthodox church calendar for
this year, decorated with reproductions of brightly colored icons
painted by Sokolov.
</P>
<P>
   A biographical note by critic Irina Yazykova calls Sokolov ''one
of the outstanding modern iconographers of Russia.'' She cites an
image of the ''Virgin of the Inexhaustible Cup'' that he painted
for a Russian monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ''This icon became very popular,'' she wrote, ''not only because
this icon heals the illness of drinking but because it is a
creation of heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The icon shows the Virgin Mary, with a cup in front of her and
an image of the child Jesus emerging from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Classical Iconography'' and ''Traditional Russian Realism''
will be at the Russian Cultural Centre, 1835 Phelps Place N.W.,
Washington, until April 6. Admission is $5.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court to resolve hate crime sentencing dispute  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE BURNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Charles Apprendi Jr. says he was high on
alcohol and drugs -- not filled with racial hatred -- when he fired
shots into the home of a black family in his predominantly white
Vineland neighborhood in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just criminal mischief. That's all it was. I had no
idea it was a black family's home,'' he now insists.
</P>
<P>
   A judge saw it differently. He determined that Apprendi's
actions were motivated by prejudice and imposed a longer prison
term under New Jersey's hate crime law, one of the first adopted in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi, 47, is challenging his sentence in a case to be argued
before the U.S. Supreme Court this week. His lawyers argue that a
jury -- using the most stringent burden of proof -- should have
determined whether the crime was motivated by bias and warranted
the additional penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our question is how and to whom do you prove it,'' said
Richard Singer, a professor at Rutgers-Camden Law School assisting
in the appeal. ''Our argument is that anything that dramatically
affects the sentenced should be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has called
the case one of the most important to be decided this session by
the court. Oral arguments are scheduled for Tuesday. A decision is
expected by June.
</P>
<P>
   While the appeal does not directly challenge New Jersey's Hate
Crimes Act, which was upheld by the state Supreme Court in 1994, it
could have far-reaching implications on judges' power to mete out
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, a judge can add years to a sentence based on a
''preponderance of evidence.'' Apprendi's lawyers will argue that
the hate-crime issue should have been treated as an element of the
offense and decided by a jury using the highest legal standard --
whether prosecutors had proved racial bias beyond a reasonable
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will have the potential of restricting the freedom of a
judge to sentence more harshly,'' said criminal defense lawyer Carl
Poplar of Blackwood.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was one of the first states to adopt a hate crime
law, in 1981. It bans acts of racial or ethnic intimidation, such
as burning crosses or painting swastikas. The law was expanded in
1990 to provide stiffer penalties for such common crimes as assault
and harassment if prejudice played a part in selecting the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all states now have similar laws that provide for extra
punishment when crime victims are targeted because of their race,
religion or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi's 12-year sentence is about three years longer because
of the racial bias finding. He has served about one-third of his
sentence and is now in a halfway house in Camden. His case is
expected to go before a state parole board in May.
</P>
<P>
   Apprendi admitted he fired four or five shots into the house at
2 a.m., telling police he wanted to give the family who lived there
a message that they did not belong in his neighborhood. No one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   But Apprendi later said he was unfairly pressured into giving
police a false statement, and that his gunfire really had been
randomly directed when the house's purple front door caught his
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a rational state of mind and unimpaired, I would have never
thought of shooting in someone's house,'' Apprendi said during a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to a firearms violation and possessing a bomb
in his house, all of which carried a maximum 10-year prison
sentence. At a plea hearing, he admitted his purpose for shooting
at the house was to frighten the family.
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors sought a stiffened sentence under the hate
crimes law, the trial judge imposed the 12-year term, saying
prosecutors had offered persuasive evidence that Apprendi's act was
racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld his sentence by a 5-2 vote
last June. The court determined that the law does not violate
constitutional rights, saying it clearly requires proof of a bias
crime.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Gov. Wants Meth Labs Cleaned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne asked President
Clinton to put more federal money to a Drug Enforcement Agency
program that helps states clean up dangerous methamphetamine
laboratories shut down by local law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time a meth lab is shut down, we're left with a toxic
time bomb. And the more labs that we put out of business, the more
time bombs are left ticking,'' Kempthorne said Saturday in the
Republicans' weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA told state and local agencies this month that cleanup
money supposed to last until the end of September has been used up.
It can cost as much as $10,000 to dispose of chemicals and
equipment left when an illegal lab is closed.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine, also known as meth or speed, ''remains one of
the most dangerous substances America has ever confronted,'' White
House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey said at a congressional
committee hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   DEA spokesman Terry Parham said the agency would try to work
with the Department of Justice and Congress to get more money, but
the outlook so far is bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ''DEA resources, particularly in the area of clandestine lab
cleanup, are extremely limited and will be provided to state and
local law enforcement agencies on a first come, first served
basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last budget provided $5 million specifically for the DEA's
hazardous waste disposal program. This year the Clinton
administration budget circumvents the DEA and gives money directly
to a certain, limited number of state and local law enforcement
agencies for cleaning up, which leaves some local agencies without
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Kempthorne said an alliance of federal, state and local law
enforcement has had great success in breaking up meth labs in
Idaho, which saw a 74 percent increase in the number of labs shut
down last year. But more seizures means more toxic materials to
clean up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminals who produce meth leave behind extremely poisonous and
environmentally hazardous byproducts, Kempthorne said. In one Idaho
case, he said, a suspect was caught dumping chemicals out the
window of a house next door to a church preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies in several other states, including Utah
and Oklahoma, also are searching for replacement money.
</P>
<P>
   Kempthorne wants the House to deal with the situation next week
when it takes up an emergency appropriations bill for the fiscal
year ending Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''When states can't clean up meth labs, I'd say that constitutes
an emergency,'' he said. ''There's no room for drugs in our society
-- not as a deadly enterprise, and not as a toxic legacy.''

<HEADLINE> Bizarre Twists Lead Up to Oscars  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood's finest screenwriters would have
trouble matching the odd twists leading up to this year's Oscars.
It's been a bit like the limo ride from hell.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup to Hollywood's big night included misplaced Academy
Awards ballots and stolen statues, culminating in the discovery of
the missing Oscars by a salvager foraging around trash bins where
the trophies had been dumped.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy's cherished secrecy was threatened, first by a Web
site that claimed it had an advance list of potential nominees,
then by a Wall Street Journal story that polled Oscar voters to
prophesy how the awards might shake out.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the nominees, as unlikely a lot as the staid
Academy has seen in years. Sweeping epics in the vein of
''Schindler's List,'' ''The English Patient'' and ''Titanic''
definitely are out this year.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are such flicks as the morbidly funny family
satire ''American Beauty,'' the ghostly blockbuster ''The Sixth
Sense,'' and ''The Cider House Rules,'' which has a classic Oscar
look but delivers a clear message favoring women's right to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the mix are the supernatural prison saga ''The Green
Mile,'' the tobacco-whistleblower thriller ''The Insider,'' the
nuthouse drama ''Girl, Interrupted,'' the wildly eclectic
''Magnolia,'' the gender-bending ''Boys Don't Cry,'' the demented
''Being John Malkovich'' and the murderous ''The Talented Mr.
Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   And consider this: The one G-rated film among nominees in top
categories, ''The Straight Story,'' comes from director David
Lynch, who made such emotionally and visually disturbing movies as
''Eraserhead'' and ''Blue Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   Another certified family movie among nominees in leading
categories, ''Music of the Heart,'' was directed by horror maestro
Wes Craven. Oscar perennial Meryl Streep is up for best actress for
the film, tying Katharine Hepburn for most acting nominations with
12.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar's infatuation with all things British continued, with a
twist. Six of the 20 acting nominees are British or Australian, but
five adopt American accents and the sixth, Samantha Morton in
''Sweet and Lowdown,'' plays an American who is mute.
</P>
<P>
   The one British accent is donned by North Carolina-born Julianne
Moore in ''The End of the Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange as the Oscar contenders turned out, Hollywood's big
night has almost been overshadowed by outside circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   A day before nominations came out Feb. 15, a Web site posted
what it claimed was a short list from which nominees would be
drawn. The information proved false.
</P>
<P>
   Academy executives reacted with irritation over reports that The
Wall Street Journal was surveying voters. The newspaper ran a story
Friday based on interviews with 356 of the 5,607 Academy voters,
predicting ''American Beauty'' would win best picture, Hilary Swank
would take best actress for ''Boys Don't Cry'' and ''The
Hurricane's'' Denzel Washington would narrowly win best actor.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy had already had to send new ballots to most of its
members after 4,000 voting forms got lost in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The finishing touch came when 55 Oscars were stolen March 8 from
the shipping company hired to deliver the statues. An employee of
the company was charged with grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   All but three Oscars were found in a garbage bin last weekend by
Willie Fulgear, who scavenges trash for a living.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy has rolled with the punches, holding a news
conference to announce the disappearance of the statues and joining
the police briefing to celebrate their recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Academy executive director Bruce Davis jokingly warned Oscar
host Billy Crystal to stay away from Bell, Calif., the community
where the ballots and statues vanished, because it ''seems to be a
Bermuda Triangle for Oscar things.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Academy officials are bracing, again good-naturedly, for the
inevitable ribbing Crystal will dish out over the mishaps come
Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very, very, very weird year,'' said Academy
spokesman John Pavlik.
</P>
<P>
   On with the show.

<HEADLINE> Rally in N.Y. After Police Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of mourners filled the streets of a
New York City neighborhood Saturday to express outrage once again
at a police shooting of an unarmed black man, this time a Haitian
immigrant who rebuffed an undercover officer's request for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A hearse carrying the body of 26-year-old Patrick Dorismond led
the miles-long protest march of mourners. Many demanded the mayor's
resignation over the police killing of another unarmed man.
</P>
<P>
   Earsplitting shrieks and hysterical shouts accompanied the
honking of car horns as protesters knocked down police barricades.
</P>
<P>
   A car driving the wrong way on the street was plastered with
banners, including some that read: ''If you shoot one of my
children, I shoot five of you'' and ''Rudy Giuliani, shoot one of
my children and your son Andrew will go to his grave''
</P>
<P>
   A man walking through a crush of people shouted: ''Rudy, I'll
blow you up to kingdom come, cut you with a chain saw, and feed you
to the dogs!''
</P>
<P>
   Another protester's sign named others caught up in police-linked
violence: ''Diallo, Louima, Baez, Bumpers, enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our blood, it's not cheap. We must let them know this
must stop,'' said Michel Eddy, a 26-year-old Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, the son of Haitian singer Andre Dorismond, was
fatally shot March 16 during a scuffle with an undercover police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The officer allegedly approached Dorismond, a security guard, as
part of a drug sting and asked if he would sell him marijuana. The
scuffle ensued, backup officers arrived and one officer's gun went
off, killing Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth shooting of an unarmed black civilian by
undercover officers in the city in the past 13 months and came only
a few weeks after an Albany jury acquitted four white undercover
officers in the shooting of Amadou Diallo, who died in a hail of 41
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   As Dorismond's coffin was brought out from the funeral home
draped in Haitian and American flags, what had started as a quiet
family gathering grew into a loud protest march of at least 2,500
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton headed the procession with supporters
hoisting a banner that read ''Justice for Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani came under fire after the shooting for
releasing information from Dorismond's police record, including
sealed juvenile files, and for not visiting Dorismond's family.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Dumont, 26, a Haitian-born Brooklyn resident, compared
Haiti's decades of military rule with America's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Dorismond took her son out of a military regime and
brought him here because she thought it would be better and safer,
but Giuliani and the way he's empowered the police have proved her
wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Dorismond's wake Friday evening, thousands paid their
respects as sobs drifted through the largely Haitian crowd of
family, friends and supporters.
</P>
<P>
   One mourner, Blaise Lambre, described Dorismond as ''a person
who just enjoyed life,'' and he blamed Giuliani for failing to show
sympathy for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Picture somebody you grew up with, played in the same building
with, did everything with,'' Lambre said. ''I'm angry at the fact
that he died. ... It was wrong. To me, it's murder, simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton and police brutality victim Abner Louima, also a
Haitian immigrant, were among those at the wake.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has happened too much and it's only happening in our
community,'' said Sharpton. ''We must ask God to give us strength
that in Patrick's name this can stop.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Campaign Dominated by Hussein  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's parliament campaign has been devoid
of debate, short on issues and dominated by one personality --
Saddam Hussein, the 62-year-old president who has ruled absolutely
since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As Iraqis vote Monday, their old-style politics are especially
striking coming so soon after neighbor and rival Iran showed that
elections in the Middle East can be open, lively, driven by voter
concerns -- and even surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Religious hard-liners in Iran suffered a landslide defeat in the
February election, losing their grip on Parliament for the first
time since the Islamic revolution that coincided with Saddam's rise
to power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Iran was rewarded with overtures from Europe and the United
States to end its international isolation. But Saddam is not making
what he likely sees as the Iranian hard-liners' mistake -- allowing
a breath of reform that grew into a wind threatening to sweep away
the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   The last Iraqi parliamentary elections, in 1996, saw most
incumbents re-elected. More of the same is expected this time,
thanks to a system that favors Saddam's status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have to be either members of Saddam's Baath Party or
nominal independents loyal to the government. The government
forbids election rallies and manifestos and severely limits
candidates' use of radio, television and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 522 candidates for the 250 National Assembly seats
was allowed just 10 simple banners, 300 cards to distribute to
voters and 400 black-and-white, letter-sized posters. That
contrasts with the permanent, full-color, billboard-size depictions
of Saddam everywhere in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also know it's a good thing to mention allegiance
to Saddam in their campaign speeches. Even better, drop his name
twice. Best of all, be related to him.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's eldest son, Odai, who is seeking a legislative seat for
the first time, didn't appear at a meet-the-candidates forum in his
Baghdad ward days before the vote. But all the moderator had to do
was mention his name to get the most enthusiastic applause of the
hour-long event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was impressed by the son of the president,'' laborer Fakher
Hussein said afterward, fingering a string of amber prayer beads.
''He is the son of the symbol of Iraq, and I know his
achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Assembly has little power. Its influence could
change if Odai Hussein becomes a member, but for now the assembly
can only make recommendations to the Revolutionary Command Council,
which is the highest authority in the country and is led by Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi dissidents living in exile dismiss the parliament and the
voting as a sham. No such criticism is heard in Iraq, where Saddam
deals ruthlessly with dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi writer Hassan Abdul Hameed bristled at any suggestion
Iraq's democracy is less than democratic. In Iraq, he said, a
candidate can't use personal wealth to influence voters and is
encouraged to cooperate rather than compete with other politicians
for the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do people try to describe our experience as false?'' Abdul
Hameed said. ''Maybe some people accuse people in the Third World
of being suppressed by their governments. But I've traveled; I've
seen people in other countries ask, for example, that their
parliaments lift sanctions on Iraq. And they get no results. So,
where is the democracy?''
</P>
<P>
   The 100 or so voters gathered at the candidate forum heard a
domestic policy discussion that centered on pledges to ''follow the
suggestions of President Saddam Hussein.'' That line from Saadoun
Hamadi, speaker of the departing parliament, drew sustained
applause.
</P>
<P>
   None of the candidates took questions, and each spoke for just a
few minutes. No speech was so short as to lack praise for Saddam,
and no one in the audience would be caught failing to applaud
vigorously at every mention.
</P>
<P>
   The clampdown on political expression much beyond praise for
Saddam has stifled debate on issues of vital concern -- the economy,
crippled first by the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and then by U.N.
sanctions in effect since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990; drought;
stalled peace talks with Iran. Iran and Iraq fought a draining
eight-year war that ended in 1988, but relations remain strained.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 candidates in the ward where Hamadi and Odai Hussein
are running, the top five vote-getters will take a place in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   About 8.5 million of Iraq's 22 million people are eligible to
vote. Most are expected to turn up at the polls Monday -- Saddam
strongly encourages participation.

<HEADLINE> Gary Coleman Taking Date to Oscars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A marketing analyst who paid $4,000 for
her dream date with Gary Coleman is getting a second outing with
the actor, and this time it won't cost her a dime.
</P>
<P>
   The former ''Diff'rent Strokes'' star planned to take
23-year-old Jennifer Vanlerberghe to the Academy Awards in Los
Angeles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just for kicks,'' Vanlerberghe said Friday. ''I mean, I
get to go to the Oscars.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanlerberghe, who lives in Charlotte, and Coleman went on their
first date after she bid on him in December during UGO.com's Web
auction to raise money for the bankrupt actor.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is a columnist for UGO.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needed a date, and we thought of Jen,'' said UGO.com
publicist Sabine Heller.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Robert Danes loaned her a $3,500 gown to wear -- and
yes, the 6-foot-2 former basketball player will don heels.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nazi Plot Outlined in Papers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Half-century-old documents of Italy's Defense
Department cite an attempt by ex-Nazi officers to mobilize Hitler's
old military to restore greater Germany, a news service reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1953-54 scheme reached an advanced stage of planning under
the protection of then-Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, the Italian
intelligence reports claim, according to Italy's AGI news service,
saying it had obtained the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged plot was outlined in Italian Defense Department
reports outlining intelligence gathered by Italian officials in
Bonn, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   AGI cited no independent verification of the documents or of the
reliability of the information they contained.
</P>
<P>
   The documents claim former Nazi Gen. Heinz Guderian presided
over meetings of other ex-Nazi officers in the early 1950s. The
former officers estimated they had at their disposal 550,000
members of the fallen Reich's army and other military branches, the
Italian news agency said, citing the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The plotters noted that ''the reorganization and rearming of our
(military) can be assisted by our gold in safekeeping in Swiss
banks,'' AGI quoted the documents as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Nazi officers aimed at reunifying Cold War-divided
Germany and saw as their enemies the French, the British and
Communists, according to AGI.
</P>
<P>
   ''The German general staff, rebuilt in large part with old Nazi
elements, is in full activity for the rebirth and regrowth'' of the
Reich army, the Italian intelligence reports noted, according to
AGI.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chancellor Kohl Upset Over Snub  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who went from the hero
of German unification to a political pariah after he admitted
operating illegal slush funds while in office, doesn't like the way
his old party colleagues are snubbing him.
</P>
<P>
   In a magazine interview released Saturday, the man who led the
conservative Christian Democrats with an iron grip from 1973 to
1998 complained that many who used to jostle to be at his side now
don't even want to be seen with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Earlier they couldn't tip their hat deep enough, and today
they cross the street so they don't have to say hello,'' Kohl told
Munich-based Focus magazine. ''That's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has angered many fellow conservatives for refusing to
identify the source of some $1 million in undeclared campaign
donations he accepted between 1993 and 1998, insisting he promised
the donors to keep their identities secret.
</P>
<P>
   He has raised new funds -- more than $3.5 million so far, he told
Focus -- to cover fines expected to be levied against the Christian
Democrats for failing to declare that income.
</P>
<P>
   But his silence about the original donors has fueled speculation
that the money was given in return for political favors, something
Kohl has vehemently denied. Parliament is investigating the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl told Focus he also remembered accepting cash donations as
far back as 1989, although he did not say how much or whether that
money was properly booked. He said people gave the money because
they wanted ''that I and the (Christian Democratic) Union win'' the
first postunification election in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Margulies Wants Clooney Back on ER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actress Julianna Margulies is determined to get
former co-star George Clooney back on ''ER'' for her last episode.
</P>
<P>
   Margulies tells the New York Daily News in Saturday's editions
that she calls Clooney's answering machine every day pleading,
''Help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, who played Dr. Doug Ross, left the NBC show last year.
Margulies departs at the end of this season. Her character, nurse
Carol Hathaway, and Ross split, although she became pregnant and
gave birth to twins.
</P>
<P>
   Having Clooney appear on her last episode could help tie up
loose ends, the actress says.
</P>
<P>
   But Clooney told a meeting of the Television Critics Association
in Pasadena last month that no one has talked to him about
returning to the show so the fictional couple could reunite.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Margulies said she is happy with her decision to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six years was enough,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> President Derides Tobacco Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Congress should give the Food and
Drug Administration power to regulate tobacco, thus bypassing a
Supreme Court ruling that the FDA lacks that power, President
Clinton said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a partisan issue. It's a health issue for our
nation and a life-or-death issue for children,'' the president said
in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled last week that the FDA does not hold the
authority to regulate tobacco, a legal substance. That makes
congressional action vital, said Clinton, speaking during a trip to
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball is in Congress' court. They should ... give the FDA's
tobacco regulations the force of law,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   A leading House Republican denied that intercession by Congress
is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., urged Clinton to provide ''moral
leadership'' by using the bully pulpit of the presidency to help
reduce the incidence of smoking by children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of putting forth a courageous program, like Mrs.
(Nancy) Reagan's 'Just say no' campaign against drug use, President
Clinton passes the buck and tells the American people, 'The ball is
in Congress' court,''' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said in its 5-4 decision that by reversing a
decades-old policy in 1996 and cracking down on cigarette sales to
minors, the FDA was exercising an authority not granted it by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the high court's decision was ''a setback for the
health of our children.'' But he noted that the majority opinion
labeled smoking ''perhaps the most significant threat to health in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people know this. They've known it for a long
time,'' Clinton said. ''Preventing our children from smoking is our
common responsibility. It's a fight we can win, and one we must
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants Congress to grant the FDA authority to enforce
regulations that prevent children under 18 from buying tobacco
products and impose new regulations that would end tobacco
advertising aimed at young people.
</P>
<P>
   Any effort to regulate the tobacco industry faces strong
obstacles in Congress, as witnessed two years ago when the Senate
defeated an ambitious antismoking plan championed by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan would have raised $516 billion over 25 years from
increased cigarette taxes, bolstered antismoking campaigns and
given the FDA authority to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain bill had majority support but fell three short of
getting the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Many
Republicans said they couldn't accept it because the bill, by
increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes, violated their
promise not to impose new taxes.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Promises Trimmer, Hipper Show  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Richard Zanuck and Lili Fini Zanuck were
feeling like winners, even with the Academy Awards still ahead.
Brad Pitt had agreed to be a presenter at Sunday's ceremony
produced by the husband-and-wife team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did call us and tell us that he'd like to be in the show.
We just thought that was wonderful, a wonderful gesture, and we're
thrilled by it,'' Zanuck said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hollywood golden boy, however, appeared to be a lost
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've decided to lay off Leonardo,'' Fini Zanuck said two
weeks before the ceremony. ''We've let Leonardo know enough we
wanted him, so let's give him a break now.''
</P>
<P>
   If Leonardo DiCaprio was off the hook, the Zanucks were
otherwise unrelenting in their effort to restore excitement to a
ceremony that has slipped in the regard of the public and Hollywood
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for last year's bloated, four-hour-plus affair
plummeted. And Zanuck, 65, who was steeped in decades of Academy
Award tradition as the son of studio mogul Darryl F. Zanuck, can
attest to insiders' dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The industry celebrated itself. Everybody in town fought to
get into the presentation,'' he recalled. Now, he says, ''stars
don't go to the show unless they're involved in it somehow. They
just don't go to be a part of the evening, which is kind of sad in
a way but that's what it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zanucks, Oscar winners themselves for producing the 1989
Best Picture ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' are trying to bring back the
glamour -- by moving into the future.
</P>
<P>
   They promise the 72nd Academy Awards broadcast (8 p.m. EST on
ABC) will be sharpened by new technology, including the use of
high-definition masters to cut the movie clips that highlight major
awards categories. (The leading nominees include the dark suburban
satire ''American Beauty'' and the coming-of-age drama ''The Cider
House Rules.'')
</P>
<P>
   There will be a more international flavor to acknowledge that
filmmaking extends beyond Hollywood, the Zanucks said. Presenters
will include Chinese actor Chow Yun-fat and Spain's Penelope Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   To tighten the ceremony, the Zanucks have banished the dance
numbers that sometimes proved real groaners, such as Rob Lowe's
spin with Snow White in 1989 or last year's ''Saving Private Ryan''
tap demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that viewers are now accustomed to the quicker cuts of
movies and television, the producers say the show's pacing and
editing will be improved.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated songs and scores will be presented in a way that
recognizes how important music has become in films and how aware
audiences are of soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dick and I are real purists about this,'' Fini Zanuck said.
''We not only asked the artist to perform (their nominated song)
but with the musicians of their choice. So, for instance, Aimee
Mann will be doing ''Save Me'' (from ''Magnolia'') with her band.
... Phil Collins will perform his song (''You'll Be in My Heart''
from ''Tarzan'') exactly the way he's chosen to.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men in charge of the music, Burt Bacharach and Don Was,
demonstrate the Zanucks' deep industry roots. Bacharach wrote the
Oscar-winning ''Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'' and the score
for Fox's ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' back when Zanuck
was in charge of the studio. Record producer Was was recruited by
Fini Zanuck, who has created music videos for Eric Clapton and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Having friends in the business, however, wasn't entirely a plus
for the Oscar producers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody has a vision of how the show should be conducted so
we've had to listen to that from our friends,'' said Zanuck, who
knows they'll also face a lot of second-guessing after the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stupid advice was, 'Have you thought about getting Billy
Crystal?' Yeah,'' said Fini Zanuck.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal is so good as Oscar host he can make Whoopi Goldberg and
David Letterman look bad, so getting him was the obvious first
move.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's probably the biggest decision the producer of the show
has to make,'' Zanuck said. The host ''has to be someone who
everybody likes, who's funny, charming, who can be spontaneous, and
Billy is all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People really like him on this show. They want to see him,
they want to see what he's going to do,'' said Fini Zanuck,
referring to Crystal's past crowd-pleasing openings in which he
spoofed the nominees in song and costume.
</P>
<P>
   So what's he going to do Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know and we're not telling,'' said Fini Zanuck.
</P>
<P>
   Corrected her husband: ''We DO know, but we're not telling.''
</P>
<P>
   Head writer Bruce Vilanch, an Oscar veteran, says Crystal makes
the ceremony a ''big party'' where anything can happen. Vilanch and
his team will be poised to capitalize on those unexpected moments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep writing the show right through the show,'' he said.
''Our big night was the night that Jack Palance did the one-arm
pushups, and we had to toss out what we had and start writing anew.
... You always hope that somebody will do something, because it's a
spontaneous event.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanuck predicts that the ceremony will come in, without counting
commercials, at ''three hours and 14 minutes of pure solid
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Their post-Oscar plans already are in place, the couple said.
Richard Zanuck is flying to Idaho on Monday morning to catch up on
the skiing he's missed working on the show. ''I'm not disclosing my
location,'' Fini Zanuck said, jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she's off to Paris to work on a music video for Faith
Hill and Tim McGraw a couple of days after the ceremony. But there
is something she would like kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really hope that everybody enjoys the show -- and if they
don't, they keep it to themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Panic Subsides in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Though an end of the disastrous floods
finally is in sight for this poor southeast African country,
Mozambicans face an enormous challenge -- rebuilding their nation
and their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The floods swept away the homes or livelihoods of one in 10 of
the population of 19 million. An estimated 650,000 will depend on
emergency aid for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   The surging water damaged more than 600 primary schools, wrecked
more than 625 miles of roads and downed 250 miles of power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Crops in fertile river valleys in central and southern
Mozambique have been destroyed. Large tracts of land remain
submerged by water and thick soft mud. Seeds, farm tools -- even the
little money they had in their huts -- just floated away.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding it all will be an expensive and lengthy process. The
bill for emergency aid for just the coming six months has been
estimated at $165 million.
</P>
<P>
   A World Bank-led assessment of reconstruction costs is expected
to be released next week, forming the basis for an international
aid appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Though the floods robbed the nation of many of its resources,
President Joachim Chissano said the people's spirit had not been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Validating his remarks are countless heroic acts and displays of
generosity and courage by ordinary Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
   The panic that characterized early relief efforts also is gone.
Most military operations from other nations are about to end with
the rescue work out of the way, and most aid is being smoothly
directly to where it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, officials see an end to the rainfall that has
battered the nation for more than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We seem to have a handle on the food delivery systems,'' said
Dean Curran, U.S. ambassador to Mozambique. ''So far, the major
epidemics have been avoided, but the challenges are huge, the
ecosystems are fragile, the ground is saturated with water, the
reservoirs are full, and we are not out of the rainy season yet.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the lessons learned, Curran said, was the need to quickly
disseminate information, thereby raising international awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no substitute for touching the cord of humanity on
these things. Governments move more quickly when they know their
people are concerned about a situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The international humanitarian response also had to be better
coordinated, and greater use had to be made of the military's
specialist expertise and logistical capabilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Curran was optimistic about Mozambique's possibilities to get
back on its feet, and the willingness of other countries to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt Mozambicans are resilient people,'' he said.
''They are ready to pick up and move ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Peace in Holy Land Remains Elusive  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel (AP) -- Jesus' hometown turned out en masse to
cheer John Paul II in the waning hours of his Jubilee pilgrimage,
but the pope passed by yet another new quarrel in the ancient Holy
Land.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth, a city of Muslim and Christian Arabs in a Jewish
state, symbolizes what has been clear all along: Even for an
indefatigable Holy Father respected on all sides, bringing peace to
biblical landscape is a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   ''Baba! Baba!'' thousands shouted Saturday as the pope went by,
sandwiched in a security convoy. They pressed against metal
barriers fencing off a phalanx of police. Sharpshooters with
long-range binoculars lined the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Basilica of the Annunciation, built where the angel
Gabriel is believed to have told Mary she would bear the son of
God, the pontiff passed the cornerstone of a mosque dedicated to an
Islamic hero who fought the Crusaders. Christians are angry about
the planned mosque, whose towering minaret would rise high against
the basilica's dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis approved it as freedom of religion, but
Christians say they did it to drive a wedge between us and the
Muslims,'' said Joseph Banna, a Christian in a souvenir store he
has run across from the site for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down, in her father's memorabilia shop, Reem Mazawi,
21, said she thought the pope's visit would forestall construction
of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are starting to feel our power as Christians,'' she said.
''The Muslims only proved that if you just go and stay there and
scream, you get what you want. That's not the right message.''
</P>
<P>
   Rana Fahoum, a Muslim professor at Hebrew University who came
home to watch the pope pass by her father's main street cafe,
blamed outside troublemakers for exaggerating the conflict and
inventing extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Muslim terrorism in Nazareth?'' she said, rolling her eyes at
what she considered an absurdity. ''Excuse me? Hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Nazareth, there was dissension even among Catholics.
After John Paul left town, a silent vigil in nearby Kana protested
that their Wedding Church was ignored. Jesus turned water into wine
there -- his first miracle, the Bible says.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a political issue,'' said Elias Zahr, the organizer.
''When Pope Paul VI came in 1964, Israeli security said it was not
safe for him to enter Kana. We think it is the same thing this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, such accusations and disappointments have
blunted some enthusiasm for the papal pilgrimage, as reality bumps
against great expectations at almost every stop.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every community seemed thrilled with the visit and yet
the bases of divisive strife remain unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Israel, John Paul spent his first day in the
Palestinian territories, saying Mass on Manger Square in Bethlehem,
meeting with Yasser Arafat and then telling refugee children at
Dheisheh Camp that he understood their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Although he expressed clear sympathy for Palestinian rights, he
made no clear endorsement for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, at the Yad Vashem monument to the Holocaust, he
said the church was ''saddened'' but made no explicit apologies for
a Holy See that looked the other way as Hitler systematically
exterminated 6 million Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure in the long run if this visit will leave an
impact,'' Rana Fahoum said. ''But now, it's wonderful. People
talked too much about the millennium and got little. They thought
the pope would give what they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before John Paul left Rome, the Vatican made clear his
purpose was spiritual, not political. He would pray for peace but
not attempt to negotiate it.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the disappointment was commercial. Merchants, hotel
keepers and tourism officials hoped many more people would come to
the Holy Land to be part of the holy pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Others reported a more personal letdown.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, 11-year-old Rizek Andary waved a yellow and white
Vatican flag and still had on the John Paul II T-shirt he wore to
the outdoor Mass on the Mount of Beatitudes, an hour north in
Korazim. ''We are very much happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his friend Elias Lulu, also 11, looked doubtful. Asked what
he hoped the pope would bring, he replied: ''A chocolate rosary.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovars Remember Milosevic Victims  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CELINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Old women placed their hands on the
graves, sobbing in anguish and calling out names as they remembered
the 82 ethnic Albanians -- including 11 children -- killed here last
year by Yugoslav forces in revenge for NATO's bombing of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The women were among the thousands who gathered in Celina on
Saturday, about 30 miles southwest of Kosovo's capital of Pristina,
to honor the dead. They say President Slobodan Milosevic's
paramilitary forces began streaming in March 25, 1999, lining up
the civilians, shooting them outside their homes and then burning
many of the corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The Celina killings were never widely reported, as they came
only one day after NATO started bombing Yugoslavia, dominated by
the Serbia republic. In early April, the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army, which has since disbanded, circulated reports of the killings
in Celina.
</P>
<P>
   Selman Zeqiri lost 10 members of his family, including his wife
and two of his children. Only his 12-year-old son survived as a
witness to the events.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we were asking for NATO air attacks we didn't believe, we
didn't think, that they (Serbs) would attack women and children,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The children,'' he repeated quietly, staring off into the
distance. ''This we didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeqiri, who was working in Germany at the time of the attack,
had no ill words for the alliance, seeing the 78-day air campaign
as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the only solution for us,'' he said. ''Maybe it
wouldn't have been this family, but it would have been some
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed in the 18-month
crackdown carried out by Milosevic's forces to stop attacks by the
KLA. Once NATO bombs began to fall, Milosevic's forces intensified
their efforts to expel ethnic Albanians from the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's bombing campaign finally forced Milosevic to
withdraw his troops. But in the eight months since NATO-led
peacekeepers and a U.N. mission have been in charge of Kosovo,
revenge-minded attacks by ethnic Albanians have chased nearly all
200,000 Serbs from the province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeepers, meanwhile, detained a young ethnic Albanian
on charges of killing a Russian peacekeeper. The teen was taken
into custody by Spanish soldiers working in western Kosovo, NATO
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the U.S. Army accused a peacekeeper of falsely
reporting that he was shot by a sniper while on guard duty. The
Army said Spc. Buddie Deal shot himself in the leg Feb. 11 to avoid
service in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Saturday's gathering in Celina, people filed into a
schoolhouse to see a display of photographs taken by a local man,
Hamdi Fazliu. Particularly striking was the gruesome photograph of
a 2-year-old child whose bloody body lay twisted in a ditch, a
gunshot wound in her skull.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason I did this exhibition, is to remind people in
the international community, because lately they are accusing us of
ethnic cleansing,'' Fazliu said. ''This is the truth of what
happened here, and this is only one village in Kosovo.''

<HEADLINE> Mich. HMO Doctors Vote To Unionize  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Doctors with a Michigan health maintenance
organization have agreed to organize under the American Medical
Association's bargaining arm, making them the first physicians to
join the union.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians for Responsible Negotiation was formed last year by
the AMA in response to what it described as increasing workload and
financial pressures being placed on doctors by HMOs and other
managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven Wellness Plan doctors voted March 9 in favor of
organizing and eight against it, Dr. Susan Hershberg Adelman, PRN's
president, said Friday. Three doctors didn't vote.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Abhay Mehendale, a Detroit pediatrician who has been with
the HMO for 15 years, said he hopes unionizing will ease his
frustration over working without a contract for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will never strike, and patient care will never suffer,'' he
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Wellness Plan executives refused to comment Friday and were not
in their office Saturday. They previously have made clear they are
not in favor of unionization, which they claim could radically
change the 140,000-member HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Federal antitrust laws ban most of the nation's 650,000 doctors
from joining a union because they are self-employed. Only doctors
who are employed by a hospital or municipality, for example, may
unionize. About 110,000 doctors are in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden by its bylaws from striking, the PRN will supply the
expertise that doctors need to form bargaining groups and help them
negotiate in states where it's legal.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The very notion of President Hillary Rodham
Clinton is helping Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, his allies and
conservative groups raise money in their effort to keep her out of
the United States Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It's even helping to sell books for former Ronald Reagan
speechwriter Peggy Noonan.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though the first lady says there's no truth to the
speculation, some Democrats believe the thought at least crosses
her mind from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not just any Senate race ... I expect she will use her
Senate seat as a springboard to become a leading Democrat prospect
to run for president,'' Republican Giuliani said in a recent
fund-raising letter to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP's Web site is also in on the President Clinton II
act.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton money machine has already said they will raise $25
million to buy our U.S. Senate seat and we all know her driving
ambition is to be president,'' state GOP Chairman William Powers
tells browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she wins in New York it will only be a matter of time
before she announces for president ... This is our best chance to
stop another Clinton from taking the White House,'' Powers added.
''Working together we will put an end to Hillary's 'Blind Ambition
Tour.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''But worst of all, the U.S. Senate may not be Hillary Rodham
Clinton's ultimate goal,'' the Citizens for a Sound Economy
Political Action Committee wrote in a recent fund-raising letter.
''There are increasing reports that the New York Senate seat is
nothing more than a stepping stone for a future White House bid by
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, ''The Case Against Hillary Clinton,'' Wall
Street Journal columnist Noonan makes the same point, repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she wins in New York and Al Gore loses in the general
election, Mrs. Clinton will be first in line in 2004,'' Noonan said
in an interview. ''And, if Al Gore wins, she'll be very high on
line in 2008.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has repeatedly denied any interest in running for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really want to be the senator, and I want to serve my full,
six-year term, and I have learned that senators have a whole lot
more privacy than presidents,'' she said last month in an interview
with Charlie Rose. ''It is not a choice I'm looking at, interested
in.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nonsense,'' said state Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope.
''Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who pledged to serve her
full, six-year term. It's no secret Rudy Giuliani doesn't even want
the job. He wants to be governor ... He wants to be the top dog.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats believe Clinton does think about being
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''She certainly is the most prominent political woman in the
United States which automatically makes her a possible
(presidential contender) should she win this,'' said Hank
Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant who worked on President
Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Hope refused to speculate on what Hillary Clinton might do
later in life, she said the first lady ''is one of the most capable
women I've ever met and fully capable of doing anything she wants
to do. But right now she's working hard to earn our trust and get
elected to the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   New York pollster Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion, said the main reason Republicans
raise the presidential ambition issue is that ''it's a good way for
raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheinkopf, who is not working on the Senate campaign, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is this is the great jihad for conservatives
around the country -- to defeat her -- and this is another charge
Rudy can make to get conservative money,'' the Democratic
strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It energizes people to support us,'' Republican boss Powers
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   He said raising the issue is an effective fund-raising tool
because ''that's what is out there and people feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, the state GOP chairman said he firmly believes Hillary
Clinton wants to be president -- in part because her husband got
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they've been in competition all along,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a view shared by Noonan. In her book she imagines what
the first lady would be thinking if she wins the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''And now I've won, and I've beaten more than Rudy. I've beaten
Bill. He got it and blew it. Now I'll show him how it's done,''
Noonan writes.
</P>
<P>
   While Noonan says she is firm in her belief that Hillary Clinton
wants to be president, the former Reagan speechwriter who has also
done work for New York Gov. George Pataki said the first lady isn't
about to talk about it -- at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have chosen a horse to ride to the presidency, it is
good politics to say, 'Oh horse, I love you,' and it's bad politics
to say, 'Horse, get me to the White House and then we'll shoot
ya.'''

By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In an age when museums lure guests with
interactive displays, videos and virtual reality, the New York
State Museum can seem downright old fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   Mounted sparrows and warblers clutch branches behind display
windows, mannequins of sweatshop workers sit frozen in mid-stitch,
vintage fire engines are parked behind ropes, out of reach. Some
displays date to 1976, when the museum moved into the modernistic
Empire State Plaza, near the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current museum is pretty one-dimensional,'' acknowledged
museum director Cliff Siegfried. ''It's mostly a passive learning
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That should all be changing soon.
</P>
<P>
   A more airy and interactive museum is on the drawing board, one
where a biplane will hang above and a stream will flow into the
mezzanine. Exhibits will be rotated in and out. There will be a
vintage carousel on a terrace above and virtual ''rides'' in an
Erie Canal boat.
</P>
<P>
   If money comes in as planned, the 164-year-old museum will
arrive foursquare into the new century over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The pricetag for the renovation is $69 million. Right now, the
museum has only $4.5 million for the project. Museum officials are
lobbying the state Legislature to include funding in the budget due
April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the Assembly this month proposed a $20 million
museum grant in the state budget. That proposal will be considered
in the context of budget negotiations with Gov. George Pataki and
his fellow Republicans who run the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's ultimate goal is to secure $60 million in state
bonds and raise another $15 million to $20 million in private
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great place but nothing has been done in what, 30
years? So it has to be updated,'' said Assemblyman Ronald
Canestrari, an Albany County Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is sort of like New York state's attic, in possession
of 5 million specimens and artifacts. This includes Franklin Delano
Roosevelt's old Packard, a hulking mastadon skeleton, an old ''A
Train'' from New York City's subway, Shaker chairs, Iroquois tools
and a 2,000-pound salt pillar featuring tongue marks from
generations of children.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried notes that the museum is the No. 1 cultural tourist
attraction in the Albany region, but annual attendance has dipped
from 1.3 million in 1993 to about 650,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been funding woes. Siegfried says state funding
has barely grown in 15 years. The museum even scaled back its hours
for a brief period in 1995 because of state budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has maintained its no-admission policy. Visitors are
asked to donate as they enter.
</P>
<P>
   A recent exhibition deal with three major New York City art
museum was funded privately. The arrangement allows for the showing
of works from the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried said the first $4.5 million in funding should be
enough to revamp the museum's fourth-floor gallery, complete with a
cafe and a vintage carousel.
</P>
<P>
   That could be finished in about 18 months. If funding comes
through at a good pace, the museum could be redone in about five
years.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Invade Russian-Held Village  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Rebels invaded a village deep in
Russian-held western Chechnya on Saturday, while smaller clashes
were reported throughout the breakaway republic and four Russian
police were killed by a mine, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days' lull in large-scale battles, a group of rebels
entered Samashki, near Chechnya's border with the Russian republic
of Ingushetia, Russian news reports said. Russian troops were
battling rebels, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Ministry spokesman in Moscow denied the rebels had
gained any ground in Samashki. He said Russian troops located a
rebel band hiding in the woods outside the village Saturday and
pounded them with artillery.
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment on casualties or say how the rebels reached
Samashki, which is deep in the area that Russian troops wrestled
away from Chechen rebels last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The raid highlighted the damage rebels can still inflict on
Russian troops, even though the Russians have occupied most of
Chechnya. It also underscored the difficulty Russia will have
trying to establish peace in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's invasion came a day after Russian authorities
effectively banned nonmilitary travel around Chechnya, saying they
were worried about rebel attacks ahead of Sunday's Russian
presidential election. Troops guarded polling stations around the
republic. Elections officials were bringing ballot boxes to refugee
camps in neighboring Ingushetia for displaced Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's roads were deserted Saturday, but the violence seemed
to be worsening.
</P>
<P>
   Four Russian police were killed when their truck hit a mine near
Argun, east of the capital, Grozny, the Defense Ministry said.
Rebels fired at a Russian military post in Argun, drawing federal
troops into a protracted battle, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing military sources. There was no word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last day, rebels had fired grenades at interior
troops in Grozny, attacked a special unit in the northern village
of Naurskaya and fired at police checkpoints in and around three
other towns, the Interior Ministry press center said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the main arena of the military action, Russian
troops battled rebels in the southern mountain districts of Sharoi,
Vedeno and Nozhai-Yurt, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships flew more than 50
missions over the past 24 hours, attacking rebel groups in the
Argun gorge and the nearby villages of Bamut, Khatuni and
Sharo-Argun, the military command told Interfax. The command said
the strikes wiped out nine rebel strongholds in the mountains. The
claim could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in late September, after
rebels invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last
summer. The military swept across the plains in the north quickly
but has been stalled for several weeks at the foothills of the
mountains that cut across southern Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Inmates Paid To Fill Out Census  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- To get its prison inmates to fill out their
federal census questionnaires, Minnesota is offering a small
incentive -- $1 per form.
</P>
<P>
   That's good money for an inmate, and even with a price tag that
could reach $5,600, Minnesota officials say its a worthwhile way to
reach the Census Bureau's goal of 90 percent participation in the
country's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we can reach that level, but it would definitely be
problematic without some incentive,'' said Erik Skon, the state's
assistant commissioner for adult facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Beaver, who coordinates census collection for six Midwestern
states including Minnesota said he isn't aware of any other state
where inmates will be paid to fill out the seven-question form.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad to hear it,'' he said from his office in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The plan wasn't driven by the Census Bureau, and the money isn't
coming from anyone's taxes -- it's coming from the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The program is financed by money the inmates have paid in
surcharges for telephone calls and for items bought at the prison
canteen, Skon said. Typically, those fees go to buy recreation
equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A dollar may not seem like a lot of money to most people, but
this is behind prison walls where wages start at 25 cents an hour
and half an inmate's wages typically go to pay restitution, fines
or child support.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Larson, the state's ombudsman for corrections, said he
supports the Department of Corrections' plan because it will help
the department accurately gauge the makeup of its population,
including race.
</P>
<P>
   ''The census is an important tool that will give corrections
officials an opportunity to plan for more effective programming to
meet the unique needs of groups in the prisons,'' Larson said.
''The census will have a tremendous impact.''

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Energy Shortages Worsen  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Energy shortages have gotten so bad in
North Korea that tourists staying in first-class hotels have had to
sleep with their coats on, South Korean officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The episode is yet another indication that North Korea's energy
shortages are getting worse in its fifth year of a hunger crisis
caused by bad weather and a botched collective farm system.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S.-led consortium, called the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization, is building two modern reactors and
providing 500,000 tons of fuel oil annually in return for a freeze
on the North's nuclear program. Before the freeze, North Korea was
suspected of using its Soviet-designed reactors to build materials
for atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
   When KEDO delegates visited Pyongyang in February, they had to
wear their coats during a dinner party and went to bed with clothes
on at a first-class hotel in Pyongyang that was not heated, said
Choi Yong-joon, an official at Seoul's Unification Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea recently acknowledged that an acute electricity
shortage was disrupting its already weak industries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Charles Kartman and North Korean Vice Foreign
Minister Kim Gye Gwan discussed how to ease the North's shortages
during their weeklong meeting in New York earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea demands compensation for delays in building the two
KEDO reactors. It says if it had built its own reactors as
scheduled, its power problem would not be so serious.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that North Korea was developing nuclear weapons,
Washington signed a 1994 pact with Pyongyang under which the North
agreed to freeze its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the consortium of U.S., Japanese and South Korean
partners agreed to build two 1,000-megawatt reactors worth $4.6
billion that cannot be used for military purposes. However, delays
have plagued the project.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1994 accord, the United States promised to build the
first light-water reactor by 2003. Now officials say privately that
a delay of several years is inevitable.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Presidential Candidates  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A look at the 11 candidates vying for Russia's
presidency in
Sunday's elections:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   VLADIMIR PUTIN, 47: A former KGB agent, Putin was appointed
prime minister in August and has led Russia since Boris Yeltsin
resigned Dec. 31. He has kept his plans vague, saying he wants to
restore a strong state while preserving civil freedoms and a market
economy. The heavy favorite in the race, Putin became popular for
his strict handling of the war in breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   GENNADY ZYUGANOV, 55: The Communist Party leader, Zyuganov came
in second in the 1996 presidential election. He vows to raise wages
and pensions and eliminate unemployment. Zyuganov advocates a state
monopoly on vodka production and re-nationalizing the oil and gas
industries. Putin's biggest threat, but still given little chance
of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   GRIGORY YAVLINSKY, 47: An economist, Yavlinsky heads the market
reform-oriented Yabloko party. He would cut taxes and bureaucracy
while preserving a social safety net. He is seen as highly
principled but unwilling to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tight Security During Russia's Vote  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Police fanned out to guard polling stations and
campaign billboards were pasted over Saturday as Russia prepared
for a presidential election whose outcome most consider a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The frontrunner, acting President Vladimir Putin, spent election
eve at a soccer match.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters debated whether to cast a ballot Sunday, and
wondered what a Putin presidency would hold. Putin is so far ahead
of his rivals that analysts say he could win more than 50 percent
of the votes cast, avoiding a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are tired of all this mess, and they want a strong
hand,'' Yuri Mashinin, a 41-year-old video equipment engineer, said
Saturday. ''But they don't understand that a strong hand will be
good for one person only'' -- the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is widely popular because of his decisive, hawkish
handling of Moscow's military offensive in rebel Chechnya and his
image as a tough leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin, a pokerfaced 15-year veteran of the Soviet-era KGB,
remains an enigma who frightens some Russians. He has never held
elected office and did not release a formal election program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he is dangerous. He seems too harsh,'' said Anna
Polevaya, a 27-year-old architect.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry troops were sent to guard polling stations as
part of tightened security around the country, especially in the
south near Chechnya. Officials say they fear terrorist acts staged
by Chechens on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning was officially over on Saturday. Russian election
law bans electioneering on the day before the vote. Campaign
billboards across the country were removed overnight, or covered
with commercial advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Painters cleaned up the schools and libraries where top
officials are scheduled to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television ran its regular weekend programs Saturday,
free of the lackluster campaign advertisements of recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed and bundled in a puffy black parka, Putin spent
Saturday evening in box seats at a soccer match between Moscow's
Spartak and Alania from the southern city of Vladikavkaz. Putin
discussed the play with Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands was another presidential candidate: opposition
lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent market reformer whom many
polls predict will come in third. It was an unusual appearance for
a politician seen as aloof and removed from ordinary Russians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Assess Security in Libya  </HEADLINE>
By JASPER MORTIMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Four U.S. State Department officials arrived
in Libya on Saturday on what is thought to be the first such visit
since diplomatic relations were cut in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The consular officers have come to assess Libya's general
security arrangements with a view to recommending whether to lift a
ban on U.S. citizens visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
   Their trip is opposed by some relatives of the victims of the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which blew up in 1988 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's handing over last year of two suspects indicted in the
Lockerbie bombing caused the United Nations to suspend sanctions
against the country and has led to a flurry of visits by European
business executives seeking trade with the oil-rich state.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said this week that the
increase in non-Americans traveling to Libya since the suspension
has raised questions about whether the country is still dangerous
for U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe an objective answer requires an on-the-ground
examination by consular officials,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials will assess security at airports, hotels and
hospitals and also confer with foreign diplomats in Tripoli,
according to a senior U.S. official in Washington who asked not to
be identified. No meeting is planned with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency said the Americans arrived on a
British Airways plane and were met by Libyan officials and the
Belgian ambassador, whose embassy hosts a U.S. interests section.
They will leave Libya on Sunday, said State Department spokeswoman
Michelle King.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cohen, of Cape May Court House, N.J., whose daughter was
one of the Lockerbie victims, said this week she was appalled by
the decision to send a delegation to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sends a signal to Gadhafi that we've changed our policy,
and we're ready to be friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the United States has taken note of positive steps by
Libya to end involvement in terrorism. But, he said, the country
''has a very, very long way to go before it meets the standards
required to be removed from the terrorism list.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban on U.S. citizens traveling to Libya has been renewed
annually since it was imposed almost 20 years ago. There have been
no official contacts between the two countries since 1981 when
Washington closed its embassy in Tripoli and ordered Libyan
diplomats to leave the United States.

<HEADLINE> Same-sex unions at issue during meeting of Reform rabbis  </HEADLINE>
By GARY D. ROBERTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Reform Judaism is poised for a vote that
could make it the most influential U.S. religious group to support
clergy who perform same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution sanctioning commitment ceremonies is expected to
come up at the Central Conference of American Rabbis convention
starting Sunday in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual step, discussions will be held privately, a sign
of the issue's volatility. A similar vote at the group's 1998
convention was dropped to head off potentially divisive debate.
</P>
<P>
   The group's 1,800 members serve at least 1.5 million Reform
Jews, the largest and most liberal of Judaism's three major
branches in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, introduced by some female rabbis and endorsed by
the conference's resolution committee, reads: ''The relationship of
a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through
appropriate Jewish ritual. In accordance with the principles of
Reform Judaism, each rabbi should decide about officiation
according to his/her own rabbinic conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters believe rabbis should affirm committed relationships
between Jewish gays and lesbians as sacred, just like Jewish
marriage. While the conference supports civil same-sex unions and
approved openly gay rabbis a decade ago, some homosexuals say they
still feel like second-class citizens at temple. The resolution
would give religious legitimacy to same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a major religious group to pass a resolution that same-sex
unions are worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish
rituals, it would send a message to them that they are not
abnormal,'' said Rabbi Paul Menitoff, the conference's executive
vice president in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Menitoff expects a majority of the 500 rabbis coming to
Greensboro will approve the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a women's issue or a gay or lesbian issue. This is
a human rights issue,'' said Rabbi Shira Stern, a co-leader of the
275-member Women's Rabbinic Network, which introduced the
resolution in January. Stern said the resolution gives rabbis
leeway in deciding whether to declare a same-sex union to be a
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Jews who have no choice in the matter of sexual identity,
we as leaders of the movement must provide them with the religious
framework in which to celebrate their union,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the resolution believe it would disparage rabbis
who believe same-sex relationships do not meet criteria for the
Jewish concept of ''kiddushin,'' or a sanctified relationship
between a Jewish husband and wife. Moreover, they warn it would
alienate Reform Judaism from Israel, where it seeks stronger
recognition, and create sharp divisions among rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are ''not homophobes, we're not gay-bashing. We're not
opposed to the dignity and Jewish integrity of gays and lesbians in
our midst,'' said Rabbi Clifford Librach of Temple Sinai in Sharon,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A possible compromise recognizing the diversity of opinion on
the subject within the rabbinate is in the works, members of the
Central Conference say.
</P>
<P>
   An alternate resolution backed by Librach and others urges the
Reform rabbinate to ''strengthen its efforts to seek justice for
gays and lesbians in American society'' by pushing for civil and
political rights for partners, but stops short of sanctioning
same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah condemns male homosexual intercourse, but Reform
Judaism has been liberal on gay rights, taking into account
contemporary understanding of homosexuality and the Jewish values
of human dignity and justice.
</P>
<P>
   Many Reform rabbis already have officiated at same-sex
ceremonies at synagogues. Librach said he would not, but ''would
perhaps arrange a celebration of the Jewish integrity of their
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a coalition of 895
Reform congregations, has taken no stand on same-sex religious
unions, but has approved resolutions supporting civil unions and
nondiscrimination against gays, said UAHC spokeswoman Emily Grotta.
</P>
<P>
   Among other religious groups, the Unitarian Universalist
Association, a denomination with about 150,000 members, has
officially endorsed decisions by its clergy to perform same-sex
unions. Presbyterian, United Methodist and Episcopal church leaders
are expected to take up the issue this year.

<HEADLINE> Battered by bizarre turns, Oscar's big night arrives  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood's finest screenwriters would have
trouble matching the odd twists leading up to this year's Oscars.
It's been a bit like the limo ride from hell.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup to Hollywood's big night included misplaced Academy
Awards ballots and stolen statues, culminating in the discovery of
the missing Oscars by a salvager foraging around trash bins where
the trophies had been dumped.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy's cherished secrecy was threatened, first by a Web
site that claimed it had an advance list of potential nominees,
then by a Wall Street Journal story that polled Oscar voters to
prophesy how the awards might shake out.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the nominees, as unlikely a lot as the staid
Academy has seen in years. Sweeping epics in the vein of
''Schindler's List,'' ''The English Patient'' and ''Titanic''
definitely are out this year.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are such flicks as the morbidly funny family
satire ''American Beauty,'' the ghostly blockbuster ''The Sixth
Sense,'' and ''The Cider House Rules,'' which has a classic Oscar
look but delivers a clear message favoring women's right to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the mix are the supernatural prison saga ''The Green
Mile,'' the tobacco-whistleblower thriller ''The Insider,'' the
nuthouse drama ''Girl, Interrupted,'' the wildly eclectic
''Magnolia,'' the gender-bending ''Boys Don't Cry,'' the demented
''Being John Malkovich'' and the murderous ''The Talented Mr.
Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   And consider this: The one G-rated film among nominees in top
categories, ''The Straight Story,'' comes from director David
Lynch, who made such emotionally and visually disturbing movies as
''Eraserhead'' and ''Blue Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   Another certified family movie among nominees in leading
categories, ''Music of the Heart,'' was directed by horror maestro
Wes Craven. Oscar perennial Meryl Streep is up for best actress for
the film, tying Katharine Hepburn for most acting nominations with
12.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar's infatuation with all things British continued, with a
twist. Six of the 20 acting nominees are British or Australian, but
five adopt American accents and the sixth, Samantha Morton in
''Sweet and Lowdown,'' plays an American who is mute.
</P>
<P>
   The one British accent is donned by North Carolina-born Julianne
Moore in ''The End of the Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange as the Oscar contenders turned out, Hollywood's big
night has almost been overshadowed by outside circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   A day before nominations came out Feb. 15, a Web site posted
what it claimed was a short list from which nominees would be
drawn. The information proved false.
</P>
<P>
   Academy executives reacted with irritation over reports that The
Wall Street Journal was surveying voters. The newspaper ran a story
Friday based on interviews with 356 of the 5,607 Academy voters,
predicting ''American Beauty'' would win best picture, Hilary Swank
would take best actress for ''Boys Don't Cry'' and ''The
Hurricane's'' Denzel Washington would narrowly win best actor.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy had already had to send new ballots to most of its
members after 4,000 voting forms got lost in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The finishing touch came when 55 Oscars were stolen March 8 from
the shipping company hired to deliver the statues. An employee of
the company was charged with grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   All but three Oscars were found in a garbage bin last weekend by
Willie Fulgear, who scavenges trash for a living.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy has rolled with the punches, holding a news
conference to announce the disappearance of the statues and joining
the police briefing to celebrate their recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Academy executive director Bruce Davis jokingly warned Oscar
host Billy Crystal to stay away from Bell, Calif., the community
where the ballots and statues vanished, because it ''seems to be a
Bermuda Triangle for Oscar things.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Academy officials are bracing, again good-naturedly, for the
inevitable ribbing Crystal will dish out over the mishaps come
Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very, very, very weird year,'' said Academy
spokesman John Pavlik.
</P>
<P>
   On with the show.

<HEADLINE> Patrick Dorismond funeral ends in violence  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a violent faceoff after the funeral of
Patrick Dorismond, police in riot gear clashed with bottle-throwing
protesters demanding the mayor's resignation over the police
killing of the unarmed man.
</P>
<P>
   Some burned the American flag draping the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ''You didn't protect him, you killed him!'' mourners shouted
earlier at unarmed community affairs officers who walked alongside
the funeral procession from a Brooklyn funeral home to the church.
</P>
<P>
   One sign read: ''Giuliani must go!''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, the 26-year-old son of one of Haiti's most beloved
singers, Andre Dorismond, was fatally shot last week in Manhattan
during a scuffle with an undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The hearse carrying his body led a miles-long protest march of
thousands, including the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   When Dorismond's body arrived at the Holy Cross Roman Catholic
Church, some in the crowd ripped a flag off the coffin and set it
afire.
</P>
<P>
   As the funeral Mass was ending at about 2 p.m., police in riot
gear massed by the side of the church. Within minutes, they were
confronted by hundreds of protesters, some throwing bottles, and
police formed a human barricade against the surging crowd. Officers
used their batons to knock back the flying glass as they made
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a quiet family gathering Saturday morning grew
into a loud protest march of at least 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The coffin was brought out from the Andrew Torregrossa and Sons
Funeral Home draped in Haitian and American flags, and the crowd
broke into the Haitian national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's mother, Marie Dorismond, wept uncontrollably as she
was escorted to a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Police blocked off streets as mourners walked on Flatbush Avenue
toward the church several miles away in the Flatbush neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton headed the procession, with supporters hoisting a
banner that read ''Justice for Patrick'' -- referring to Giuliani's
controversial response to the death.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor came under fire for releasing information from
Dorismond's police record, including sealed juvenile files, and for
not visiting Dorismond's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor is mentally sick, that is why we are out here, to
let him know we want him out,'' said Michel Eddy, a Haitian native
the same age as Dorismond. ''It's our blood, it's not cheap. We
must let them know this must stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the names of other victims of police-linked violence, one
sign read: ''Diallo, Louima, Baez, Bumpers, enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour procession reached Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church
at about 11 a.m. At that point, the hostility against Giuliani
escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Ear-splitting shrieks and hysterical shouts accompanied the
honking of cars and protesters knocked down police barricades. Two
police officers were injured, one suffering a possible broken nose
and a minor leg injury when barriers and people crushed him. The
second officer was left with abrasions on his leg and face. Police
did not immediately know how many arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered attorney Johnnie Cochran as he arrived for the
funeral Mass.
</P>
<P>
   When Dorismond's coffin was carried toward the church entrance,
the crowd surged forward. They grabbed the U.S. flag, tore it to
shreds and set the pieces on fire.
</P>
<P>
   A car driving the wrong way on Flatbush was plastered with
banners, including some that read: ''If you shoot one of my
children, I shoot five of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some threatened violence against the mayor and his family.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny store across from the church put out a boombox that
blasted a song with the lyrics: ''I'm in a crazy, crazy world.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1,000 people attended the two-hour funeral Mass, and
several were so overcome that they appeared to pass out.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can be said that has not been said in the past few days?
What can be added?'' said the Rev. Rollin Darbouze in his homily.
</P>
<P>
   The priest mentioned ''those who tried to dishonor his good name
after his death,'' but added: ''We are not here to form an
opinion... to talk about what happened. We are not here to judge or
condemn. We are here to weep with the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mourners wore purple ribbons, while others carried small
Haitian flags.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Dumont, 26, a Haitian-born Brooklyn resident, compared
Haiti's decades of military rule with America's democracy: ''Mrs.
Dorismond took her son out of a military regime and brought him
here because she thought it would be better and safer, but Giuliani
and the way he's empowered the police have proved her wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dorismond's wake Friday evening, thousands paid their
respects as sobs drifted through the largely Haitian crowd of
family, friends and supporters.
</P>
<P>
   His corpse dressed in a white suit, Dorismond was surrounded by
about 20 large flower arrangements, many in the shape of crosses or
hearts. The name ''Patrick'' was spelled out in green and white
flowers above the coffin and a large wooden crucifix hung nearby.
</P>
<P>
   One mourner, Blaise Lambre, described Dorismond as ''a person
who just enjoyed life,'' and he blamed Giuliani for failing to show
sympathy for the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Picture somebody you grew up with, played in the same building
with, did everything with,'' Lambre said. ''I'm angry at the fact
that he died ... It was wrong. To me, it's murder, simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, who worked as a security guard, was shot during a
scuffle with police in Manhattan last week after an undercover
officer allegedly approached him as part of a drug sting.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton and police brutality victim Abner Louima, a Haitian
immigrant, were among those at the wake.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has happened too much and it's only happening in our
community,'' said Sharpton. ''We must ask God to give us strength
that in Patrick's name this can stop.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Holds Bomb Exercise in Fla.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- Windows rattled and pets
scattered as Navy jets dropped live bombs for a training exercise
that was moved to the Florida Panhandle because of protests against
training drills at a Puerto Rican island.
</P>
<P>
   Planes from the aircraft carrier USS George Washington dropped
62 tons of bombs on an Eglin Air Force Base test range Friday, the
first and most intense day of live bombing during war games that
continue through next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Paroz, manager of a motel in the Seminole community south
of the range, said her two dogs scampered into a corner when they
heard the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's loud and it's bothersome,'' she said. ''We just figure we
have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Maheu thought a storm was brewing as she played golf with
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told her, 'No, that's not thunder,''' said Bob Maheu, a
retired Air Force colonel.
</P>
<P>
   The air-to-ground bombing runs will slack off during the
remainder of the exercise while the focus shifts to aerial combat.
</P>
<P>
   For some 60 years, the Navy had used the small Puerto Rican
island of Vieques as a military training ground. But after an
errant bomb killed a civilian security guard and injured four
others last April, protesters demanded the bombing range be shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal reached between the United States and Puerto Rico
earlier this year, the Navy can continue training there for now,
but only using inert bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Although pleased with the way the exercise is going so far, Navy
officials say they prefer Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Realism has suffered because of safety and noise restrictions on
Eglin's test range, said Rear Adm. Richard Naughton, commander of
Carrier Group 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to be as combat-ready as we can be, but not where
I want them to be. The training is not optimal,'' he said.

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Police arrested four men on
suspicion that they might be behind a tear gas attack on a
nightclub in South Africa that left 12 schoolchildren dead and 150
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The men were detained for questioning, Durban South police area
commissioner Raj Ramsaroop said Saturday. He said the investigation
was progressing and that more arrests were expected, but declined
to give further details.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 children were celebrating the end of the school term
at a Durban nightclub Friday afternoon when someone released tear
gas into the crowd, sparking a stampede, police said. A brick wall
collapsed on top of several children.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have not released any details about how the children
died. Earlier media reports said 13 died in the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the injured remained in critical condition Saturday.
Children as young as 11 were at the club, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were treating the case as a murder
investigation and also would investigate whether the nightclub met
building regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven victims were buried Saturday. Grieving relatives and
friends also laid wreaths outside the club, which is located in
Chatsworth, a Durban suburb with a largely Indian population.
</P>
<P>
   Durban, South Africa's third-largest city, lies on the Indian
Ocean coast, 350 miles southeast of Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> First President of CBS News Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sig Mickelson, who helped build CBS News during
the early days of television and made Walter Cronkite a national
news figure, has died. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, the first president of CBS News, died Friday at
Scripps-Mercy Hospital of complications from pneumonia, his wife,
Elena, said Saturday. He had been hospitalized since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson began working for CBS on radio in 1943, then was put
in charge of news and public affairs at CBS Television in 1951. He
founded the Radio and Television News Directors Association and was
its president from 1948 to 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sig was undoubtedly one of the pioneers of television news,''
Cronkite said Friday. ''Much of what we accomplished can be traced
to his leadership in the founding days of this incredible medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson helped arrange the first commercially sponsored
television broadcast of a political event, the 1952 conventions,
and assigned Washington newsman Cronkite to anchor the broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is for his selection of Walter Cronkite that Sig will be
remembered forever,'' said Don Hewitt, who directed coverage of
those conventions and went on to create the news magazine ''60
Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson hired Fred Friendly, who also became a president of
CBS News, to collaborate with Ed Murrow on ''See It Now,'' the
documentary series famed for a piece that led to the downfall of
Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., in 1954, according to CBS News.
Friendly died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Mickelson oversaw the first same-day U.S. broadcast of
a foreign event with the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and he
went on to help expand the network's international camera crew and
international coverage.
</P>
<P>
   He was named the first president of the CBS News Division in
1959, then supervised the full broadcast of the 1960 Olympic games
before leaving CBS in 1961 to lead the international broadcast
division of Time Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson later taught at Northwestern University, San Diego
State University and Louisiana State University, and wrote seven
books, including ''The Decade that Shaped Television News,''
published in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson is survived by his wife, two children, two
stepchildren and seven grandchildren.

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Supermodel Kate Moss was discharged from a
hospital Saturday after collapsing several days ago with a kidney
infection, her modeling agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old had been at Princess Grace Hospital since she
collapsed with severe abdominal pains while at her home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Her agency said the condition worsened because Moss had not
completed a course of antibiotics prescribed for an earlier kidney
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kate was in a lot of pain and had a high fever. She was in
abject misery,'' said Sarah Doukas, managing director at Storm
Models.

<HEADLINE> Festival Withdraws Japan Erotic Film  </HEADLINE>
By DEAN VISSER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Organizers have withdrawn a classic Japanese
erotic movie from this year's Singapore International Film Festival
after government censors insisted on cuts, a spokeswoman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The film, Nagisa Oshima's ''In the Realm of the Senses,'' is a
1976 work that influenced the way European and American directors
depict sex scenes, festival spokeswoman Kong Kam Yoke said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Films have to be seen complete in order for the audience to
get what the director wants to convey,'' Kong said. ''If one scene
is removed, the message of the film is compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old Singapore festival also has a policy against
screening films that have been cut, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Realm of the Senses,'' about a sometimes
sadomasochistic affair between a young female innkeeper and her
employer, is known for a scene in which the woman mutilates the
man's genitals. The film was to be part of the festival's
retrospective this year on sex in Asian cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The retrospective, which includes erotic films from India,
Turkey and other countries, is intended to raise awareness of the
way Asian directors have handled sexuality, Kong said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 16 films in the retrospective, censors only insisted
on cuts to the Oshima film.
</P>
<P>
   Another, ''Lies,'' by South Korea's Chang Sun-woo, was banned
outright, Kong said. The film is about a high school girl's affair
with a middle-aged sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Singapore's reputation for heavy-handed censorship, Kong
said the festival has in the past been able to screen films that
might not have made it to theaters in the conservative city-state.
All films shown in the country must be submitted to censors for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is also an understanding with the Board of Film Censors
that this festival is attended by film buffs, by people who look at
films as art,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 300 films scheduled for this year's festival,
which runs from March 31 to April 15.

<HEADLINE> Mich. College Students Face Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Six members of an unofficial fraternity
are facing charges in the alcohol-related death of a university
freshman, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Petz, 19, a Ferris State University student, died March
15 of apparent alcohol poisoning after participating in what police
characterized as a hazing initiation into the Knights of College
Leadership fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary autopsy report showed his blood alcohol level was
0.42 percent, more than four times the legal limit for
intoxication.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Peter Jaklevic issued warrants Friday charging the
six. The charges range from furnishing alcohol to a minor, a
misdemeanor, to involuntary manslaughter, a 15-year-felony.
</P>
<P>
   Names of the suspects and the specific charges against each will
be released when they are arraigned this week. All the men are
Ferris State students, The Grand Rapids Press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Courtney, Big Rapids director of public safety, said the
counts are ''probably the most serious charges that could have been
filed.''
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity is not officially recognized by the university.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Decides To Hike Oil Exports  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq will increase oil exports by 700,000
barrels a day within a few weeks -- almost a quarter of what
analysts say the market needs to curb soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Iraqi Oil Ministry officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they would start raising exports next week and hope
to go from 1.6 million to 2.3 million barrels a day in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid confirmed plans to increase
production in an interview with CNN on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision appears to be a bid to grab the initiative from
OPEC. The 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
meets in Vienna on Monday for crucial talks on whether to increase
output as urged by the United States to drive down prices.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a member of OPEC, Iraq has operated outside the
cartel's quota system ever since the United Nations imposed
sanctions after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq this year has slashed its exports by 700,000 barrels a day,
citing the fragile state of its oil infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is almost Iraq's sole source of hard currency. The United
Nations allows the country to bypass sanctions and export oil so
long as the revenues are spent on food, medicine and essential
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid said the decision was prompted by the removal of holds on
contracts for the purchase of spare parts and by the U.N. Security
Council's permission to double the amount of equipment Iraq can buy
to repair its shaky oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Rashid warned that Iraq would be ''forced to alter its
decision'' to boost exports if the United States continued to place
contracts on hold. The United States and Britain fear the equipment
could be diverted to military use.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi move is certain to play a part in the OPEC meeting, as
countries such as Iran, Algeria and Libya oppose any substantial
boost to production.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has lobbied heavily for producer nations to
increase supplies and drive down prices that have recently hit
nine-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill
requiring the president to review OPEC practices and work with
other nations to restrict military assistance to countries found to
engage in price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Several Middle Eastern producers have criticized such steps.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. pressures are meaningless to us. We hope OPEC members
will not give in to political pressures,'' Iranian Oil Minister
Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told state-run Tehran radio from Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, the daily Al-Nadwah said the Congress bill is
''not the right approach'' because the first country to be affected
by this decision is the United States, as it is the world's largest
weapons exporter.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, the influential state newspaper Al-Jumhouriya urged
OPEC to take its own interests into account and ''not fear
threats'' by ''the hallucinating Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Trimble Narrowly Wins Re-election  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Assailed by critics of
compromise, Nobel laureate David Trimble narrowly won re-election
Saturday as leader of the Ulster Unionists, a Protestant party
central to the success or failure of Northern Ireland's peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists' grassroots council gave Trimble 457 votes
to 348 for a last-minute challenger, the Rev. Martin Smyth. Smyth,
a party veteran, argued that Trimble had been wrong to attempt a
coalition government with the Sinn Fein party, which is linked to
the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's victory came by a narrower margin than had been
predicted. He also suffered a significant defeat when grassroots
members voted to link the party's future participation in
government to retention of the formal name of the province's
predominantly Protestant police force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agreed this decision will complicate efforts to
relaunch any power-sharing government. Britain has already promised
to change the force's name to the more neutral-sounding Police
Service for Northern Ireland. Under terms of the Good Friday
accord, the issues of forming a local government and reforming the
police weren't supposed to be linked.
</P>
<P>
   A four-party coalition Northern Ireland government -- the
intended cornerstone of 1998's Good Friday peace accord -- was
formed in December, giving local leaders a measure of self-rule.
But the coalition was suspended in February after the IRA refused
to begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put a positive spin on the day's events, Trimble said
substantial opposition wasn't surprising given the IRA refusal. The
Ulster Unionists had agreed to form the coalition government in the
expectation that the outlawed group would start to give up its
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying the patience of the ordinary, decent folk of
Ulster too far and too hard,'' Trimble, referring to Sinn Fein and
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But his challenger said Trimble was mostly to blame for his
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''In recent years under David's leadership our party has been
seen continually to give ground to Sinn Fein-IRA, who through
threat of terror are trying to dominate our society,'' Smyth said.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old Smyth is a Presbyterian minister and former
leader of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's major Protestant
fraternal group. He had declared sharing power with Sinn Fein
unrealistic because, he said, the IRA never intends to scrap its
weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble outlasted Smyth, but the vote tying the police force's
name to Cabinet participation was a major loss for him. It passed
unanimously after a more moderately worded Trimble amendment
narrowly failed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants view any name change as a victory for the IRA,
which killed about 300 officers as part of its now-suspended
campaign to abolish Northern Ireland. Any retreat by Britain on the
issue would anger the province's Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, 55, who shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic
moderate John Hume, was elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995. He
was then considered a Protestant hard-liner, but the challenges of
peacemaking brought out a strong pragmatic streak. He took key
steps toward Sinn Fein even though it infuriated many within the
province's Protestant majority, and he led his party into the
coalition government even though that move was supported by only 58
percent of the party council.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble exacerbated Protestant unease last week in Washington
when, to many observers' surprise, he announced he would support
resuming government alongside Sinn Fein before any IRA disarmament
happened -- so long as the IRA pledged its ''unambiguous
commitment'' to the goal. Trimble emphasized Saturday this remained
his position.

<HEADLINE> Belarusian Police, Detain Protesters  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- Baton-wielding police beat back thousands
of protesters at an opposition rally Saturday, sending armored
personnel carriers into downtown Minsk and detaining 400 people in
one of the country's harshest crackdowns on dissent in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Central Minsk was sealed off and hundreds of police poured in to
disperse the thousands of demonstrators. Officers began seizing
protesters and journalists, beating many with batons. Some
demonstrators hid in stores lining the chaotic street.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was held to commemorate the founding of the Belarusian
Popular Republic on March 25, 1918, when German forces were ousted
from Minsk in the waning days of World War I. The independent state
was short-lived and within a year, much of Belarus was part of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus' hard-line government had said it would allow Saturday's
rally to be held on the outskirts of Minsk, but several thousand
demonstrators went instead to a central square in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin appealed to the
Belarusian government to release television crews from Russia's
largest networks -- ORT and RTR, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
The crews were detained and beaten, and their cameras were smashed
or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter was among several journalists
detained and later released.
</P>
<P>
   Other rally participants detained were Polish Solidarity party
legislator Mariusz Kaminski, and seven Polish observers with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. They were
later released.
</P>
<P>
   Police surrounded the office of the country's main opposition
group, the Belarusian Popular Front, and detained 12 members of the
group when they tried to leave the building, said a party leader,
Konstantin Khadyka.
</P>
<P>
   The party, one of the rally's organizers, said about 400 people
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing disorder connected to the anniversary, officials had
ordered high school students to come to school for special Saturday
classes to keep them from joining the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry troops surrounded the presidential residence,
the government headquarters and the main television station.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday evening, streets in the city center were open again.
</P>
<P>
   Authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko praised the police
actions. ''Any disorder must be put to an end, and we are doing
that,'' Lukashenko said during a visit to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko has clamped down on opposition parties and media,
drawing fire from international human rights groups. Belarusian
police routinely beat and detain participants in opposition
rallies, but Saturday's crackdown was one of the largest in years.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Al-Amin Petition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A judge has rejected a petition by
lawyers for Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin complaining that the former
Black Panther militant was being treated unfairly in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County District Judge Lynn Bright on Friday ordered
the attorneys to file a separate lawsuit on their claim that the
man once known as H. Rap Brown was barred from attending Muslim
services and prohibited from wearing traditional Muslim garb.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, is accused of the fatal shooting of Fulton County,
Ga., deputy Ricky Kinchen and the wounding of Deputy Aldranon
English. Authorities say the two were trying to serve Al-Amin with
an arrest warrant at his Atlanta grocery store when the shooting
occurred March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was captured Monday west of Montgomery. He is jailed
pending an extradition request from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition process cannot begin unless a Georgia grand jury
indicts Al-Amin. The grand jury met Friday but did not issue an
indictment. Prosecutors would not say whether jurors considered
Al-Amin's case.
</P>
<P>
   The motion filed by Al-Amin's lawyers asked that he be allowed
to pray along with other Muslims in jail and spend more than one
hour a day outside his cell.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff D.T. Marshall said Al-Amin is not being singled out and
is being treated like any other maximum-security inmate.

<HEADLINE> Mourners say goodbye to third Bloomsburg University fire victim  </HEADLINE>
By JOY RUSSELL PEREZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, N.J. (AP) -- Cars with flashing hazard lights and
Bloomsburg University window stickers slowly climbed the steep hill
leading to the Martin Funeral Home.
</P>
<P>
   Over 200 students, friends and family members filled the
building Saturday to say goodbye to 22-year-old Kristoffer Polhemus
of Hampton, the third victim of a fraternity house fire at
Bloomsburg University.
</P>
<P>
   Polhemus, an only child, was a college senior and scheduled to
graduate in May with a bachelor's degree in biology.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners who filled the funeral home were the
college's president and chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers were set up outside so that 40 people who couldn't be
seated would hear the service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had so many good times with Kris, and he was always there
for the bad ones,'' Brian Palma, a friend of Polhemus, told
mourners. ''This is why it's so hard to say goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire in an off-campus fraternity house at the Pennsylvania
college killed three students. Others in the house jumped to safety
from a second-story window after the fire broke out about 6 a.m. on
March 19, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed in the fire at the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity
house were Cliff Vail, 21, of Dunellan and Marcus LaBuda, 21, of
Hazleton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday's memorial, one student spoke of a recent spring
break when Polhemus was locked outside a room early one morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He tried everything to get in. He pounded on the door. He
tried to break in a window. He ended up sleeping in the bushes,''
the student recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsburg University president Jessica Kozloff told students
that they should comfort each other on campus just as they saw the
Polhemus' family comforting each other here.
</P>

Voorhees High School in 1995.

<P>
   Another Bloomsburg fraternity house fire killed five students on

<HEADLINE> L.A. Rolls Out Red Carpet for Oscars  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There are certain days that define a city.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve in New York City. Bastille Day in Paris.
Washington celebrates all those dead presidents' birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, it's Oscar day -- the day when the red carpet is
rolled out for movie stars hoping to grab onto a little gold man
with folded arms.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's a day to celebrate everything good -- from movies
to fashion -- that is ''Hollywood.'' For others, it's a headache
that yields limo logjams and long lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it depends on the perspective you take,'' said Carol
Martinez of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   From a tourism point of view, she said, the show is a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wants to experience a little movie magic, and the
Academy Awards show, well, offers the ultimate in movie magic,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The only place most will be able to see the show is from the
comfort of their living rooms. But to handle the Oscar-addicted,
some local broadcast stations plan to air pre-pre-awards coverage
hours before the show even begins.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they watch for the stars. Others, the drama, which
there was plenty of this year with missing Oscar ballots and stolen
statues.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kolandjian, a sales representative, says he plans to
watch -- on the couch in his living room -- to catch a glimpse of
Willie Fulgear, the junk man who received a $50,000 reward and two
tickets to the show after finding 52 of 55 stolen Oscar statues in
a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was funny when (Fulgear) said that now he had
more Oscars than anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From a certain business point of view -- those who own posh
hotels and upscale restaurants -- the show also proves a boon.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Development Corp. estimates that the 72nd Annual
Academy Awards will generate $60.5 million for the local economy.
The money was expected to pour in from hotel stays, expensive meals
and, of course, the big Oscar parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''That dollar figure includes collagen lip injections,'' joked
Jack Kyser, the chief economist for the development corporation.
''Although we haven't heard of any major reconstruction for the
Academy Awards this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, many say the city's payoff for the awards show
comes later -- after millions around the world have watched the
glamorous and glittery accept their awards.
</P>
<P>
   ''On TV, they see the blue skies and palm trees swaying in the
wind,'' said Morrie Goldman of the Entertainment Development Corp.
''Sitting on their couches in some cold and snowy place, the say to
themselves 'That's where I should be.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are some people who won't be tuning in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no interest in the show whatsoever,'' said Steve
Watkins, 47, of Los Angeles who says he only goes to the movies to
keep his wife happy. ''It just reinforces the general perception of
Hollywood as being the most popular pop cultural place in the
world.''

<HEADLINE> US Servicemen in SAfrica, Kuwait Die  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRASKOP, South Africa (AP) -- A U.S. serviceman who went down a
waterfall while sightseeing on a break from duty in flooded
Mozambique was found dead Saturday, South African police said.
</P>
<P>
   Airman Basic Jeffrey Costa had been missing since Friday
afternoon, when he was swimming in a river above Lisbon Falls, the
U.S. Air Force said in a statement. He hit a rock, became
unconscious and went over the 70-yard-high waterfall, the statement
cited witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Tom Dolney said that a body found Saturday had not been
identified. But Police Inspector Olga Marais said the body found by
rescuers was believed to be Costa's.
</P>
<P>
   Costa, an aircraft maintenance specialist assigned to the 352nd
Special Operations Group at Mildenhall Air Base in England, was on
break from the U.S. Air Force relief operation in flood-ravaged
Mozambique when he disappeared. His hometown and age were not
released.
</P>
<P>
   Graskop is about 220 miles northeast of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a U.S. Navy sailor has died from injuries sustained
in a fall from a hotel in Bahrain, the U.S. 5th Fleet said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified sailor fell from the fourth floor of the Mannai
Plaza Hotel in Juffair, a suburb southeast of the capital, Manama,
on Friday, the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fall was being investigated, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several U.S. Navy personnel stay at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The sailor's name was being withheld pending notification of
next of kin, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   And in Puerto Rico, two U.S. Navy servicemen died Saturday in a
car accident, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Neal and Thomas Massey were stationed at Roosevelt
Roads Naval Base in the eastern town of Ceiba, but police did not
know their hometowns or ages. Navy officials were not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The driver had swerved to avoid hitting another car at a highway
intersection, but lost control of the car and hit a tree, killing
both men, police said. It was not clear who was driving.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Wins Ulster Unionist Vote  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Assailed by critics of
compromise, Nobel laureate David Trimble narrowly won re-election
Saturday as leader of the Ulster Unionists, a Protestant party
central to the success or failure of Northern Ireland's peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists' grassroots council gave Trimble 457 votes
to 348 for a last-minute challenger, the Rev. Martin Smyth. The
party veteran argued that Trimble had been wrong to attempt a
coalition government involving Sinn Fein, the party linked to the
outlawed Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's victory came by a much tighter margin than predicted.
He also suffered a significant defeat when members voted to link
the party's future participation in government to retention of the
formal name of the province's predominantly Protestant police
force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agreed this decision will complicate efforts to
relaunch any power-sharing government. Britain has already promised
to change the force's name to the more neutral-sounding Police
Service for Northern Ireland. Under terms of the 2-year-old peace
accord, the goals of forming a local government and reforming the
police weren't supposed to be linked.
</P>
<P>
   And Britain's minister responsible for Northern Ireland, Peter
Mandelson, warned that Trimble's critics ''cannot be ignored, but
nor do they have a veto on future progress.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-party government -- the intended cornerstone of the
province's peace accord -- was formed in December, giving local
leaders a measure of self-rule. But the coalition was suspended in
February after the IRA refused to begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put a positive spin on the day's events, Trimble said
substantial opposition wasn't surprising given the IRA refusal. The
Ulster Unionists had agreed to form the coalition government in
expectation that the IRA would start to give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying the patience of the ordinary, decent folk of
Ulster too far and too hard,'' said Trimble, referring to Sinn Fein
and the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But his challenger said Trimble was mostly to blame for his
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''In recent years under David's leadership our party has been
seen continually to give ground to Sinn Fein-IRA, who through
threat of terror are trying to dominate our society,'' Smyth said.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old Smyth is a Presbyterian minister and former
leader of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's major Protestant
fraternal group. He had declared sharing power with Sinn Fein
unrealistic because, he said, the IRA never intends to scrap its
weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble outlasted Smyth, but the vote tying the police force's
name to Cabinet participation was a major loss for him. It passed
unanimously after a more moderately worded Trimble amendment
narrowly failed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants view any name change as a victory for the IRA,
which killed about 300 officers as part of its now-suspended
campaign to abolish Northern Ireland. Any retreat by Britain on the
issue would anger the province's Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, 55, who shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic
moderate John Hume, was elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995. He
was then considered a Protestant hard-liner, but the challenges of
peacemaking brought out a strong pragmatic streak. He took key
steps toward Sinn Fein even though it infuriated many within the
province's Protestant majority, and he led his party into the
coalition government even though that move was supported by only 58
percent of the party council.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble exacerbated Protestant unease last week in Washington
when, to many observers' surprise, he announced he would support
resuming government alongside Sinn Fein before any IRA disarmament
happened -- so long as the IRA pledged its ''unambiguous
commitment'' to the goal. Trimble emphasized Saturday this remained
his position.

<HEADLINE> Progress in UN Chemical Ban Treaty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany (AP) -- Representatives working on a U.N. treaty to
eliminate some of the world's deadliest chemicals ended a one-week
conference Saturday with no resolution on who would pay for
cleaning up developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which brought together negotiators from 121
countries, made ''considerable progress,'' but no breakthrough on
the financing question, said chairman John Buccini.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth and final round of negotiations is planned for early
December in South Africa, with plans to sign a treaty in Stockholm,
Sweden, in May 2001. Buccini said he was optimistic the timetable
could be met.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is a global ban on a ''dirty dozen'' list of highly
toxic chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants, or POPs,
which have been linked to cancer, birth defects and other genetic
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   The substances, which include pesticides like DDT, dioxin and
PCBs, are deemed the most harmful because they break down slowly
and accumulate at higher levels in the food chain. Some are already
banned in industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   But for many developing nations, chemicals like DDT provide a
cheap and effective way to wipe out mosquitos and prevent the more
immediate danger of malaria. That means weaning them from the
''dirty dozen'' requires richer nations to help pay for effective
replacements.
</P>
<P>
   China, India and other countries want a separate fund to be
established, while industrialized countries say letting existing
aid agencies handle the task would avoid creating a new
bureaucracy. The U.S. team stressed that additional money would
have to be provided in any case, but environmental groups like
Greenpeace and WWF International accused industrialized countries
of not being willing to make a real commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The future treaty risks unraveling if governments don't start
exercising political will,'' said Craig Boljkovac of WWF-Canada in
a statement. ''Making financial commitments voluntary and
unpredictable instead of mandatory will only serve to perpetuate
POPs problems rather than achieve solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The German representative, Ulrich Schlottmann, said agreement
was reached on another contentious point: formulating criteria
under which new chemicals could be brought under the treaty's
restrictions.

Iraq Decides To Hike Oil Exports
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq will increase oil exports by 700,000 barrels a day
within a few weeks -- almost a quarter of what analysts say the market needs to
curb soaring prices. Senior Iraqi Oil Ministry officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said they would start raising exports next week and hope to go
from 1.6 million to 2.3 million barrels a day in a few weeks. The decision
appears to be a bid to grab the initiative from OPEC. The 11-member Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Vienna on Monday for crucial talks on
whether to increase output as urged by the United States to drive down prices.

journalists, beating many with batons. Some demonstrators hid in stores lining

<HEADLINE> Former Pres. Bush Gives Son Advice  </HEADLINE>
By PAT LEISNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Bush says he gives his son
George W. plenty of advice -- but not about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't do politics anymore,'' the elder Bush told a group of
innkeepers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't go to Washington. I don't do press conferences. ... I
had my shot. In our family the baton is passed to two sons who are
giving it their very best in the political arena. My political days
are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before 1,800 people at a conference of Days Inn general
managers and owners, Bush said: ''The advice (to George W.) would
be more don't get down, get some rest, do your best, if you get
hurt we'll be there to help you, put our arms around you. It's like
a mother and father to a kid trying out for a team and might or
might not make it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like you all would do. You'd be there with pride, or
you'd be there to put your arm around him and get him back in the
ball game,'' Bush said in a brief question and answer session.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were posed by Joe Kane, president and chief
financial officer of Days Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 75, talked about his happy, less-hectic life today of
family, friends and faith. Then he touched on a variety of general
topics: the economy, free trade, a booming China, the Internet and
the communications revolution. Only fleetingly did he mention his
sons, Republicans George W. Bush, the Texas governor seeking to
become president, and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was proud of their accomplishments. Bush, making his
fourth trip to Florida this year, asked his listeners to put
politics and party affiliations aside and stand for a moment in his
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think how proud you'd feel as a dad,'' he said, ''if you had
two kids who were governors of two huge states, and one of them had
a chance to be president of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests 10 Shooting Suspects  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Police have arrested 10 suspects in the
shooting of a top Iranian reformer and none of them are affiliated
with his hard-line conservative opponents, Intelligence Minster Ali
Yunesi said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Quoted on Iranian state-run television, the minister said one of
the suspects in the March 12 attempt to assassinate Saeed Hajjarian
was on the technical staff of the hard-line Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps., but had been ''deceived'' into joining the others.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people do not have any affiliation to any organization
or any faction in Iran,'' Yunesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Reformist newspapers and Hajjarian's allies have blamed
hard-line opponents of the reform program initiated by President
Mohammad Khatami for the bid to kill Hajjarian, a confidant of
Khatami, Tehran city councilor and a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian, who was shot in the face by a gunman on a motorcycle,
is recovering with a bullet lodged in his neck. Yunesi's disclosure
of 10 arrests was four more than the authorities had previously
declared.
</P>
<P>
   He said they included a chemistry student -- identified earlier
as Saeed Asgar -- as well as a staff member of Tehran University.
Asgar is said to be the owner of the motorbike used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the suspects were unemployed, Yunesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Yunesi's statement, as reported by state radio and television,
did not give a motive for the attack or other details on the
suspects.

<HEADLINE> Amendment Offers Pinochet Immunity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's congress passed a constitutional
amendment Saturday that could protect former dictator Augusto
Pinochet from prosecution -- even if he is stripped of the immunity
he now enjoys as a senator-for-life.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet faces 77 criminal complaints in Chile stemming from
human rights abuses during his reign, and a judge probing the
complaints, Juan Guzman, has requested that the Santiago Court of
Appeals lift that immunity so Pinochet can stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   However, if he loses his congressional legal shield, the
84-year-old former ruler can now step down from the senate and take
advantage of the new legislation and the immunity it offers.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint session Saturday, the Senate and the House voted
113-27 for the amendment. The ''Dignity of the former President of
the Republic'' amendment will also give former heads of state a
salary equal to that of senators, about $6,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Law experts were unclear if there was any way to lift the
immunity written into the new amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned to Chile earlier this month from London after
successfully fighting extradition to Spain, where a judge wanted to
try him for human rights abuses during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
Britain released Pinochet after an independent team of four doctors
determined he was physically and mentally unfit to stand trial.

<HEADLINE> George W Bush Gets Advice From Dad  </HEADLINE>
By PAT LEISNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Bush says he gives his son
George W. plenty of advice -- but not about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't do politics anymore,'' the elder Bush told a group of
innkeepers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't go to Washington. I don't do press conferences. ... I
had my shot. In our family the baton is passed to two sons who are
giving it their very best in the political arena. My political days
are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before 1,800 people at a conference of Days Inn general
managers and owners, Bush said: ''The advice (to George W.) would
be more don't get down, get some rest, do your best, if you get
hurt we'll be there to help you, put our arms around you. It's like
a mother and father to a kid trying out for a team and might or
might not make it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like you all would do. You'd be there with pride, or
you'd be there to put your arm around him and get him back in the
ball game,'' Bush said in a brief question and answer session.
</P>
<P>
   The questions were posed by Joe Kane, president and chief
financial officer of Days Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 75, talked about his happy, less-hectic life today of
family, friends and faith. Then he touched on a variety of general
topics: the economy, free trade, a booming China, the Internet and
the communications revolution. Only fleetingly did he mention his
sons, Republicans George W. Bush, the Texas governor seeking to
become president, and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was proud of their accomplishments. Bush, making his
fourth trip to Florida this year, asked his listeners to put
politics and party affiliations aside and stand for a moment in his
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think how proud you'd feel as a dad,'' he said, ''if you had
two kids who were governors of two huge states, and one of them had
a chance to be president of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Amendment May Protect Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's congress passed a constitutional
amendment Saturday that could protect former dictator Augusto
Pinochet from prosecution -- even if he is stripped of the immunity
he now enjoys as a senator-for-life.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet faces 77 criminal complaints in Chile stemming from
human rights abuses during his reign, and a judge probing the
complaints, Juan Guzman, has requested that the Santiago Court of
Appeals lift that immunity so Pinochet can stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   However, if he loses his congressional legal shield, the
84-year-old former ruler can now step down from the senate and take
advantage of the new legislation and the immunity it offers.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint session Saturday, the Senate and the House voted
113-27 for the amendment. The ''Dignity of the former President of
the Republic'' amendment will also give former heads of state a
salary equal to that of senators, about $6,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Law experts were unclear if there was any way to lift the
immunity written into the new amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned to Chile earlier this month from London after
successfully fighting extradition to Spain, where a judge wanted to
try him for human rights abuses during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
Britain released Pinochet after an independent team of four doctors
determined he was physically and mentally unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 3,197 people were killed or
vanished after Pinochet seized power in a bloody coup.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators from the Socialist Party of President Ricardo Lagos
opposed the new legislation while their Christian Democrat allies
in the center-left pro-government coalition approved it, as did the
right-wing opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation immediately benefits Patricio Aylwin, the

<HEADLINE> Pope Urges Renewal of Faith  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel (AP) -- A weary Pope John Paul II traveled the
ancient streets of Jesus' boyhood town Saturday and celebrated Mass
in the soaring Basilica of the Annunciation, built on the site
where Christians believe an angel told Mary she would give birth to
the Christ Child.
</P>
<P>
   A cheering crowd of thousands -- undeterred by heavy security and
simmering Muslim-Christian tensions in this Arab town in the hills
of northern Israel -- lined Nazareth's winding streets to welcome a
pope who had spoken fervently of his wish to walk among them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have longed to come back to the town of Jesus,'' John Paul
said in a homily delivered at the Basilica, with colored light
streaming in through stained glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   Giving added resonance to the visit, it came as Roman Catholics
celebrated a feast day devoted to the Annunciation. The pope used
the story of Mary to urge Christians to seek a ''great renewal'' of
their own faith in this millennial year.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour visit to Nazareth -- nearly all of it devoted to a
Mass celebrated in the basilica before several thousand people --
laid bare the physical toll this pilgrimage has taken on the frail,
stooped pontiff, who turns 80 in two months.
</P>
<P>
   His voice was hoarse and badly slurred, and long pauses
punctuated his homily. At one point, the pope appeared to briefly
lose his balance as he knelt to pray in the dim grotto below the
main cathedral. Even in repose, his hands shook with the tremors
typical of Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although John Paul was clearly fatigued, the final and perhaps
most demanding day of his weeklong pilgrimage still lay ahead:
visits Sunday to several sites in Jerusalem's walled Old City that
are held holy -- and have been fought over through the ages -- by all
three faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Painstaking care has been taken during the papal visit to try to
foster religious harmony, but even so, the pope's presence has at
times been a lightening rod for just the sort of religious strife
that has torn the region for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In a token of that discord, Jerusalem's top Muslim leader said
Saturday, on the eve of a scheduled meeting with the pontiff, that
the figure of 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust was
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's true, the number was less than 6 million and Israel is
using this issue to get sympathy worldwide,'' said Ikrema Sabri,
the mufti, or top Muslim cleric. The 6 million figure is well
documented and there is broad consensus amongst mainstream Western
historians that it is reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the meeting with
the mufti would go ahead as scheduled. He said the pope was aware
of the mufti's remarks and planned no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, where religious rivalries have at times boiled over
into violence in recent years, the pope's visit had generated hopes
as well as anxiety. Last year, Nazareth's Christian minority and
Muslim majority quarreled bitterly over plans to construct a large
mosque in the shadow of the Catholic basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of past clashes, Israeli security blanketed the town,
closing off streets in the city center and forming a tight cordon
along the route of the papal motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was peaceful, but with a few reminders of the jostling
proximity in which faiths are practiced here. While the pope was
celebrating Mass inside the basilica, the muezzin began calling
Muslims to prayer over a loudspeaker at a mosque nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Some Muslims in the crowd responded by shouting, ''Allahu
Akbar'' -- God is great -- and whistling loudly. But the prayers did
not disrupt the Mass, and afterward the Muslim prayer leader called
on worshippers to stay calm and quiet during the remainder of the
pope's stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a visit to all the people of Nazareth,'' said Riad
Qudsi, a Muslim judge who was among those who turned out to welcome
the pontiff. ''There is no need for disturbances or problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, Navarro-Valls said Vatican officials had asked
Israeli authorities to reconsider a compromise plan that will allow
a mosque to be built on a third of the half-acre plot adjoining the
basilica.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout what has been a highly public pilgrimage, the pope
has managed to find a few moments for quieter contemplation in
places of special spiritual significance to him. As dusk fell on
Jerusalem Saturday, he visited the Garden of Gethsemane on the
Mount of Olives, praying in a basilica built on the spot where the
gospels recount Jesus' torment on the night of his betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   At the basilica, the pontiff bowed his head and rested his hands
on an altar built over the rock that, tradition says, Jesus prayed
over in such agony he sweated blood. Only the click of cameras
broke the silence.

<HEADLINE> Lahoud Against Syrian Pullout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon's president said Saturday that a
rare call for a Syrian pullout from Lebanon was ''Israeli
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a daring front-page commentary Thursday, Lebanon's leading
newspaper An-Nahar called on Syria to begin withdrawing its 30,000
troops from Lebanon in line with the 1989 agreement that ended the
country's 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said calls
for Syria to withdraw were ''Israeli motivated'' and ''aimed at
exerting pressure on Syria and Lebanon'' in peace negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian support was vital to Lahoud's election to the presidency
by the parliament in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad is due to meet President Clinton in
Geneva on Sunday for talks expected to revive the Syrian-Israeli
peace negotiations that have been stalled since January. If
Syrian-Israeli talks make progress, Lebanon is expected to conduct
negotiations with the Jewish state as well.
</P>
<P>
   An-Nahar's managing director, Gebran Tueni, wrote that many
Lebanese, mainly Christians, rejected Syrian control over their
country. ''They are asking if the price of peace in the region is
definitive Syrian control over Lebanon,'' said Tueni, who himself
is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that Syrian troops have played a
stabilizing role in Lebanon's postwar recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In a conciliatory gesture, Lahoud said he was ''confident that
Syria itself is not committed to staying in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal, he said, ''is linked to a time that serves our
interests and not to a time that serves Israeli interests.''

<HEADLINE> Serbian Seized Transmitter Returned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Following a week of anti-government
protests, the Yugoslav Ministry of Telecommunications backed down
and returned a transmitter that it had seized from a Serbian TV
station, independent media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians from the local TV station in Kraljevo, 70 miles
south of Belgrade, have reinstalled the main transmitter,
independent B2-92 radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications ministry confiscated the transmitter on
March 18, claiming it lacked a frequency license.
</P>
<P>
   The move triggered seven days of anti-government demonstrations
organized by the opposition-run municipal government. Local
governments oversee local broadcasters, while the government of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic controls all state media.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the transmitter, Kraljevo authorities promised to
cease the anti-Milosevic protests and pay about $10,000 in
frequency license taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several months, dozens of non-governmental media
outlets and independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down
or subjected to severe fines under Serbia's repressive Information
Law. Milosevic's ruling Socialists and two allied parties sponsored
the legislation.

restraint seemed to go unheeded. Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit

Mich. HMO Doctors Vote To Unionize

Negotiation was formed last year by the AMA in response to what it described as
increasing workload and financial pressures being placed on doctors by HMOs and
other managed-care companies. Federal antitrust laws ban most of the nation's
650,000 doctors from joining a union because they are self-employed. Only
doctors who are employed by a hospital or municipality, for example, may
unionize.

<HEADLINE> Putin Looks Headed for Victory  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Weary of chaos and government corruption, Russians
are expected to give Vladimir Putin a victory in presidential
elections Sunday, hoping the ex-KGB spy can clean up the country
and restore it as a world power without rolling back democratic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of all this disorder,'' said Vladimir Prishchev, a
pensioner casting his ballot for Putin in Russia's Pacific port
city of Vladivostok, where graft is rampant and electricity is
unreliable. ''When Putin takes charge of something, he takes it to
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   With a Putin presidency seen as inevitable by most Russians, the
question is what he plans for the world's largest country in land
mass. Putin has given few firm commitments beyond saying that
restoring strong government is his top goal -- a jarring idea in a
nation that has endured centuries of dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the very start Russia was created as a supercentralized
state. This is part of its genetic code, traditions and people's
mentality,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin spent Saturday evening at a soccer match. Campaigning was
forbidden on election eve, and workers pasted over campaign posters
with new advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Troops also fanned out to polling stations around the country,
guarding against possible Chechen terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show Putin with about 50 percent of voters backing
him, with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov far behind with about
20 percent. The 10 other candidates are mostly unknown, with only
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and liberal Grigory Yavlinsky
likely to get more than a handful of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The only worry for Putin was whether voter apathy would keep
turnout low. That would likely deny him the 50-percent plus vote he
needs to avoid an April 16 runoff against the next-highest vote
winner. Such a runoff would probably be against Zyuganov, with
Putin virtually guaranteed victory.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has devoid of suspense because everyone assumes
that Putin will win and most of the candidates have stayed home.
But while the campaigning has been bland, few have been nostalgic
for the character assassination and dirty tricks that normally
besmirch Russian elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians hope Putin is going to clear up the corruption and
deceit that swamped the final years of former president Boris
Yeltsin's administration. He is the most popular leader in recent
Russian history, polls show.
</P>
<P>
   Others, mainly liberals and intellectuals, worry that the
ex-member of the KGB will bring back the iron controls of the
Communist era and crush any dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under Putin, a new stage in the introduction of modernized
Stalinism has begun. Authoritarianism is growing harsher, society
is being militarized,'' a group of Soviet-era dissidents said in a
recent open letter.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts see Putin as a pragmatist serious about tackling
Russia's problems, but lacking clear plans. And while the power of
the state is likely to increase, democratic reform has gone too far
to be rolled back, they add.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nor will Putin seek to turn Russia into a police state. Over
the past decade the Russian people have learned to cherish their
private property and personal freedoms,'' said Masha Lipman, a
political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concern about Putin's democratic credentials, there
has been none of the fear and tension that drenched the 1996
presidential vote, when Yeltsin fought off a strong challenge by
the Communist leader Zyuganov. Now many Russians treat elections as
something routine, even boring.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says he wants to restore Russia as a great power. He wants
to modernize Russia, saying it must catch up with the West, but
that he will work with the West if it treats Moscow as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his policies, Russia will have a strong and healthy
president after years of weak or ill leaders. Putin is expected to
be cool-headed and pragmatic and Moscow's policies won't be a
puzzle, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''He shows a high degree of independence, an ability to work,
mobility and activity, something we haven't seen in a Kremlin
leader in decades,'' said Roy Medvedev, a prominent historian.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge awaiting Putin is enormous. The economy is in
ruins and market reforms have been discredited by incompetence and
corruption. Schools and hospitals are falling apart and people
sometimes go months without pay.
</P>
<P>
   Putin comes across as stern and colorless, often cold. His
unflinching stare rarely shows feeling. His rise to the top of the
Russian government is as much an enigma as the man.
</P>
<P>
   After an unspectacular KGB career, Putin rose after the Soviet
collapse, usually in obscure posts and with no clear record of
achievement. Putin was virtually unknown when Yeltsin made him
prime minister last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Putin became popular because of his tough image after years of
rudderless government under the often ill Yeltsin and for the
military campaign against breakaway Chechnya. Putin's ascent was
aided by relentless and mostly flattering coverage in the Russian
media, especially powerful state-run television.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin resigned early Dec. 31, saying Putin was the best man to
protect Russian democracy and making him acting president.

<HEADLINE> Former boxer ''Hurricane'' Carter blames police conspiracy forarrest  </HEADLINE>
By TIM MOLLOY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Rubin ''Hurricane'' Carter, whose 19 years in
prison for murders he said he did not commit inspired an Academy
Award-nominated film, said Saturday he believes both he and
death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal were victims of an FBI-directed
conspiracy against high-profile blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, whom he called
the ''five-star general'' of all American police, ordered officers
to stop black leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.
Carter said officers later followed that direction to frame him and
Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every police officer in every city, every county, are under
the control of the five-star general,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors in both cases have denied trying to frame
either Carter or Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   Carter made the remarks at an anti-death penalty gathering at a
Pittsburgh church where he called for racial harmony and the
release of Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of murder in the 1981
shooting of police officer Daniel Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he was targeted because of his high profile as a
boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on television every week prizefighting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His case is the basis of ''The Hurricane,'' starring actor
Denzel Washington, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his
portrayal of Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter met Saturday with Abu-Jamal at the state prison in
Waynesburg. He said officers framed Abu-Jamal for speaking out
against police brutality. Abu-Jamal has become a symbol for many
death penalty opponents of the wrongs of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he and Abu-Jamal discussed ways that they believed
prosecutors deliberately withheld evidence that would have helped
them, but declined to go into details.
</P>
<P>
   Carter pointed to the FBI's COINTELPRO campaign as evidence of a
conspiracy. A Senate investigating committee revealed in 1976 that
the campaign had used false documents, infiltrators and snitches to
divide and smear civil rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and John Artis were convicted in the 1966 shootings of
three people in a Paterson, N.J. bar. Their convictions were
overturned in 1975 but both were found guilty at a second trial in
1976. A federal judge freed Carter in 1985, ruling that prosecutors
improperly argued that he was out for racial revenge in the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors elected not to try him again after the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld the decision.

<HEADLINE> NY Convict Furloughed For Oscars  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In real life, Tyrene Manson bunks with 59
other women in a New York prison, sharing five toilets, eight
shower stalls and breakfasts of oatmeal and cold cereal.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, in a Hollywood fairy tale come true, she's
sleeping in luxury at the Chateau Marmont and cruising Sunset
Boulevard in a stretch limo. On Sunday, she'll get decked out in
pearls and a floor-length gown and rub shoulders with the stars at
the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a convict.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't even dream anything like this,'' Manson, 30, gushed
over the phone from her hotel room Saturday. ''It's like Alice in
Wonderland and Cinderella. I can't even describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson was jailed for possessing and selling crack in 1997 while
the subject of a documentary about aspiring boxers in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The film, ''On the Ropes,'' is nominated for an Academy Award,
and Manson was granted a furlough by the commissioner of the New
York State Department of Correctional Services so she could attend
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   She has been on a work release program since the fall, spends
only four nights a week in jail and is not considered a flight
risk, said correctional services spokesman Jim Flateau.
</P>
<P>
   The film shows a criminal justice system that failed Manson by
assigning her incompetent attorneys and an indifferent judge.
Directors Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen also train their
cameras on Manson's coach at Brooklyn's Bed-Stuy Boxing Center,
Harvey Keitt, and on two fellow aspiring boxers, Noel Santiago and
George Walton, now Manson's fiance and a professional boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to go to Universal Studios and I would love to
meet Denzel Washington,'' Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, Manson's Oscar idyll will be over; she'll be
back in jail.

<P>
   She has been on a work release program since the fall, spends

risk, said correctional services spokesman Jim Flateau. Manson made
her trip unaccompanied by corrections personnel and is not required
to check in with them or wear a monitoring device during her trip,
although she is expected to not venture outside of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Manson maintains she was convicted after police found a piece of
crack the size of a grain of rice behind some upholstery in a room
she shared with five people including her uncle, an addict with
AIDS who sold drugs to an undercover cop.
</P>
<P>
   The film shows a criminal justice system that failed Manson by

</P>
<P>
   All are in Hollywood from Brooklyn and Queens this weekend
courtesy of The Learning Channel, which will air the film April 4.
They've spent their time eating sushi, window shopping in Hollywood
and driving around in a limo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to go to Universal Studios and I would love to
meet Denzel Washington,'' Manson said.
</P>
<P>
   Manson even has a real-life fairy godmother -- Park City, Utah,
resident Diane Mellen, who saw ''On the Ropes'' at the Sundance
Film Festival in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mellen, 54, took Manson on a shopping spree at Lord &AMP; Taylor in
Manhattan earlier this month and outfitted her for the Oscar's in a
sweeping black Jones New York gown, three-inch heels and pearls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never done anything like this before,'' Mellen said
Saturday from Manson's room at the Chateau Marmont. ''But I really
was very moved by the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson said she's still training as a boxer, and hopes one day
to open a gym for women boxers at the Queens church where she works
as a secretary through the work release program.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, Manson's Oscar idyll will be over, and she'll be
back in jail. She's due to report back to the Bayview Correctional
Facility in Manhattan at 5 p.m., Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau said Manson's furlough is unusual, but not
unprecedented. Prisons Commissioner Glenn Goord decided to grant it
because Manson was jailed for a nonviolent crime and has a clean
disciplinary record. The trip also could increase the career
possibilities available to her upon her release from prison -- a
goal of work-release programs, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   Manson could be released as early as October.
</P>
<P>
   Flateau added that he and Goord have not seen ''On the Ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither one of us has seen it, and frankly we don't have to,''
Flateau said. ''We don't make our decisions based on that.''

<HEADLINE> US Airways, Union Reach Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- US Airways and the Association of Flight
Attendants hailed their agreement Saturday on a tentative five-year
contract that keeps planes flying and provides raises for the
union's 10,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an agreement that shows the company has recognized the
value of the flight attendants,'' union negotiator Lynn Lenosky
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the pact, which the union's rank and file must
approve, allows it to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant US Airways flights were not disrupted this weekend
as had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got airplanes, we've got crews and we are flying a full
schedule and operating normally,'' US Airways spokesman David
Castelveter said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Union and airline bargainers stayed at the table with federal
mediators for more than three hours past a 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday
strike deadline. US Airways had said it would halt operations
rather than try to weather a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement would guarantee raises totaling 10
percent for US Airways attendants, plus some new paid holidays and
a signing bonus, according to Lenosky. The starting salary for
attendants has been $17,145 a year, with those at the pay scale
earning $36,918.
</P>
<P>
   The attendants have not had a raise since 1996, the year their
previous contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   Also, union negotiators said they won pension improvements,
including the elimination of a two-tiered system under which
married attendants received lower benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lenosky said the attendants won contract language they wanted
protecting their jobs if US Airways ever sells off part of its
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it accomplished its goal of bringing labor
costs and policies closer in line with major competitors.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways said in a written statement that the deal ''works for
our flight attendants and allows the company to compete in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to provide further details Saturday,
but they had been seeking changes to sick leave and scheduling. AFA
negotiators said only that the union had agreed to some concessions
on work rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed to look at particular items in our contract and once
we made some adjustments to those particular items, the company was
willing to accept that they were on par with the industry,''
Lenosky said.
</P>
<P>
   More details of the deal will be made public after the AFA's
council on US Airways, headed by Lenosky, votes on recommending
ratification; that is expected this week. Then the rank and file
will vote by mail in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, US Airways ticket holders were breathing
easier.
</P>
<P>
   At Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Renee and Ken
Pedersen and four friends were relieved after hours of contingency
planning for getting to Phoenix to visit their pregnant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   They had left their home in Newmanstown, Pa., at 2 a.m. Saturday
for the drive to BWI in hopes of getting standby seats on Southwest
to replace their US Airways tickets if the strike had gone ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we came into the airport, there was a line at US Airways.
Some man behind us told us the flights were running. We all
sighed,'' said Renee Pedersen.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said they were not confident of averting a strike
until shortly before a deal was announced around 3:30 a.m. Saturday
</P>
<P>
   Sequestering the two sides in a Washington hotel, the National
Mediation Board swore them to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has strikebreaking powers in the
transportation industry, was kept updated on progress while
traveling in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   During the night, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart issued a
statement saying Clinton was urging the sides ''to stay at the
table and redouble their efforts to reach an agreement as soon as
possible. They owe that to each other and to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants who had held a candlelight vigil at Reagan
National Airport outside Washington through the night moved
downtown to wait outside the hotel as rumors that agreement was
near spread. When negotiators emerged to confirm it, they erupted
in cheers and hugs.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney issued a statement Saturday
saying the labor dispute's successful resolution ''proved the
age-old lesson -- when working women and men join together and stay
together they win.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Role Cited in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon's president said Saturday that a
rare call for a Syrian pullout from Lebanon was ''Israeli
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a daring front-page commentary Thursday, Lebanon's leading
newspaper An-Nahar called on Syria to begin withdrawing its 30,000
troops from Lebanon in line with the 1989 agreement that ended the
country's 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said calls
for Syria to withdraw were ''Israeli motivated'' and ''aimed at
exerting pressure on Syria and Lebanon'' in peace negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian support was vital to Lahoud's election to the presidency
by the parliament in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad is due to meet President Clinton in
Geneva on Sunday for talks expected to revive the Syrian-Israeli
peace negotiations that have been stalled since January. If
Syrian-Israeli talks make progress, Lebanon is expected to conduct
negotiations with the Jewish state as well.
</P>
<P>
   An-Nahar's managing director, Gebran Tueni, wrote that many
Lebanese, mainly Christians, rejected Syrian control over their
country. ''They are asking if the price of peace in the region is
definitive Syrian control over Lebanon,'' said Tueni, who himself
is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that Syrian troops have played a
stabilizing role in Lebanon's postwar recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In a conciliatory gesture, Lahoud said he was ''confident that
Syria itself is not committed to staying in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal, he said, ''is linked to a time that serves our
interests and not to a time that serves Israeli interests.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Rabbis Mull Same-sex Unions  </HEADLINE>
By GARY D. ROBERTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Reform Judaism is poised for a vote that
could make it the most influential U.S. religious group to support
clergy who perform same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution sanctioning commitment ceremonies is expected to
come up at the Central Conference of American Rabbis convention
starting Sunday in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual step, discussions will be held privately, a sign
of the issue's volatility. A similar vote at the group's 1998
convention was dropped to head off potentially divisive debate.
</P>
<P>
   The group's 1,800 members serve at least 1.5 million Reform
Jews, the largest and most liberal of Judaism's three major
branches in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, introduced by some female rabbis and endorsed by
the conference's resolution committee, reads: ''The relationship of
a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through
appropriate Jewish ritual. In accordance with the principles of
Reform Judaism, each rabbi should decide about officiation
according to his/her own rabbinic conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters believe rabbis should affirm committed relationships
between Jewish gays and lesbians as sacred, just like Jewish
marriage. While the conference supports civil same-sex unions and
approved openly gay rabbis a decade ago, some homosexuals say they
still feel like second-class citizens at temple. The resolution
would give religious legitimacy to same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a major religious group to pass a resolution that same-sex
unions are worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish
rituals, it would send a message to them that they are not
abnormal,'' said Rabbi Paul Menitoff, the conference's executive
vice president in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Menitoff expects a majority of the 500 rabbis coming to
Greensboro will approve the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a women's issue or a gay or lesbian issue. This is
a human rights issue,'' said Rabbi Shira Stern, a co-leader of the
275-member Women's Rabbinic Network, which introduced the
resolution in January. Stern said the resolution gives rabbis
leeway in deciding whether to declare a same-sex union to be a
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Jews who have no choice in the matter of sexual identity,
we as leaders of the movement must provide them with the religious
framework in which to celebrate their union,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the resolution believe it would disparage rabbis
who believe same-sex relationships do not meet criteria for the
Jewish concept of ''kiddushin,'' or a sanctified relationship
between a Jewish husband and wife. Moreover, they warn it would
alienate Reform Judaism from Israel, where it seeks stronger
recognition, and create sharp divisions among rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are ''not homophobes, we're not gay-bashing. We're not
opposed to the dignity and Jewish integrity of gays and lesbians in
our midst,'' said Rabbi Clifford Librach of Temple Sinai in Sharon,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A possible compromise recognizing the diversity of opinion on
the subject within the rabbinate is in the works, members of the
Central Conference say.
</P>
<P>
   An alternate resolution backed by Librach and others urges the
Reform rabbinate to ''strengthen its efforts to seek justice for
gays and lesbians in American society'' by pushing for civil and
political rights for partners, but stops short of sanctioning
same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah condemns male homosexual intercourse, but Reform
Judaism has been liberal on gay rights, taking into account
contemporary understanding of homosexuality and the Jewish values
of human dignity and justice.
</P>
<P>
   Many Reform rabbis already have officiated at same-sex
ceremonies at synagogues. Librach said he would not, but ''would
perhaps arrange a celebration of the Jewish integrity of their
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a coalition of 895
Reform congregations, has taken no stand on same-sex religious
unions, but has approved resolutions supporting civil unions and
nondiscrimination against gays, said UAHC spokeswoman Emily Grotta.
</P>
<P>
   Among other religious groups, the Unitarian Universalist
Association, a denomination with about 150,000 members, has
officially endorsed decisions by its clergy to perform same-sex
unions. Presbyterian, United Methodist and Episcopal church leaders
are expected to take up the issue this year.

Putin Presidency Expected
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russians are expected to give Vladimir Putin a victory in
presidential elections Sunday, hoping the ex-KGB spy can clean up the country
and restore it as a world power without rolling back democratic reforms. Opinion
polls show Putin with about 50 percent of voters backing him, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov far behind with about 20 percent. The only worry for
Putin was whether voter apathy would keep turnout low. That would likely deny
him the 50-percent plus vote he needs to avoid an April 16 runoff against the
next-highest vote winner.

Iraq Plans To Increase Oil Exports

   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Senior Iraqi Oil Ministry officials said they would
start raising oil exports next week, hoping to go from 1.6 million to 2.3
million barrels a day. Analysts say that is almost a quarter of what the market
needs to curb soaring prices. The 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries meets in Vienna on Monday for crucial talks on whether to increase
output as urged by the United States to drive down prices.

Clinton Advises Pakistan on Weapons

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- President Clinton admonished Pakistan's military
ruler Saturday for a ''tragic squandering of effort, energy and wealth'' on
confrontations with India and a nuclear arms race. But Clinton's appeal for
restraint seemed to go unheeded. Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit
Pakistan since 1969 and he brought a sobering warning of diplomatic isolation
and worsening problems unless Islamabad changes course. It was a hard message
for a nation that stood loyally with the United States through a half century of
Cold War crises.

Marchers Protest NYPD Shooting
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Protesters hurled bottles and clashed with police today
after a funeral for an unarmed black man shot to death by an undercover officer
-- the third such killing in the past 13 months. A miles-long procession of more
than 3,000 protesters and mourners led by the Rev. Al Sharpton had followed a
hearse carrying the body of 26-year-old Patrick Dorismond from a funeral home to
Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn for the service. Dorismond was shot
to death March 16 after an officer conducting a drug sting allegedly asked him
if he would sell marijuana.

   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- One swing on the most unforgiving hole in
golf cost Hal Sutton some breathing room against Tiger Woods going into the
final round of The Players Championship. Sutton answered Woods' best round ever

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Erick Barkley will forgo his final two years of eligibility
at St. John's and enter the NBA draft, someone close to the university told The
Associated Press today. Barkley, whose sophomore season was marred by a pair of
suspensions for NCAA violations, will make the announcement Tuesday, the source
said on condition he not be identified. Barkley and St. John's have been hounded
by the NCAA all season, with the team's leading scorer most recently meeting
with investigators March 13.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prises Rise a Half Cent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices edged up a mere half a cent
in the past two weeks, and the increases may be coming to an end,
an industry analyst said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The average retail price of all grades of gasoline, including
taxes, was about $1.59 per gallon as of Friday, an increase of only
a half cent from March 10, according to the Lundberg Survey of
10,000 stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices are down, which affects all petroleum products,
analyst Trilby Lundberg said. But she warned that when demand for
gas increases rises, prices usually do, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could be the end or just a lull in the price hikes,'' she
said. ''Spring and summer demand for gasoline could be an up factor
for the price of gasoline apart from the prices for crude oil.''
</P>
<P>
   While the nationwide average cost of gas rose half a penny,
there are starkly different regional trends. For example, ''Prices
are down more than 6 cents in the Midwest but up nearly a dime in
the West,'' Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at self-service stations averaged nearly $1.55 for
regular unleaded gasoline, $1.64 for mid-grade and $1.75 for
premium.
</P>
<P>
   Full-service prices were about $1.84 for regular, $1.93 for
mid-grade and $2.01 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Italian Workers Strike For 6 hours  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEZZOMERICO, Italy (AP) -- Steelworkers at a foundry in northern
Italy struck for six hours Saturday to show solidarity with U.S.
colleagues locked out in six-month labor dispute in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six of the 28 Italian workers on duty agreed to take part
in the sympathy strike, union representative Umberto Zillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very good score for us,'' Zillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mezzomerico plant and the plant in Duluth, Minn., are both
owned by GS Industries, of Charlotte, N.C., which also has plants
in the Philippines, Chile, Peru, Mexico and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Duluth's ME International went on strike last year
over what they allege are unfair labor practices, including alleged
safety problems and mandatory overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The strike turned into a lockout last month when the plant
rejected workers' offer to return to work during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes in Italy typically last for hours -- seldom months, or
even days -- and replacement workers are rare. Italian workers
expressed surprise last month when a touring labor representative
from Duluth told them of the length of the walkout there.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed then to Saturday's sympathy strike. Zillo said
Saturday the striking Italian workers also meant the strike as a
warning signal to their own employers.

Gov't Said Unmoved by Microsoft Offer

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government lawyers consider an offer from the Microsoft
Corp. to settle its antitrust trial so inadequate in important areas that there
were no immediate plans to resume negotiations in Chicago, people close to the
case said today. These sources did not rule out the possibility of talks
resuming, and the government continued to evaluate the proposal by Microsoft to
end the case before Tuesday, when the trial judge has threatened to announce his
verdict. Published reports said Microsoft's offer included promises to separate
the company's Internet browser software from its dominant Windows operating

Putin Expected To Win Election
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russians are expected to give Vladimir Putin a victory in
presidential elections Sunday, hoping the ex-KGB spy can clean up the country
and restore it as a world power without rolling back democratic reforms. Opinion
polls show Putin with about 50 percent of voters backing him, with Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov far behind with about 20 percent. The only worry for
Putin was whether voter apathy would keep turnout low. That would likely deny
him the 50-percent plus vote he needs to avoid an April 16 runoff against the
next-highest vote winner.

unions. A resolution sanctioning commitment ceremonies is expected to come up at
the Central Conference of American Rabbis convention starting tomorrow in
Greensboro. While the conference supports civil same-sex unions and approved
openly gay rabbis a decade ago, some homosexuals say they still feel like
second-class citizens at temple. The resolution would give religious legitimacy

restraint seemed to go unheeded. Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit

the Big Ten to NCAA West Region champions. The Badgers (22-13), whose only

Boilermakers without a field goal for nearly six minutes late in the game to
become the lowest-seeded team to advance to the Final Four since 1986. Jon

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Release Hostages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim guerrillas on Saturday
released 18 of 53 hostages held for five days in a southern jungle
hide-out after the military agreed to halt rescue attempts,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf rebels turned over nine children, eight teachers and
a civilian to Congressman Jerry Salapuddin, a former Muslim rebel
commander who is leading negotiations for the release of the
hostages from a rebel camp in the hinterlands of Basilan province,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Salapuddin escorted the freed hostages to a tearful reunion with
relatives waiting in an army brigade headquarters in Basilan's
capital of Isabela, said Victor Leozo, a Red Cross official who
witnessed the release. Basilan is about 560 miles south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of crying and I was moved to tears myself when
I saw a friend among the freed hostages,'' Leozo told radio station
DXRZ.
</P>
<P>
   The military halted attempts to rescue the hostages Saturday to
allow negotiations for their release, said Brig. Gen. Narciso
Abaya. Among the hostages still in rebel hands are a Catholic
priest, two teachers and several children seized from two schools
on Monday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Abu Sayyaf spokesman, Abu Ahmad, said the group would release
more hostages as negotiations continue. He said the group also
wanted to talk with movie action star Robin Padilla, a Muslim
convert who has offered to help negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have demanded 200 sacks of rice, canned goods and
medicine in exchange for at least 10 of the hostages. They also
have demanded the dismissal of Basilan police chief Akmadul
Pangambayan and Governor Wahab Akbar.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have accused Akbar of having ordered the
abduction of 11 relatives of Abu Sayyaf chieftain Khadaffy
Janjalani, including his wife, 1-year-old daughter and mother, to
force the rebels to free their hostages. Akbar has denied any
involvement in the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Diomedio Villanueva, chief of the military's Southern
Command, said Janjalani's relatives may have been abducted by
relatives of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''This somehow reflects the desperate situation being faced by
families of the victims,'' Villanueva said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels threatened Friday to kill the hostages if Janjalani's
relatives are not released.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf and a a larger rebel group, the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, are both battling the Manila government for an
independent Islamic nation in the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Phony Plastic Surgeon Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Plastic was the alleged scam artist's
specialty, but he didn't stop at credit cards. He also passed
himself off as a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Adolfo Roman Quinteros, described as a
secondary-school dropout from Argentina, was arrested by federal
police on Thursday in the northern city of Monterrey, where he
posed as an Argentine consul using a passport falsified to identify
him as a diplomat, the federal attorney general's office reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The office said Roman Quinteros had ''deceived hundreds of
Mexican women from various states of the republic'' by posing as a
plastic surgeon and convincing them to let him sketch them in the
nude. ''Afterward he carried out operations which put their life
and health in grave risk,'' it said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   It said he had not completed secondary school, which ends in the
9th grade in Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries, the agency said, Roman Quinteros is accused
of committing credit card fraud, trading in stolen U.S. cars, and
falsifying documents -- including forging the signature of former
Argentine President Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
   The international police coordination agency Interpol was
involved in the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Also taken into custody was Ricardo Sebastian Rodriguez, another
Argentine citizen, who accompanied Roman Quinteros in a Mercedes
Benz with false diplomatic license plates, the agency said.

   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israel's education minister met Saturday and agreed that peace
efforts were back on track, an Israeli spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's meeting with Education Minister Yossi Sarid, an
outspoken dove and leader of the progressive Meretz party, comes
less than a week after Israeli-Palestinian peace talks resumed in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (Arafat and Sarid) discussed the current status of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and said the peace process was on
the right track,'' said Yossi Gazit, the spokesman for the Sarid's
Meretz Party. Arafat's spokesmen were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gazit, Arafat expressed concern that a possible
Meretz party departure from the government over conflicts with
another coalition partner, might endanger the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid assured Arafat that Meretz would continue to work doggedly
for the success of peace efforts, in or out of government.
</P>
<P>
   After a freeze in the talks of about a month, negotiators are
again grappling with such heated issues as the Palestinian demand
for a state and a capital in Jerusalem.

   In a sign of progress, last week Israel withdrew from another
6.1 percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Workers Rally For New Contract  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANSFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- Locked out steelworkers and thousands of
supporters held a noisy rally Saturday to press AK Steel to reach a
contract settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''AK is a renegade company,'' Steelworkers International
President George Becker told the cheering crowd. ''As an evil
empire, they are determined to destroy this union.''
</P>
<P>
   About 620 local members have been locked out of their jobs since
their contract with Pittsburgh-based Armco Inc. expired seven
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Middletown-based AK Steel, which bought Armco a month after the
lockout started, has used nonunion replacement workers to continue
making steel for auto emission systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings tears to your eyes that so many people care,'' said
Local 169 member Timothy Risinger, 40, of Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   Union backers traveled from as far away as Chicago and
Mississippi to lend support. Police Lt. Steve Sheldon estimated the
crowd at 4,000, while the union said 6,000 attended.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters carried signs reading ''Stop AK/Armco's war on
Steelworker's families'' and ''United we stand -- divided we beg.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of unions were represented and brought contributions of
more than $50,000 for a lockout fund.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka said the 13 million
member federation would stand by the workers and help them win
their jobs back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your fight is our fight,'' Trumka said. ''We're going to beat
the scabs with 169.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers want the company to return to the bargaining table
and drop its demand for unlimited, mandatory overtime. The company
says it wants control over scheduling, which is the case with other
steelmakers. No talks have been held since last month.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Alan McCoy said Saturday that the company does
not want to break up the union. ''What we need is an equitable
market contract,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout has been marked by threats and vandalism. A fight
outside the plant Sept. 10 injured 14 guards and workers, and pipe
bombs have placed in the mailboxes of replacement workers.

<HEADLINE> Snuck In Steals Arkansas Derby  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY KING, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Snuck In, making his first start of the
year, beat Big Numbers by a neck Saturday in the $100,000 Rebel
Stakes at Oaklawn Park in the last big prep for the Arkansas Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Cash Asmussen for his brother, trainer Steve Asmussen,
Snuck In returned $4.20, $3 and $2.60. Big Numbers paid $3.80 and
$3.40. It was another 4\ lengths back to pacesetting Fan the Flame,
who paid $5.20.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very laid-back horse in the morning until he gets some
competition,'' Cash Asmussen said. ''Then, he's a tiger. Steve's
got him slowed down in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In broke alertly but was fighting his rider a little going
into the first turn, but settled nicely heading down the
backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''He relaxed so good, he wasn't in any hurry,'' said the jockey,
who flew in from France on Friday. ''That's what made him win. He's
got speed to spare. We just need to conserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In ran 1 1-16 miles in 1:42.99 on a track rated good. His
trainer said Snuck In would remain at Oaklawn with an eye on the
1[-mile Arkansas Derby, a Kentucky Derby prep, on April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Asmussen also said Big Numbers would stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Arkansas Derby is $500,000,'' Steve Asmussen said. ''If I
can win it running five, I'd be glad to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One and an eighth miles is definitely in his grasp in my
mind,'' Cash Asmussen said. ''A mile and a quarter (the Kentucky
Derby length), it would be in the lap of the gods then.''

<HEADLINE> Funeral of Patrick Dorismond ends in violence  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Dorismond's funeral fired both Haitian
protest and pride on Saturday as an angry crowd burned an American
flag draping the coffin and mourners clashed with riot police after
a procession that began with Haiti's national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Police used batons to knock back bottles thrown outside a
Brooklyn church as the funeral Mass ended. One officer was seen
holding his head, wrapped in a bandage. In all, 23 police were
injured, some suffering torn ligaments or broken bones, others had
to have shards of glass rinsed from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 27 people were arrested on charges ranging from
disorderly conduct to inciting a riot. They were expected to be
arraigned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Five civilians were injured, police said, but details of their
conditions were not immediately released. Norman Siegel, executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said some of those
arrested received medical treatment at the police station house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our blood, it's not cheap. We must let them know this
must stop,'' said Michel Eddy, a 26-year-old Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem on the street contrasted with the message of peace
delivered at Mass for the unarmed man killed by a police bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not here to judge or condemn. We are here to weep with
the family,'' the Rev. Rollin Darbouze told about 1,000 mourners at
Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in the Flatbush neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is precious,'' he said. ''It is a gift from God. Respect
it and love every human being, whether they are black or white.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two-hour service ended around 2 p.m., a group of unarmed
community affairs police and uniformed officers outside the church
began having increasing difficulty contolling the crowd. Within
half an hour, about 25 officers in riot helmets carrying batons
entered the crowd and were met with people throwing bottles and
knocking down police barricades. The face-off between hundreds of
protesters and a growing number of police escalated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour after the disturbance began, the crowd
dispersed, but random unrest took its place as store owners
shuttered shop fronts on Flatbush Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Rioters tore bricks out of the sidewalk, smashed two police
cruisers and a telephone booth. A cardboard box was lit into a
bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   As about 30 officers walked down the avenue, bottles rained over
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was brewing, you could see it -- and they (police) didn't
take the steps needed to diffuse it,'' said Siegel, who watched the
violence explode just feet away as he stood in front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said, ''Police officers
should receive the thanks of the entire city for the restraint they
exhibited in the face of sustained hostility and abuse.
Unfortunately, when you allow demagogues to take over for political
and divisive purposes, the American flag gets shredded and burned;
steel barricades are hurled and bottles are thrown injuring police
officers and civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral spokeswoman Sunny Mindel said Giuliani visited the
injured police officers at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn,
arriving about 4:30 p.m. and staying for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters demanded the mayor's resignation over
Dorismond's killing -- the fourth of an unarmed black civilian by
NYPD undercover officers in the past 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, the 26-year-old son of one of Haiti's most beloved
singers, Andre Dorismond, was fatally shot last week in Manhattan
after rebuffing an undercover officer's alleged request for drugs
during a sting operation. He had gotten into a scuffle with the
officer and was killed when the gun of a backup cop went off.
</P>
<P>
   The backup officer, Detective Anthony Vasquez, issued a
statement on behalf of his family Saturday, telling the Dorismonds:
''As a father and a son, I can only imagine the depth of your
grief. Our prayers are with you.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the hearse carrying Dorismond's body led a miles-long
march of thousands from a Brooklyn funeral home to the church, some
shouted ''You didn't protect him, you killed him!'' at unarmed
community affairs officers nearby.
</P>
<P>
   One sign read: ''Giuliani must go!''
</P>
<P>
   The coffin left the Andrew Torregrossa and Sons Funeral Home in
the Flatlands section draped in both Haitian and American flags,
with hundreds of mourners singing the Haitian national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The procession started as a small family gathering, with
Dorismond's mother, Marie Dorismond, weeping uncontrollably as she
was escorted to a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   The march proceeded on Flatbush Avenue, growing into a loud
protest of at least 3,000 people, with Rev. Al Sharpton walking at
the front. His supporters hoisted a banner that read ''Justice for
Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor will try to say this is political,'' Sharpton said.
''But it is clear this is really about people who are extremely
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was criticized for releasing information from
Dorismond's police record, including sealed juvenile files, and for
not visiting Dorismond's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor is mentally sick, that is why we are out here, to
let him know we want him out,'' said Michel Eddy, a Haitian native.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign recalled other victims of police-linked violence:
''Diallo, Louima, Baez, Bumpers, enough.''
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 a.m. the two-hour procession reached Holy Cross,
where the hostility escalated. Several protesters grabbed the U.S.
flag off the coffin, ripping it to shreds and setting the pieces
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Ear-splitting shrieks, shouts and ritual wailing accompanied
honking car horns. Protesters knocked down police barricades,
injuring two police officers. One suffered a possible broken nose
and a minor leg injury as he was crushed. The second officer was
left with abrasions on his leg and face.
</P>
<P>
   Protest banners plastered a car driving the wrong way on
Flatbush, including one that read: ''If you shoot one of my
children, I shoot five of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending the funeral Mass was attorney Johnnie
Cochran, who was cheered by the crowd as he entered.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mass, several people were so overcome that they
appeared to faint. Some mourners wore purple ribbons, while others
carried small Haitian flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can be said that has not been said in the past few days?
What can be added?'' asked Darbouze in his homily.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin of Dorismond's said the young man had dreamed of being
a police officer and was preparing to take the test.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you've got a loss like that, we have to come together to
let the police hear our community's voice,'' said Robert August,
36, a hospital psychologist. ''These kinds of things have to
stop.''

<HEADLINE> Crowd Watches Amistad Replica Launch  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MYSTIC, Conn. (AP) -- More than a century ago, Sengbe Pieh led
slaves aboard the Amistad in a revolt in which they overthrew their
captors in an effort to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the launching a replica of the 129-foot schooner
gave Pieh's great-grandson hope for the future and optimism that
his ancestor's fight for freedom would soon be heard around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable that an icon of slavery is being transformed
in this millennium into an icon of partnership, faith in each other
and of human rights for all of us,'' said Samuel Pieh, who runs an
organization that works to improve relations between Africa and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands, including American and Sierra Leone dignitaries and
descendants of the Amistad captives, watched and cheered as the
138-ton vessel was lowered into the Mystic River.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was christened with water from Cuba, Long Island and
Sierra Leone -- where the slaves were sold, captured by American
authorities and finally returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Yema Gbujama, the minister of social welfare, gender and
children's affairs in Sierra Leone, and African-American actress
Ruby Dee broke the bottle of water over the ship's bow.
</P>
<P>
   A brass bell tolled for each of the ship's 53 captives.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year, $3.1 million project marked the beginning of the
unending task of teaching histories, forgotten stories and
improving race relations, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She represents friendship, which is the translation of the
name Amistad, cooperation ... all of the good stuff,'' said Warren
Marr II, who began in 1976 to push for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The slaves took control of the original Amistad near Cuba in
1839. Their story was depicted in a 1997 movie by Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Sengbe Pieh, the slaves killed the captain of the Spanish
ship and tried to force its crew to sail them back to Africa. The
ship wandered up the East Coast before landing on Long Island. They
were captured there, brought to New London and then jailed in New
Haven and several trials followed.
</P>
<P>
   An 1841 U.S. Supreme Court ruling freed the slaves, whose cause
had been taken up by white abolitionists and former President John
Quincy Adams. The 35 Africans who survived returned to their
homeland in 1842 and established churches and schools for others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our mission is to tell the story of the Amistad as well as the
story of the human rights struggle that exists today,'' said
William Pinkney, the ship's captain. ''We want to show young people
what can happen with cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship will make its maiden voyage to New York City on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   It will be operated by the nonprofit Amistad America, created by
the Mystic Seaport. The ship will dock around the world including
Cuba and Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The president of Colombia's House of
Representatives announced his resignation Saturday amid a
corruption scandal involving questionable contracts and exorbitant
redecorating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Pomarica, a legislator for the opposition Liberal Party,
said he would step down on Monday, after President Andres Pastrana
called for him to resign his post atop Colombia's lower legislative
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Pomarica said he was assuming responsibility for congressional
employees embroiled in charges of graft and other wrongdoing in
connection with at least $2.5 million paid late last year to
advisors and for remodeling bathrooms and offices.
</P>
<P>
   At least three employees of congress were arrested this week,
including the chamber's chief executive officer, who allegedly
received kickbacks for granting inflated contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say more arrests will follow in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in August 1998, President Pastrana has
pledged to battle corruption, one of Colombia's endemic ills.
Barely a day goes by in the South American country without news of
new accusations that public funds are being pilfered.

<HEADLINE> Reform Chairman Downplays Infighting  </HEADLINE>
By JOSHUA KUCERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Infighting over who controls the Reform
Party won't cripple the party or overshadow its mission, Pat
Buchanan and the party's new chairman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time we get to our convention, we're going to have a
unified party which will overwhelmingly, I believe, support me for
president,'' Buchanan said in an interview Saturday. ''Before that,
there's going to be a lot of battles along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan spoke later at a Virginia Reform Party meeting held two
days before a judge in Lynchburg is to decide whether a faction led
by Pat Choate or one headed by former chairman Jack Gargan controls
the party and almost $15 million in campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are issues that had to get resolved, and it's well that
they be resolved here, in March,'' Choate said. ''If the side that
I represent prevails, the first thing to do is invite everyone on
the other side to come and work with us. The door is always open.''
</P>
<P>
   Choate deposed Gargan at a rowdy meeting in Nashville last
month. Some members physically struggled for the microphone, and
Nashville police threatened to intervene. Gargan claims the meeting
did not follow procedure and so the results of the election are
invalid. There was no sign of Gargan supporters at Saturday's
Virginia meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The party's most prominent elected official, Minnesota Gov.
Jesse Ventura, has defected and called the group he left
dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesse Ventura said our party was a dysfunctional party. And
then he left and it's been functioning very well ever since,''
Buchanan told a crowd of about 200 during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   To party activists, Buchanan alluded to the wide ideological
spectrum he draws from, at different points mentioning allegiance
with James Hoffa, Ralph Nader, Jerry Brown, Oliver North and
protesters at World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle. ''We
all had one thing in common. We all said that if ... Congress and
the president sign a law in this country, no international
institution, no global authority has the right to tell us to repeal
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest (challenge) I see is this gradual, peaceful
encroachment on the liberty, sovereignty of this country, until in
20 or 30 years, we're going to wake up like Gulliver, on the beach,
tied down with silver strands until we cannot move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Choate said the Reform Party's appeal has
influenced how the major parties' candidates portray themselves to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both George Bush and Al Gore no longer define themselves as
Republican or Democrat,'' Choate said. ''They define themselves as
reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he said, Bush and Gore are ''captives of special
interest money (and) groups that have brought them to power.''

<HEADLINE> Marchers Protest Police Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Furious protesters hurled bottles and clashed
with police Saturday after the funeral for an unarmed black man
shot to death by an undercover officer, the latest police shooting
to inflame tensions between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the minority
community.
</P>
<P>
   Police used batons to knock back bottles thrown outside a
Brooklyn church as the funeral Mass ended. One officer was seen
holding his head, wrapped in a bandage. In all, 23 police were
injured, some suffering torn ligaments or broken bones, others had
to have shards of glass rinsed from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 27 people were arrested on charges ranging from
disorderly conduct to inciting a riot during the clash which
included the burning of an American flag. They were expected to be
arraigned on Sunday. Five civilians were injured, police said, but
details of their conditions were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   A miles-long procession of more than 3,000 protesters and
mourners led by the Rev. Al Sharpton had followed a hearse carrying
the body of 26-year-old Patrick Dorismond from a funeral home to
Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in for the service.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's shooting March 16 was the third time in the past 13
months that an unarmed black man has been fatally shot by
undercover officers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been criticized for releasing information from
Dorismond's police record, including sealed juvenile files, and for
not visiting Dorismond's family.
</P>
<P>
   As Dorismond's coffin was carried inside, a few protesters
surged forward and snatched the U.S. flag that had draped it, tore
it to shreds and then set the pieces on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our blood, it's not cheap. We must let them know this
must stop,'' said Michel Eddy, a 26-year-old Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   With car horns blaring, protesters chanted, knocked down police
barricades, and many demanded Giuliani's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   A car driving the wrong way on a nearby street was plastered
with banners, including one that read: ''If you shoot one of my
children, I shoot five of you,'' and others threatening Giuliani's
family.
</P>
<P>
   Another protester walking through the crowded street shouted:
''Rudy, I'll blow you up to kingdom come, cut you with a chain saw,
and feed you to the dogs!''
</P>
<P>
   As the two-hour service ended around 2 p.m., a group of unarmed
community affairs police and uniformed officers outside the church
began having increasing difficulty controlling the crowd. Within
half an hour, about 25 officers in riot helmets carrying batons
entered the crowd and were met by people throwing bottles and
knocking down police barricades. The face-off with hundreds of
protesters escalated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani issued a statement praising the restraint of officers
involved in the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, when you allow demagogues to take over for
political and divisive purposes, the American flag gets shredded
and burned; steel barricades are hurled and bottles are thrown
injuring police officers and civilians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond shooting has become a major issue in his campaign
for the U.S. Senate against Hillary Clinton. The first lady said
last week that the GOP mayor's ''utter failure of leadership'' was
a sign that he couldn't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has maintained that the news media are incapable of
covering police shooting cases fairly, so he has a duty to
emphasize the police point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem on the street Saturday contrasted with the message of
peace delivered during the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not here to judge or condemn. We are here to weep with
the family,'' the Rev. Rollin Darbouze told about 1,000 mourners at
Holy Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, a security guard and the son of Haitian singer Andre
Dorismond, was shot after an officer conducting a drug sting
allegedly asked him if he would sell marijuana. The two scuffled,
backup officers arrived and one officer's gun went off, killing
Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   The officer whose gun went off, Anthony Vasquez, issued a
statement Saturday, telling the Dorismonds: ''As a father and a
son, I can only imagine the depth of your grief. Our prayers are
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting happened just two weeks after another undercover
officer fatally shot an unarmed man in the Bronx near where Amadou
Diallo was shot and killed in hail of 41 police bullets last year.
The four officers in the Diallo case were acquitted last month.
</P>
<P>
   What had started as a quiet family gathering Saturday grew into
a loud protest march against police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Dumont, 26, a Haitian-born Brooklyn resident, compared
Haiti's decades of military rule with America's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Dorismond took her son out of a military regime and
brought him here because she thought it would be better and safer,
but Giuliani and the way he's empowered the police have proved her
wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour after the disturbance began, the crowd
dispersed and unrest spread in random acts of violence in the
Flatbush neighborhood where stores pulled down their shutters.

<HEADLINE> Down the Aisle Wins Bougainvillea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Down the Aisle closed fast under
Javier Castellano to beat Mi Narrow by a half-length in the
$100,000 Bougainvillea Handicap for 3-year-olds on the grass in the
Hialeah-at-Gulfstream meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Castellano and trainer Bill Mort also won the $100,000 Hialeah
Breeders' Cup Handicap with Batuka earlier on Saturday's card.
</P>
<P>
   Down the Aisle ran 1[ miles in 1:51 1-5 and paid $8.60, $4.60
and $3. Mi Narrow paid $12.60 and $5.20. Honor Glide paid $3.20 to
show.
</P>
<P>
   Honor Glide, four wide on the turn, was battling for the lead
with 3-16ths to go as Mi Narrow gained ground on the inside. Honor
Glide had a head in front with a sixteenth of a mile to race, but
Down the Aisle moved past from the outside and Mi Narrow on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Down the Aisle is 7-year-old son of Runaway Groom bred and owned
by Charles Deters. The Kentucky-bred has won seven times and has

   In the co-featured $100,000 Hialeah Breeders' Cup handicap for
fillies and mares, Batuka, the 2-5 favorite, won by a length over
Royal Fair. Dorm was third in a field of six, going 1[ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Batuka has earned $437,349 with eight victories in 12 starts.
She won four stakes in her final five starts in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Her total earnings in 12 races are more than the rest of the
field had earned in 60 starts, $432,016, going into Saturday's
handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Batuka was timed in 1:51 1-5 and paid $2.80.
</P>
<P>
   Batuka moved to the outside at the eighth pole and caught Royal
Fair in the final yards. Royal Fair was 1{ lengths in front of
Dorm.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Party Joins New Alliance  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY (AP) -- A political gamble to unify Canada's divided
right passed a critical test Saturday when the nation's
second-largest party voted to join a new conservative alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The resounding approval by the Reform Party, the official
opposition in Parliament, to enter the Canadian Reform Conservative
Alliance altered Canada's political landscape by bringing together
formerly divided conservative groups to take on the governing
Liberal Party in national elections expected in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   An independent auditing firm spent Saturday tallying ballots
mailed in by most of the Reform Party's 75,000 members. A
two-thirds majority of the total vote was required for approval,
along with majority support in at least six of the nation's 10
provinces and territories.
</P>
<P>
   Reform leader Preston Manning announced the results to a packed
ballroom saying that 91 percent of the 48,838 ballots supported
joining the alliance. The response was from 66.5 percent of the
total party membership and the proposal was approved in every
province and territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We resolve to work together with you to create a bigger
national revolution to remove the unprincipled Liberals from
office,'' Maning said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the alliance created in January was to combine the
Reform Party with supporters of the Conservative Party to create a
rightist movement capable of toppling the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the referendum results were known, the campaign to
lead the Canadian Alliance had started.
</P>
<P>
   Manning and Alberta Treasurer Stockwell Day of the Conservative
Party previously declared their candidacies, with at least three
others expressing interest.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, the politically ambitious son of a former Alberta
premier, has led the Reform Party since its creation in 1987 as a
Western protest movement against domination and disinterest by the
eastern political establishment, then headed by the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party eventually grew enough to make Manning
opposition leader in Parliament, but it never won meaningful
support outside of its Western base.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing he needed votes from central and eastern regions to
topple the governing Liberals, Manning spearheaded the unity plan
to merge his Western support with the Conservatives' backing in
Ontario, the most populous province, and points east.
</P>
<P>
   While both parties agree on fiscal discipline, lower taxes and
other conservative economic principles, the Reform Party's
reputation for extremist views on social issues such as immigration
and gay rights has made it unpalatable to more mainstream
Conservative supporters.
</P>
<P>
   A policy platform adopted at the Canadian Alliance's founding
conference in January included concessions from some previous
Reform positions.
</P>
<P>
   One policy accepted Canada's two national languages of French
and English. The Reform Party has opposed special official status
for the French language, the most volatile issue in Francophone
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   But deep enmity between the parties lingers, particularly at the
top. Manning has a long-standing rivalry with Conservative leader
Joe Clark, another aspirant for the prime minister's office who
rejects the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   For the governing Liberal Party, the prospect of a unified right
caused some parliament members to publicly suggest two-term Prime
Minister Jean Chretien should step aside so fresh leadership could
contest the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by a strong economy and dormant separatist aspirations
in Quebec, Chretien insists he can fulfill a personal ambition to
win a third term, saying the inherent conservatism of the Canadian
Alliance differs from the basic nature of Canadians.

Government Mulls Microsoft Offer

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sources close to the Microsoft case said that government
lawyers found inadequate the 11th-hour offer the technology giant made last
night to settle its antitrust trial. They also reported that there were no
immediate plans to go back to Chicago and continue negotiations. These sources
did not rule out the possibility of talks resuming, and the government continued
to evaluate the proposal by Microsoft to end the case before Tuesday, when the
trial judge has threatened to announce his verdict. Published reports said
Microsoft's offer included promises to separate the company's Internet browser

Russians Vote in Presidential Election
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Former KGB spy Vladimir Putin is expected to win the Russian
presidential election and hopefully clean up the country and restore it as a
world power. Putin says he wants to modernize Russia, saying it must catch up
with the West, but that he will work with the West if it treats Moscow as an
equal. Opinion polls show Putin with about 50 percent of voters backing him,
with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov far behind with about 20 percent.
Liberals and intellectuals worry that the ex-member of the KGB will bring back
the iron controls of the Communist era and crush any dissent.

education minister met Saturday and agreed that peace efforts were back on
track, an Israeli spokesman said. Arafat's meeting with Education Minister Yossi
Sarid, an outspoken dove and leader of the progressive Meretz party, comes less
than a week after Israeli-Palestinian peace talks resumed in Washington. After a
freeze in the talks of about a month, negotiators are again grappling with such
heated issues as the Palestinian demand for a state and a capital in Jerusalem.
In a sign of progress, last week Israel withdrew from another 6.1 percent of the
West Bank.

   HAVANA (AP) -- As a U.S. government deadline neared for Elian Gonzalez's
Miami relatives, tens of thousands of Cubans gathered in a central city today to
demand that the 6-year-old be returned to his father on the island. State media
said an estimated 50,000 pro-government demonstrators gathered for the rally in
the city of Sagua la Grande, in Villa Clara province. Broadcasting the event
live, government television showed tens of thousand of people wearing T-shirts
featuring Elian's portrait and waving a sea of red, white and blue Cuban flags.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices edged up a mere half a cent in the past
two weeks, and the increases may be coming to an end, an industry analyst said

Wisconsin Beats Purdue 64-60
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The eighth-seeded Wisconsin Badgers put on another
clinic of precision passing and pressure defense today to beat Purdue for the
third time this season, 64-60, and complete an unlikely rise from sixth place in
the Big Ten to NCAA West Region champions. The Badgers (22-13), whose only
big-time basketball success came when they won the NCAA title in 1941, held the
Boilermakers without a field goal for nearly six minutes late in the game to
become the lowest-seeded team to advance to the Final Four since 1986. The
Badgers will play the winner of tomorrow's North Carolina-Tennessee matchup.

<HEADLINE> Purdue's Coach Again Falls Short  </HEADLINE>
By PETE HERRERA, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Gene Keady's resume is still missing a
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The winningest coach in Purdue history once again fell in a town
that has not been kind to Keady or the Boilermakers. Four years
ago, Purdue was the No. 1 seed in the West, but lost to Georgia in
the second round at The Pit.
</P>
<P>
   Under Keady, the Boilermakers have won six Big Ten
regular-season titles, have won 20 or more games 14 times, and have
made it to the round of 16 five times since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But no further.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Duke beat the Glenn Robinson-led Boilermakers
69-60 in the Southeast Regional final. On Saturday, Big Ten
neighbor Wisconsin beat Purdue 64-60 in the West final.
</P>
<P>
   Keady said few teams in the NCAA tournament could have been a
tougher draw for the Boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We faced a team today that probably if we had faced any other
team in America, we might have been better off, except for Michigan
State,'' Keady said. ''They're a team that was very, very good on D
(defense). They knew our weaknesses and they went right after
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It took several minutes in the postgame news conference before
the Final Four question was posed to Keady. He said earlier in the
week he is tired of being asked about not getting a team to the
Final Four, noting at one point that he considered making a 20-foot
putt in a golf game against his buddies more important that getting
to the national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Keady later clarified the remark, saying that of course going to
the Final Four carried much more significance.
</P>
<P>
   Keady was unemotional about the latest close call.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just try to play great basketball and if that gets to the
Final Four, great. If not, you move on,'' he said. ''You know how
hard it is and if that bothers a coach, he probably ought to get
out of it. There's only four going out of 315. You get better
players or work harder, or find ways to execute better. There's
always a reason why you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Wisconsin's ability to excel at what the
Badgers do best -- play tenacious defense, chase down loose balls
and make pass after pass until an open Badger can bury a 3-pointer
or a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Keady, as usual, paced in front of the Purdue bench most of the
game -- his arms crossed and his face in a scowl. UCLA coach Steve
Lavin, a former assistant to Keady, sat behind the Purdue bench
cheering for the Boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue led twice in the second half -- the last time at 50-49
with 6:56 left. But Wisconsin wouldn't crack and when Ron Boone hit
two free throws to give the Badgers a 60-53 lead with 1:08 left,
Keady sank into his chair, sipped a drink of water and tugged at
his tie.
</P>
<P>
   Keady's last chance at Indianapolis came when Carson
Cunningham's 3-pointer cut the Wisconsin lead to 63-60 with 11.5
seconds left. Keady leaped to his feet and signaled for a timeout.
But a free throw by Wisconsin's Mike Kelley a second later sent the
Badgers to Indianapolis and Keady home with another loss in
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel indescribably happy,'' Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett
said. ''But there's a big part of what's inside of me that feels
for coach Keady.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's last appearance in the Final Four was in 1980, the year
before Keady was hired. That season the Boilermakers lost to UCLA
in the semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin 64, Purdue 60  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- As improbable as it seems, it's ''On
Wisconsin!''
</P>
<P>
   The pesky, patient Badgers are headed to the Final Four, a
journey they last made 59 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''''What can I say?'' Wisconsin's Jon Bryant said. ''Who would
have thought this was possible? A month and a half ago, we were
just trying to get into the tournament. But here we are going to
the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Bennett's eighth-seeded team put on another clinic of
precision passing and pressure defense Saturday to beat Purdue for
the third time this season, 64-60, and complete an unlikely rise
from sixth place in the Big Ten to champions of the NCAA West
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever superlative you can think of, use those words,''
Bennett said. ''I feel indescribably happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers (22-13), whose only big-time basketball success came
when they won the NCAA title in 1941, held the Boilermakers without
a field goal for nearly six minutes late in the game to become the
lowest-seeded team to advance to the Final Four since 1986 when LSU
made it as a No. 11 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Boone scored 12 points for Wisconsin, twice his season
average, six of them in the final 2:45. The reserve guard's short
jumper put the Badgers up 56-53 with 2:45 remaining, then he made
two free throws with 1:08 to play to make it 60-53 and two more to
boost the lead to 63-57 with 17.6 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who transferred from Division II St. Cloud State in
1997, scored 18 points, including 5-of-9 3-pointers, and was
selected the regional MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their team defense and his 3-pointers really cut our
throats,'' Purdue coach Gene Keady said.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kowske added 14 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cardinal scored all 13 of his points in the second half
for Purdue (24-10), but it wasn't quite enough. Carson Cunningham
also scored 13, including a 3-pointer that cut Wisconsin's lead to
63-60 with 11.5 seconds to play. But Mike Kelley, the Big Ten
defensive player of the year who forced Purdue's Jaraan Cornell
into another miserable shooting day, made one of two free throws
with 10.6 seconds left to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal, one of four senior starters for the Boilermakers,
broke down in the postgame news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wisconsin's a great team,'' he said. ''I really couldn't do
too much, so my hat's off to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, 1-for-7 from the field in Wisconsin's victory over
Purdue two weeks ago in the first round of the Big Ten tournament,
was 1-for-9 this time, 1-for-7 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The loss deprived Keady of his first trip to the Final Four. It
was the second time the Boilermakers have made it to a regional
final in Keady's 20 years at the school. They lost to Duke in the
Southeast in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just try to play great basketball and if that gets you to
the Final Four, great,'' Keady said. ''You know how hard it is, and
if that bothers a coach, he probably ought to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers beat the Boilermakers three consecutive times after
losing at Purdue early in the conference season.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, as the band blared the old fight song ''On
Wisconsin,'' Badgers players and fans rushed to the center of the
court. Three players jumped on a courtside table in front of a
large section of shrieking Wisconsin fans. The table collapsed,
sending writers' laptop computers, soft drinks and the players onto
the court, but no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was especially rewarding to Bennett, whose rise
through the coaching ranks in the state of Wisconsin was as slow
and steady as his team's offense. He was a successful high school
coach, then was a winner at Wisconsin-Stevens Point and
Wisconsin-Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He was passed over twice for the Wisconsin job before finally
getting his chance five years ago. But he had his critics, who
complained he wasn't winning enough and his style was boring. The
Badgers were just 13-12 after a loss at Michigan State on Feb. 19.
But they are 9-1 since then, with the only loss to Michigan State
in the Big Ten tournament.
</P>
<P>
   They'll get another shot at the Spartans on Saturday in the
national semifinals in Indianapolis. Michigan State beat Iowa State
75-64 in the Midwest final in Auburn Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue held its previous three tournament opponents to 16-
percent shooting from 3-point range, but Wisconsin was 7-for-16.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers were 5-for-7 on 3-pointers in the first half and led
31-28 at the break. Bryant made three in the first 3:20.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers led by one point twice in the second half, the
last time at 50-49 on Cardinal's bank shot with 6:54 to play.
Bryant's 3-pointer with 5:45 to go put Wisconsin back on top 52-50.
Cardinal tied it at 52 with two free throws with 5:23 remaining
before Kowske, who drew his fourth foul with 9:48 to go, took a
slick pass from Bryant on the baseline and scored to make it 54-52.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Robinson, who scored 12 points, made one of two free throws
with 3:01 remaining to cut the lead to 54-53, then Boone, who had
blown a wide-open layup a minute earlier, sank a 12-footer to make
it 56-53.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just had to put that last play behind me,'' Boone said.
''When they fouled me down the stretch, it dawned on me we were
going to the Final Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue went without a field goal from the 6:54 mark until Greg
McQuay's tip with 56 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very intense,'' Robinson said. ''As Coach said, they
got the job done on defense. We try not to think about it right now
because the season is over. It's not like we can go right back out
there and play again.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise a Half Cent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices edged up a mere half a cent
in the past two weeks, and the increases may be coming to an end,
an industry analyst said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The average retail price of all grades of gasoline, including
taxes, was about $1.59 per gallon as of Friday, an increase of only
a half cent from March 10, according to the Lundberg Survey of
10,000 stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices are down, which affects all petroleum products,
analyst Trilby Lundberg said. But she warned that when demand for
gas increases rises, prices usually do, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could be the end or just a lull in the price hikes,'' she
said. ''Spring and summer demand for gasoline could be an up factor
for the price of gasoline apart from the prices for crude oil.''
</P>
<P>
   While the nationwide average cost of gas rose half a penny,
there are starkly different regional trends. For example, ''Prices
are down more than 6 cents in the Midwest but up nearly a dime in
the West,'' Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at self-service stations averaged nearly $1.55 for
regular unleaded gasoline, $1.64 for mid-grade and $1.75 for
premium.
</P>
<P>
   Full-service prices were about $1.84 for regular, $1.93 for
mid-grade and $2.01 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Greek Church Criticizes EU on Gays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The leader of Greece's Orthodox Church
Saturday criticized calls by the European Union's parliament this
month to grant same-sex couples equal rights with heterosexual
couples.
</P>
<P>
   During a religious service, Archbishop Christodoulos said
granting gay partners marriage status would be ''legalizing a sin''
but urged compassion for all human ''weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece's official state Orthodox Church has recently reaffirmed
its conservative views on sex while appealing to young people to
follow the church's teachings. Last year, the church publicly
reiterated its opposition to premarital sex.
</P>
<P>
   Christodoulos' remarks Saturday were in response to the European
Parliament's non-binding resolution which urged the 15 EU nations
to extend rights enjoyed by traditional couples to one-parent
families, unmarried couples and same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   Greek homosexual organizations expressed disappointment with the
church leader's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a Greek citizen and I expect that my government to
protect my rights and not to have them interfered with by any
church,'' said Evangelos Yanellos, leader of Greece's largest gay
association.

   CHULA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Two Nevada prison inmates overpowered
two guards and escaped during a rest stop while being transported
to other facilities Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada prison spokesman Glen Whorton said a search was under way
for convicted murderer James Prestridge, 39, and convicted robber
John Doran, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're considered to be dangerous, but there are conflicting
reports as to whether they're armed,'' Whorton said. ''We're
hopeful they'll be recaptured very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmates overpowered one guard and took his gun while using a
restroom, then returned to the prison van and overpowered the other
guard, Whorton said.
</P>
<P>
   Prestridge and Doran put both officers and other inmates in the
back of the van, then drove around for a while before abandoning it
in Chula Vista, just north of the Mexican border, Whorton said.
</P>
<P>
   The two inmates were being driven to other jurisdictions by a
private transport company, Extraditions International.
</P>
<P>
   Prestridge was en route to a North Dakota prison under an
exchange arrangement. Doran was headed to Colorado to face other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor had planned to pick up or drop off other inmates
in San Diego County before taking Prestridge and Doran east,
Whorton said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scolds Pakistani Leader  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Amid extraordinary security of decoy
limousines and a last-minute plane switch, President Clinton
admonished Pakistan's military ruler Saturday for a ''tragic
squandering of effort, energy and wealth'' on nuclear weapons and
confrontations with India. But Clinton's appeal for restraint
seemed to go unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take the right steps now to prevent escalation, avoid
miscalculation and reduce the risk of war,'' the president urged.
He prodded Gen. Pervez Musharraf to restore democracy, crack down
on terrorism and renew talks with India to ease their angry
standoff over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit Pakistan since
1969 and he brought a sobering warning of diplomatic isolation and
worsening problems unless Islamabad changes course. It was a hard
message for a nation that stood loyally with the United States
through a half century of Cold War crises.
</P>
<P>
   The president spelled out his concerns in a meeting at the
presidential palace with Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless
coup last October. Then, Clinton made an address on state-run
television, asking citizens to consider whether a nuclear rivalry
and border tensions with India will make Pakistan safer or improve
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The answer to all these questions is no,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit concluded a six-day trip to South Asia, a region
he has called perhaps the most dangerous in the world. Beginning
his journey home, Clinton stopped in Oman for refueling and then
flew to Geneva, Switzerland, to meet Syrian President Hafez Assad
in hopes of renewing peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   His plane pulled up beside Assad's plane shortly before 4:30
a.m., local time and the president headed straight for a hotel for
a little rest before meeting with the Syrian leader there.
</P>
<P>
   He met for a little over hour at the airport in Oman with
Foreign Minister Youssef bin Alawi, who told reporters later that
Clinton told him he was ''optimistic'' that Assad ''shares his
feelings in finding solutions to resuming the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations.'' bin Alawi told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At his own news conference, Musharraf said he told Clinton he
would meet ''anywhere, at anytime and at any level'' with India to
begin resolving their disputes. He said ''there was no deadlock at
all'' between him and Clinton -- they even discussed golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we got on pretty well together. I was also pretty
diplomatic for a change,'' Musharraf said.
</P>
<P>
   Security around Clinton was the tightest of any presidential
trip in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Streets were eerily empty except for thousands of rifle-toting
soldiers and police. The president flew to Pakistan in an unmarked
white Gulfstream jet after a carefully staged ruse at his departure
from Bombay, India.
</P>
<P>
   It had appeared Clinton was going to board an Air Force C-17
cargo jet but at the last second, he detoured around the plane and
got on the Gulfstream, which was hidden behind the huge C-17.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, a USA-marked decoy Gulfstream landed at
Chaklala Airfield in Islamabad and pulled up at the arrival stand.
But Clinton was not on board. About five minutes later the white
plane carrying Clinton touched down. Six armored black limousines
with American flags and seals and Washington license plates raced
up to shield Clinton's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   With helicopters hovering at the front and rear of his
motorcade, Clinton was driven to the presidential palace where he
held inconclusive talks with Musharraf. Despite the apparent lack
of progress, the two leaders ended up with a clearer view of each
other's positions, said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he was unaware of any specific security threat in
Pakistan but said it is in a dangerous neighborhood. Neighboring
Afghanistan has given refuge to Osama bin Laden, blamed by the
United States for the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prevent Musharraf from claiming a public relations
triumph from the meeting, the White House refused to allow any
media coverage and instead released an official photo of the two
leaders seated 12 feet across from each other.
</P>
<P>
   In his televised address, Clinton acknowledged that Pakistan's
democratic governments had failed to meet hopes that they would
repair the economy and stem corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''Successful democratic government takes time, patience and hard
work,'' he said. ''The answer to flawed democracy is not to end
democracy, but to improve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tone was one of disappointment with the path Pakistan
has taken and optimism that it can get back on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you do not,'' the president warned, ''there is a danger
that Pakistan may grow even more isolated, draining even more
resources away from the needs of the people, moving even closer to
a conflict that no one can win.''
</P>
<P>
   He presented a clear list of conditions to remedy the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Musharraf to produce a plan for the return of
civilian democratic rule and to intensify efforts against
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Matching a plea he made to India, Clinton urged Pakistan to sign
a nuclear test ban treaty to slow the arms race they started with
nuclear tests in 1998. ''The whole world will rally around you if
you do,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for a reduction in tensions with India, Clinton said
Pakistan must ''create conditions that will allow dialogue to
succeed'' in resolving the Kashmir dispute, which nearly sparked a
third war last summer.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging Pakistan's concern about human rights in
Kashmir, Clinton said that ''a stark truth must be faced. There is
no military solution to Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   And he dashed any hopes in Pakistan that the United States would
step in to mediate a Kashmir settlement. India argues outside help
would reward Pakistani violence.
</P>
<P>
   During a five-day visit to India, Clinton made the same appeal
for nuclear restraint and a dialogue on Kashmir. But the government
in New Delhi showed little interest, although both sides said
Clinton's visit had been a big step toward improving relations that
soured over two decades of U.S. neglect.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Millennium Wins World Cup  </HEADLINE>
By TAREK AL-ISSAWI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Dubai Millennium, a
4-year-old British-bred who had his name changed for the sole
purpose of winning the first Dubai World Cup in the millennium, did
just that Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by Godolphin Racing Inc., headed by Dubai's ruling family
Al Maktoum, Dubai Millennium won the world's richest thoroughbred
event by six lengths over Behrens of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi-owned Public Purse, winner of the San Marcos Handicap at
Santa Anita in his previous start, finished third. Puerto Madero,
third in the Santa Anita Handicap three weeks ago, was fourth over
the 1\-mile Nad al Sheba course. The winning time was 1:59.50.
</P>
<P>
   Dubai Millennium, originally named Yareek, was pursued closely
in the early stages by Behrens, but he found another gear at the
halfway point and surged far ahead almost effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best horse I've seen in terms of looks and
action,'' said Dubai Millennium's owner, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid
Al Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai. ''He didn't disappoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Italian jockey Frankie Dettori, Dubai Millennium
showed why Sheik Mohammed was confident of winning the $3.6 million
top prize. Before the race, Dubai Millennium had earned only
$615,581.
</P>
<P>
   Dettori was certain of victory long before crossing the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to go and I thought, 'OK, let's go,' '' Dettori
said. ''It's the best horse I've ever ridden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the cheering and thought I'd take a look. I almost
broke my neck looking back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubai Millennium was made the 4-7 favorite by British bookmaker
Ladbrokes. Betting is forbidden in Dubai because of its Islamic
laws. Wagering was permitted in other countries, including the
United States, where bets could be placed in 35 states.
</P>
<P>
   Dubai Millennium won six of his first seven starts on the grass
in England and France, including the Queen Elizabeth II at Ascot.
He then won his only start this year in the Maktoum Challenge at
Nad al Sheba.
</P>
<P>
   He is trained by Saeed bin Suroor of the United Arab Emirates,
who won the British trainer's championships in 1996, 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin also won the race last year with Almutawakel.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, trained by H. James Bond, had won his first four starts
and lost his next four, before winning the Gulfstream Park Handicap
Feb. 26. He finished fifth in the Dubai World Cup in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Jorge Chavez, Behrens, a 6-year-old, earned $1.2
million for finishing second.
</P>
<P>
   Ecton Park, another U.S. horse, was fifth, followed by Japan's
World Cleek and Britain's Running Stag. Hong Kong's Indigenous,
Britain's Lear Spear, the United States' Saint's Honor, Strudel
Fitz, Gracioso and Worldly Manner completed the field.
</P>
<P>
   Malek, last year's runner-up and fourth in 1998, was scratched
Friday after incurring a tear in his right foreleg.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mandella, who trains Malek, was hoping to make up for
the scratch with Puerto Madero, a 12-1 shot, but Dubai Millennium
was too much for the U.S.-based horse, ridden by the world's
winningest jockey, Laffit Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella is the only trainer to have a horse in all five Dubai
World Cups. He has yet to win.
</P>
<P>
   In the night's other races, horses owned by the Al Maktoum
family, and Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruling family, won five of six
events.
</P>
<P>
   In the $1 million Dubai Golden Shaheen, Alex Solis celebrated
his 36th birthday, riding American Big Jag to victory in a track
record 1:08 1-5, nearly a full second off the previous mark.

Lawyers Review Microsoft Proposal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government lawyers reportedly found some parts of
Microsoft's antitrust proposal inadequate and no plans have been made to return
to Chicago to continue negotiations, according to sources close to the case.
However, these sources did not rule out the possibility of talks resuming. The
government today again reviewed Microsoft's latest offer, which published
reports said included promises to separate the company's Internet browser
software from its dominant Windows operating system.

Mideast Leaders Pleased With Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Peace efforts between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israel's education minister appear to be back on track, according to
an Israeli spokesman. After a freeze in the talks of about a month, negotiators
are again grappling with such heated issues as the Palestinian demand for a
state and a capital in Jerusalem. In a sign of progress, Israel last week
withdrew from another 6.1 percent of the West Bank. Officials assured that the
two leaders would continue to work doggedly for the success of peace efforts, in
or out of government.

Russians Await Election Results

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Former KGB spy Vladimir Putin is expected to win the Russian
presidential election and hopefully clean up the country and restore it as a
world power. Putin says he wants to modernize Russia, saying it must catch up
with the West, but that he will work with the West if it treats Moscow as an
equal. Opinion polls show Putin with about 50 percent of voters backing him,
with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov far behind with about 20 percent.

Uganda Fears Finding More Bodies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BUHUNGA, Uganda (AP) -- Police mobilized across this East African nation on
Saturday to search buildings and land belonging to a doomsday Christian sect,
fearing they could find many more murdered cult members after the discovery of
mass graves containing strangled and hacked bodies. Authorities were planning to
examine six properties known to be owned by the Movement for the Restoration of
the Ten Commandments. ''We think wherever there was a sect branch, there could
be more graves,'' said Jim Muhwezi, a parliament member. The site is 20 miles
away from the cult's main compound where at least 330 other members died in a
fire March 17 in a makeshift church.

China Bans Online Sale of Videos

<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- In its latest effort to impose control over freewheeling
electronic commerce, China has announced rules banning online sales of imported
music and videos and excluding foreign invested Internet companies from selling
any audiovisual products. The Ministry of Culture will require that all
companies selling such products online get licenses by May 1, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported Saturday. The report said the rules were intended to
prevent sales of pirated, smuggled or ''otherwise illegal'' music and video
products and to help ''develop a healthy market.''

   VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- A $154 million NASA satellite that
will study the interplay of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field
successfully rocketed into orbit this afternoon. A Boeing Delta II rocket
carrying the Image satellite lifted off at 12:34 p.m. for a 56-minute ride into
its proper orbit. The probe's four 820-foot wire antennas will make Image the
longest artificial object in space and give it the appearance of a celestial

Michigan St. Beats Iowa St. 75-64

<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The top-seeded Michigan State Spartans used
another late run to beat Iowa State 75-64 in the Midwest Regional final tonight,
advancing to the Final Four for the second straight year. Morris Peterson and
A.J. Granger each scored 18 points for the Spartans (30-7), the last No. 1 seed
left in the tournament. This will be the eighth time only one No. 1 has reached
the Final Four, and seven of those have been since 1989 -- with four since 1994.
Michigan State, which scored the final 17 points in its third-round victory over
Syracuse, trailed Iowa State by seven points with 5:49 left in the second half.

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The eighth-seeded Wisconsin Badgers put on another
clinic of precision passing and pressure defense today to beat Purdue for the
third time this season, 64-60, and complete an unlikely rise from sixth place in
the Big Ten to NCAA West Region champions. The Badgers (22-13), whose only
big-time basketball success came when they won the NCAA title in 1941, held the
Boilermakers without a field goal for nearly six minutes late in the game to
become the lowest-seeded team to advance to the Final Four since 1986. The
Badgers will play the winner of tomorrow's North Carolina-Tennessee matchup.

<HEADLINE> Hornets 86, Hawks 70  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Eddie Jones scored 24 points and the Charlotte
Hornets pulled away in the fourth quarter for an 86-70 victory over
the cold-shooting Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, sixth in the Eastern Conference and looking to
improve its position for the playoffs, has won three games in a
row. The Hawks lost for the seventh time in eight games, including
three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Leading only 64-58 after Alan Henderson scored for Atlanta with
9:50 remaining, the Hornets used an 18-3 spurt to blow the game
open. Jones scored eight points during the run, including a
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had 12 points during the third quarter, hitting a couple
of 3s and accounting for half of Charlotte's scoring in the period
as the Hornets stretched a 38-35 halftime lead to 62-54.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks went 29-of-87 (33 percent) from the field in their
lowest-scoring game of the season. They led by as many as eight in
the first quarter before fading away in a barrage of missed shots.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's starting center, Elden Campbell, didn't play because
of flu-like symptoms. It didn't matter. Todd Fuller stepped in with
11 points and 15 rebounds. Anthony Mason also had 15 rebounds for
the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, with 17 points, and Dikembe Mutombo, with 11 points
and 20 rebounds, were the only two double-figure scorers for the
Hawks. They combined to hit 13 of 18 shots -- their teammates went
16-of-69.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jackson hit only 2 of 13, while both LaPhonso Ellis and
Lorenzen Wright made 2 of 10.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Atlanta was playing its fifth game in seven nights. ...
Derrick Coleman needed two stitches after being poked near the left
eye by Roshown McLeod in the first quarter. Coleman returned to
score 11 points and grab eight rebounds. ... Chris Crawford was not
in uniform for the Hawks after spraining his left ankle Friday in a
loss at New York. ... The Hawks dropped to a 18-17 at Philips
Arena, while Charlotte improved to 12-21 on the road. ... Atlanta's
lowest scoring game until Saturday: an 85-73 loss at Phoenix on
Feb. 18.

<HEADLINE> 23 police injured in melee with funeral-goers  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A clearly agitated police chief blamed
aggressive protesters for an angry disruption in Brooklyn on
Saturday following the funeral Mass held for police shooting victim
Patrick Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Department Joseph Dunne said 23 officers were injured
in the clash, which he called an ''unprovoked attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers suffered broken limbs, torn ligaments, cuts and eye
injuries when people in the crowd of funeral-goers lobbed glass
bottles and pushed over barricades.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton questioned the decision to use police in
partial riot gear, suggesting it may have fueled an already uneasy
standoff with the NYPD. But Dunne said many of his officers were
not wearing safety helmets until the crowd became unruly.
</P>
<P>
   ''This came as a result of an unprovoked attack by some of the
people at the funeral,'' he said, adding that he wished all the
police had been wearing protective helmets from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne called Sharpton's comments ''total nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, a 26-year-old Brooklyn native of Haitian descent, was
shot in a struggle with undercover police last week when an officer
allegedly approached him for drugs as part of a sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   Violence erupted Saturday afternoon in the Flatbush section
after the crowd of funeral-goers inside the Holy Cross Roman
Catholic Church spilled into the street. Uniformed officers along
with unarmed community affairs police in light blue windbreakers
were soon overwhelmed. The situation escalated when about 25
officers in riot helmets joined them.
</P>
<P>
   People began throwing bottles and knocking down police
barricades, crushing one officer in the process. In all, 27 people
were arrested and five civilians injured. Details of their
conditions were not immediately released by police.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were expected to be arraigned Sunday on charges
ranging from disorderly conduct to inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne said more than 1,000 officers were in the area at the time
of the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they did a magnificent job,'' he said. ''We will
continue to work with the community to see that the neighborhoods
remain safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharpton called for an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not know who is at fault,'' he said. ''We do not condone
violence.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Sergei Berezin scored twice and the Toronto Maple
Leafs kept alive their hopes of finishing first in the Eastern
Conference with a 5-3 victory Saturday night over the New Jersey
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Nik Antropov, Garry Valk and Darcy Tucker also scored for the
Leafs, who ended a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks left in the season, the Leafs are within five
points of the conference-leading Devils with a game in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The line of Berezin, Antropov and center Yanic Perreault
combined for six points.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Joseph stopped 29 shots, including 12 in the third period
when the Maple Leafs sat back protecting the two-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, 1-1 under new coach Larry Robinson, looked nothing
like the team that hammered the New York Islanders 8-2 on Friday
night in Robinson's first game behind the bench after replacing the
fired Robbie Ftorek.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden had two goals and Petr Sykora also scored for the
Devils, who outplayed the Leafs for the first half of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Berezin responded just over a minute after Madden's second goal
during a power play, making it 3-3 with a slap shot from the
right-faceoff circle into the top left corner past Martin Brodeur's
outstretched glove.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker gave Toronto the lead on a controversial play with less
than five minutes to go in the second, scoring into a half-empty
net after it appeared Toronto captain Mats Sundin interfered with
Brodeur. The Devils, who once again gave the puck away in their own
zone, argued the call to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Antropov completed a nice three-way passing play late in the
second, tapping in a pass from Perreault at the edge of the crease
behind a helpless Brodeur for a 5-3 lead. Berezin started the play
with a fake shot and a perfect pass to Perreault across the Devils
zone to the left of Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 2-0 lead in the first seven minutes on goals
31 seconds apart from Madden and Sykora.
</P>
<P>
   But Berezin cut it to 2-1 with a rush from center ice. Berezin
used a between-the-legs deke to get past defenseman Ken Daneyko and
then poked a shot past Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Valk, wearing a visor for the first time in the wake of teammate
Bryan Berard's eye injury, scored short-handed on a breakaway to
tie it.

<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Peter Bondra scored on a short-handed
breakaway in the third period to lift the Washington Capitals to a
4-3 win over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bondra stole the puck from Senators defenseman Wade Redden, then
broke away from Ottawa's Marian Hossa to score the winner with his
21st goal of the season. It his third short-handed tally.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast Division-leading Capitals have the NHL's best
record since Jan. 1 (28-7-5) and are a league-leading 8-2 in their
past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Terry Yake opened the scoring midway through the
first period when he poked in a loose puck behind Ottawa goalie Tom
Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sacco gave the Capitals a two-goal lead at 13:30 when he
scored from the slot with Barrasso down.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators responded with three unanswered goals.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Alfredsson hit Shaun Van Allen with a pass low in the
slot and Van Allen beat Washington's Olaf Kolzig at 15:24.
</P>
<P>
   Just 2:28 later, a long shot by Kevin Dineen hit Kolzig's stick
and bounced over him into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Juneau gave the Senators a 3-2 lead 47 seconds into the second
period with a blast from the top of the left circle as the teams
skated 4-on-4.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Gonchar swung out from the corner and flicked a shot past
Barrasso to tie it 3-3 at 8:13.
</P>
<P>
   With two minutes left in the second, Ottawa's leading goal
scorer Shawn McEachern left the game with an injured left thumb
after he was slashed by Steve Konowalchuk. No penalty was called on
the play.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Tech 86, Old Dominion 74  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Betty Lennox's response to missing shots
was simple: Keep shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted after misfiring on nine of her first 10 shots, Lennox
scored 25 points to lead top-seeded Louisiana Tech past Old
Dominion 86-74 Saturday night in the NCAA Midwest Regional
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Too quick for Old Dominion, Louisiana Tech (31-2) also held its
own in the rebounding battle against the taller Lady Monarchs
(29-5) and moved into the regional final Monday night against the
winner of the late game between Penn State and Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox, cheered on by family members from nearby Independence,
Mo., kept firing away despite her early misses and eventually
helped the Lady Techsters break it open midway through the second
half and keep Leon Barmore coaching for at least one more game.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore, Tech's coach for 18 seasons, has announced he'll retire
when his team finishes playing in the tournament. The Lady
Techsters are now within one victory of their third straight Final
Four appearance and 11th overall.
</P>
<P>
   Tech went ahead to stay late in the first half, then kicked it
in after Old Dominion pulled to 52-46 on Lucienne Berthieu's layup
with 14:43 left.
</P>
<P>
   Catrina Frierson scored on a follow shot and Lennox on a
3-pointer for a 57-46 lead. After two straight Old Dominion
baskets, Tech's Christie Sides made a 3 from the left wing and
Lennox, who had left the game briefly because of leg cramps,
returned to make another 3.
</P>
<P>
   Tamicha Jackson's 3-pointer made it 66-50 and Lennox answered
Sharron Francis' 3-pointer with one of her own, putting Tech ahead
69-53 with 10:14 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was never below 10 after that as Tech answered almost
every time fourth-seeded Old Dominion scored.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox finished 10-for-32 from the field, including four
3-pointers. Frierson added 19 points on 7-for-10 shooting, Jackson
scored 17 and Takeisha Lewis had 12 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Berthieu led Old Dominion with 19 points, Hamchetou Maiga scored
16, Natalie Diaz 15 and Francis 14.
</P>
<P>
   After some poor shooting early, both teams cranked up their
offense and treated fans to an entertaining, fast-paced game.
</P>
<P>
   Old Dominion missed eight of its first nine shots in falling
behind 9-2, then came back with a 12-2 run to take the lead and
twice led by four points. When Diaz scored on a follow shot -- Old
Dominion's fifth offensive rebound in that sequence -- the Lady
Monarchs led 23-19 and the angry Barmore called a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   His team responded with a 16-6 run to go up 35-29, and Lennox
hit back-to-back jumpers to make it 39-30.
</P>
<P>
   Old Dominion drew to 39-35 on Maiga's steal and layup before
Tech's Brooke Lassiter drew a charge to stop a 3-on-1 fast break
and sank both free throws for a 41-35 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tech opened a 52-42 lead in the first four minutes of the second
half, then began its 3-point barrage when Old Dominion cut it to
six.

<HEADLINE> Iowa St. Coach Loses Cool, the Game  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- All night long, coach Larry Eustachy
was on his feet, up and down in front of the Iowa State bench,
shouting at his players, shouting at the officials, just plain
shouting.
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, no small piece of business against Michigan
State. The coach's seat on the bench was there strictly for
decoration. Eustachy certainly didn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the coach's carrying on went too far in the
NCAA tournament's Midwest Regional final Saturday night. Eustachy
wound up in the dressing room, thrown out on a double technical
foul in the final minute of Michigan State's 75-64 victory that was
much closer than that.
</P>
<P>
   This game was played hand-to-hand, with an in-your-face attitude
by both teams. ''I didn't even comb my hair today,'' said Iowa
State guard Michael Nurse, ''because I knew it would be a
dogfight.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions ran high all night long and Eustachy wasn't the first
coach to get in trouble with the officials. Michigan State's Tom
Izzo drew his own technical foul with 5:49 left, dropping the
Spartans into a seven-point hole at 59-52.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask my players to stick up for what they think is right and
I stick up for what I think is right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So did Eustachy.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Izzo's technical, Eustachy's pressure cooker began
to build. With 3:43 to play, Iowa State's Paul Shirley got locked
up under the basket. As Shirley's shot went in, it was waved off by
the officials. No basket. Instead, a fifth personal foul on
Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy screamed at that turn of events, crucial at that
juncture with Iowa State's lead down to three points.
</P>
<P>
   It would get worse.
</P>
<P>
   All-American Marcus Fizer was already laboring under the burden
of four personal fouls but Eustachy couldn't pull the centerpiece
of his team off the floor at that stage. So Fizer stayed. And so
did Nurse, also playing with four personals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We play hard, no matter what,'' he said. ''If Coach catches
you playing soft because of fouls, he'll take you out. Whether
we're not in foul trouble or if we have a lot of fouls, we play the
same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after being beat off the boards all night long, Michigan
State began asserting itself under the basket -- just in time. Andre
Hutson grabbed three rebounds in a row and the Spartans converted
each time to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The game had turned. In the final minute, Iowa State was down by
five points at 69-64 and desperate for baskets. Fizer went up for a
shot and again there was the dreaded whistle. Another personal
foul, this one Nurse's fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Eustachy went ballistic. Players tried to keep the crewcut coach
away but he tore past them to confront officials Curtis Shaw, Frank
Basone and Lonnie Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, Dixon called a technical and that just incited Eustachy
even more. He was out on the floor, pushing players away, appearing
to make contact with Basone.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, he drew another technical. In an instant, the coach was
gone. Moments later, so was the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first technical foul was for excessive demonstration and
cursing,'' Shaw said. ''The second technical was for coming out on
the floor and being outside the coaching box.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have any choice. It was done strictly by the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Eustachy was contrite.
</P>
<P>
   ''Officiating is part of the game and you've got to play through
it, whatever it is,'' he said. ''You've got to play with what
you're dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Palace at Auburn Hills rocking, Hutson dropped in two
free throws for the foul called against Nurse. Then A.J. Granger
dropped in four straight for the double technical on Eustachy.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the game got away. Eustachy refused to comment on
the calls that sent him into a rage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just going to say it's disappointing that it ended that
way and I apologized to the team for that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a costly temper tantrum by a coach who turned a program
around this season. And when it was over, so was Iowa State's
season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Pavel Bure scored a pair of goals as the
Florida Panthers clinched their first playoff berth in three years
with a 4-2 victory Saturday night over the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   It was Florida's third consecutive win, following a stretch in
which the Panthers lost three of four.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers are four points behind Washington in the Atlantic
Division while ninth-place Montreal is struggling to get into the
playoffs, trailing Buffalo in the final spot by one point.
</P>
<P>
   Bure leads the NHL with 54 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers took a 1-0 lead on Bure's first goal. It was almost
a short-handed score as Mike Wilson just left the penalty box when
Bure broke free down the middle and sent a slap shot past Jeff
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Florida went up 2-0 with 1:29 left in the first when Len Barrie,
claimed off waivers from Los Angeles on March 10, one-timed a Scott
Mellanby pass by Hackett's left side.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1:38 into the second, Bure put the Panthers up 3-0 with a
power-play goal. After camping out at the edge of the crease to
Hackett's left, Bure poked in a goal assisted by Ray Whitney and
Viktor Kozlov.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov's assist was his 50th, breaking the team mark he shared
with Robert Svehla.
</P>
<P>
   Bure's second goal gave him and brother Valeri of the Calgary
Flames 89 this season, breaking the mark for NHL brothers. Dennis
and Bobby Hull totaled 88 in the 1968-69 season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth straight game with a point for Bure, tying his
second-longest stretch of the season. He has nine goals and five
assists during the span.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Hicks, who has missed much of the season after knee
surgery, notched his first goal with the Panthers at 17:27 of the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal finally got on the board on their sixth power play as
Sergei Zholtok's tallied his 24th goal at 6:29 of the third. Juha
Lind added a goal with 32.1 seconds remaining.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 93, Mavericks 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Chris Whitney scored a career-high 29 points,
including a pivotal steal and layup with less than three minutes
left, as the Washington Wizards continued their late surge with a
93-86 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Richmond added 20 points to help the Wizards to their
fourth victory in five games, matching their most successful
stretch of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Nowitzki's 18 points, Michael Finley's 15 and Erick
Strickland's 13 paced the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, starting in place of the injured Rod Strickland, scored
seven of Washington's first nine points of the fourth quarter and
the Wizards went on to build a 78-67 lead. But Dallas answered with
10 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   With the Wizards clinging to an 80-79 edge, Calvin Booth scored
a field goal and Whitney stole the ball from Steve Nash and
converted a layup for an 84-79 lead with 2:40 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond's 20-footer with 2:00 left expanded Washington's lead
to 86-79.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas got as close as 88-84 on Finley's 3-pointer with 31.4
seconds left, but Richmond hit four free throws and Aaron Williams
added one from the line for the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Washington led 47-39 at halftime and took a 67-62 advantage into
the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' loss allowed San Antonio, the NBA's defending champion,
to clinch a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Whitney's previous career high was 21 points. ... The
Wizards placed starting point guard Rod Strickland (strained
quadriceps muscle) on the injured list Thursday. ... The Mavericks'
Erick Strickland left the game early in the third quarter with a
bruised left hip. He went to the locker room for treatment and
returned with 1:57 left in the quarter. ... Shawn Bradley had a
season-high 14 rebounds for Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Flames 2, Predators 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Rookies Jeff Cowan and Sergei Varlamov
scored first-period goals and Fred Brathwaite made 26 saves
Saturday night, leading Calgary to a 2-1 win over the Nashville
Predators, the Flames second victory in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville dropped its third straight and is only 13-22-3 at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan put the rebound of Derek Morris's shot from the point by
Nashville goalie Mike Dunham 7:15 into the first period. The first
shot fell at Dunham's feet and Cowan poked it home.
</P>
<P>
   Varlamov, recalled Friday on an emergency basis from Saint John
of the AHL, made it 2-0 at 12:59 of the first. After Sergei
Krivokrasov drew Dunham to the right side of the goal he spotted
Varlamov all alone at the left post. It was Varlamov's first NHL
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Krivokrasov, an original member of the Predators, was traded to
Calgary March 14. He spent much of this week criticizing
Nashville's management and was booed every time he touched the
puck.
</P>
<P>
   Krivokrasov, who led the Predators in goals last season with 25,
had just nine in 63 games this season and was often a healthy
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Karlis Skrastins made it 2-1 at 4:42 of the third, rifling a
backhander from the slot past Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary's Valeri Bure became part of an NHL record when older
brother Pavel scored two goals for the Florida Panthers against
Montreal. Pavel's league-leading 54 goals combined with Valeri's 35
broke the record of 88 set by Chicago teammates Bobby and Dennis
Hull in the 1968-69 season.

<HEADLINE> Israel-Syria Differences Abound  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) -- Differences between Israel and Syria
on terms for a peace agreement ''may not be reconcilable,''
national security adviser Sandy Berger said Saturday in lowering
expectations for President Clinton's talks with Syrian President
Hafez el-Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Sunday's meeting of the two leaders was unlikely to
produce an immediate resumption of Syrian-Israeli negotiations,
which broke off in January. Instead, he said, the hope is that the
two sides ''over the next few weeks will reach the conclusion that
they can enter into a serious round of negotiation. But that's by
no means certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger previewed the Clinton-Assad summit as the president flew
here from a stop in Muscat, Oman, at the end of a six-day trip to
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   During a refueling layover in Muscat, Clinton told the Sultan
Qaboos that ''the gaps are not huge but the path is very
difficult'' as Syria and Israel seek a land-for-peace agreement,
Berger said. The two sides are seeking a deal in which Israel would
surrender control of the strategic Golan Heights, captured from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, in return for security guarantees
from Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we will know more after this meeting about whether
those two views are reconcilable or not,'' Berger said. ''They may
not be reconcilable. I think that is a perfectly plausible result.
And I think that if that's the case, that it's a good thing that
they know that now.''
</P>
<P>
   He described a process in which Clinton would consult with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak after Sunday's meeting while
Assad returned to Damascus to weigh what he learned from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will describe to Assad why he believes negotiations with
Israel can resume in a serious fashion with both sides committed to
reaching an agreement, Berger said. For both sides to reach that
conclusion, he said, ''there needs to be a higher level of
confidence -- certainly not certainty but confidence -- that their
respective needs can be met in an ultimate agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we know more about their respective needs than they
know about each other's respective needs,'' Clinton's adviser said.
''And I think that we can try to convey that, one to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on his comment that differences may be
irreconcilable, Berger said, ''I mean that in the end of the day
there has to be a win-win. They both have to compromise but they
both have to believe that they are stronger and better positioned
as a result of reaching a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether or not that is achievable or doable, I think, is still
unclear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger denied rumors that Clinton might extend this trip to go
to Israel. He said Clinton intends to return to Washington Sunday
night, but left open the possibility of staying in Geneva to
continue talks with Assad on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Missile Crashes in Utah  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- An Air Force cruise missile malfunctioned
during a test and crashed in the Great Salt Lake Desert, Hill Air
Force Base officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt when the missile crashed Thursday on Bureau of
Land Management property near the Goshute Indian Reservation on the
Nevada state line, said Tech. Sgt. Timothy Trager.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Tribune reported Saturday that the 20-foot-long
cruise missile was dropped from a B-52 bomber that took off from
Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana and flew to the Utah Test and
Training Range.
</P>
<P>
   The missile was being tracked by two F-15 chase planes and a
radar scope when it crashed, said Staff Sgt. Sonja Whittington,
spokeswoman for the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill. She did not know
its intended target.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pilots never lost the missile visually, but why it crashed
will be determined by investigators,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The missile contained no explosives, and there was no fire when
it crashed.

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. 75, Iowa St. 64  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Michigan State Spartans can slam
bodies with the best of them. Add patience to their game and they
are almost unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Spartans used another late run to beat Iowa State
75-64 in the Midwest Regional final Saturday night, advancing to
the Final Four for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach always says tough players win,'' said Morris Peterson,
who scored all but five of his 18 points in the second half. ''And
I thought down the stretch, we showed how tough we were.''
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Granger also scored 18 points for the Spartans (30-7), the
last No. 1 seed left in the tournament. This will be the eighth
time only one No. 1 has reached the Final Four, and seven of those
have been since 1989 -- with four since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, which scored the final 17 points in its
third-round victory over Syracuse, trailed Iowa State by seven
points with 5:49 left in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans outscored the Cyclones 23-5 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both teams in those situations are used to winning with five
minutes to go,'' said Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy, who was
ejected with 9.9 seconds remaining. ''They played a better quality
late in the game, and they're going to the Final Four. You have to
give them all the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamaal Tinsley scored 18 points, Michael Nurse had 17 and
All-American Marcus Fizer added 15 for the second-seeded Cyclones
(32-5), who were bidding for their first Final Four appearance
since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made a lot of good things happen throughout the game,''
Fizer said. ''We also made a lot of mistakes. That team right there
is playing to be national champs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, who have won three straight Big Ten championships,
will face conference rival Wisconsin in the national semifinals
next Saturday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, three-time losers to Michigan State this season, beat
Purdue 64-60 in the West final in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State took a 59-52 lead with 5:49 left on Kantrail Horton's
two free throws. But successive 3-pointers by Granger and Peterson,
plus two free throws by Charlie Bell, narrowed the gap to 61-60
with 4:01 left.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's jumper from the right side put the Spartans ahead 62-61
with 2:54 left -- their first lead since the 14:19 mark of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Then came perhaps the biggest play of the game. Mateen Cleaves,
who had only one assist to that point, threw up an alley-oop pass
that Peterson slammed down with 2:03 left, giving the Spartans a
64-61 lead and sending the partisan crowd at The Palace -- about 80
minutes from East Lansing -- into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to get a for-sure basket, and I think that's as for
sure as you can get,'' Granger said. ''It was a big
momentum-changer. We wanted to get the crowd on its feet, and that
did the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said it was Peterson who called
the play in the huddle a few moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''That play usually comes off when we screen and re-screen,''
Izzo explained. ''Morris said, 'What do you think about screen and
re-screen?' and I said it sounded great.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the 21,214 fans, over three-fourths of them wearing green
and white, could sense the dream had been revived.
</P>
<P>
   ''That really turned the whole thing around,'' Cyclones guard
Kantrail Horton said. ''That was great execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson hit four free throws and Cleaves made one down the
stretch, while the Cyclones -- hurrying their shots now -- began to
fire wildly until Nurse sank a 3-pointer with 44.2 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Granger finished it off with four straight free throws, thanks
in part to a double technical foul against Eustachy who left a
dejected bench. As he walked toward the tunnel, reserve forward
Paul Shirley, who fouled out with 3:43 remaining, was still
sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was still a great season,'' Horton said. ''People picked us
to finish last in our conference, but we accomplished a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans are seeking their first NCAA championship since
1979 when Magic Johnson's team beat Larry Bird's Indiana State
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones trailed by three at halftime. But Fizer, a
6-foot-8, 265-pound junior held to six points in the first half,
started connecting after intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer hit three straight shots -- a layup, a floating 3-pointer,
and a jumper from the left side -- during a 12-0 run that put Iowa
State ahead 48-40 with 11:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's best weapon at that point was Andre Hutson.
Izzo had been pleading with the pass-first player to be more
selfish, and Hutson finally took him up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson, who finished with 17 points, scored nine straight, some
over Fizer, as the Spartans narrowed the gap to 48-47 with 7:52
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he took playing Fizer as a challenge,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   But a jumper by Tinsley, who learned the game on the New York
City playgrounds, and a 3-pointer by Nurse sparked another Iowa
State spurt that put the Cyclones up 59-52 with 5:49 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spartans have been behind before. They trailed Syracuse
by 14 in the second half of their semifinal game with the Orangemen
on Thursday night and still won by 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Successive 3-pointers by Granger and Peterson let the Cyclones
know Michigan State wasn't going to wilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot of leadership,'' said Cleaves, the Spartans'
leader who returned for his senior year just for another shot at
the national championship. ''It's something like a refuse to lose
attitude. When we get down, we pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's jumper put the Spartans ahead for good, 62-61, with 2:54
left.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Michigan State's ninth straight. Iowa State had
won 10 in a row.

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- An Air Force cruise missile malfunctioned during a
test and crashed in the Great Salt Lake Desert, Hill Air Force Base officials
said. No one was hurt when the missile crashed Thursday on Bureau of Land
Management property near the Goshute Indian Reservation on the Nevada state
line, said Tech. Sgt. Timothy Trager. The Salt Lake Tribune reported today that
the 20-foot-long cruise missile was dropped from a B-52 bomber that took off
from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana and flew to the Utah Test and
Training Range. The missile contained no explosives, and there was no fire when
it crashed.

Reform Rabbis Mull Same-sex Unions
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Reform Judaism is poised for a vote that could make it
the most influential U.S. religious group to support clergy who perform same-sex
unions. A resolution sanctioning commitment ceremonies is expected to come up at
the Central Conference of American Rabbis convention starting Sunday in
Greensboro. Supporters believe rabbis should affirm committed relationships
between Jewish gays and lesbians as sacred, just like Jewish marriage. While the
conference supports civil same-sex unions and approved openly gay rabbis a
decade ago, some homosexuals say they still feel like second-class citizens at
temple. The resolution would give religious legitimacy to same-sex unions.

<HEADLINE> Group: 'Wild Wild West' Worst Movie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the eve of the Oscar ceremony they love to
dishonor, the Golden Raspberry Foundation let out its annual Bronx
cheers and picked ''Wild Wild West'' as Hollywood's worst offering
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Loathed as ''a wretched remake of the mid-1960s TV hit,'' the
movie starring Will Smith led in dis-stink-tion with five Razzies --
worst picture, director, screenplay, song and screen couple (Smith
and Kevin Kline).
</P>
<P>
   ''It swept, to the surprise of no one who saw it,'' foundation
president John Wilson said. ''It personifies what you need to do to
win a Razzie in modern Hollywood -- spend too much, entertain no one
and fall flat on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Wild Wild West'' beat out ''Big Daddy,'' ''The Blair Witch
Project,'' ''The Haunting'' and ''Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The
Phantom Menace'' in the worst-picture category.
</P>
<P>
   Razzie nominees and winners are picked by 465 foundation
members, who are industry workers, journalists and moviegoers in
the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation members gathered Saturday at the Hollywood Roosevelt
Hotel, site of the first Academy Awards, for their 20th annual
spoof of the Oscars taking place the following day at the Shrine
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Winners never show up to collect the gold-painted, golf
ball-sized plastic raspberry atop a film canister, which Wilson
said are worth about $4.27. This year, however, actor Robert Conrad
planned to be on hand. Conrad played James West in the ''Wild Wild
West'' TV series -- the same character Smith played.
</P>
<P>
   The Razzie for worst actor went to Adam Sandler for his role as
''an amazingly idiotic adoptive father'' in ''Big Daddy,'' and
Heather Donahue's portrayal of ''the increasingly irksome director
of a doomed documentary'' in ''The Blair Witch Project'' got the
worst actress nod.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue faced serious competition from Catherine Zeta-Jones, who
was nominated in the worst actress category for two films,
''Entrapment'' and ''The Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst supporting actors were Denise Richards of ''The World is
Not Enough'' and Jar-Jar Binks (voice by Ahmed Best) of the ''Star
Wars'' prequel.

<HEADLINE> Spartan Defense Key To Victory  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State's depth and defense
were too much for Iowa State to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights after holding Syracuse to two points in the final
8:02 of a 75-58 victory, the Spartans held the Cyclones to a single
3-point basket over the final 4:51 to finish with a 20-3 run in a
75-64 victory Saturday night in the Midwest Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing we hadn't seen. We'd seen that defense from
lesser talented players,'' Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had everything to do with stopping Marcus (Fizer) at
times and our attempting poor shots and turnovers. They're very
talented and athletic and big and it's tough to score over big and
talented guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, Iowa State's All-American forward, was held to 15 points
on 6-of-15 shooting and made just one basket in the final 11:45.
The Spartans used a committee of three against Fizer, but Andre
Hutson pulled the main duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took the challenge to play Marcus Fizer,'' Michigan State
guard Mateen Cleaves said. ''Andre's one of the best big men in the
league and he showed it. If Andre hadn't played like he played
tonight, we wouldn't be sitting here right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutson said the plan was to keep a body on Fizer at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a good job of double teaming, trying to keep the ball
out of his hands and forcing him to take bad shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Like traveling early in the first half when trying to get past
Aloysius Anagonye, or forcing several forced shots when Hutson or
someone else was on him and misfiring on all but one of his six
3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans had the luxury of also putting A.J. Granger and
Anagonye on Fizer, and everyone else lent a hand when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew we had to give (Hutson) help and he did a great job by
himself,'' Granger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones committed 19 turnovers, 13 in the first half. They
only committed 12 all game in their win over UCLA. And Jamaal
Tinsley, who had 11 assists and five turnovers against the Bruins,
had only two assists and five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Cyclones had 19 turnovers while forcing only
eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the key stat of the ball game,'' Eustachy said.
</P>
<P>
   The other key stat was playing time. Michael Nurse played the
entire game for the Cyclones, Fizer played 36 minutes and three
others played more than 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans had three players play 35 minutes or more, but
played nine players with the game on the line while the Cyclones
used only seven.
</P>
<P>
   ''After we made a few big plays in the second half, we could
tell they were starting to wear down,'' Hutson said. ''I think
that's been the key to our success all year. We wear teams down and
then in the last five minutes, we suck it up and fight through it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our defensive pressure for the whole 40 minutes is
what wears our opponents down.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Relaxes Facial Hair Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Worried about finding workers in a tight
labor market, Walt Disney executives are relaxing the company's
long-standing ban against theme park employees having facial hair,
The Orlando Sentinel reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mustaches will be OK, although beards will still be taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney adopted its clean-cut code for Disneyland employees
in 1957, requiring men to be clean shaven and to keep their hair
short.
</P>
<P>
   Though he sported a mustache himself, the company's founder
thought the prohibition was necessary to change the image of
amusement parks from that of sleazy carnivals to a wholesome,
family environment. Employees who worked for the creative side of
the company, Walt Disney Imagineering and the Walt Disney Studio,
were generally exempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think most of the people would say hallelujah,'' said Mike
Duffy, president of the Service Employees International Union Local
362, which represents Disney workers. ''It's good to see the
company come into the new millennium from the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   The new policy comes as the company is struggling to find
workers for its theme parks, offering incentives from cash bonuses
to tuition reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance code was last revised in 1994, when female theme
park workers were permitted to use eye shadow and eyeliner and
balding men were allowed to wear toupees.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tim Duncan recorded his first career
triple-double with 17 points, 17 rebounds and 11 assists Saturday
night in leading the San Antonio Spurs to a 96-76 victory over the
Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   Jaren Jackson had 16 points, Avery Johnson and Mario Elie added
14 apiece, and David Robinson had 10 for San Antonio, which was
assured of a playoff spot when Dallas lost to Washington earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which was outscored 48-27 in the second half, was led
by Andre Miller's 15 points and Lamond Murray's 14.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio never led in the first half, but opened the third
quarter with six straight points by Johnson to lead 54-49 with 9:05
to play in the period.
</P>
<P>
   After Cleveland regained the lead, at 57-56, San Antonio
answered with an 8-0 run to go up 64-57 on Elie's driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Spurs, who have defeated Cleveland in 10
of their last 11 meetings, continued to stretch the advantage in
the fourth quarter as Jackson came off of the bench to connect on
consecutive 3-pointers, giving San Antonio a 77-63 lead with 8:58
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson combined with Jerome Kersey for 15 fourth-quarter points
as Cleveland could get no closer than eight points in the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland led by as many as 15 points in the first quarter,
jumping out to a 27-12 lead as Miller had 11 first quarter points.
The Cavaliers outscored San Antonio 20-8 in the paint and were
ahead 29-21 at the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who has 53 double-doubles this season, had a 15-point,
10-rebound first half as San Antonio rallied to close the gap to
49-48 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Antonio is 27-8 at the Alamodome this season. ... The
largest crowd of the season, 35,217, attended. ... Saturday's
double-double was the 147th of Duncan's career, the most in the NBA
over the last two-plus seasons. ... The teams split the season
series 1-1.

<HEADLINE> 11 Arrested in Purdue Fans Violence  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF TUCKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- A mob of Purdue University students
overturned Dumpsters and lit small bonfires Saturday night to vent
their anger that the Boilermakers lost in the NCAA college
basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, police fired tear gas into the crowd to break it
up. Eleven people were arrested, said State Police Sgt. Shana
Kennedy. Most faced charges of public intoxication and disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''A bunch of people came by the residence hall, singing 'Join
the riot' said Christina Matthews, 18, as she walked along with the
crowd. ''Now we're walking around, not doing much of anything. It's
kind of a quiet riot.''
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance followed a riot on campus Thursday night, after
the Boilermakers beat Gonzaga to advance to Saturday's regional
final game. That night, police fired tear gas into a crowd of
students who set fires and damaged cars. Four students were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, disappointed with the team's 64-60 loss to
Wisconsin, students tore down a couple of utility poles, lit a sofa
on fire at a campus intersection and overturned a Dumpster, while
officers watched on the ground and in helicopters overhead.
</P>
<P>
   A very different scene played out in Madison, Wis., where an
estimated 7,000 people flooded State Street to celebrate the
Badgers' first Final Four appearance since 1941. There were no
disturbances reported.

<HEADLINE> Texas Wins NCAA Men's Swimming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Texas, despite going without an individual
victory Saturday night, easily outscored defending champion Auburn
538-385 for the NCAA men's swimming and diving championship.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which had won four races and two diving titles in the
first two days of the event, had to settle for a second-place
finish by Troy Dumais on the 10-meter platform behind Miami's Tyce
Routson.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was third with 360{ points and Stanford fourth with
279{.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came in here with a pretty good team the last three
years,'' Texas coach Eddie Reese said. ''As they've gotten older,
they've swam better each year. This has been an enjoyable trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Ryk Neethling was upset in his bid for a fourth
straight title in the 1,500-meter freestyle. Erik Vendt of Southern
Cal won in 14 minutes, 31.02 seconds, beating out Chris Thompson of
Michigan by nearly five seconds. Neethling, who won the 200 and 400
freestyles earlier in the week, was third at 14:39.04.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he was the defending champion,'' Vendt said of
Neethling. ''I wasn't thinking about those titles. I was thinking
about winning the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Moses won his second title of the week, the 200-meter
breaststroke in 2:06.40. He won the 100-meter breaststroke on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ervin of California added the 100 freestyle to the 50
freestyle title he won earlier, Florida's Matt Cole won the 200
backstroke, and Adam Messner of Stanford won the 200 butterfly.

<HEADLINE> Mets, Cubs Prepare for Tokyo Games  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Baseball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa stepped off the bus and into another
world.
</P>
<P>
   Old men bowed when he walked into the hotel lobby. Young women
in flowery kimonos asked for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Bleary-eyed after an 18-hour trip from the Chicago Cubs' spring
training camp in Mesa, Ariz., to Tokyo, the slugger still managed a
smile after his team arrived Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll wake up now,'' he said. ''I feel happy here.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already a huge star in Japan -- his picture is plastered all
over television commercials, subway posters and convenience store
signs. A customs agent at Narita airport struck the pose of a
hitter at the mere mention of his name.
</P>
<P>
   Sellout crowds are expected Wednesday night and Thursday night
at the Tokyo Dome when the Cubs and New York Mets open the major
league season, and Slammin' Sammy is the main reason.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa clearly was the No. 1 fan favorite as the Cubs and Mets
worked out Sunday afternoon at the ballpark. Kids cheered his every
swing, catch and throw, and he responded by throwing wristbands
into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   With left field only 317 feet away, Sosa took target practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't worry about the park,'' he said. ''I'm just trying to
make contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was the MVP of an all-star team that toured Japan in 1998,
right after his home-run race with Mark McGwire attracted worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's because of McGwire, mostly, that Sosa will get to play in
the majors' first regular-season games held outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were picked to go after the St. Louis Cardinals, led by
McGwire, turned down the trip last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Japanese have their own brand of baseball over there,''
McGwire said. ''I know major league baseball wants to do more
internationally, but there's no purpose in it. I don't agree with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs first baseman Mark Grace did not agree with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lot of respect for Mark McGwire, but I want to thank
him for saying no. Because if he'd said yes, then I wouldn't have
had the opportunity to come over here,'' Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as major league players have a responsibility to show the
world the best players in the world. I know there a lot of baseball
fans overseas that don't get a chance to see us. That's just
another reason for us to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace, in fact, planned to be part of a Cubs and Mets contingent
taking a helicopter to visit a U.S. Army base, Camp Zama, after the
workout Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Said commissioner Bud Selig: ''Mark McGwire and I have talked
about this, and I know his feelings on the subject. I look at this
much differently. This is the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this is only the first of many such ventures,'' Selig
said. ''It is our hope and dream that the World Series will be what
the word connotes -- a true world series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Cubs will take turns playing exhibition games
against the Tokyo Giants and Seibu Lions -- they signed Tony
Fernandez and Reggie Jefferson in the offseason -- on Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mets left-hander Mike Hampton will throw the first pitch of the
2000 season on Wednesday night (5:08 a.m. EST). Before then, he
planned to see the shrines and perhaps go shopping in the famous
Ginza district.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to experience the city and culture, and embrace
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, both teams were more concerned about overcoming
the effects of the long trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets traveled about 7,400 miles from their spring camp in
Port St. Lucie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all of us are used to dealing with jet lag,'' catcher
Mike Piazza said. ''I think going from the East coast to the West
coast helps us be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took a bus early Friday morning from their camp to the
airport in Phoenix, caught a connecting flight to San Francisco,
switched to a United plane to Tokyo and finished up with a two-hour
bus ride to their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs trainer David Tumbas advised the players to nap for 3-4
hours on the flight, drink plenty of water and walk around the
plane to stay loose. He also suggested they stay awake when they
arrived, giving them a better chance of getting adjusted to the
local time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some headaches on the flight. They'll be OK by the time
we play Monday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who guided Chiba Lotte in Japan in
1995, sounded fresh and ready. Smiling, he answered his first
question in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very happy and excited to be here, for the series
against the Japanese teams and the Cubs,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lieber, who will pitch the opener for the Cubs, was eager to
try the sushi. It was his first trip overseas and the Iowa native
seemed surprised the scenery was not more unusual from the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we flew over Japan, it kind of looked like the Midwest.
It looked like when you fly into Milwaukee,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Kentucky FB Players Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Two Kentucky football players were
arrested Saturday morning after police broke up a late-night party.
</P>
<P>
   Senior wide receiver Garry Davis, 22, was charged with
disorderly conduct and allowing nine minors to possess alcohol
after police halted a party at his home near campus. Also arrested
at the party was freshman wide receiver Brad Pyatt, 19, who was
charged with criminal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Police identified Pyatt as the person who damaged a police car,
the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were booked in the Fayette County Jail. Each posted
$1,000 bail and were released about 3:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Davis played in 10 games for the Wildcats last season. He had 26
catches for 312 yards and one touchdown, but struggled late in the
season and was briefly off the team.
</P>
<P>
   The football team begins spring practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests come less than two weeks after junior cornerback
Jeremy Bowie was arrested in Lexington on drunken driving charges.
Bowie has been suspended from the team.
</P>
<P>
   Under the school's alcohol policy, an athlete charged with
public intoxication or underage consumption would be put on
probation and be required to attend counseling.

Government Said Unmoved by Microsoft Offer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Skeptical government lawyers consider an 11th-hour offer
from the Microsoft Corp. to settle its antitrust trial so inadequate in
important areas that there were no immediate plans to resume negotiations in
Chicago, people close to the case said Saturday. These sources did not rule out
the possibility of talks resuming, and the government continued to evaluate the
proposal by Microsoft to end the case before Tuesday, when the trial judge has
threatened to announce his verdict.

Putin Looks Headed for Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Weary of chaos and government corruption, Russians are
expected to give Vladimir Putin a victory in presidential elections Sunday,
hoping the ex-KGB spy can clean up the country and restore it as a world power
without rolling back democratic reforms. With a Putin presidency seen as
inevitable by most Russians, the question is what he plans for the world's
largest country in land mass. Opinion polls show Putin with about 50 percent of
voters backing him, with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov far behind with about
20 percent.

Israel-Syria Differences Abound
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) -- Differences between Israel and Syria on terms for
a peace agreement ''may not be reconcilable,'' national security adviser Sandy
Berger said Saturday in lowering expectations for President Clinton's talks with
Syrian President Hafez el-Assad. Berger said Sunday's meeting of the two leaders
was unlikely to produce an immediate resumption of Syrian-Israeli negotiations,
which broke off in January. Instead, he said, the hope is that the two sides
''over the next few weeks will reach the conclusion that they can enter into a
serious round of negotiation. But that's by no means certain.''

Reform Rabbis Mull Same-sex Unions
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Reform Judaism is poised for a vote that could make it
the most influential U.S. religious group to support clergy who perform same-sex
unions. A resolution sanctioning commitment ceremonies is expected to come up at
the Central Conference of American Rabbis convention starting Sunday in
Greensboro. Supporters believe rabbis should affirm committed relationships
between Jewish gays and lesbians as sacred, just like Jewish marriage. While the
conference supports civil same-sex unions and approved openly gay rabbis a
decade ago, some homosexuals say they still feel like second-class citizens at
temple. The resolution would give religious legitimacy to same-sex unions.

Gas Prices Rise a Half Cent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gasoline prices edged up a mere half a cent in the past
two weeks, and the increases may be coming to an end, an industry analyst said
Saturday. The average retail price of all grades of gasoline, including taxes,
was about $1.59 per gallon as of Friday, an increase of only a half cent from
March 10, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. While
the nationwide average cost of gas rose half a penny, there are starkly
different regional trends. For example, ''Prices are down more than 6 cents in
the Midwest but up nearly a dime in the West,'' analysts said.

Disney Relaxes Facial Hair Rules
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Walt Disney executives are relaxing the company's
long-standing ban against theme park employees having facial hair, The Orlando
Sentinel reported Saturday. Mustaches will be OK, although beards will still be
taboo. Walt Disney adopted its clean-cut code for Disneyland employees in 1957,
requiring men to be clean shaven and to keep their hair short. Though he sported
a mustache himself, the company's founder thought the prohibition was necessary
to change the image of amusement parks from that of sleazy carnivals to a
wholesome, family environment. Employees who worked for the creative side of the
company, Walt Disney Imagineering and the Walt Disney Studio, were generally
exempt.

Group: 'Wild Wild West' Worst Movie

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- On the eve of the Oscar ceremony they love to dishonor,
the Golden Raspberry Foundation let out its annual Bronx cheers and picked
''Wild Wild West'' as Hollywood's worst offering for 1999. Loathed as ''a
wretched remake of the mid-1960s TV hit,'' the movie starring Will Smith led in
dis-stink-tion with five Razzies -- worst picture, director, screenplay, song
and screen couple (Smith and Kevin Kline). Razzie nominees and winners are
picked by 465 foundation members, who are industry workers, journalists and
moviegoers in the United States and abroad.
