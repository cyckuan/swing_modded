FAA WAIVES AMWEST'S RE MAINING $2.5 MILLION FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year after America West Airlines was hit with a $2.5 million
fine over maintenance violations, the Federal Aviation
Administration waived the remaining $2.5 million penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA agreed Wednesday to forgive the final fine because the
airline complied with terms of a settlement reached last July,
according to FAA spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was the largest in U.S. aviation history, eclipsing a
$1 million penalty paid by now-defunct Eastern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   America West management declined to comment on the fine waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders for America West workers reacted with optimism
about the FAA announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more than happy that that is behind America West,'' said
Bill McGlashen, union president for the company's flight
attendants. ``It's up to the union and FAA to keep vigilant watch
over the airline.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine and FAA scrutiny of America West were good things in
that they forced the Tempe-based carrier to focus more attention on
maintenance issues, McGlashen said.
</P>
<P>
   America West was tagged with a $5 million civil penalty exactly
a year ago to settle violations of aircraft maintenance and
operations regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA agreed last July to accept $2.5 million and suspend the
remaining $2.5 million if America West complied with the terms of
the settlement over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation consultant Mike Boyd said America West has rebounded
from the bad publicity it received over the FAA fine.
</P>
<P>
   He called the problems minor technical violations of the FAA's
complex rules and said America West never compromised safety.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regulators saw it much differently. America West ``grossly
mismanaged'' its maintenance and operations, according to FAA
documents obtained last year by ''The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA alleged that America West flew 17 Airbus A-320 aircraft
that were overdue for significant structural inspections. The
agency also said that cargo-hold netting was improperly installed
on passenger and cargo flights, and that an aircraft was returned
to service before mechanics properly repaired an elevator actuator,
which controls the tail flap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude of this carrier's management (is) that safety and
regulatory requirements are secondary to the continued movement of
aircraft within the carrier's route system,'' an FAA inspector
wrote in his report last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This culture, which permeates the carrier, lends credence to
the employees who conduct the day-to-day operations of the carrier
that it is OK to continue an operation even when there may be a
significant factor that could impede safety. This fact alone could
lead to a significant event resulting in a loss of life or
property.''
</P>
<P>
   America West has never had an accident. But its maintenance has
drawn attention since it laid off 500 mechanics in 1995 and began
outsourcing heavy maintenance to outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   America West is negotiating with the mechanics union to bring
back some of the heavy maintenance, which would create about 125
jobs for mechanics, according to Pat Porter, a spokesman for the
mechanics union.
</P>
<P>
   The company has hired 71 mechanics since last July, an 18
percent increase, according to America West spokeswoman Patty
Nowack.
</P>
<P>
   America West also shook up its management team in the wake of
the FAA fine. The fallout from the agency's action may have been
the beginning of the end for Richard Goodmanson, America West
president and chief executive officer. He resigned in April.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Goodmanson disputed the FAA conclusions about
America West and said the agency's reports were written by
``apparently junior FAA investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that the FAA was being picky and compared it
to a police officer citing a motorist for having a taillight out.
</P>
<P>
   After the FAA fine and continued poor operations over the
summer, Goodmanson fell out of the limelight and virtually
disappeared during the company's contract negotiations with flight
attendants, which averted a threatened strike in March.
</P>
<P>
   America West Chairman William Franke returned as the airline's
president and CEO under the management reorganization announced in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Mook, a former top operations executive for Federal
Express Corp., was hired as executive vice president and chief
operating officer to help improve the carrier's day-to-day
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The management changes made since the fine a year ago are
encouraging, according to Donald Steinman, chairman of the Air Line
Pilots Association unit at America West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these are steps in the right direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen agreed and said he would like to see the company move
forward on bringing back more of the outsourced heavy maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep watch from our end over safety-type issues,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a part of that, McGlashen said that the Association of Flight
Attendants is lobbying for a whistle-blower protection measure in
Congress for aviation workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``America West and the industry need that because it creates
another level of safety,'' he said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MONITORING NEW YORK'S POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made his point this week with the usual
clarity. ``My administration never compromises on matters of
principle,'' he said. The principle, in this case, is that New York
City's Police Department should not have an outside monitor on
questions of police brutality. An overseer for the department is
said to be one of the remedies suggested by federal prosecutors in
the wake of police torture of the Haitian immigrant Abner Louima
two years ago. But if a federal monitor is such a bad idea, the
mayor must come up with something better.
</P>
<P>
   The federal inquiry begun by the outgoing U.S. Attorney Zachary
Carter has reportedly found that complaints about brutality are
rarely followed up within the department, including those that make
it through the Civilian Complaint Review Board. As the talks
between the city and federal officials proceed, Police Commissioner
Howard Safir is said to be reviewing what happens to complaints
passed along by the Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   At this secretive stage in the negotiations, details about
Carter's findings are hard to come by. One thing is clear _ this is
an excellent moment for the mayor, the police and federal
prosecutors to find some new and thoughtful ways to deal with a
problem that has been vexing the city and the department for years.
Too often the only way to complain about police brutality in New
York City is to hire a hot-blooded lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Such added trauma and expense should not be necessary. Instead,
a vital and independent Civilian Complaint Review Board should be
the negotiators' first order of business. Another possibility worth
study is an independent advisory body of nationally respected
experts, comparable to the child welfare advisory panel created
last year as part of a court settlement over the city's handling of
children's issues. Other analysts of departmental practices have
found that some police precincts have much better records than
others of taking brutality charges seriously. Those precincts
should be studied and their practices replicated.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and police commissioner admirably defend the many
officers who do their jobs well and use force legitimately. At the
same time, the protests and criticism over the police shooting of
an unarmed West African, Amadou Diallo, cannot be ignored. For all
the mayor's complaints _ that a federal inquiry is sheer politics
and that there are 200 other police departments that deserve more
scrutiny than New York City's _ these negotiations should not be
about winning political points but improving relations between the
police and the diverse community they serve.
</P>
<P>
   As for the federal monitor, the mayor said on Wednesday, ``They
can't do it!'' But of course they can do it. The Justice Department
could sue the city, and a court could impose a monitor. It would be
far better if they do not have to do it.

SENATE REPUBLICANS FLEX THEIR MUSCLE IN SHAPING BILL ON MANAGED
CARE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans Wednesday showed that they were calling
the shots in the Senate's managed care debate, approving their own
measure on hospitalization for women undergoing mastectomies and
turning back three efforts by Democrats to strengthen the rights of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   In votes almost completely along party lines, the Republicans
defeated the Democrats' second attempt in two days to broaden the
bill to apply to all 161 million Americans with private health
insurance. The Senate also killed a measure to ensure patients'
access to specialists, and it blocked the Democrats' attempt to
require health plans to cover the costs of clinical trials and
drugs. The Democrats argued that clinical trials once paid for by
health insurance are being curtailed because managed-care plans
were no longer paying for the routine patient costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican unity presented a sharp contrast to the party's
disarray on gun control earlier this spring, when the majority
party proved powerless to stop Democratic measures. But on the
health care issues, the Republican leaders held their members in
line by making sure that they had put forward their own proposals
on the most emotional issues in the debate, over how to regulate
the managed care companies. That would give Republicans votes they
could point to on matter that the Democrats might raise as campaign
issues next year.
</P>
<P>
   So a day after defeating a broader Democratic amendment on
women's health measures, the Republicans passed, 55 -45, their own
measure to prevent insurance companies from forcing women to have
mastectomies as outpatients.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republicans Wednesday introduced a multipart measure to
guarantee patients emergency room care, as well as access to
specialists and to obstetricians and gynecologists. The action came
after they defeated broader Democratic versions of the same
provisions that would have covered far more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to come up with a good bill,'' said Sen. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn., attributing the Republicans' success to their
willingness to revisit some issues after defeating Democratic
amendments on those matters. ``It's working,'' he said, ``that's
why we're getting people to stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats charged that the Republicans were simply seeking
political protection. Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader, said:
``Yesterday they voted wrong. Today they saw what they did, and I
guarantee you they're going to come back today and try to cover
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is pushing to pass a final bill on Thursday night,
but appeared to be on a collision course with President Clinton.
Clinton's aides have said they will recommend that he veto the bill
if the Republican version passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no room for compromise between an absolute sham and a
real Patients' Bill of Rights,'' the secretary of Health and Human
Services, Donna Shalala, said in an appearance on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had forced the Senate to consider the issue of
regulating managed care, stepped up their efforts to show how their
version of the legislation known as the Patients' Bill of Rights
differed from the rival Republican plan. And they drew support from
various doctors' groups.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists came out
in opposition to the Republican version of a plan to give women
direct access to obstetricians. It said the Republican amendment
would give direct access in cases of a routine visit but weaken
access to follow-up care.
</P>
<P>
   And the president of the American Medical Association, Dr.
Thomas R. Reardon, appeared at a news conference with a handful of
House Republicans who are doctors and dentists to condemn the
Senate vote on Tuesday night against a Democratic plan to give
doctors, not insurance companies, the say over what treatment is
medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting at times on the Senate floor, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said that many of the Republicans' protections were
extended only to the 48 million people who have their insurance
through large companies with self-financed plans. Such plans fall
solely under federal and not state regulation, and are often
older-style fee-for-service plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reforms are supposed to protect patients against HMOs
and insurance companies,'' Kennedy said. ``But people with
insurance coverage with HMOs are not covered by the Republican
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Kennedy how
many New Yorkers would be covered by the Republican bill. ``Four
out of five of the citizens of New York will not be covered under
the Republican program,'' Kennedy replied.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said: ``That means four out of five would not get
emergency room coverage. Four out of five would not get the right
to specialists. Four out of five would not get the right to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans countered that the states were better suited to
regulate insurance companies, not the federal government. ``This is
about arrogance,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``It's about
people thinking we'll decide. We here in Washington think we're
enlightened and know what's best for you.''
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 52-48 the Senate defeated the Democrats' effort to
broaden the Republican bill to cover all Americans with private
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Kennedy became so impassioned that Sen. Don
Nickles, the Oklahoman who is the majority whip, said he feared
that Kennedy would have a heart attack and need to call in Frist,
the only doctor who is a member of the Senate. Kennedy shot back,
``We couldn't get Dr. Frist under the access-to-specialists
provisions of the Republican bill.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case Wednesday, that of mastectomies, the Republicans did
agree to extend their bill's protection to all those with private
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Just a day after voting down a Democratic amendment that would
have given women an array of protections, the Senate turned around
and by a straight party-line vote of 55 -45 approved a provision by
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R- Maine , that would give all women who
undergo a mastectomy the right to stay in the hospital as long as a
doctor considered it medically necessary. ``Leave it to the doctor
and the patient,'' Ms. Snowe said. ``That's what we're asking to do
with patients who have breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snowe's measure also required insurance companies to pay for
a secondary consultation for cancer. But it stopped short of the
assurances that were in the Democrats' provision to give a woman
the right to select an obstetrician-gynecologist as her primary
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Women's health issues have been a major issue in the debate on
HMO care, as was demonstrated by the passage of the Federal
Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996, which
requires a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours after a normal vaginal
birth and 96 hours after a Caesarean section, unless the mother and
doctor agree to an earlier discharge. Mastectomies have become an
issue because it has not been rare for women to be discharged
immediately after a procedure. In addition, many women are not
allowed to use obstetrician-gynocologists as their primary care
physician in an HMO, though many states have passed laws allowing
them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the day, the Republicans introduced a multipart
amendment that would ensure patients access to emergency rooms
outside of an HMO hospital network, allow but not require a health
plan to consider an obstetrician-gynecologist a primary care giver
and give patients more assured access to specialists. In all cases
these protections would apply to 48 million people, not the 161
million the Democrats would cover.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the Republicans voted down the Democrats'
provision on access to specialists.

GAMEWORKS FLAGSHIP MAY ANCHOR IN L.A.'S VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sega GameWorks, the ambitious chain of nearly two
dozen arcade-nightclubs backed by Steven Spielberg, is actively
considering building its prime site in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would definitely like to have a flagship site in a place
like Sherman Oaks or West Los Angeles,'' Bruce Fabel, chief
operating officer at the 3-year-old venture, said during a recent
interview. ``We are actively looking for real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive's comment indicates GameWorks is likely to take a
long look at the legendary Sherman Oaks Galleria, which would give
GameWorks high visibility at a well-known location. It could take
at least a year for such a site to open at the mall, about five
miles to the east of GameWorks headquarters on the Universal
Studios lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing solid yet in terms of real estate decisions,''
GameWorks spokeswoman Melissa Schumer said Wednesday. ``At this
point, we see Sherman Oaks and West Los Angeles as viable areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The mall, made famous through Frank and Moon Unit Zappa's song
``Valley Girl'' and its use in the film ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High,'' has been mostly vacant for several months due to extensive
remodeling in its interior. Galleria owner Douglas Emmett &AMP; Co. has
said it expects the revamping to be finished around October 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision by GameWorks _ a joint project of Universal
Studios, Sega and Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG _ would underscore its
commitment to stick with the still-evolving concept of
location-based entertainment. The basic idea is to lure
free-spending adults to a high-tech combination of a three-ring
circus of interactive games, food, flashing lights and computer
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The original concept, launched in Seattle in March 1997, was
designed to attract teen-agers and young adults who wanted more
than video games and would pay for ``play cards'' that could be
used throughout the multilevel facility. The idea was to attract
kids during the day and adults at night and the first locations
were designed to blend the casual feel of a Hollywood studio back
lot with an array of casual-eating options and hundreds of video
games.
</P>
<P>
   The signature attractions at GameWorks include a half-dozen
Zones, such as the Racing Zone, the Carnival Zone and Sports Zone
with one-of-a-kind games such as Two Minute Drill, Wave Runner,
Extreme Powerboat and the Spielberg-designed Vertical Reality game
in which players strap on harnesses and raise and lower themselves
along a 24-foot-high wall in a race against the clock to rid a
skyscraper of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to serve as an anchor at a retail center and a lure
for free-spending young adults as a hangout. GameWorks has remained
on the outskirts of the action in Southern California's suburbs
thus far, opening outlets in Irvine, Ontario and Orange.
</P>
<P>
   GameWorks is pushing ahead despite competition from the Dave and
Buster's restaurant chain for adults and Walt Disney Co.'s
DisneyQuest interactive play parks, now open in Chicago and
Orlando, Fla. It will open at least three more GameWorks facilities
next year and will expand the Irvine location from its GameWorks
Studio format to a full-size site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give mixed grades so far to the GameWorks concept,
which also has opened in Detroit; Miami; Tempe, Ariz.; Las Vegas;
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Chicago; Guam and Grapevine, Texas. Their
major criticism is that the sites are unlikely to attract more
customers than teen-age boys and young adult males.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to shift their appeal to something that's more
attractive to other demographics,'' said entertainment analyst
Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners. ``The family
demographic is not going be attracted by multilevel bars. GameWorks
had a very clear goal originally to attract a family-oriented
demographic by re-creating the Hollywood back lot experience in an
enclosed retail environment but it wasn't executed effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Theme park consultant Dennis Speigel said Spielberg's name
elevates the concept, but he added that insiders haven't been
overly impressed so far with the locations.
</P>
<P>
   GameWorks says more than 15 million people have attended its
dozen full-size sites, most of which occupy more than 30,000 square
feet and its 10 smaller GameWorks Studio sites. It also has been
fine-tuning the concept with the more recent locations by shifting
its appeal more toward adults, particularly females, rather than
teen-age boys, according to Fabel.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 18 months ago, we did a tremendous amount of exit
surveys and guest research and what we found was that adults were
looking for places to go after hours,'' said Fabel. ``We've been
focusing on softening the design to cater towards women so it no
longer has a technical hard feel, but more of a Hollywood feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That's meant adding bar areas on both levels, making the play
Zones more distinct and offering a sit-down grill-style restaurant
much like Houston's or The Cheesecake Factory, Fabel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restaurants are not just selling just onion rings and
fries,'' he added. ``We're now offering things like linguine with
shrimp sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   There will continue to be variety from site to site since
GameWorks wants each location to complement the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to make concept fit the location,'' Fabel said.
``We're definitely hitting targets as being hometown entertainment
choice in terms of competing with the megaplex and major
restaurants. We're not trying to be a tourist attraction but a
place where locals feel comfortable with coming in once a week.''

EDITORIAL: THE VOLATILE ISSUE OF TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   By most measures of civic development, Taiwan has evolved in
recent years into a far more appealing model than mainland China.
Taiwan's politics is now fully democratic, its economy market-based
and thriving and its press free and spirited. But relations between
Taiwan and the mainland remain as tense and explosive as ever, and
each side takes every opportunity to provoke the other. The latest
dispute was set off when Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, abruptly
announced a new definition of Taiwan's status, needlessly angering
Beijing and complicating relations between the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview last weekend, Lee asserted that Taiwan and
China were, at least for now, two separate states. That cast aside
the traditional and usefully ambiguous formula of ``one China.''
That doctrine, adopted by Washington and Beijing when they began
serious diplomatic courtship in 1972, affirms that ``there is but
one China and Taiwan is part of China.'' In practical terms, it
means that Washington has committed itself not to recognize Taiwan
as an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   The merit of this formula is that it allows Taiwan and the
mainland to coexist as separate political entities so long as both
acknowledge a commitment to eventual reunification. Lee has not
only challenged that status quo, but has virtually asserted
Taiwan's independence. As he surely knew it would, his statement
struck a nationalist nerve among mainland Chinese, stirring
sentiments that the Communist leadership there has always been
quick to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   The combustibility of this issue should not be underestimated.
Four years ago tensions increased after Lee exploited a private
visa to attend a Cornell reunion to promote his vision of a more
assertive Taiwan. Beijing, accusing Washington of going back on its
earlier commitments, chilled relations with the United States.
Several months later Beijing conducted missile tests and war games
near Taiwan during the island's 1996 presidential election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing should not make the same mistake of resorting to
military threats. That bullying turned Taiwanese opinion sharply
against the mainland and reunification. Lee, for his part, should
abandon talk of separate states and instead reaffirm Taiwan's
desire for eventual peaceful reunification on terms consistent with
its current freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, meanwhile, should try to stay out of the
public crossfire while counseling restraint to both sides. In
particular, Washington should make sure Lee clearly understands
that while Americans support Taiwan's democracy, the United States
believes the island's future is ill served by needless
confrontations with Beijing.

EDITORIAL: FAMILY PLANNING UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress disgracefully cut off funding to the United
Nations Population Fund, an agency that supports voluntary family
planning services, maternal and child health initiatives, and AIDS
and sexually transmitted disease prevention programs in 150
countries. In April the House International Relations Committee
wisely voted to restore $25 million for the program in 2000. A
House vote on the State Department authorization bill containing
that contribution is expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, however, this worthy program is under attack by
anti-abortion forces. The Population Fund does not provide or pay
for abortion services in any country, and can actually reduce the
need for abortions. Yet Rep. Christopher Smith, a fervent abortion
opponent, is expected to offer an amendment to block funds for the
program. He and others have argued that the United States should
contribute no money to the agency unless it ceases all family
planning activities in China.
</P>
<P>
   This is senseless, because the fund's pilot project in China is
actually designed to end coercive population policies. Under the
program, the Chinese authorities have agreed to abandon quotas like
the one-child policy in 32 areas covered by the pilot project, and
adopt instead new strategies to slow birth rates, such as better
contraception, health care and expanded economic opportunities for
women.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, as a tactical move, the program's supporters have
agreed to deduct any amount the Population Fund spends in China,
which is expected to be $5 million a year, from the $25 million
U.S. contribution. The House now has no excuse for not financing
family planning efforts that can improve the lives of women all
over the world.

   NEW YORK _ The first WNBA All-Star game Wednesday night was not
a contest that gave you so many great plays that your eyes wanted
to pop out. It was just hard basketball, lots of fun and too much
defense. But it satisfied the Madison Square Garden sellout crowd
of 18,649, including many youngsters who took part in the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Conference All-Stars _ who had the more marquee
players _ held off a surging Eastern Conference team, went on one
final spurt and won, 79-61.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a wonderful game, especially since we won,''
West coach Van Chancellor said. ``Our defense was 300 percent
better than I ever dreamed it would be in an all-star game. We were
switching on screens. We looked like we had been working on defense
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   True to the vibe of the league, none of the stars shined too
much. They just blended together, showing their skills when they
got the chance but not forcing it. The game's most valuable player,
Lisa Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks, had 13 points. Utah Starzz
forward Natalie Williams led all scorers with 14 points, eight of
those coming from the foul line. Every player scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel honored to have won this award,'' Leslie said.
``A few players could have received this award, and they chose
me.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the players seemed more concerned with whether
the fans, especially the children, were enjoying the game.
Throughout the game, children were integrated into the festivities.
And even if the play was not stellar, the screaming youths made the
game worthwhile to the players.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty players Vickie Johnson, Kym Hampton and Teresa
Weatherspoon scored eight , five and three points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Heralded rookie Chamique Holdsclaw of the Washington Mystics
left the game midway through the second half with a chip fracture
of her left index finger. Holdsclaw, who had five points, sustained
the injury in the first half while trying to prevent Michele Timms
from stealing a pass from Weatherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball just hit me dead on, on the tip of my finger,''
Holdsclaw said. ``Yeah, it hurts, but I took four painkillers so
it's a little better. The initial prognosis is three weeks to heal,
but I think I'll be playing this Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   From that start, the crowd was teeming with energy and emotion.
Whitney Houston rocked with her rendition of the national anthem.
Celebrities like Tyra Banks, Gregory Hines and Spike Lee, along
with Nets point guard Stephon Marbury and six members of the U.S.
women's soccer team, including Mia Hamm, added to the glamour of
the event.
</P>
<P>
   And the players did their part, too. They raised the roof with
their mock shoulder presses. Some danced a step or two while
waiting to be introduced. But this was more about children's
giddiness than glitz, more about fun than fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   As the starters were introduced, hundreds of children stood at
half court and slapped the hands of the players. Throughout the
timeouts, youngsters dressed as mascots trotted around the court.
The halftime show featured dancing for youths representing their
WNBA teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun,'' said Houston Comets forward Sheryl
Swoopes, who had eight points. ``I think everyone had a good time.
I think we gave the fans exactly what they wanted to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The basketball was shaky at the start. The East seemingly came
out with jitters and the West jumped out to a 17-2 lead. The East
was able to get back into the game from that point, getting as
close as two, at 31-29, by the four-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   But the half still had its thrills. Cynthia Cooper went coast to
coast for layups. Swoopes showed her trademark speed, streaking
down the court for easy scores. Weatherspoon threw no-look passes,
but several East players failed to finish.
</P>
<P>
   A dropped pass here, a missed layup there. A few air balls. That
is how it went.
</P>
<P>
   And uncharacteristic defense, too.
</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After spending 14 years trying to solve the
killing of Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. George Arthur, police
found their prime suspect dead Wednesday in an apparent suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The body of 54-year-old Ted Eugene Kirby was first discovered
Wednesday afternoon by a news reporter and a photographer, a few
blocks away from the Spokane, Wash., home where Kirby moved in 1996
shortly after his retirement from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He was up against a rock outcropping in a pasture, said Deputy
David Reagan, a spokesman for the Spokane County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The body was partially decomposed, indicating Kirby apparently
shot himself to death after learning he was a suspect in the Arthur
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of disappointing,'' said Detective Dennis Kilcoyne
of the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division.
``There are some aspects of this investigation that will now never
be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirby used to work with Arthur at the Men's Central Jail in Los
Angeles, and police said he apparently waited in Arthur's van on
the night of June 1, 1985, before the 14-year sheriff's veteran
left work for his Rancho Cucamonga home.
</P>
<P>
   Though police did not provide specifics on the motive for the
fatal shooting, Kilcoyne said it apparently involved a dispute over
a woman. Kirby was divorced at the time and Arthur, 37, was
separated from his wife, Linda Arthur, then a member of the latent
prints section of the Sheriff's Department's crime lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appeared to be a misunderstanding on Kirby's part about
this, but everyone involved at the time was young and single and
living on their own,'' Kilcoyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after taking off in his van, Arthur was shot several
times, causing the vehicle to crash on a concrete divider on the
Mission Road on-ramp to the eastbound San Bernardino Freeway in
Boyle Heights, Kilcoyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses saw a man crawl from the wreckage and flee.
</P>
<P>
   CHP officials initially thought Arthur died from traffic
collision injuries. It was not until 27 hours later that the
Coroner's Office found Arthur had been shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could not find the suspect, and in the past 14
years, the case was reopened at least twice. The story was even
televised on ``America's Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kirby's name did not come up in the case until about three
weeks ago, Kilcoyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Kilcoyne and sheriff's homicide Detective Mike Bumcrot were
assigned to a team looking at older cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about having fresh eyes look at a case,''
said LAPD Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy.
</P>
<P>
   Kilcoyne said he and Bumcrot went through nine boxes of
materials and evidence as part of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focused on a different direction than prior detectives and
got lucky,'' Kilcoyne said. ``We interviewed people who were close
to Sgt. Arthur and names popped up. We focused on a group that had
closer relations with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilcoyne added there was no indication that Arthur and Kirby had
been friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no indication that Sgt. Arthur did anything to cause
this to happen,'' Kilcoyne said. ``It appeared Mr. Kirby had been
given some wrong information.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had seen Kirby alive the last week of June, when
they got a court order to take a sample of his saliva to test for
DNA. That sample matched evidence at the crime scene 14 years ago,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   But when police returned with an arrest warrant in hand to
Kirby's home July 7, he had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after police left with the sample, Kirby walked away from
his home armed with a handgun and was described by his wife as
being ``depressed and emotional,'' police said.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the police closing in on him, Kirby also been
terminated June 28 from his job as a bag handler for Horizon Air at
Spokane International Airport, where he was employed part time
since August 1997, said Cheryl Temple, a Horizon spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police left his home, suspicions were high that he
was the wanted man, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A red flag went up immediately,'' Kilcoyne said of Kirby's
reaction to the news that detectives were reopening the case and
wanted a saliva sample.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, police had launched a nationwide manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was an NBC-affiliate news crew who discovered
Kirby dead, Reagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McDonald, a photographer, and Gary Darigol, a reporter, had
heard that Kirby had gone into neighboring woods near his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they said, Let's just go back there and check it out,''
Troy McGuire, KHQ-TV's executive producer in Spokane said
Wednesday. ``We weren't expecting that. We were just out looking
around. ... Police said that they were not going out there until a
day later.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police officials received word of Kirby's death as
Chief Bernard C. Parks was holding his monthly media briefing at
Parker Center.

EDITORIAL: WHEN A CRASH CAN BE A CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   The filing of state charges of third-degree murder and
manslaughter against the aircraft maintenance company Sabretech for
110 deaths in the 1996 ValuJet crash is highly unusual, and
probably not appropriate in most plane crash cases. Criminal
prosecutions in this context may deter airlines and maintenance
crews from fully cooperating in future accident investigations. But
if there is clear evidence that the accident was caused by gross
negligence that rises to criminal conduct, prosecution may be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board found that the ValuJet
crash was probably caused by Sabretech's failure to properly secure
and label oxygen generators that caused a fire in the cargo hold.
But the NTSB also blamed ValuJet and the Federal Aviation
Administration for inadequate oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida prosecutors have singled out Sabretech, concluding
that the actions of the other parties did not rise to criminal
culpability. Sabretech is charged with violating state law in
transporting the generators that caught fire. The felony murder
charges rest on the fact that the deaths were directly caused by
the illegal transportation of hazardous material. The manslaughter
counts are based on criminal negligence. Neither felony murder nor
manslaughter under Florida law requires proof of intent to kill. No
employee or officer of Sabretech, whose assets have been sold, was
charged with the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But three individuals have been indicted by federal prosecutors
for conspiracy to make false statements to the FAA, falsifying
records about the generators and violating federal regulations on
the handling of dangerous materials. They would be subject to fines
and prison sentences if found guilty of those Federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The state prosecutors evidently believe they can prove the
deaths were due to criminal conduct, not merely mistakes that can
lead to tragic results. They face a heavy burden of proof, but in
instances where there may be criminal negligence that costs lives,
prosecutors should bring the case to court.

AN INJURED HOLDSCLAW HAS TO SIT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chamique Holdsclaw, whose shoulders have been chosen
to carry the future of women's professional basketball, sat on the
bench for most of the second half of Wednesday night's inaugural
WNB A All-Star game. She was the victim of the game's only injury.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, who finished with five points in 11 minutes, left the
game with a chip fracture of her left index finger. She suffered
the injury early in the game while trying to stop Michele Timms
from stealing a pass. Holdsclaw said the finger was not expected to
fully heal for three weeks, but she hoped to play on Saturday when
her Washington Mystics face the Charlotte Sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball just hit me dead on, on the tip of my finger,'' said
Holdsclaw, whose East team lost to the West, 79-61, at Madison
Square Garden. ``Yeah, it hurts, but I took four pain-killers, so
it's a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury spoiled an all-star homecoming for the Queens native,
who starred at Christ the King High School before attending the
University of Tennessee. Holdsclaw said before the game that she
did not need the game to validate her superstar potential. But she
was disappointed that she got injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to compete, you want to have fun, you want your team
to win,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I got hurt, my team lost, so I'm a
little upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, whose 18.7 points per game are fourth in the WNBA,
shied away this week from directly responding to criticism that she
is getting too much publicity. Sheryl Swoopes of the Houston Comets
recently said that she thought Holdsclaw's hype was overshadowing
some of the league's other stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is one of the finest players in the game,'' the Eastern
Conference coach, Linda Hill-MacDonald of the Cleveland Rockers,
said about Holdsclaw. ``I think she has lived up to everything she
has been billed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But to prove that point emphatically, Holdsclaw will have to
wait.

 GAMEWORKS FLAGSHIP MAY ANCHOR IN L.A.'S VALLEY  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sega GameWorks, the ambitious chain of nearly two
dozen arcade-nightclubs backed by Steven Spielberg, is actively
considering building its prime site in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would definitely like to have a flagship site in a place
like Sherman Oaks or West Los Angeles,'' Bruce Fabel, chief
operating officer at the 3-year-old venture, said during a recent
interview. ``We are actively looking for real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive's comment indicates GameWorks is likely to take a
long look at the legendary Sherman Oaks Galleria, which would give
GameWorks high visibility at a well-known location. It could take
at least a year for such a site to open at the mall, about five
miles to the east of GameWorks headquarters on the Universal
Studios lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing solid yet in terms of real estate decisions,''
GameWorks spokeswoman Melissa Schumer said Wednesday. ``At this
point, we see Sherman Oaks and West Los Angeles as viable areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The mall, made famous through Frank and Moon Unit Zappa's song
``Valley Girl'' and its use in the film ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High,'' has been mostly vacant for several months due to extensive
remodeling in its interior. Galleria owner Douglas Emmett &AMP; Co. has
said it expects the revamping to be finished around October 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision by GameWorks _ a joint project of Universal
Studios, Sega and Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG _ would underscore its
commitment to stick with the still-evolving concept of
location-based entertainment. The basic idea is to lure
free-spending adults to a high-tech combination of a three-ring
circus of interactive games, food, flashing lights and computer
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The original concept, launched in Seattle in March 1997, was
designed to attract teen-agers and young adults who wanted more
than video games and would pay for ``play cards'' that could be
used throughout the multilevel facility. The idea was to attract
kids during the day and adults at night and the first locations
were designed to blend the casual feel of a Hollywood studio back
lot with an array of casual-eating options and hundreds of video
games.
</P>
<P>
   The signature attractions at GameWorks include a half-dozen
Zones, such as the Racing Zone, the Carnival Zone and Sports Zone
with one-of-a-kind games such as Two Minute Drill, Wave Runner,
Extreme Powerboat and the Spielberg-designed Vertical Reality game
in which players strap on harnesses and raise and lower themselves
along a 24-foot-high wall in a race against the clock to rid a
skyscraper of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to serve as an anchor at a retail center and a lure
for free-spending young adults as a hangout. GameWorks has remained
on the outskirts of the action in Southern California's suburbs
thus far, opening outlets in Irvine, Ontario and Orange.
</P>
<P>
   GameWorks is pushing ahead despite competition from the Dave and
Buster's restaurant chain for adults and Walt Disney Co.'s
DisneyQuest interactive play parks, now open in Chicago and
Orlando, Fla. It will open at least three more GameWorks facilities
next year and will expand the Irvine location from its GameWorks
Studio format to a full-size site.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give mixed grades so far to the GameWorks concept,
which also has opened in Detroit; Miami; Tempe, Ariz.; Las Vegas;
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Chicago; Guam and Grapevine, Texas. Their
major criticism is that the sites are unlikely to attract more
customers than teen-age boys and young adult males.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to shift their appeal to something that's more
attractive to other demographics,'' said entertainment analyst
Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners. ``The family
demographic is not going be attracted by multilevel bars. GameWorks
had a very clear goal originally to attract a family-oriented
demographic by re-creating the Hollywood back lot experience in an
enclosed retail environment but it wasn't executed effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Theme park consultant Dennis Speigel said Spielberg's name
elevates the concept, but he added that insiders haven't been
overly impressed so far with the locations.
</P>
<P>
   GameWorks says more than 15 million people have attended its
dozen full-size sites, most of which occupy more than 30,000 square
feet and its 10 smaller GameWorks Studio sites. It also has been
fine-tuning the concept with the more recent locations by shifting
its appeal more toward adults, particularly females, rather than
teen-age boys, according to Fabel.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 18 months ago, we did a tremendous amount of exit
surveys and guest research and what we found was that adults were
looking for places to go after hours,'' said Fabel. ``We've been
focusing on softening the design to cater towards women so it no
longer has a technical hard feel, but more of a Hollywood feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That's meant adding bar areas on both levels, making the play
Zones more distinct and offering a sit-down grill-style restaurant
much like Houston's or The Cheesecake Factory, Fabel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restaurants are not just selling just onion rings and
fries,'' he added. ``We're now offering things like linguine with
shrimp sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   There will continue to be variety from site to site since
GameWorks wants each location to complement the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to make concept fit the location,'' Fabel said.
``We're definitely hitting targets as being hometown entertainment
choice in terms of competing with the megaplex and major
restaurants. We're not trying to be a tourist attraction but a
place where locals feel comfortable with coming in once a week.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Because of her mom, 2-year-old Abigail Merritt's six
days of misery may help other children avoid her fate: being
poisoned by packaged unpasteurized fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   Regulatory wheels are grinding because the tot, her sister
Isabella, 4, and their mother, Karen Wolf, shared a fruit
``smoothie'' made with contaminated orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   They slurped it at a World Wrapps restaurant in Seattle on June
18. A few days later, Abigail developed severe diarrhea _ becoming
one of least 36 local cases of salmonella poisoning traced to Sun
Orchard orange juice. With medical care, the youngster recovered
from the potentially fatal illness after nearly a week of pain,
lack of appetite and listlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The day Abigail recovered, Wolf got busy. A senior policy
analyst for King County, she e-mailed her boss, County Executive
Ron Sims, and Dr. Alonzo Plough, the Seattle-King County health
director, urging them to ask the county Board of Health to ban the
sale of unpasteurized, commercially prepared fruit juice in the
county.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Sims said he will do just that when the board meets
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the board agrees, King County may be the nation's first state
or local government to impose such a ban, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In her e-mail, Wolf, a vegetarian and avid natural-foods
consumer, wrote: ``I know people will be upset that they can't get
`fresh-squeezed' orange juice, but if they saw how sick my little
girl was, I think they would reconsider their opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims said he prefers a ban, but might consider a warning label
on commercially produced, unpasteurized fruit juices that would be
stricter than now required by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said the action is justified because last month's salmonella
epidemic was the second local food poisoning outbreak in three
years involving unpasteurized, prepackaged fruit juice. An outbreak
of E. coli poisoning in 1996 was traced to Odwalla apple juice.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scare may make unpasteurized juice harder to find in
stores and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Pettinger, vice president of World Wrapps Northwest, said
his company stopped using unpasteurized juice the day it learned
some of the salmonella cases had been traced to its outlets.
</P>
<P>
   He said World Wrapps now uses only pasteurized products, and its
supplier no longer carries unpasteurized orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Of Sims' proposed ban, Pettinger said, ``If that's going to
ensure the food safety for all of us, I think it's a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, the health department's director of
communicable disease control and epidemiology, said consumers don't
always know if the juice they buy is unpasteurized.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA requires commercially produced, unpasteurized fruit
juices to be labeled as such. But it has granted a temporary
exemption to the labeling requirement for citrus juice producers
who achieve a 100,000-fold reduction in pathogens using alternative
technologies instead of pasteurization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big bugaboo with fresh-squeezed juice is that the
establishment selling the juice doesn't know for sure whether the
juice has been pasteurized or not unless it's been labeled, so the
consumer is really in the dark,'' Duchin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of restaurants that advertise `fresh-squeezed' orange
juice may not be the ones that squeezed it,'' Duchin said. ``It may
have been `fresh-squeezed' a thousand miles away a couple of days
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current salmonella outbreak, health authorities have
identified more than 200 cases in 14 states and two Canadian
provinces. Duchin said nearly all the cases have been traced to
unpasteurized orange juice from Sun Orchards, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe, Ariz., company has recalled all of its
non-pasteurized orange juice, which was sold to hundreds of
restaurants, including World Wrapps. A class-action lawsuit seeking
unspecified damages from Sun Orchards has been filed in King County
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Requests to Sun Orchards for comment went unanswered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said Wednesday she's gratified that some good might come of
the pain her daughter suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told my husband, I wanted to focus my energies on getting
legislation through,'' she said.

STARS TO OPEN AGAINST PENGUINS ON OCT. 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stars will share the spotlight with Wayne Gretzky on opening
night next season, NHL officials announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars plan to raise their Stanley Cup banner on Oct. 1 at
Reunion Arena before a national television audience on ESPN, when
they play host to the Pittsburgh Penguins and Jaromir Jagr in a
6:30 p.m. game. The only other game scheduled opening night is the
Edmonton Oilers at the New York Rangers in which Wayne Gretzky will
be officially honored for his retirement after 20 years in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the NHL season has been moved ahead one week to
help the playoffs begin earlier. The league also has added the
Atlanta Thrashers to the schedule. That means the Stars will play
only once against the Penguins, Buffalo Sabres, Boston Bruins,
Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, and Toronto Maple Leafs to
accommodate the expansion team and an adjusted schedule that offers
extra games against the Chicago Blackhawks and Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are scheduled to play 24 games against their Pacific
Division rivals _ six apiece against the Los Angeles Kings, Phoenix
Coyotes, Anaheim Mighty Ducks and San Jose Sharks. They will play
34 games against the other Western Conference teams (four apiece,
except five against Flames and Blackhawks). And they will play 24
times against Eastern Conference teams, twice against nine teams
and once against six others.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are scheduled to play on New Year's Eve at home and
have a day game scheduled the day after Thanksgiving (Nov. 26 vs.
the Mighty Ducks). They will play eight day games and have 21 of
their home dates scheduled for Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will play eight of their first 13 games at home and
five of their final seven on the road. In between, their longest
scheduled home stand is six games from Dec. 29 to Jan. 7 and their
longest road trip will be Jan. 11 to Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars should have a stout preseason schedule, getting two
games apiece against the Detroit Red Wings, Colorado Avalanche, St.
Louis Blues and the Blackhawks and one game against the Coyotes.
The Red Wings, Avalanche and Blues each made it to the Western
Conference semifinals.  &LR; subheds:Marshall to file Pat Morris, the
agent for Stars winger Grant Marshall, said Marshall will file for
arbitration rights today. However, Morris said that does not mean
he and the Stars will stop negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one step, one option,'' Morris said. ``You can
sign a deal even during arbitration.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who made $400,000 last season, is hoping for a big
raise after posting career highs of 13 goals and 31 points. Today
is the last day for free agents who have arbitration rights to file
for arbitration. Cases will be scheduled for later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk, who also can file for
arbitration, is not expected to exercise his right. Because
Matvichuk had only 12 points during the 1998-99 season, he has
little ammunition for getting a good arbitration settlement. If
Matvichuk and the Stars cannot come to terms on a new contract,
Matvichuk's best strategy is a holdout. \Ntagtop:Mike Heika, (817)

SPORTS COLUMN: A LEAGUE IN SEARCH OF A MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At midday Wednesday Angela Alfaro was on 33rd Street,
outside Madison Square Garden, contemplating an imposing 7-foot
rim. This was at the Slam Dunk exhibit, one of 12 set up by the
WNBA as a prelude to its inaugural All-Star game Wednesday night,
won by the West, 79-61.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 3-point arc. A consecutive foul-shot challenge. An
obstacle course. But the slam dunk booth, with baskets ranging in
height from 7 to 9 feet, drew the most persistent attention. This
was an intense laboratory of bravado and experimentation. While
male counterparts attempted dunks at a 9-foot rim _ mostly without
success _ the 15-year-old Alfaro readied herself, steadied herself,
measured her steps. Run. Lift. Bam! A dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Could she do it again? Of course. Alfaro measured her steps,
sprinted, rose: Bam.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Katz, who works in the NBA's marketing office, worked the
7-foot basket all day and made his own observations about the
culture of dunking. ``During the course of the day, I sort of
tempted the girls to try,'' Katz said. ``At first they were
tentative. A lot of them wouldn't even try, they just took shots.
After they tried it, they got into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anastasia Chin, of average height for an 11-year-old, walked
over to the 7-foot rim and measured her steps. Deep breath, run,
rise. Oops. Try again. And again. On her fifth attempt, Anastasia
finally dunked one. She raised her arms in triumph and slapped
palms with her teammates on the 13-and-under New York Angels. ``I'd
like to see more women dunk,'' she said. ``The dunk would turn up
the game a little more, put more excitement in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tired of people saying what we can't do. Like in soccer,
they said women can't do this, women can't do that. Women proved
that they can do anything if they put their minds to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has dunked during a WNBA game, and nobody dunked
Wednesday night, either, although Lisa Leslie, the West's
6-foot-5-inch center, dunked during warm-ups. But the moment was
lost in the midst of all the excitement. ``I was surprised nobody
noticed,'' Leslie said. ``Everybody's been asking me to dunk. When
I do it, nobody notices.''
</P>
<P>
   On a fast break during the game, Leslie threw the last pass to
Yolanda Griffith for the basket. ``If Yolanda and I would have
switched places on the break, I could have dunked it,'' Leslie
said.
</P>
<P>
   As women's basketball fights for a toehold in the United States,
some players still react defensively to any suggestion that the
women's game is lacking simply because they do not dunk. ``Men rely
more on their physical talents, women rely more on the technical
game,'' Cynthia Cooper of the Houston Comets, the league's two-time
most valuable player, said Wednesday. ``But it's still
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and officials in the women's game too often dismiss the
dunk as ``a man's thing,'' the way critics once dismissed it as ``a
black thing.'' Of course, the dunk is no such thing. The dunk
belongs to no race or gender; it has become an intrinsic part of a
global game.
</P>
<P>
   And believe this: the first woman who consistently ``throws it
down,'' who consistently terrifies the opposition with her ability
to thunder dunk at crucial points of a game, will become the WNBA's
first icon. This might chase away some purists who see the WNBA as
more of a movement than a pro sports league. But they'll be
replaced by hard-core fans, eager to see the game played by women
at its highest level.
</P>
<P>
   All Anastasia Chin knows is that she has seen the dunk and she
wants to dunk, too. As the novelty of a women's pro league wears
off, the WNBA must soar to the next level. Dismissing what one
cannot do argues for limitations, and isn't removing limitations
what the WNBA is supposed to be about?
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, I was part of a group riveted by the Women's
World Cup championship game. Finally the moment of truth arrived:
the shootout. Goals had been impossible to come by; now, at
point-blank range, the goals seemingly came as easy as pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the third Chinese kicker made her attempt, the
commentator said something about women goalkeepers lacking the
athleticism of men to make the great play. No sooner had the words
been spoken than Briana Scurry, the U. S. goalkeeper, darted to her
left and used instinct, reflexes and ``athleticism'' to make an
incredible save. That save may have been the defining moment of
women's soccer in the United States. A barrier was scraped away,
one more layer of cannot-do removed.
</P>
<P>
   The women's soccer team found its moment. You get the sense that
the women in the WNBA are still looking for theirs.

DODGERS, ANGELS NEED A KICK START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Listen to the players from both teams talk and the
three-game series between the Dodgers and Angels that begins
tonight at Edison Field holds no greater meaning than any other
series.
</P>
<P>
   But the standings say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   A fast start to the second half of the season is of utmost
importance to both teams, considering the mountain each has to
climb.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who will start Kevin Brown tonight, are in last
place in the NL West, 10 games out and eight games under .500. The
Angels, who start Chuck Finley, are in last place in the AL West,
6{ games out and four games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both teams went into the break playing well _ the Dodgers
won their last four and the Angels won four of five. To sweep the
series could propel one team into the race; to be swept could leave
the other reeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just winning, plain and simple (is important),'' Dodgers first
baseman Eric Karros said. ``We need one-game winning streaks . . .
about 20 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning one game, one night at a time is a lot more
attainable. This game is so mental, when you win a few games,
things continue to happen. Once you start to do that, everyone
starts to believe in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins said he'd rather not play the
Dodgers to start the second half. And it's not because the Dodgers
won two of three earlier this season when the two teams met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather we were playing teams from our own league, teams we
were familiar with,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won nine in a 15-game stretch against their AL West
counterparts before taking two of three from the Rockies heading
into the break. Collins wants his team to focus on the task at hand
and not be distracted by outside forces.
</P>
<P>
   Such as?
</P>
<P>
   Such as Chan Ho Park, who will start Saturday's game for the
Dodgers. Collins said he didn't expect Park, who angered Angels
players by kicking pitcher Tim Belcher in a fight last month, to
pitch in the series before learning otherwise: ``Really?'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there is more talk about reviving their seasons
than creating a crosstown rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to play with confidence, play like we have been
playing,'' Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``It's getting
there. We're getting there. I'm excited about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching a mediocre team like the Padres win 14 in a row has
given the Dodgers reason to believe they can get back into it. But
they admit it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the question goes, does success breed confidence or does
confidence breed success?'' Karros asked. ``I believe success
breeds confidence. The Padres believed they could win every single
game.''

DEMOCRATS PAINT BULL'S EYE ON KYL'S SEN ATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   National Democrats have painted a bull's eye on the back of Sen.
Jon Kyl, calling Arizona's junior senator the ``most vulnerable
Republican incumbent'' in the nation next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee released a poll
Wednesday that shows Kyl with a 39 percent favorable rating,
compared with 42 percent for President Clinton, 65 percent for Gov.
Jane Hull and 67 percent for Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly countered that Democrats, desperate for a
candidate, are using the poll to scare up a high-profile challenger
to Kyl, a charge that Democrats don't dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The poll is evidence that the Democratic Party is prepared to
make a serious push for a Senate seat in Arizona, if they can find
the right candidate. That effort would include an infusion of
campaign cash that would be needed to offset Kyl's huge
fund-raising advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The last Democratic U.S. senator from Arizona was Dennis
DeConcini, who retired from political office in 1995 and whose seat
Kyl won.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kyl) is vulnerable because he's been a non-entity in the
Senate,'' said Jim Jordan, the political director for the group
that coordinates Democratic Senate campaigns from Washington.
Jordan said Democratic polling shows that Kyl's poll numbers are
the worst of any GOP Senate incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poll confirms what we suspected: that Sen. Kyl has made no
impact in Washington or on his constituents in Arizona,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl was elected to his first term in 1994, the year of the
Republican congressional landslide that enabled the GOP to take
control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in
nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans defended Kyl, saying that the Democratic poll was
biased. State GOP Chairman Mike Minnaugh said Kyl already has
raised $1.4 million, giving the incumbent a daunting lead in the
campaign race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very strong,'' Minnaugh said, noting that the
Washington-based Cook Political Report lists Kyl's seat as
``solid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he has been in the shadow of Senator (John)
McCain,'' Minnaugh said. ``But Jon's record is solid in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl could not be reached for comment. However, his regional
director for southern Arizona, Hank Kenski, ripped the poll: ``This
is a standard poll that parties conduct when they're trying to come
up with opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenski said his boss's poll numbers are reasonable but could be
better.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University pollster Bruce Merrill also disputed
the Democrats' contention that Kyl is in trouble. Merrill's May 27
poll showed Kyl with a 42 percent positive rating and a 20 percent
negative rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic poll of 500 Arizona voters, taken from June 29 to
July 1, found Kyl with a 17 percent negative rating. The poll had a
margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. The survey found that 30
percent of those questioned would vote to re-elect Kyl.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said the fact that the Democratic poll was conducted by
random dialing, and not necessarily of registered voters, may have
skewed the sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of running someone against him, I would say he's not
very vulnerable,'' Merrill said. ``It's going to take someone with
a name, someone with a ton of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats still haven't come up with a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranking elected Arizona Democrat, Attorney General
Janet Napolitano, has no interest in the race, a spokeswoman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party Chairman Mark Fleisher says he's trying
to convince Terry Goddard, the former Phoenix mayor and two-time
gubernatorial nominee, to run.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard, who now works for Department of Housing and Urban
Development in Phoenix, declined to comment, citing his federal
job.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said he asked others to encourage Hattie Babbitt,
acting director of the Agency for International Development, to
consider the race. Babbitt is the wife of Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, who served as Arizona governor from 1978 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does not seem real interested in running,'' Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely Democratic candidate so far appears to be Dan
Salcito, an attorney and rancher who spilts time between Scottsdale
and Skull Valley. Salcito said Wednesday that the Democrats asked
him to run and that he was considering the race. If he runs, he
will spend personal wealth on the campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Arizonans know who the state's second senator
is,'' Salcito said. &QL;

NEW, LESS EXPENSIVE DRUG FOUND TO CUT HIV RISK IN INFANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A less expensive drug that prevents transmission of
HIV from infected mothers to their newborns could keep about 1,000
babies a day from being born with the virus that causes AIDS,
according to researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, nevirapine, is somewhat less effective than AZT, the
drug widely used in the United States to prevent transmission from
mother to child, but costs only $3 per dose compared with $1,000 to
$2,000 for a course of AZT.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, nevirapine is only administered once to the mother
during labor and once to the infant shortly after birth _ while AZT
is part of a long course of prenatal therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug could become a standard of care for HIV-infected
women giving birth in developing countries, preventing spread of
the infection, said Dr. Thomas Fleming, lead statistician for the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, we've not been able to meaningfully reduce the risk
(of transmission) in countries where risk is the highest,'' he
said. ``Now we think we have a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, who is chairman of the Department of Biostatistics at
the University of Washington School of Public Health and Community
Medicine, is also a biostatistician for the Hutchinson Center's
Public Health Sciences Division.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was conducted in Uganda, was done in
collaboration with researchers at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,800 HIV-infected babies are born each day in
developing countries, Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   The study results, based on the study of 618 women, are being
heralded as a major public health advance for prevention of HIV
infections in infants.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shahala called the
study results ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American scientists along with our international partners are
committed to developing treatments that not only work, but that are
also feasible in other health care settings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, most pregnant women with the human
immunodeficiency virus are treated with a course of AZT, a powerful
antiretroviral drug. The treatment reduces transmission by between
70 percent and 80 percent, Fleming said. But the treatment requires
extensive prenatal care, which is not available in many parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, researchers in Uganda found that giving one oral
dose of nevirapine during labor and one follow-up dose to the
infant within three days of birth, reduced transmission of HIV by
about 50 percent. The treatment costs about $3 for the mother and
11 cents for the infant.
</P>
<P>
   With little treatment available, most HIV-infected infants in
developing countries die within two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the study was to find a safe, simple, effective way
to prevent babies from being born with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30 percent of women in the urban areas of
sub-Saharan countries, such as Uganda, are infected with HIV, said
Fleming. The majority of those women receive no treatment for HIV,
and about one-third of infected women pass the virus to their
babies, either in utero or through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study represents the most promising advance to date
toward the goal of finding strategies that can be used worldwide to
prevent the spread of HIV from HIV-infected mothers to their
infants,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which funded the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo-Wellcome, which manufactures AZT, and Boehringer-Ingelheim
Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures nevirapine, provided drugs for
the study.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the study was designed to use a placebo control
group, but the placebo was dropped after data showed a shorter
course of AZT also reduced transmission of the virus. The
redesigned study tested nevirapine against a short course of AZT.
</P>
<P>
   ``This research provides real hope that we may be able to
protect many of Africa's next generation from the ravages of
AIDS,'' Crispus Kiyonga, Uganda's Minister of Health, said in an
announcement in Kampala Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the study showed the risk of transmission could be cut at
birth, the babies of infected mothers are still at risk of
acquiring the virus through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   More research is under way to determine whether continued doses
of nevirapine through the breast-feeding period can cut the risk of
transmission even more, Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, scientists are looking at whether nevirapine should
be added to the AZT treatment currently used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Uganda, women were anxious to participate in the study, said
Lynda Emel, protocol operations coordinator for HIVNET, the
federally funded program based at the Hutchinson Center that helped
coordinate the study. Emel helped set up the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the mothers who know they're HIV-infected would do
anything possible to prevent transmission to their babies,'' she
said.

SECOND CHANCE FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Trying to determine the defining moment of the Angels'
rocky first half isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been:
</P>
<P>
   _Shortstop Gary DiSarcina suffering a broken bone in his forearm
after getting hit by coach George Hendrick's fungo on Feb. 21, even
before position players were scheduled to report to spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   _Mo Vaughn falling into the dugout on opening night and severely
spraining his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   _Jim Edmonds suddenly deciding to have shoulder surgery _ after
the season had already started.
</P>
<P>
   _Tim Salmon injuring his wrist while trying to make a sliding
catch at Edison Field on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   _Manager Terry Collins and general manager Bill Bavasi finding
themselves in the middle of a player revolt regarding Collins'
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a moment; it doesn't seem to matter. All the Angels know is
it's always something.
</P>
<P>
   This season seems to be worse than normal. They invested $80
million in Vaughn, an obvious statement by Disney that winning _
not just competing _ is important.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn brought a winning attitude to the clubhouse, but his
message has fallen on deaf ears at times this season. He held a
players-only meeting once this year that ``didn't go over too
well,'' according to a source.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Vaughn has decided the best way to go about dealing
with his teammates is to do it one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the meeting didn't go over well could be that Vaughn
has not been able to lead by example. The ankle injury forced him
out for 14 games and into the DH slot for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern California hasn't seen the real Mo Vaughn yet,''
Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   While Southern California waits for Vaughn, the Angels are
waiting to catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should have to go through what we went through,''
Collins said. ``All we can do is look to tomorrow. There are no
guarantees in this game. We can't worry about the last two months,
only the next two months.''
</P>
<P>
   There is reason for optimism as the Angels enter the second half
only 6{ games behind the AL West-leading Texas Rangers. And they're
expecting their injured players to return.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon and Edmonds are hoping to be ready by the first week in
August. And if they can make the impact DiSarcina has made, the
Angels are in for a good second half. Since DiSarcina returned June
22, the Angels are 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I think I can bring to the club,'' Salmon said, ``I
am not a savior. I've still got to find my swing. But the bottom
line is having me in the lineup relieves some pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Angels even have a second half to look forward to is a
credit to their resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have played well through all that stuff,'' Vaughn said.
``We put ourselves in position to get people back and make a run by
staying close. We'll definitely make a solid run. We've got a
chance to make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And Vaughn wants to lead the way. He's hitting .287 with a
team-leading 17 homers and 55 RBI. But people expect more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a presence in the clubhouse, but the worst part is
everybody's expecting him to take somebody and make him a better
player,'' Collins said. ``That doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little unfair to judge him halfway. He came with so
much hype, so much expected of him, and he knew it. But he's the
real deal. He does everything a great player is asked to do, and he
does more than he's asked. And he's playing hurt more than he'll
ever let on.''

DODGERS' MALONE STILL A BELIEVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Through the heartache of the first three months of
the season, general manager Kevin Malone had a glimmer of hope that
the Dodgers would turn their season around.
</P>
<P>
   It was dim, but it was there. Malone still talks of a long road
to recovery for the Dodgers, but winning the final four games
before the All-Star break has added brightness.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dodgers open the second half of the season with the first
of three games at Anaheim tonight, they will do so with a tangible
optimism absent the last two months. The Dodgers are looking for
their first five-game winning streak since April 27 to May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're optimistic,'' Malone said. ``We showed signs of what
this team is capable of doing in holding a powerful Seattle team
down. It shows we're capable of beating a good team like that.
We're moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (39-47) entered the break 10 games behind
front-running San Francisco, but also on a four-game winning
streak. They did it by shutting down a Seattle club that led the
league in homers. The Mariners managed only four runs in the
three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson is hoping that's the beginning to a better
understanding from the reluctant Dodgers, who haven't exactly
conformed to Johnson's methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy for a talented group of individuals to accept
maybe a different system,'' Johnson said. ``Sometimes things I do
can be misconstrued in their eyes because a different manager did
it a different way. But I have no hidden agendas. I just want to
win games. I've never won a division or a pennant without a team
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna return delayed: The Dodgers spoke last week of
right-hander Antonio Osuna returning for today's series opener
against the Angels, but that's changed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said even though Osuna remains on schedule (he was to
pitch for Single-A San Bernardino on Wednesday), a more realistic
return date would be after the Dodgers return from Pittsburgh on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His velocity was at 92, but it fell back to 88, 89,'' Johnson
said. ``We want to see if he can stay in the 90s.''
</P>
<P>
   There's other reasons the Dodgers aren't eager to activate
Osuna. They don't want to bring him back too soon only to have him
re-aggravate his pitching elbow, from which he had a bone spur
removed in May. Also, the Dodgers bullpen hasn't been a problem. If
he's activated, the Dodgers will have to ship someone out.
</P>
<P>
   F.Y.I.: There was talk a few months back that the Dodgers would
put in a bid to host the 2002 All-Star Game, but they decided not
to waste the time, energy or money to explore the option. Dodgers
president and CEO Bob Graziano said he spoke with officials in the
National League office who told him it would be fruitless to bid on
the game because the new ballparks are in line to host. . . . There
is still no word on possible suspensions for Sunday's brawl in
which Dodgers Todd Hundley, Pedro Borbon and coach Rick Dempsey
were ejected.

HOUSE NARROWLY DEFEATS INCREASE IN MONEY FOR ARTS AND HUMANITIES
ENDOWMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: RECASTS with votes, details) (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Wednesday night narrowly defeated a
move to increase spending on the National Endowment for the Arts
and the National Endowment for the Humanities, whose budgets have
been cut and then frozen for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as the House debated after midnight a $14 billion
Interior Department spending bill. The bill passed, 377-47, after
conservatives forced across-the-board spending cuts and froze funds
for endowments of the arts and humanities at $98 million and $110.7
million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   By a 217-207 vote, the House rejected an amendment to increase
spending on the arts and humanities endowments by $10 million
apiece. Twenty-nine Democrats provided the margin of defeat,
joining 188 Republicans opposing the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a luxury, let's face it,'' Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla.
said of the federal support for arts and humanities. ``Many of us
question whether it should even exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said Congress had declared ``a war
on culture'' ever since Republicans took control of Congress in
1994. ``I'm embarrassed for this House of Representatives,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides about $7 billion for the Interior Department,
more than $4 billion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the
Indian Health Service, $1.4 billion for national parks and about
$580 million for cultural heavyweights like the Smithsonian
Institution and the National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which had already cut $1.2 billion from the White
House's budget request for the Interior bill, trimmed $140 million
more on Wednesday at the instigation of the Republicans' staunchest
fiscal conservatives, who want to freeze or cut money for all
federal agencies this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David R. Obey of Wis., the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, denounced them as ``a hard core of
right-wing militants'' who ``detest government'' and are engaging
in political power plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a game,'' the leader of fiscal conservatives, Rep.
Tom Coburn, R-Okla., calmly responded. He has largely succeeded in
his threats to delay or derail all spending bills in the House this
year unless the Republican leadership bowed to his demands for
domestic spending cuts that, to date, total nearly $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The House also voted, 273-151, for an amendment that would
stymie a controversial Senate measure favoring mining companies.
</P>
<P>
   The issue pits environmentalists against miners. The Senate
wants to overturn a five-acre limit for mine waste sites on federal
land. The House amendment would block funds for processing mining
companies' applications for dumps bigger than five acres.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the Senate measure say Interior Department lawyers
enforcing the limit threaten the mining industry. Opponents say the
Senate's bill would allow mining companies to dump thousands of
tons of cyanide-tainted waste freely on public land.
</P>
<P>
   The House also rejected, by voice vote, an amendment blocking
the Forest Service from charging fees to hikers, boaters and others
using national parks and forests. The fees pay for maintenance and
improvements. Opponents call them a tax on a pleasure that once was
free.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A Superior Court judge set bail at $1 million
Wednesday for ex-Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah
as prosecutors detailed evidence of her alleged plot to blow up two
Los Angeles police cars 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah's three teen-age daughters broke down in tears as she was
led from the courtroom back to jail after bail was set. One cried,
``Bye, Mommy.'' Her husband, Dr. Fred Peterson, an emergency room
physician, sat with the girls in the front row of the courtroom and
visited with Soliah at the noon break.
</P>
<P>
   Eight friends from Minnesota came for the hearing. One, Stephen
Yanisch, said they hope bail will be reduced for the woman who grew
up in the Antelope Valley and has lived in Minneapolis for more
than 20 years as Sara Jane Olson, a suburban wife and mother who
attended church regularly and acted in the local theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge was in a tough situation, so I'm hoping we can get
the bail reduced through appeals,'' Yanisch said. ``For people of
ordinary means, raising $1 million is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Soliah appeared in court for the first time on 1976 charges
that, the previous year, she helped plant pipe bombs under two Los
Angeles Police Department cars.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Larry Fidler called such a crime ``particularly
abhorrent.'' He said a bomb ``is the terrorist's weapon of choice
and has no discretion,'' often harming innocent bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   But he made it clear during the four-hour hearing that the case
against Soliah is far from strong. ``The evidence in this case is
circumstantial, and that is certainly acceptable, but it's not
overwhelming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors conceded they only have a circumstantial case
against the 52-year-old Soliah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a strong case, but it is not a weak case,'' said
Deputy District Attorney Michael A. Latin.
</P>
<P>
   He said bomb-making materials were found in an apartment Soliah
had been sharing in San Francisco at the time two large pipe bombs
were placed under police cruisers Aug. 21, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Steel nails packed into the bombs and wiring used to trigger
them were identical to nails and wires found in a closet at the
apartment, Latin said. Investigators also found empty holders for
magnets, manufactured in England, of the same size and make as
those used in the bomb triggers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a bomb found in the closet was very similar to those
under the police cars; one bomb malfunctioned and the other was
found later in an emergency search.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah's fingerprints were on a map of Los Angeles that police
found in the car she and an accomplice allegedly used in the plot,
Latin said.
</P>
<P>
   She was charged in February 1976 with conspiracy to commit
murder and multiple counts of possessing bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorneys called the case against Soliah ``beyond
weak,'' as one worded it. ``She did not attempt to kill Los Angeles
police officers,'' defense lawyer Stuart Hanlon of San Francisco
said after the hearing. ``She will be acquitted if this goes to
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Susan Jordan of Oakland said the person who
named Soliah as the prime suspect and who identified the car
allegedly used in a bomb plot was fellow SLA member Patricia
Campbell Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, a newspaper heiress who was kidnapped by the group but
later joined it, made those claims immediately after she was
convicted of bank robbery in federal court and began cooperating
with the FBI, said Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has never been relied on as a witness in court _ and
won't likely be called in this case _ because of severe credibility
problems, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Court records filed by the defense contend that John Marshall,
the only witness who could directly link Soliah to the bomb plots,
has died.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah is due back in court Tuesday for her attorneys to explain
how bail would be posted and who would monitor compliance with the
judge's order that she wear an electronic monitoring device if
released.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors wanted Soliah held without bail. Defense attorneys
hoped to get bail set at $250,000, an amount supporters already
have raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her life is with her children and her husband and also with
those of us in the community,'' said James M. Johnson, a retired
civil engineer who was among supporters who came from Minnesota to
attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow member of Minnehaha United Methodist Church in
Minneapolis, he said she has been a tireless volunteer teaching
English and citizenship skills to immigrants, working on blood
drives and helping the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson echoed other witnesses who testified Wednesday that
Soliah would not disappear again if granted bail because she would
never willingly give up her family and friends in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way she would run from that,'' he said. ``If she
ran from that, she would have no life.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ There was a familiar hue to the first WNBA All-Star Game
on Wednesday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was red-hot sizzling energy flowing throughout the event,
which played to a sellout crowd of 18,649 at Madison Square Garden.
There was equally sizzling entertainment in the pre-game and
halftime ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   And when the game began, the three players clad in Comets red
who have been so dominant through the league's first two-plus years
_ Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper and Tina Thompson _ were at it
once again, staking the Western Conference to an early 14-2 lead
that eventually stood up for a 79-61 victory.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the three Comets All-Star starters were, it was the
dominant inside game of Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith, Utah's
Natalie Williams and All-Star Most Valuable Player Lisa Leslie of
the Los Angeles Sparks, along with some of the defense that has
been the Comets' trademark, that ultimately sent the Eastern
Conference to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The night was predicted to be one filled with fun and
excitement. In that, there was no disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Or was there?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mad. I'm real mad. No, just kidding,'' said East guard
Teresa Weatherspoon of the New York Liberty. ``It was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as the players had, however, Comets coach Van
Chancellor, the 54-year-old self-described ``child'' who coached
the West squad, had more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a wonderful night for women's basketball,''
Chancellor said. ``I got here at 3:45 in the afternoon, son, and
I've been soaking in everything that hatched since that moment. I
had my grandchildren, my children here, my wife, my whole family. I
thought about how lucky I was. This is one of my most special
moments in my life. It's the best moment in coaching I've ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   It was made that way because Cooper, Swoopes and Thompson made
it look like a typical Comets game early, as the West scored five
of its first seven baskets on the fast break while running off to a
17-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And it was made that way because the West held in check Nikki
McCray, Vicky Bullett, Kym Hampton and the rest of the East,
limiting them to 35.1 percent shooting and 36 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was about 300 percent better than I ever dreamed
it would be in an All-Star Game,'' said Chancellor. ``I thought it
was good. We were switching on screens. We looked like we had been
working on defense for a long time. That was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And fun was the operative theme for the full 40 minutes,
especially in the first five minutes when the West jumped to its
big lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Thompson, ``it did kind of feel like a Comets
game, particularly in those first five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had five of her seven points during the opening run,
Thompson had four of her eight points and Swoopes two of her eight
points.
</P>
<P>
   Four more points in the run were scored by Leslie, who came out
of the night with 13 points, five rebounds and a beautiful glass
trophy from Tiffany &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a little kid,'' the 6-5 Sparks center said. ``I am
totally excited to be here and very thankful that the fans are the
ones that put me in that position, as well as the fans here (at
Madison Square Garden). Obviously, a few other players probably had
the opportunity to get it as well. I just thank God for blessing me
to be here, to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get in and get some quick shots with Michele
Timms pushing the ball upcourt. I guess basically I'll leave here
believing that I'm going to be a part of history, being the first
MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little of the razzle-dazzle on either side that is
often typical of All-Star affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the trimmings were there. Movie director Spike
Lee and supermodel Tyra Banks were among those in the crowd. And
Whitney Houston turned up the electricity during the pre-game
ceremonies, turning in a rendition of the national anthem that left
the entire house on its feet cheering.
</P>
<P>
   The early run by the West served to settle the pro-East throng
back into its seats rather quickly, however. The East eventually
cut a 15-point deficit to 31-29, but Chancellor sent his starters
back in and they built a 43-29 halftime lead. The East never
threatened in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Linda Hill-MacDonald's squad suffered a huge blow when
heralded rookie Chamique Holdsclaw of the Washington Mystics broke
the index finger on her left hand in the first half and was unable
to play the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill-MacDonald said what hurt the East more was not having
the size and wide bodies to cope inside with the likes of Williams
(14 points, eight rebounds), Griffith (10 points, five rebounds)
and Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much we could do to combat that when you don't
have size on your bench,'' said Hill-MacDonald. ``The tallest
player on our team was 6-3 (Taj McWilliams of the Orlando Miracle).
The next-tallest after that was 6-2. Next after that was 6-2. We
had three post players; they had five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kym Hampton (New York Liberty), I was asked to limit her
minutes. I tried to rotate them as best I could, keep people as
healthy as we could.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much you can do. You just put them in there, let
them play. And that's what we did.''

THE skipper returns tonight, but that won't guarantee the ship
steering into clear and smooth waters.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will arrive at the Astrodome tonight wearing their favorite
Hawaiian shirts, in tribute to Astros manager Larry Dierker, whose
recovery from the seizure and ensuing brain surgery of last month
has been nothing short of spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't guarantee the Astros' second half will be just
another cheeseburger in paradise like it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's return will inspire this team, for sure. His calm and
steady hand is sure to make a difference in the season's second
half. He will keep pitchers happy and understand that experience
and leadership should give the Astros an edge over the hot
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it simply will be a welcome sight seeing Dierker's
jersey draped around something other than a hanger. Bring your
Hawaiian shirts, and cheer the man. He's earned it.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Dierker can do, as seemingly comfortable and
confident as the Astros remain with a 50-37 record and a share of
the division lead at the break, the Astros haven't earned a thing
yet. Margaritaville still can become Nowheresville quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, three significant issues face Dierker upon his
return to the team as the second half of the season begins tonight
against the Detroit Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   What do you do with the pitching rotation, especially
considering the up-and-down bullpen performances?
</P>
<P>
   Is Derek Bell, who always looks casual and unconcerned, really
casual and unconcerned this time _ simply going through the motions
on the way to another uniform?
</P>
<P>
   And when will the Astros get what they paid for out of Ken
Caminiti?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, other questions need attention, but they all should be
weathered.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Ricky Gutierrez to a broken hand was a tough break, but
Tim Bogar can pick up the defense and Bill Spiers can flat-out
play. This guy needs to get onto the field as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the second half with a makeshift lineup of catchers is
no big help, either. But Tony Eusebio should be back to form soon,
and his stick figures to improve. Besides, the Astros never
expected a lot of offense from this position, even when they were
touting Mitch Meluskey as a cross between Johnny Bench, Yogi Berra,
Aquaman and Inspector Gadget.
</P>
<P>
   As for Craig Biggio, he probably could have put up better
first-half numbers, but I wouldn't worry. The way Bidge responded
to being snubbed for the All-Star Game might be a sign of how he
again will lead this team the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The difference will be in the rotation. And between Bell's ears.
And on Caminiti's wheels.
</P>
<P>
   At what point, if ever, will Dierker make the decision to go to
a four-man rotation of Shane Reynolds, Mike Hampton, Jose Lima and
Scott Elarton? It's not always smart to do that too early in a
season, but on this team it might be an option.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to toss in the occasional start for a fifth arm,
sure. But Astros coaches and management already have given Chris
Holt and Sean Bergman more chances than Hillary has Bill. At some
point, you have to send them to the pen, or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bullpen has at times been stifling and figures to
get stronger with the return of Doug Henry. And there's nothing
better in a division chase than having a reliable starter every
time out and an array of relief possibilities sitting out there
ready to enter.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bell, the option facing Dierker might be more touchy in
terms of clubhouse harmony. But it might be necessary nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   If Moises Alou returns full strength and Bell still hasn't found
whatever it is that ignites his game, it should be Bell who takes a
seat. Not Richard Hidalgo. And certainly not Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Caminiti _ his problem is he has been sitting far
too long.
</P>
<P>
   It's never a good sign when you've just pulled a calf muscle but
then a couple of weeks later you're still sitting out when your
manager has his head cut open.
</P>
<P>
   And then weeks after that, the guy with the scar across the top
of his head is back in the lineup before you.
</P>
<P>
   The whispers of several weeks ago have turned into outright
cries of speculation across the league: Did the Astros sign a
broken-down player?
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubting Caminiti's heart for the game, so obviously
it is not a lack of desire keeping him out. It might just be a
matter of taking too many wild dives into the dirt for too long. It
might just be too many miles on the treads. Too many turned ankles.
Too many sprained wrists. Too many bangs on the knees.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Astros truly want to make a big run, Caminiti has to
get better. Caminiti has to return to some form of his old self and
contribute his bat and playoff experience. Down the stretch, he
must be in the lineup every day.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the biggest question of all: Can Dierker perform another
medical miracle, this time on Cammy?

planted in this classic Imperial Mughul garden. By Paula Deitz.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
With Larry Dierker returning to the dugout tonight, the Astros are
asking fans to wear Hawaiian shirts _ the favored attire of the
popular manager when he's not in uniform _ to the Astrodome.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly before Dierker spoke to the media Wednesday at the
Astrodome, leis were handed out to reporters. There was a buoyant
atmosphere, which players participating in a voluntary practice
session noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lift to see him back and having fun again,''
said Derek Bell, one of the players closest to Dierker when he
suffered a grand mal seizure during a game June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker underwent brain surgery, and there are some lingering
symptoms. He has occasional headaches; his sense of time may be
off; he is not allowed to drive an automobile or to engage in a
strenuous workout.
</P>
<P>
   But he is alert and in excellent spirits, and Bell said, ``He's
the same guy except he has a low haircut, like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Ken Caminiti said, ``It's a positive thing getting
him back. He is probably the leader of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker is confident he has regained enough mental faculties to
lead the Astros to a third consecutive National League Central
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to have any difficulties resuming my duties as
manager,'' he said, in anticipation of tonight's game against the
Detroit Tigers. He added, ``I would like to thank the many people
who sent cards and letters and food and flowers. I was totally
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from a lot of people who've had the same type of
condition I had, and they're living as if they'd never had the
episodes. Those messages have made me very optimistic about a full
recovery. I don't have any fear of this happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may take time before he's 100 percent recovered. Doctors
do not want him driving for another five months, and he said,
``That's the only thing that reminds me daily that something
serious has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, I had headaches for two days preceding the
seizure, and I don't get headaches very often. I have had a few
headaches since I've come home, but if I take a couple of Advils or
aspirins, they go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he recently ``had a brain-wave test to determine if
I have what's called a `seizure focus' _ which is a little thing
that tells doctors this is a person who might have a seizure. I
don't have that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been taking seizure medication, and the doctors want me
to take it through the end of the season. If they do the test again
and it comes out clean, then I'll probably stop taking the
medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker admitted he's lacking energy, but he said, ``I did go
out and play golf several times. One time I played from 10 in the
morning to 6 at night, and that made me feel pretty good about my
endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any apprehension about managing again, he said,
``Just a little bit. I wonder if I may have lost some sense of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled: ``The day I had the seizure, I got down to the
dugout late. I remember (Astros pitcher) Mike Hampton coming into
my office and asking me if I was going to watch the game. It was
the bottom of the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've come out of the hospital, I still have some trouble
with time. Yesterday it was four weeks from the surgery, and it
seemed like two weeks to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he suffers an occasional mental lapse, he's confident
that Matt Galante, who filled in for him during his convalescence,
will make sure he doesn't overlook anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt is so experienced as a manager, he's like a prompter for
me in the dugout,'' Dierker said. ``And the same thing with Vern
Ruhle looking after the pitchers. So I'm not fearful of anything
happening that would put us at a competitive disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the Astros as they emerge from the All-Star
break, Dierker said: ``I'm not happy with where we are based on the
team we had coming out of spring training. But I am happy with
where we are based on the circumstances, the injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Moises Alou has not played this season because of a
knee injury, and shortstop Ricky Gutierrez and Caminiti also are on
the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we lose Ricky Gutierrez twice, we have Tim Bogar,''
Dierker pointed out. ``How many teams have a Tim Bogar who can play
everyday shortstop? And I'm not sure Caminiti can play that much
better than Bill Spiers has been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros enter the second half trailing Cincinnati by one
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell by watching the games on television that the Reds
have some good chemistry going right now, and it's hard for us to
pull away from them,'' Dierker said. ``But there are so many games
left that I think eventually we will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Dierker was focusing more attention on others than on
himself. ``It's great to be back,'' he said, ``but to be honest,
I'd rather have Alou back than myself.''

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ When the British Open ends Sunday, the proud
and proper Scots might be departing Carnoustie humming a familiar
refrain.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yanks for the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Seven decades ago, Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones combined to win
five consecutive British Opens. It stands today as the best run of
success Americans have had in the 128-year history of this
tournament. But by Sunday evening, that legendary duo may have
company.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with John Daly in 1995, Americans have won four
consecutive British Opens, and Tiger Woods teed off this morning
favored to make it five in a row for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the 11 years before '95, during which only
one American _ Mark Calcavecchia in 1989 _ won the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this suddenly is America's adopted championship. The
invasion from stateside is turning this competition in golf's
homeland into a red, white and blue party.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody, including the man tabbed as the pre-tournament
favorite, is sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't point out why we've been so successful,'' Woods
said. ``I know that our tour is very strong, and maybe that's what
it is because we are able to compete at a high level to win in the
States. You can't really play a bad round anymore and still win.
Other than that, maybe it's just blind luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Once is luck. Maybe even twice. But when such diverse American
players like Daly, Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard and Mark O'Meara have
won the British Open, it clearly can be construed as a sign that
knee-high heather, gnarly gorse and bowling-alley fairways don't
intimidate the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American players who come over here realize this is what
golf is all about,'' said O'Meara, the defending champion. ``It's
one of the greatest championships in the whole world. And it's a
refreshing change for most Americans because a lot of times we play
the same type of golf course day in and day out. I think a lot of
Americans get fired up about coming over here and playing on a
links course.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Americans again are expected to do well
this week. At local bookmaking establishments, David Duval is the
second betting choice, behind Woods. And half of the players listed
at 40-1 or better odds are Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why,'' Payne Stewart said. ``I was asked
the same question at the U.S. Open. I don't know why they
(Europeans) don't perform well there. I don't have an answer for
that question. There is no reason why they shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that so many non-Americans don't play in all
the major championships, therefore they have less experience at
dealing with the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say that, but take a look at the Masters,''
Ireland's Darren Clarke said. ``Take a look at how many European
winners you have had at the Masters. How long ago is it since we
had a winner here? Five years?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happens it's been non-Europeans who have played
better the past five years. Anybody who wins this tournament is a
fantastic player. It just so happens they've been American.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever prevails this week will have conquered what is expected
to be as difficult an Open Championship golf course as has ever
been played. Carnoustie has teased players during practice rounds.
The wind was docile for two days. But Wednesday, it whipped strong
from the west, and expectations for a Carnoustie carnage wafted
through the ranks of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There most certainly will be some scores in the 90s,'' said
Colin Montgomerie, one of the favorites among the non-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Carnoustie so tough is the combination of length
(7,361 yards), narrow fairways, hayfield rough and strategic
bunkering, plus the wind that invariably will blow this week.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes Carnoustie great is the history that abounds,
particularly on Nos. 6 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth hole is a 578-yard par-5 that will forever be known as
Hogan's Alley. In 1953, when Ben Hogan won with a 282 total at
Carnoustie, he discovered he could shave off some yardage on the
then-shorter hole by knifing his tee shot between a pair of fairway
bunkers and the out-of-bounds fence that runs the length of the
hole on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that on the final day of the Open, when 36 holes
were played, he hit his tee ball perfectly on the first 18 and then
drove it into his exact divot on the second trip around the course,
making birdie both times.
</P>
<P>
   That might be fact or fiction. But what is undeniable is that
Hogan, Tommy D. Armour, Henry Cotton, Gary Player and Tom Watson
are the five who previously have won Opens at Carnoustie, and
whoever prevails this week will step alongside five of the greatest
names in the sport's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a course quite like this before,''
Calcavecchia said. ``There's no question it's tough. Some holes, if
you don't make the perfect tee shot, you're going to make bogey or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it gets really windy and ugly, then it will be vicious to
play. The average score might be 80. In fact, it probably will be.
So that's pretty silly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty of golf in any circumstance is that it will be
the same golf course for each player, although conditions can
change quickly along the Scottish coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether you like or dislike the golf course,
they haven't stopped giving out a trophy on Sunday,'' Duval said.
``So whether you think it's fair or unfair or too hard or too easy,
somebody is going to take home the Claret Jug on Sunday night.''

biologist Norman Murray strolls in the knee-high growth 90 miles
south of Kansas City. It's why he is part of the recently formed
Missouri Grasslands Coalition, an unprecedented public-private
prairie conservation effort. Prairie chickens _ the bird that once
roamed Missouri by the hundreds of thousands _ are not seen on this
hike, or during a subsequent drive across the ridge tops. Greater
prairie chickens, a large member of the grouse family, last year
were added to Missouri's endangered species list. They number less

   BROWN-RELEASE (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) Sharion Beaver didn't want to
turn her son in to police. She wanted her son, Allen C. Brown, to
get on with his life in Kansas City after he was released July 6
from a Tucson jail. But it turns out Brown, 37, was freed because
of a paperwork foul-up. Arizona authorities suspect Brown of
killing his girlfriend by stabbing her more than 100 times on May
22. And they did not want him released from jail, where he had been
held on a $1 million bond. On Monday, a Tucson detective left a

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For years, Chiefs star Derrick Thomas has

interested in helping children improve their reading skills. So it
seemed a natural step when, nearly two years ago, Thomas pledged
$127,035 to pay the fines for lost and overdue books for more than
4,000 Kansas City children. Paying the fines would allow the
children to borrow books from the library again. In anticipation of
Thomas' check, the library forgave the fines. But so far, Thomas
has paid less than half the money. By MATT STEARNS. Story will move

REEDS SPRINGS MAYOR SENT TO JAIL BEFORE START OF MISCONDUCT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS

<P>
   REEDS SPRING, Mo. _ The mayor of Reeds Spring, Mo., was taken
into federal custody Wednesday after a U.S. magistrate heard
evidence that he had offered thousands of dollars to potential
witnesses in his sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dan Dwyer, 68, had been free on bond since his indictment in
January on charges that he had transported a 15-year-old girl from
Kansas to St. Louis to engage in illegal sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, prosecutors added new charges, alleging that
Dwyer offered and, in some cases, paid three women to lie to his
lawyers to help his case or to commit perjury at his upcoming
trial.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Hays heard
FBI agent John R. Smith testify that he interviewed three women who
said Dwyer had offered up to $50,000 for their help in his case.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer also gave some of the women books to teach them how to lie
convincingly under oath and during interrogations, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's lawyers objected to the testimony, saying it was
based on hearsay and that they could not confront the potential
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   They characterized some of the women as unreliable small-time
criminals, nude dancers and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting the government's evidence, defense attorney Charles
Rogers said prosecutors hadn't made a good enough case to revoke
Dwyer's bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Prosecutors) have a burden to show dangerousness and a flight
risk,'' Rogers said. ``The government has shown neither.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said Dwyer has always appeared for court proceedings, and
so would not leave the jurisdiction without permission. Hays,
however, said the evidence was enough to put Dwyer in jail until
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest and best predictor of future conduct, I've found,
is past conduct,'' Hays said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeds Spring is in Stone County, about 20 miles northwest of
Branson.

PRAIRIE CHICKENS A SYMPTOM OF AN ECOLOGICAL ILL AS GRASSLANDS
DWINDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The richness comes in part from the grasses, drought-resistant
strains that evolved over millions of years. They sink roots five
to 20 feet deep. When those roots are replaced, the old ones decay
and add organic matter to the soil, creating a fertile loam.
</P>
<P>
   A canopy of vegetation forms over the ground, with space between
stalks and stems. It's ideal for ground-dwelling birds such as
prairie chickens to run and hide in. The grasses turn reddish gold
in autumn and stay upright, helping wildlife stay dry and warm in
winter. The cover provides nesting sites during spring.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer settlers didn't understand these drought-tolerant
grasses. They fenced livestock onto prairie pastures European
style. When the cattle ate the grass close to the ground and it
didn't grow back, they called it unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that forage production on prairies is equal
or superior to imported grass if the native grasses are not cut or
grazed too low. But it's expensive to change back to native
grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Homesteaders quickly plowed most prairies to grow corn and wheat
in the rich topsoil, much of which has since eroded away.
</P>
<P>
   Taberville Prairie, like the Flint Hills prairie in Kansas, was
likely spared because of rocky glades that are hard to till.
</P>
<P>
   Some prairie patches survived as hay fields, or for sentimental
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But much native grass was plowed in the 1970s as crop prices
jumped. Now, many farm families are leaving their lands. New owners
or tenants with no ties to the land are plowing more prairie
fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of acres have been replanted with native grasses such
as switchgrass or big bluestem under the federal Conservation
Reserve Program.
</P>
<P>
   That helps prairie chickens and has boosted numbers in northwest
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a monoculture of grass and not a true prairie with more
than 300 species of plants interwoven by the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners such as Hand _ with Grassland Coalition help _ are
Missouri prairie chickens' best hope.
</P>
<P>
   Taberville Prairie will be the heart for one of nine prairie
chicken focus areas created by the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But help from private landowners will be crucial in re-creating
a large-scale prairie landscape. Hand used a federal grant to pay
for tree-cutting on a small prairie he owns near the public land.
He plans more tree removal and native grass replanting on other
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't talking to our neighbors before,'' Figg said. ``The
prairie chickens were failing, but the neighbors didn't know. Now
we're talking, and so far they're responding positively.''
</P>
<P>
   Some steps are as simple as giving farmers a helping hand in
ridding fence lines of trees. But shrub and weed cover for prairie
chickens and quail will be left.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists believe tree lines draw predators such as red-tailed
hawks or owls and furbearers such as raccoons that eat eggs in
nests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prairie chickens don't like to fly through or over trees,''
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   On all sides of Taberville Prairie, he pointed to tree lines
separating pastures and fields. Hand's great-grandfather divided
his land into 80-acre tracts by planting hedgerows of Osage orange.
Trees also spread because fires, once a regular occurrence on
prairies, were suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take out the trees, it will open up areas for birds to
use,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City lawyer Arthur A. Benson II, coalition co-founder,
and other volunteers from the Missouri Prairie Foundation visited
Taberville Prairie recently to clear trees. Another member bought
an adjoining prairie remnant and will manage it to boost prairie
chickens. A paid crew, hired by the foundation, is working with
farmers this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some landowners may be offered financial incentives to replant
native grasses or to revitalize surviving prairies with controlled
fires. The coalition hopes to raise $1.5 million for landowner
assistance that can be implemented quickly, free of government red
tape.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, government agencies are communicating more
than ever on prairie restoration techniques, said Sharron Gough, a
Conservation Department grasslands biologist.
</P>
<P>
   All participation is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a neighbor (landowner) doesn't want to be part of the
Grassland Coalition effort,'' Figg said, ``it's OK and we'll go
work on other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure whether these efforts will save prairie
chickens. One flock in northwest Missouri has grown from birds
restocked in Iowa that migrated to the Dunn Ranch and Pawnee
Prairie area.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere, Missouri's native prairie chickens must reverse a
long-term downward trend.
</P>
<P>
   At Taberville, Murray hopes flushing a prairie chicken during a
hike becomes common rather than rare.
</P>
<P>
   But history makes biologists cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is trying to figure out what a great panorama is supposed
to look like,'' Gough said, ``when you're only working with a few
small jigsaw puzzle pieces.''

PRAIRIE CHICKENS A SYMPTOM OF AN ECOLOGICAL ILL AS GRASSLANDS

   TABERVILLE PRAIRIE, Mo. _ Purple prairie coneflowers nod in the
wind above the grasses in this ancient prairie, as they have for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But something is missing as biologist Norman Murray strolls in
the knee-high growth 90 miles south of Kansas City. It's why he is
part of the recently formed Missouri Grasslands Coalition, an
unprecedented public-private prairie conservation effort.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie chickens _ the bird that once roamed Missouri by the
hundreds of thousands _ are not seen on this hike, or during a
subsequent drive across the ridge tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought this area in 1959 to save the prairie chicken,''
said Murray, who works for the Missouri Department of Conservation.
``We've found out we need to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater prairie chickens, a large member of the grouse family,
last year were added to Missouri's endangered species list. They
number less than 1,000 and are scattered in dangerously small
flocks on prairie remnants. If population trends continue, they
will vanish in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Their thinning numbers are a sign of deeper trouble; in fact,
all grassland bird populations are declining in the Midwest.
Kansas, a prairie stronghold, has seen prairie chicken numbers drop
in the southeast and the southwest. Beyond that, conservationists
say, the region is losing its last shreds of virgin prairie _ and
with it, some of the delicate balances of plant and animal life
that have long been its hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prairie chickens are really a banner species for all the
grassland birds and plants,'' said Dennis Figg, a Missouri
Conservation Department naturalist and coalition co-founder. ``Even
commonly seen birds like meadowlarks have declined by 50 percent
over the last three decades in Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri coalition of 13 state, federal and private
conservation agencies will try to reverse the trend by creating
large grassland focus areas, 10,000 acres or more for each area,
with the volunteer help of private landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Within these areas the coalition will re-create the original
open landscape. Trees will be cut, and the coalition will offer
financial incentives to make private pasture and crop field
management-friendly to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can meet the needs of the prairie chicken,'' Figg said,
``then a number of other species should respond, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure prairies once dominated as much as half of Missouri's
landscape. Grassy savannas, meadows and glades mixed with trees in
the remainder of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, less than 1 percent of the native grassland remains, and
small pockets of virgin prairie continue to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent decades have scientists begun to study in depth
what was lost and what is left.
</P>
<P>
   Many biologists believe surface and groundwater quality and
quantity dropped when prairie was no longer present to soak up
rainfall. The diversity of prairie plants and their adaptations to
the climate and soils may hold invaluable secrets for agriculture
and medicine. A recent medical conference in Kansas City focused on
the healing qualities of echinacea, made from purple prairie
coneflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Coneflowers evolved in an ecosystem that vanished long before
environmental movements were born and before science understood it.
</P>
<P>
   We know forests because they survived in rocky, hilly or lowland
areas that were difficult to till.
</P>
<P>
   But most Missourians have never walked in the mix of grasses and
flowering forb plants that, over eons, built the rich soils now
cultivated for crops or pastures. And they've never seen the
once-common wild prairie chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hand remembers hundreds of prairie chickens flying near his
birthplace, on land south of Taberville Prairie that his
great-grandfather homesteaded in the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be real thick,'' said Hand, 74. ``They'd fly from
the prairie over to the cornfields. I wouldn't let anybody shoot
them. They're unusual, and I enjoy looking at them.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, observers counted 52 males on the 1,600-acre area's
annual breeding sites, called leks or booming grounds. Those are
the places where the males strut and make a cheek-puffing, drumlike
sound, known as booming, to attract breeding females.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1988, almost 200 booming males were counted.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists suspect the prairie chicken is failing because it
needs large, open spaces to thrive. Meanwhile, grassland habitat
has declined. Scientists this year also began testing to see
whether the declines had brought on disease or reproduction
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Taberville Prairie still has ridges and swales rich with flowers
that bloom in a changing pattern from spring to fall. Clear water,
rainfall filtered by the prairie, seeps into a gurgling creek.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie chickens peck bugs from plants such as the
nitrogen-building legume called sensitive briar, which has puffy,
purple flowers. Murray touched its multipetaled leaf, and it closed
like a Venus's-flytrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prairie chickens can come here and eat bugs most of the warm
season because there's green vegetation and something's always in
bloom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White obedience plant blooms faced east, away from the wind, and
Murray pushed them around on the stem and they held their place. He
fingered the green seed head of gama grass, succulent fodder to
livestock and a relative to corn. Ripe purple dewberries signaled
summer, while nearby a few red Indian paintbrush blooms lingered
from spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This prairie was bought for prairie chickens,'' Murray said,
``but it's turned out to be very rich for all kinds of prairie
life.''

MISTAKENLY FREED PRISONER BACK IN POLICE CUSTODY

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sharion Beaver didn't want to turn her son in
to police.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted her son, Allen C. Brown, to get on with his life in
Kansas City after he was released July 6 from a Tucson jail.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out Brown, 37, was freed because of a paperwork
foul-up. Arizona authorities suspect Brown of killing his
girlfriend by stabbing her more than 100 times on May 22. And they
did not want him released from jail, where he had been held on a $1
million bond.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Tucson detective left a message with that
information at Beaver's midtown home.
</P>
<P>
   So even as Beaver was thrilled that her son was home, she knew
what she had to do: Tell him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had mixed emotions,'' she said. ``I hated to turn him in.
But at the same time, I knew it was to his advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown had been described in a police bulletin as armed and
dangerous. So when a dozen heavily armed police officers came to
Beaver's home Tuesday, she was ready to help. After talking with
her son's attorney, Beaver led police to a house in the 8500 block
of East Sni-A-Bar Road where Brown was staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to come to an agreement where they wouldn't
bombard the house,'' Beaver said. ``They let me walk in and out of
the house with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Detective Al Devalkenaere said he was pleased with
the way Beaver cooperated with police. He said police assured her
they wanted no harm to come to her son. They just wanted him back
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we wanted was him out on the run, scared,''
Devalkenaere said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Brown cooperated when they arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted it known that he was not fleeing from Arizona and
that he was told he was free to go,'' Devalkenaere said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was indicted in Jackson County Court and is being
held in the Jackson County jail, waived extradition Wednesday. He
will remain in Kansas City until Arizona authorities come get him.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver, who believes her son is innocent, said she hopes the
next time he comes home, it will be for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep on doing what I've been doing all along,''
she said. ``And that's pray. I trust in God that justice will be
served.''

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There are about 10,000 members of the
Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks meeting at their national
convention in Kansas City this week.
</P>
<P>
   But it is two women who want to be members who are garnering
some of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Bonacci and Dona Etienne stood outside Bartle Hall on
Tuesday with placards declaring: ``Not All Elks Have Antlers'' and
``We Can Be Elks Too.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fraternal organization's decision in 1995 to allow
women as members, the Los Angeles-area women contend that the Elks
roster in the nearby Bellflower, Calif., lodge is still all-male.
</P>
<P>
   And although more women now are Elks and a few are in leadership
roles, the protesters think there is still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Etienne, Bonacci and other women said they have been denied
membership in the Bellflower lodge several times. Both women said
they were tired of being members of the organization's ladies
auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel like a second-class citizen, that I wasn't
good enough to be a member of the lodge,'' Bonacci said.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Allred, an attorney renowned for opening up the all-male
Friar's Club to women, is representing Bonacci and Etienne,
although no lawsuit has been filed to force their acceptance into
the Bellflower lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things don't just happen by evolution, they have to be
fought for,'' Allred said. ``And like in this case, even after laws
are passed, many women still have to fight to make these laws the
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach a spokesman for that lodge for comment were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Elks leaders said the number of lodges that still refuse to
admit women is small, but didn't provide numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of our membership has accepted women,'' said
James C. Varenhorst of Ludington, Mich., the grand exalted
ruler-elect for the Elks.
</P>
<P>
   Varenhorst acknowledged that court rulings, diminishing
membership and pressure from within the organization itself are
pushing for the inclusion of more women in the Elks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to embrace all American citizens into our ranks,
male and female alike; if we do not, we will destroy our fraternity
and our proud legacy will become only history,'' Varenhorst said in
his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Varenhorst also emphasized that each of the 2,200 lodges are
autonomous. New members are accepted by a two-thirds vote of
current lodge members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not my intent to force our lodges to tell them what they
have to do,'' Varenhorst said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I would be a hypocrite if I didn't tell you I
believe God created two species, man and woman. Why should we not
be able to have two societies?''
</P>
<P>
   The Elks are among many service or fraternal organizations that
once excluded women. Others include the Rotary, Lions and Kiwanis
clubs, all with international memberships.
</P>
<P>
   The Elks, a 131-year-old fraternal organization, focuses on a
variety of social service projects, such as disabled children and
drug awareness. Last year, the group's 1.3 million members gave
more than $160 million to charity.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, some Elk lodges formed private clubs to hold their
liquor licenses, Varenhorst said, then transferred members to that
club to keep the right to exclude women.
</P>
<P>
   While many Elks organizations are now accepting women, their
numbers are still small in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Cunningham, a member of the Cass County Elks Lodge, said
there are no women among its 300 members, but he added that none
have applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this convention, I met two women who headed their lodges,''
Cunningham said. ``They couldn't have become president of a lodge
if there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The bylaw change to include women came after the Elks were
challenged in several lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   A 1987 Supreme Court decision involving Rotary International
clubs in California became the catalyst for many other service
organizations to begin including women.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal challenges to clubs have been against male-only
organizations, with plaintiffs arguing that women needed access to
the business connections that frequently occur behind club doors.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day of the Rotary decision, the executive committee
of the Lions Club International opened its membership to women.
Kiwanis International officially accepted its first women in 1987,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Despite threats that all the men would resign when women joined,
the various groups have only seen memberships soar. And women have
now been in the groups long enough to rise through the ranks to
high profile positions.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Lions _ with more than 137,000 female members _
elected its first woman board member.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 percent of the Rotary's 59,300 U.S. members are
women. Of the 29,000 Rotary clubs worldwide, nearly 1,900 had women
presidents in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics may provide a welcome omen to Jewell M. Weston,
a member of the Elks for nearly three years. On Wednesday, Weston
scouted for other women to enter the room where the Elks' state
presidents and secretaries luncheon was held.
</P>
<P>
   She found none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had wholehearted support from the men,'' Weston said.
``I have always felt accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Allred said a more meaningful level of inclusion will be
reached when Weston and other women no longer can count their
numbers on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in the area of token firsts,'' Allred said.

KC SCHOOL BOARD OFFERS ANOTHER SUPERINTENDENT CONTRACT OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In a 7-2 vote, the Kansas City school board
offered the superintendent's job to Benjamin Demps Jr. late
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of intensive background checking and a closed-door
meeting that ran for nearly an hour, the board agreed to extend an
offer to Demps, 65. He is a retired Federal Aviation Administration
official who served as director of the Oklahoma Department of Human
Services during the early 1990s. He is now semiretired and operates
an aviation consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Demps is the third person to be offered the district's top job
in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Terry Riley, John Rios, Lee Barnes Jr., Connie
Clark, Lance Loewenstein, Sandy Mayer and Helen Ragsdale voted for
Demps. Patricia Kurtz and Fifi Wiedeman voted against.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong leadership is very paramount to the Kansas City school
district right now,'' Riley said after the vote. ``I think we found
a candidate we can all unite around.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said of the conversation that led to the vote: ``Everyone
was on the same page. There was no adversarial conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The deciding factor, he said, was leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   Demps could not be reached late Wednesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, school board members said they had received a
letter Wednesday from Mayor Kay Barnes, saying she wanted to
appoint a community task force to study how the district is
governed. Board member Sandy Mayer said Barnes told her that she
had received many calls from community members concerned about the
direction of the district. Barnes could not be reached for comment
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's late-night meeting came after four members, Barnes,
Clark, Ragsdale and Mayer, returned from Oklahoma City, where they
had spent the day interviewing Demps' former employees and
co-workers at the Oklahoma Department of Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   They also met with lawmakers, the administrator overseeing the
state employee's personnel office, and representatives of several
minority groups. In addition, they met with the publisher of a
local minority-owned newspaper, The Ebony Tribune, and with an
Oklahoma City Board of Education member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for someone who could make tough decisions, not
be compromised by special-interest groups and be an agent of
change,'' Mayer said. ``Based on the interviews conducted, I
believe he may be the perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who traveled to Oklahoma said they had learned nothing
during the interviews that caused them concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma trip was in addition to what district officials
described as the most exhaustive background investigation ever
conducted on a Kansas City superintendent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Oklahoma City visit, the district's search
firm also ordered a credit report, conducted a criminal background
check and reviewed local, state and federal courts in Oklahoma and
elsewhere for lawsuits involving Demps.
</P>
<P>
   District lawyers also reviewed congressional testimony involving
a training facility that Demps oversaw as a top-ranking FAA
official.
</P>
<P>
   Again, district officials said, they discovered nothing to cause
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The four members returned to the Board of Education building
about 10:40 p.m. and immediately went into the closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Demps is expected to come to Kansas City later this week to meet
with board members and community groups. Board members hope to
complete negotiations over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The school board is under orders from U.S. District Judge Dean
Whipple to reach agreement with a finalist by Monday. Failing that,
the court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee has
recommended that it be allowed to appoint an interim superintendent
while the school board continues its search for someone to fill the
post permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Board members said they expect to offer Demps a two-year
contract that calls for an annual base salary of $140,000. Demps
also would be eligible for $33,800 in incentive pay if he is able
to meet certain performance measures, such as raising test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Demps was one of four finalists identified by a Desegregation
Monitoring Committee-dominated screening committee. The other
three, Jay T. Edwards, Pascal Forgione Jr. and John A. Martin, all
withdrew as candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said they hoped Demps could bring stability to a
district seemingly in constant turmoil. They also hope he can tame
a bureaucracy that some think is overstaffed and underworked.

TWO YEARS LATER, LIBRARY WAITING ON CHIEFS' STAR TO COMPLETE
PLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For years, Chiefs star Derrick Thomas has
been locally famous not only for his on-field achievements but for
his compassion toward Kansas City's needy children.
</P>
<P>
   The linebacker's Third &AMP; Long Foundation has been particularly
interested in helping children improve their reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed a natural step when, nearly two years ago, Thomas
pledged $127,035 to pay the fines for lost and overdue books for
more than 4,000 Kansas City children. Paying the fines would allow
the children to borrow books from the library again.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Thomas' check, the library forgave the fines.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Thomas has paid less than half the money.
</P>
<P>
   Library officials aren't sure why. Thomas pointed to a familiar
Kansas City nemesis, recently retired Denver Broncos quarterback
John Elway, as the stumbling block. But Elway's supposed
involvement was news to his representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The first check, for $61,231.45, came on April 1, 1998 _ after,
library officials say, several calls to Thomas' spokeswoman, Nancy
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Several calls and more than a year later, the rest of the money
is nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Stohs, the library's director of development, said it was
unusual for a donor to take so long making good on a pledge. But
she gives Thomas the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's unfair that the community thinks he's done
this great, wonderful thing,'' Stohs said. ``But he just did half
of a great, wonderful thing. We know he can do the other half.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas plans to pay the remaining $65,803.55, Mitchell said. She
said he never intended to pay the money out of his own pocket. The
initial check came from grants made to the Third &AMP; Long Foundation,
Thomas' charitable organization, which has raised thousands of
dollars through celebrity sports events.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' fund-raising plan for most of the rest hasn't worked out
as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The plan: Sell, for $1,000 each, 58 signed footballs _
signifying Thomas' jersey number _ commemorating his 100th career
sack. That's where Elway comes in: He was the victim, so Thomas
wanted him to sign the balls, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mitchell, Elway agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But, Mitchell said, Elway hasn't let retirement keep him from
sticking it to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried so many different ways, I can't even tell you,''
Mitchell said of her attempts to get Elway to sign. ``I said:
`Derrick, they're going to hang you if you don't get these balls
signed.'...I just don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Hatch, Elway's assistant, said Wednesday that she had
never heard of the plan and had never been approached by Mitchell.
Dennis Engel, president of the Elway Foundation, the quarterback's
charitable organization, said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is bizarre,'' said Hatch, the gatekeeper for Elway
autograph requests. ``John's very good about that. He does so much
for so many other athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' next move, Mitchell said, is to apply for a grant from
the National Football League for the remainder of the pledge
amount. Applications for the grant are due by Aug. 1, and Mitchell
said the grants should be made by late September.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas could write a check for the rest of the money, but he
won't, Mitchell said, because library officials have been rude in
demanding the money.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said Thomas did not renege on the deal. ``They knew the
balls were the resource to bring the dollars in,'' she said.

CHINA PROCLAIMS IT DESIGNED ITS OWN NEUTRON BOMB 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China announced on Thursday that it has successfully
developed the design technology to make neutron bombs and
miniaturized nuclear weapons on its own, the first time it has made
these assertions publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Coming just days after Taiwan shifted its stance toward China,
prompting furious accusations from Beijing that the island it
considers a renegade province was moving toward independence, the
announcement appeared to be timed as a pointed reminder of China's
military capability.
</P>
<P>
   China has always reserved the right to use military force to
achieve its cherished goal of reunification with Taiwan, if
peaceful methods and negotiation fail, and it reiterated that
position again on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement concerning the neutron bomb came at a news
conference held to deliver a rebuttal to the Cox Committee report,
issued by a congressional committee in May, which accused China of
systematically stealing American nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox Committee accused China of having stolen information on
the designs for the neutron bomb as well as for the W-88, the most
advanced miniaturized warhead.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference in Beijing on Thursday, a senior
official, Zhao Qi-zheng, spoke at length about why he thought the
Cox report was misleading, full of lies and racist. He did not take
any questions about the neutron bomb, which was mentioned in a
passing reference in a 36-page report _ entitled ``Facts Speak
Louder Than Words and Lies Will Collapse on Themselves'' _ that was
released simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in case anyone did not immediately grasp the significance of
the report, the New China News Agency carried a dispatch entitled
``China Masters Neutron Bomb Technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China has already mastered the neutron bomb design
technology,'' the dispatch begins, saying that it began work on the
topic in the 1970s, when the United States and the Soviet Union
intensified their arms race. It does not say when China succeeded
in achieving its design technology, and omitted further details
such as whether China had conducted tests, begun production or
deployed the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neutron bomb seems quite mysterious to ordinary people,''
the report says. ``In fact, it is a special kind of H-bomb. Since
China has already possessed atom bomb and H-bomb technologies, it
is quite logical and natural for it to master the neutron bomb
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The neutron bomb is designed to kill people with enhanced
radiation while leaving buildings intact. No nation is known to
have deployed a neutron bomb, but the Cox Committee report said
that China had tested the weapon in 1988 after having stolen the
design information in the late 1970s from the Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The neutron bomb, or W-70 warhead, contains elements that may be
used either as a strategic thermonuclear weapon, or as an enhanced
radiation weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's assertion, a three-sentence reference in a long
rebuttal to the Cox report, was presented as part of a declaration
that China's scientific advances have been made over the years
without the benefit of espionage, as the Cox report alleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``As everyone knows, since the 1950s, China has successfully
overcome a series of technological problems and mastered nuclear
weapon technology within a reasonably short time,'' the report
says, ``by relying on its own forces, on its large number of
talented scientists full of creative spirit and on the energetic
support of the people throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao added that a principal implication of the report is that
``Chinese can't be as smart as Americans, so they must have stolen
the technology,'' which he called a racist allegation.
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated China's position that the Cox report was cooked
up by people whose intention was not to find the truth, but to
slander China and to damage U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he saw some connection between the Cox report and
NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy, which many Chinese believe
was deliberate, Zhao said no. But he equated the chances that the
bombing was accidental with rolling triple snake eyes in dice.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao was also asked whether China would hold military exercises
in response to Taiwan's announcement that it will no longer follow
a `one-China' formula in its dealings with the mainland and will
instead call Taiwan and China two separate countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for me to answer this question,'' Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao's news conference was held on a day when American officials
began talks with China's Foreign Ministry on how to compensate
Beijing for NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on
May 9, which killed three Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Washington agencies asked for comment early on Thursday morning
did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   China has consistently denied the allegations of spying made by
the committee, formally known as the Select Committee on United
States National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the
People's Republic of China.

MARINERS TO SPORT NEW LINEUP AT NEW BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The wraps come off Safeco Field and Jay Buhner
Thursday night, with both the brand new ballpark and bald right
fielder sure to glisten under the Seattle skyline.
</P>
<P>
   One brings outdoor big-league baseball back to the city after a
30-year absence; the other returns a significant home run bat to
the lineup, one missing for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ballpark unveiling was tempered a bit Wednesday as the
Mariners, still dealing with residue from Sunday's brawl at Dodger
Stadium, placed outfielders Brian Hunter and Charles Gipson on the
15-day disabled list. The loss of these two players _ Hunter to a
hyperextended left knee, Gipson to a separated right shoulder _
carries serious ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost most of our speed we were so proud of in one fell
swoop,'' said Woody Woodward, vice president of baseball
operations.
</P>
<P>
   To find replacements for the 7:05 Safeco opener against San
Diego, the Mariners traded swiftness for power: they activated
Buhner from the DL and recalled outfielder Ozzie Timmons from Class
AAA Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the speed part of our club (is gone),'' manager
Lou Piniella said. ``But if the pitching gets better and we catch
the ball well, we should be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners left-hander Jamie Moyer and San Diego right-hander Andy
Ashby, an All-Star selection, will be the first to trudge around
the mound at Safeco. But not before the $517 million ballpark has
been duly christened.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame ceremonies will include a ``Shoeless Joe'' reading by
Dave Niehaus; Fred Hutchinson's 5-year-old grandson, Joey, running
the bases; symphony music; fireworks; air dancers; and the
ceremonial first pitch by a mystery guest, a person the club
Wednesday still was keeping a closely guarded secret.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took batting practice in their new palatial estate
late Wednesday afternoon. They were left noticeably wide-eyed by
their new digs.
</P>
<P>
   Their spacious clubhouse, with its big-screen TV sets, could
have doubled as a sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to send someone out around here, he can hide for a
week,'' Piniella wisecracked.
</P>
<P>
   Some players detected a chill while standing on the field. A
welcome chill. Buhner plans to wear long underwear under his
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Balls flew out of the park with little trouble, too. Both Ken
Griffey Jr. and John Mabry sent drives ricocheting off the Hit It
Here Cafe in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seemed caught up in the significance of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of emotion riding on what's going to be going on
here,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about as nice as you can get for a ballpark,'' said
reliever Frankie Rodriguez, whose previous big-league tours of duty
had been spent at the Kingdome and Minnesota's Metrodome.
Laughingly, he added, ``This is a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Now all the Mariners have to do is put on a team on the field
that matches their impressive surroundings. The club, however,
comes off the All-Star break with a five-game losing streak, its
longest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The fight did nothing to improve matters. Not only did the
Mariners lose two outfielders to injury, Buhner and relievers Jose
Mesa, Jose Paniagua and Damaso Marte are facing fines, suspensions
or both for being ejected from Sunday's brawl.
</P>
<P>
   In their favor, player punishment won't be determined any time
soon. Complicating matters, officials from both leagues will be
involved because the matchup was an interleague contest played in a
National League ballpark. Both sides need to review videotapes, and
the NL office didn't request a copy of the fight footage until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   NL president Leonard Coleman will mete out the penalties in
consultation with AL president Gene Budig. No more than one player
will be suspended at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to put a serious cramp on our roster, no doubt
about that,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunter: ``I'm disappointed by the way it happened. If it
had happened during a game, I probably could explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are stiffer penalties for players on the DL who get
involved in on-field unpleasantness. Buhner might be fined as much
as $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder, out since May 18 with a severe hamstring
sprain, could find himself returning from his injury only to sit
back down with a suspension. He planned to call Budig this morning
and plead his case _ he was only coming to the aid of an injured
teammate, Gipson, and put Dodgers reliever Pedro Borbon in a
headlock, throwing no punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell him I'll pay the fine,'' Buhner said. ``I did what
anybody would have done. I'm not going to let a teammate with a
separated shoulder get pummeled. I'd do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gipson was expected to return to Seattle Thursday. He had X-rays
taken at a Los Angeles hospital and was still in a lot of pain
early this week, trainer Rick Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   In sweats, Hunter walked stiff-legged as he entered Safeco Field
and watched batting practice. Looking for a positive, the
Vancouver, Wash., native said he felt lucky to be present even if
he couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so great for the community, for the Northwest,''
Hunter said. ``This is everybody's ballpark.''

KEEP OFF THE GRASS? NOT MARINERS' BUHNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Cold weather. Hot weather. Rain or sun. Roof open or
roof closed. Doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing, regardless,'' Jay Buhner said Wednesday with a
cat-ate-the-bird grin creeping out from somewhere in the middle of
that famous Buhner goatee.
</P>
<P>
   As if they were going to be able to keep him off the field.
</P>
<P>
   As if there was any chance the Mariners right fielder was going
to stay off the grass.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a historic Seattle sporting moment, after two
months on the disabled list with a strained hamstring, Buhner's
marvelous recovery comes just in the nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in the wake of an on-field brawl that left Mariners
outfielders Charles Gipson and Brian Hunter injured and on the
disabled list, Buhner submitted to two rounds of hail-Mary
acupuncture sessions and says he's fine.
</P>
<P>
   Not 100 percent, but fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the green light,'' he said. ``I know it would have
been crazy to rush back just to play, but I would have done it
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   As if there were any chance he was going to say anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stuck needles all down the back of my leg and in my lower
back. It sounds kind of kooky but it works.''
</P>
<P>
   You bet it works. There is more chance that the Public
Facilities District and the Mariners brass will share a beer
Thursday night than that Buhner would be on the bench when the
Mariners take the field in their new park.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field was not built for Jay Buhner. Not exactly, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know that popular wisdom has it that the Mariners'
new ballyard is the house that Griffey built or the house that
Randy Johnson built or the house that everybody built even when
they voted it down by 1,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   But when the field opens Thursday to the strains of the Seattle
Symphony Orchestra playing the theme from ``2001: A Space Odyssey''
and to the lonesome freight train whistles calling from out behind
right field, the entire festive affair will be a testament to
big-money, state-of-the-art sports palaces.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be a testament to the great outdoors and vistas of
Seattle and to the splendor of grass. Baseball the way it ought to
be.
</P>
<P>
   No one deserves to feel the plush carpet of Kentucky bluegrass
beneath his feet more than Buhner, the veteran Mariner whose
12-year tenure is longer than Ken Griffey's and nearly as long as
that of Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   All those years pounding away on the turf-covered concrete in
the Kingdome have taken their toll on Buhner. It is only fitting
and only fair that he should be out there where the legs and back
and knees can catch a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, (playing on turf) knocked some years off my
career. It's almost a given that it will do that to guys,'' Buhner
said. ``So coming onto this grass isn't going to do too much for me
because basically it's too late. But the biggest thing it does for
guys like Junior and A-Rod, it's going to help them before it
sneaks up on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But grass, that's where the game is supposed to be played.
Period. It's going to be nice to go out there and stand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner is adamant that he will always miss the Kingdome _ a
place where he and his mates made that unforgettable effort to save
baseball in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome gave us Buhner Buzz Cut Night and the Buhner Bone
Yard and a place where the power-hitting Buhner became one of only
three players in history to hit 40 home runs in three consecutive
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand that there is sentimental attachment to the
old concrete dome. But Buhner, perhaps as much as any Mariner, is
ready to let go of the past and embrace the future.
</P>
<P>
   He said the opening night of the new ballpark will affirm
everything that has happened to the Mariners, good and bad and
everything in between.
</P>
<P>
   For all his grousing and attempts at being a tough guy, Buhner
always has a way of putting the big picture in perspective _
especially when it comes to the game and the team he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this (new) place represents all the hard work over the
years and what we did in '95,'' he said. ``It's going to be
exciting. I think it's going to be real emotional from the
standpoint that there's going to be a lot of stuff going through my
head. I know I'll be thinking about the reason why this all
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, from what was going on in this organization when I
first came over to now, what a difference. When I first came here,
it was terrible. You were losing all the time. It was a revolving
door not only for players but for managers and ownership. A big
goal when I first came over was to try and finish above .500,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now look at this place. This is unbelievable. To come in
here and have two (American League West championship) banners out
there and a lot more to come. It's going to be a pretty neat
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping it's more than one pretty neat night _ for Buhner
and the Mariners and everyone who chooses to be part of whatever is
ahead in the new park filled with light and grass.

BUSINESS CLASS: HARD WORK HAS GWYNN NEAR 3,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This was not one of Tony Gwynn's greatest hits. The
virtuoso of the San Diego Padres was 21 years old, and he hadn't
used a wooden bat since Little League. His first swing in his first
professional practice struck a discordant note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first ball I hit, I hit right off the end,'' Gwynn said.
``And it hurt like hell. It stung the crap out of my hands. It hurt
so bad I just dropped my bat like a little kid. I remember shaking
my hand and saying, `Man, I'm in trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1981, in Walla Walla, the first stop in a career
that has led Gwynn to the edge of 3,000 hits, the figure that will
certify him as one of the greatest hitters of all-time. He has
2,982 as he comes off the disabled list Thursday night when the
Mariners and Padres open Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was new to the Northwest when he came to Walla Walla.
Drafted in the third round out of San Diego State, he expected to
start at a higher level. Being in Walla Walla _ ``prairie land,
gigantic onions, people looking at you funny'' _ meant he'd have to
produce quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn had been an all-conference point guard in college and a
10th-round draft choice by the NBA's San Diego Clippers. Basketball
was his first love, but in baseball he had a better future. So he
made a vow the day he signed his first pro contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a profession now,'' Gwynn told himself, ``so I've got
to put all I have into it.''
</P>
<P>
   He immersed himself in the game and rose quickly. Gwynn led the
Northwest League with a .331 average, then spent the last three
weeks of the '81 season batting .462 at Class AA. He was in the big
leagues the next summer and has made 14 All-Star teams in the past
15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The year he didn't make it, 1988, he won the batting title _ one
of eight in his career. The only player with more is Ty Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   The feats are mostly a product of Gwynn's incomparable and
much-chronicled work ethic. Gwynn insists he is not a workaholic,
but people think he is, and they have proof.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the son of Padres manager Bruce Bochy wanted to
take batting practice at Qualcomm Stadium. Knowing his players
sometimes work out there, Bochy waited until a Sunday morning,
figuring no one would be around.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Gwynn, working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he knows what he's accomplished,'' said Bochy,
who has known Gwynn for 16 years, ``because that's just the way he
goes about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   (insert copy break)
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was expecting baseball to be like that when he signed _ a
business, a job, and not necessarily much fun.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he and his brothers would cut up old socks, tape
them together and practice their hitting. He played Little League,
went to Dodger Stadium, and can tell stories about Hank Aaron, Don
Drysdale and his favorite, Dodgers outfielder Willie Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But to a kid so smitten with basketball, baseball didn't seem as
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of kids, you kind of think baseball's boring,
that's the perception, and as an outfielder you stand around a
lot,'' Gwynn said. ``And really trying to learn all I could about
the game, you began to understand the nuances of the game, and it
became really fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a lot of fun for me to learn about the history of
the game. I heard Pete Rose talking about, `Look in a book, look in
a book.' You know, what book? So finally I went and got one of
those baseball encyclopedias, and you start to read and you start
to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn realized he knew more than he thought. The harder he
worked, the faster the fundamentals he'd been taught years before
came back to him. But he also found that baseball was a little like
those Walla Walla onions _ the more layers you peeled, the more
layers you found.
</P>
<P>
   That process of discovery, even at 39 years old, remains Gwynn's
greatest joy. Bochy could name only three players who retained
Gwynn's passion for the game at that age, and all three _ Paul
Molitor, Eddie Murray and Alan Trammell _ are probable Hall of
Famers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's not playing, I can pretty much assure you he's
thinking about what he would do in that situation,'' said Trammell,
Detroit Tigers hitting coach and co-owner with Gwynn of the San
Diego School of Baseball. ``Everybody watches, but I wonder
sometimes whether they're really thinking, `What would I have
done?' And they should, because that can help you become a better
ballplayer. That's what I tried to do, and that's what Tony Gwynn
does.''
</P>
<P>
   The best advice Gwynn ever received came from his first manager,
Dick Williams, who emphasized the importance of thinking something
out before doing it. Williams would let players know _ loudly _
when they'd made a mental error, and to Gwynn, there's no worse
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no better feeling than making the smart play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a position player, they say all it is is swinging a
bat, and there's so much more to it,'' Gwynn said. ``It's defense,
offense, knowing your ballpark, knowing the pitchers, other
hitters, it's a lot. And as you get into it, man, you can really
enjoy this game. This game can be as much fun as anything, because
not only do you need physical ability, you need mental ability,
too.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was not a great outfielder when he came to the majors, but
by 1991 he had won five Gold Gloves. There's an excitement in his
voice as he talks about throwing out a runner at home plate
recently _ not because of the achievement, but because it reflected
a drill he had worked on with a coach and two rookies during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   He's also improved as a hitter, turning on inside pitches better
and using his years of preparation to better predict what pitch
will come next. When a game in Cincinnati was suspended with Gwynn
at the plate last year, Gwynn told coach Tim Flannery that, when
the game was resumed, he would see a slider on the first pitch and
smack a game-tying double to left-center. It happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably seen 2,000 of his hits, and I've seen them from
every angle,'' said Flannery, also a former teammate. ``And I know
that he's a better hitter today than he's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   History surrounds Gwynn, and he's trying not to let the hype
distract him. But that's not easy. During a break in a recent
interview, he was approached by a team official with a model of a
bus that will bear Gwynn's likeness and the slogan, ``Next Stop:
Cooperstown.'' Gwynn groaned.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, he had the same reaction when he parked his
car at Qualcomm Stadium, looked up and saw ``TONY 3000'' in giant
placards on a mountain off the side of Friars Road.
</P>
<P>
   The stacks of memorabilia have piled up in his lockers, but
there is room for chairs for the stream of visitors. Mariners
catcher Tom Lampkin, a former teammate, came by a few weeks ago and
chatted with Gwynn at length.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin had no hits in five games before seeing Gwynn. In his
next five games after they spoke, he had nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time I talk to him, he gives me something
else to think about,'' Lampkin said. ``And it may be something I've
heard before, but when Tony says it, it clicks. It's like with my
kids _ I can tell them to do something, but until they hear it from
a Spice Girl or 'N Sync, it's not going to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has a knack for saying things in a way that people will
understand. He can teach hitting to a 5-year-old or a 40-year-old,
because he knows how to relate to people so well. We talked about
confidence, and he convinced me that I could hit in a matter of
about 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   (insert copy break)
</P>
<P>
   When Trammell mentions Gwynn's name to his pupils on the Tigers,
he has noticed they pay more attention. Gwynn's presence is
invaluable to the young Padres, and when a recent calf strain made
flying difficult, Gwynn drove from San Diego to Phoenix, and then
to Milwaukee, to be with the team.
</P>
<P>
   His effort matched those of some Padres fans, who had bought
tickets to those games in case Gwynn got No. 3,000 on the road.
Gwynn is a civic hero for staying in San Diego and turning down
chances to leave for more money. That loyalty impressed at least
one member of the 3,000-hit club, Hall of Famer Al Kaline, who
recently wrote Gwynn a congratulatory letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really admire someone like him,'' said Kaline, who spent his
whole career with Detroit and is one of 21 players with 3,000 hits.
``Money is so, so important to so many athletes today, and he
decided to play where he and his family are happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn wants to get the 3,000th hit at home, and although he
tries to downplay the significance of the milestone, he knows it
will make him nervous when he gets closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try my darndest not to get too hyped about it,
because I know, when you get that close, you're going to be,''
Gwynn said. ``You probably won't be able to sleep at night. Knowing
me, I'll be looking at videotape of the guy starting that night,
all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, No. 3,000 will be a lot like No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Called up from Class AAA Hawaii in July 1982, Gwynn knew his
first game would be against the Philadelphia Phillies. The whole
flight to California, he fretted about the notion of facing future
Hall of Famer Steve Carlton. As soon as he got off the plane, Gwynn
bought a newspaper to check that night's pitchers. Carlton was not
scheduled that night, and Gwynn got his first hit, a double off
reliever Sid Monge.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium scoreboard announced Gwynn's accomplishment, and a
Phillies infielder trailing the play jogged up and offered his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' said Pete Rose, whose name sits atop the
all-time hits list in a book he inspired Gwynn to buy. ``Don't try
to catch me in one night.''

BUSINESS CLASS: HARD WORK HAS GWYNN NEAR 3,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This was not one of Tony Gwynn's greatest hits. The
virtuoso of the San Diego Padres was 21 years old, and he hadn't
used a wooden bat since Little League. His first swing in his first
professional practice struck a discordant note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first ball I hit, I hit right off the end,'' Gwynn said.
``And it hurt like hell. It stung the crap out of my hands. It hurt
so bad I just dropped my bat like a little kid. I remember shaking
my hand and saying, `Man, I'm in trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1981, in Walla Walla, the first stop in a career
that has led Gwynn to the edge of 3,000 hits, the figure that will
certify him as one of the greatest hitters of all-time. He has
2,982 as he comes off the disabled list Thursday night when the
Mariners and Padres open Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was new to the Northwest when he came to Walla Walla.
Drafted in the third round out of San Diego State, he expected to
start at a higher level. Being in Walla Walla _ ``prairie land,
gigantic onions, people looking at you funny'' _ meant he'd have to
produce quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn had been an all-conference point guard in college and a
10th-round draft choice by the NBA's San Diego Clippers. Basketball
was his first love, but in baseball he had a better future. So he
made a vow the day he signed his first pro contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a profession now,'' Gwynn told himself, ``so I've got
to put all I have into it.''
</P>
<P>
   He immersed himself in the game and rose quickly. Gwynn led the
Northwest League with a .331 average, then spent the last three
weeks of the '81 season batting .462 at Class AA. He was in the big
leagues the next summer and has made 14 All-Star teams in the past
15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The year he didn't make it, 1988, he won the batting title _ one
of eight in his career. The only player with more is Ty Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   The feats are mostly a product of Gwynn's incomparable and
much-chronicled work ethic. Gwynn insists he is not a workaholic,
but people think he is, and they have proof.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, the son of Padres manager Bruce Bochy wanted to
take batting practice at Qualcomm Stadium. Knowing his players
sometimes work out there, Bochy waited until a Sunday morning,
figuring no one would be around.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Gwynn, working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he knows what he's accomplished,'' said Bochy,
who has known Gwynn for 16 years, ``because that's just the way he
goes about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   (insert copy break)
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was expecting baseball to be like that when he signed _ a
business, a job, and not necessarily much fun.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he and his brothers would cut up old socks, tape
them together and practice their hitting. He played Little League,
went to Dodger Stadium, and can tell stories about Hank Aaron, Don
Drysdale and his favorite, Dodgers outfielder Willie Davis.

became really fun.

   ``It became a lot of fun for me to learn about the history of

a book.' You know, what book? So finally I went and got one of
those baseball encyclopedias, and you start to read and you start

 CALIFORNIA SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN RESISTS TALK OF VEEP SPOT  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday
that the ``time is right'' for a woman to be on the Democratic
ticket _ but she bristled at the notion that she is the most likely
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't read into the future. I don't know what may happen or
may not happen,'' Feinstein told California reporters over
breakfast. ``I intend to be (a) United States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauging Feinstein's chances of being the Democratic vice
presidential nominee is a popular _ though vexing _ pastime for
many Washington pundits. The former San Francisco mayor has long
been regarded an attractive running mate for whoever wins the
Democratic presidential nomination, and the speculation has
intensified in light of polls indicating that Vice President Al
Gore is struggling to maintain his advantage among women and
Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein provides little guidance, showing little interest or
patience with the topic
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a coyness that has become a trademark during her
30-plus years in politics, Feinstein sipped orange juice and
brushed aside questions attempting to assess her interest,
acknowledging that such talk a year before the election ``makes me
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It builds up an expectation that I really don't see there,''
Feinstein said. ``I can't say what may happen. ... The probability
is very strong that I will be United States senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein told reporters that she is focused on the issues she
believes will form the core of her re-election bid: Improving
health care, preserving Lake Tahoe, restricting the sale of guns,
eliminating the gasoline additive MTBE, and bringing together
opposing sides in California's long-running water wars.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein is an overwhelming favorite to win re-election. The
only announced Republican challenger is Bill Horn, a member of the
San Diego County Board of Supervisors who is almost completely
unknown elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically she can run for both senator and vice
president at the same time, it would be awkward at best and could
threaten what now appears to be an easy re-election, several aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the indelicate matter of her age. The only reason
Feinstein would accept No. 2 is so she might someday be No. 1, her
loyalists say. Feinstein, who turned 66 last month, is not too old
for the post _ now. But if she were to serve two terms as vice
president, Feinstein would be 75 by the time she sought the
presidency _ older than Ronald Reagan when he ran for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was courted as a potential running mate by
Vice-President Walter Mondale in 1984, when she was mayor of San
Francisco. Her response to the initial inquiries then ring a
familiar tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am interested in being mayor,'' she said at the time, adding
that the vice presidency ``is not my interest. I do not intend to
pursue it. I intend to continue to run San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein ultimately sought the nomination with vigor, but was
passed over in favor of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The case for Feinstein as potential running mate is much
stronger than it was 15 years ago. In 1984 she was the mayor of a
Democratic city; now she represents a state with 54 electoral votes
_ 20 percent of the total needed to win the presidency. She comes
from the same ideological wing of the party as Vice-President Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, the only two Democratic presidential
candidates. She has established herself as a lawmaker who is tough
on crime, strong on public education, and is seen as a figure who
can rise above the partisanship that is so out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Hillary Clinton, Feinstein has emerged as
the nation's most recognizable Democratic woman at precisely the
time that the demand for female candidates appears to far outstrip
the supply. Of the party's six female senators and 39
representatives, none comes close to matching Feinstein in stature
or electability.
</P>
<P>
   No one argues with the political pressure on both parties to
place women on their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   `We've now established very strongly throughout this country
that women have taken a historically unprecedented role in
elections,'' Feinstein said. ``(They are) turing out in abundance,
(they are) creating the kind of critical mass in numbers that can
be very effective in electing officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The speculation over Feinstein's candidacy may not reach a
crescendo for a little more than a year, when Democrats gather in
Los Angeles to formally nominate candidates for president and vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Feinstein is not only the leading female contender, but
for most pundits she is the top contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman with U.S. Senate and big city mayoral experience who
happens to be from the nation's largest state _ Wow! She's surely a
serious VP possibility with any presidential candidate,'' wrote Ron
Faucheux, editor and publisher of Campaigns &AMP; Elections Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's credentials look so good on paper that Parade
Magazine put her on the cover this spring as one of five women most
likely to become president by the year 2008. Washingtonian magazine
also names her the most likely VP nominee, calling a Gore-Feinstein
ticket ``the closest thing the party can find to a Hollywood Dream
Team.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an image that some _ friends and foe _ dispute, and an
event late in the 1994 Senate campaign provides a telling example.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday night, and President Clinton was in San
Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, extolling Feinstein's virtues and
raising money for her re-election before a large crowd of wealthy
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein was not there. She had remained in Washington to cast
a vote against Clinton's top legislative priority at the time _ the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have a No. 2 personality,'' said an aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens,'' speculated another associate, ``when President
Gore wants to do one thing, and Vice President Feinstein wants to
do another?'' Of course, aides to former Sen. Lyndon Johnson
probably felt the same way in 1960.

 FEINSTEIN ON THE ISSUES  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Among the topics Sen. Dianne Feinstein discussed Wednesday with
California reporters in Washington:
<P>
   HEALTH CARE
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights Bill is
dead, but added that Republicans will pay a cost in next year's
election for having defeated it. ``I do think a patients' bill of
rights becomes a major campaign issue. A very important issue in
California,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR LAB SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she is very concerned about lax security, and
suggested that the lab's relationship with the University of
California should be re-evaluated. ``This is hard for me, because
the University of California is in my state and I am a big fan of
the university, but I question the academic overlay and the
academic administration. There is a whole different culture that
permeates that is not conducive to security,'' Feinstein said. ``We
have to take some vigorous and forceful action to create a new
administrative structure that has a much greater emphasis on
security.''
</P>
<P>
   TAXES
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Republican plans to cut more than as much as &LR; 
 &LR; $800 billion in taxes over the next 10 years are too large. She
said she supports a much narrower tax cut that would eliminate the
marriage penalty, make the research and development tax credit
permanent and provide relief for health care and education
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   FUND RAISING
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, who spent $9 million in her 1992 Senate race and $15
million in 1994, said she has raised a little over $2 million so
far. How much she needs to raise depends on how well financed her
competitor is. ``You raise what you have to raise to be
competitive, and we will do that,'' Feinstein said. ``We'll raise
what we have to raise.''
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON'S NEW YORK SENATE CANDIDACY
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the first lady will be a formidable candidate but
will face a tough campaign to get elected. President Clinton should
feel free to raise money for his wife, she said, but he ought to
let her campaign on her own. ``He's entitled to campaign for his
wife,'' Feinstein said. ``I'd say do the fund-raisers, but let her
campaign alone.''
</P>
<P>
   VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she supports Gore over former Sen. Bill Bradley.
She said reports of Gore's poor campaign skills are overstated, and
that there is plenty of confidence among Democratic senators. ``I
think there is kind of a media thing going on right now that isn't
really the reality,'' Feinstein said. ``The Al Gore that debated
Jack Kemp, the Al Gore that debated Ross Perot, is a formidable
candidate, and I think that is the Al Gore we are going to see on
the stump.''

A SCENE TO WATCH WITH EYES SHUT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Here comes the orgy scene!
<P>
   The flower of the city's movie-critic community gathered at
Metreon Wednesday for the press screening of ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
and just before the orgy scene, poof! Screen goes black, sound
continues.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Tres  &LR; Kubrick, no? Director Stanley Kubrick, forced to re-edit
the orgy scene to achieve an R rating, simply killed the video!
Wow! Sheer genius.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley is simultaneously thumbing his nose at the ratings
people, doing a cosmic riff on the movie title and telling us,
``The imagination is your greatest love tool.'' How, like, deep.
</P>
<P>
   No. It was simply a false fire alarm that played havoc with the
projection system at the world's most technically sophisticated
flick barn.
</P>
<P>
   The critics, perhaps predictably, were critical of the
 &LR; celluloidus interruptus.  &LR; And when the movie was re-started, with
video but no audio, the critics supplied the narration as Kubrick
spun in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was a like a scene from a Stanley Kubrick movie.
</P>
<P>
   IN OTHER cultural news, City Attorney Louise Renne is suing the
owner of a Chestnut Street bar for allowing his customers to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   One smoky San Francisco bar down, 999 to go. Hey, I feel a song
coming on.
</P>
<P>
   If Renne plans to turn this into a crusade, she'd better pack a
lunch for the two city Health Department inspectors who, in their
spare time, handle enforcement of the no-smoking bar law.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on how the mayor feels about this get-tough policy,
but the usual cloud of cigar smoke coming out of Willie's favorite
smoky bar on Columbus is an indication that he's mulling it over.
</P>
<P>
   STILL SIMMERING (I am) about Florida lawyer Morris Engelberg
trying to tell San Francisco how to honor Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe,'' asks Louisa Arndt, ``this lawyer purporting
to represent the interests of the most low-profile guy in baseball
history wants us to name the airport after DiMaggio? Very unclear
on the concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Solution. Airports are notorious sources of annoyance,
aggravation and noise pollution. So we put DiMaggio's name on North
Beach Playground and rename our airport Morris Engelberg
International.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO, of all places, has honored Joe DiMaggio in grand style.
</P>
<P>
   Chicagoans are in the process of converting an entire city block
of Little Italy to Joe DiMaggio Piazza, with large fountains and a
life-size bronze statue of the Yankee Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Why Chicago? Because Chicago is the home of the National Italian
American Sports Hall of Fame, of which Joe was the first inductee.
</P>
<P>
   We could take a lesson: If you want to honor someone, just do
it, ba-da-bing.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA FOLLIES: They're still fine-tuning the execution process
down there in Florida. ``Old Sparky,'' the electric chair, turned
human heads into Roman candles, so they got a new chair, which
caused a nosebleed in Tiny Davis as Tiny was being fried last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny was a 344-pounder (and how come tiny guys are never
nicknamed Biggie?) who murdered a woman and her two daughters. You
hate to see a guy like that suffer a bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   I oppose capital punishment, but not because it stains your
shirt. Getting our terminology straight, then: I'm a bleeding-heart
liberal but not a bleeding-nose liberal.

FOR RANGERS, PROGRESS GOES WITH PATIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ After a Rangers' exhibition in Tampa one
night last March, Doug Melvin was headed for the exits when he
walked up on an intense baseball pow-wow.
</P>
<P>
   It was Yankees general manager Brian Cashman huddled in deep
conversation with a couple of his front-office assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you guys doing _ plotting how to win 125 games again
this season?'' joked Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman, who had just watched somebody named Jeff Zimmerman
breeze through the heart of the Yankees' batting order, gave Melvin
one of those looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly,'' he told the Rangers GM. ``George
\RSteinbrenner\S saw that Zimmerman kid pitch tonight, and he's
going to want to know where he came from and why we don't have him.
We're trying to get our stories straight. This meeting is about how
to cover our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is life, huh? Nobody gets out of this world alive without
proper butt-coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's Melvin's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Play resumes tonight following the All-Star Game break, and
Melvin, it seems, has two clear-cut options to ponder with the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   One, he can be extremely cautious between now and the
major-league trading deadline at the end of July. Do the endless
phone work, gather information on what pitching help might be
available, but at the same time be picky, hesitant and protective
of all top minor-league prospects. Plus, Melvin slams the phone
down on the ear of the next media Einstein who asks if left fielder
Rusty Greer is going to New York for a pitching puzzle named Andy
Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   Or option No. 2 _ try to impress the new bosses in Arlington,
meaning owner Tom Hicks and team president Jim Lites, by sticking
your neck way out there. Trade Greer, throw in that hot-shot third
base prospect named Lamb at Tulsa, and if necessary, give up the
kid, Mateo. Do anything to get to the World Series this season. Or
get canned trying.
</P>
<P>
   But if successful, what a nice kiss-up move from Melvin to Hicks
_ a World Series in Arlington to go along with Tom's new Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The inclination is to think Melvin will sit tight behind door
No. 1, but that means you weren't paying attention last July. A
huge gamble went down at the trading deadline, and St. Louis is
still chuckling over the steal of young third baseman Fernando
Tatis. The only consolation for the Rangers is the trade helped win
the division, and that shortstop Royce Clayton is much better than
what he has shown thus far this season.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, as we know, is not scared. Which is my point. This is a
season to be more realistic than brave.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers can win the AL West with what they have. Unless,
however, a surprise deal suddenly pops open, there is no trade out
there to transform the Rangers into a prime World Series contender.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hicks is pushing to win by whatever means, but to
his credit has become a huge discipline of long-term growth through
the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks isn't going to say it publicly, and Melvin certainly
won't, but even with $70 million worth of payroll, the pieces
aren't right yet for a World Series this season.
</P>
<P>
   And as someone who always preached the
win-now-at-any-minor-league-cost philosophy, here's a curveball:
</P>
<P>
   Sit tight, Doug Melvin. Try to tweak the rotation with a
mid-range deal, but wait on 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of reasons for my crawfishing. Hicks now
gives the Rangers all the financial muscle they need in the
off-season free-agent market. Granted, the pickings will be slim
this winter (Kenny Rogers, Chuck Finley, Juan Guzman, etc.), but
the Rangers will now always be a strong player in this area. Or in
chasing a high-dollar pitcher another team can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   And the second factor is the Rangers now have a farm system that
is beginning to hum with prospects. The drought is over. It is only
a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   The farm system has given them a sensation in Zimmerman and a
reliable lefty in Mike Venafro for the bullpen this season. Free
agency brought in Rafael Palmeiro, the best sign of the off-season
by any team.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin flunked on veteran free-agent pitcher Mark Clark, but out
of nowhere, 39-year old Mike Morgan has done what Clark was
supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo arrived a bit sooner than expected, struggled early,
but is beginning to bloom. He's a center-field star waiting to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   For short-term and long-term the Rangers have never been this
well-positioned. After 28 years, why suddenly rush it, or screw it
up?
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus for the trading deadline is on winning now, but my
goal is to also be winning four and five years from now,'' said
Melvin. ``With Mr. Hicks, we will do what's necessary to win. But
he's the first to tell me to do what's right for the future good of
the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   It's coming in Arlington, it's just not there yet. More
patience, please.

FENDERS ON INDY-CAR DOES NOT FLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who follows motorsports knows that superspeedway
developer Bruton Smith and his right-hand man, H.A. ``Humpy''
Wheeler, are two of the most innovative thinkers in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Their list of pioneering ideas includes racetrack condominiums,
amenities like swank restaurants and health clubs, introduction of
personal seat licenses and taking stock-car racing to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Those initiatives _ every one a home run _ have made Smith and
Wheeler powerful and wealthy men.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a swing-and-a-miss along the way. Let's not
forget the dual-banking concept that created controversy and havoc
through the 24-degree turns at Texas Motor Speedway before the
racetrack was reconfigured and repaved last summer.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to Smith's latest ``cause celebre'' _ the
proposed introduction of fenders on Indy-cars as fielded by the Pep
Boys Indy Racing League. In the name of increased spectator safety
_ and greater sponsor visibility _ Smith and Wheeler have submitted
drawings of Indy-cars with fenders to IRL founder Tony George and
Leo Mehl, the organization's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   TMS is home to two of five IRL events run at Smith-owned
facilities in 1999. The IRL season will end in Fort Worth on Oct.
17. Will that be the last Indy Racing League event run at an SMI
facility?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, mainly because both parties need each other
to survive. But in spite of the success the IRL has enjoyed at TMS
since June 1997, TMS executive vice president and general manager
Eddie Gossage has not signed a sanction agreement for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Wheeler have been championing the fendered concept
since early May, when a three-car crash at Smith's Lowe's Motor
Speedway in Concord, N.C., sent a wheel and debris flying into the
grandstands. Three spectators were killed and eight injured in that
incident. While SMI's concern for spectator safety is admirable,
the idea of putting fenders on Indy-cars falls into the category of
dual-banking.
</P>
<P>
   It's a swing-and-a-miss.
</P>
<P>
   If you put fenders on open-wheel cars, they obviously are no
longer open-wheel cars and by definition no longer Indy-cars. They
have no connection with racing conducted at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway since 1911, one of the reasons George founded the IRL in
1994. What Smith and Wheeler envision are cars that resemble Can-Am
cars, which are in museums, or World Sports Car prototypes, which
do not race on ovals, or the Batmobile, of which there is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start closing the fenders in, you're going to run into
other problems,'' said Fort Worth's Johnny Rutherford, a three-time
Indy 500 champion and the IRL's director of special events. ``Did
you see the full-bodied Mercedes take off at LeMans?''
</P>
<P>
   The front end of a closed-coupe Mercedes-Benz prototype lifted
during the 24 Hours of LeMans last month. The car flipped five
times before landing on its roof _ fortunately in a clearing
surrounded by trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of throwing a wheel into the stands,'' Rutherford
said, ``you could end up throwing the whole car up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Lowe's tragedy, the IRL has mandated installation of a
cable restraint system designed to keep the wheels attached to each
car's tub. Engine horsepower has been cut and will be further
reduced next year. Meanwhile, SMI uniformly has raised the height
of the catch fencing at its tracks that play host to IRL events by
6 feet, from 15 to 21 feet.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith and Wheeler are determined to do away with open-wheel
racing at their tracks, they might want to consider creating a
fendered ``Indy-car'' series of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no need to reinvent open-wheel racing. On this idea,
they have swung-and-missed.
SPOTLIGHT ON...
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte envisions new Hendrick team spirit
Perhaps it's time to start referring to Hendrick Motorsports as
Team Turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach, driver of the forever star-crossed No. 25
Budweiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo, reportedly will not be rehired for
the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte, a two-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion, began his
off-week on Tuesday denying rumors that he was headed for Robert
Yates Racing in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And with each completed race, three-time and reigning Cup
champion Jeff Gordon's hopes for a third consecutive title are
evaporating like Unocal 76 fumes.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Dallenbach's impending pink slip was interesting,
in light of Labonte's comments during a national teleconference
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really working toward working more together like we used
to,'' said Labonte, driver of the No. 5 Kellogg's Chevy. ``We kind
of went in separate directions a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a back-handed reference to the
communication/cooperation gap that opened between Gordon and crew
chief Ray Evernham during their magnificent run the past two years
and the teams fielded for Labonte and Dallenbach. Specifically,
that gap widened during the court-ordered house arrest of team
owner Rick Hendrick, who also has been battling bone cancer since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick's leukemia now is in remission, and he is more involved
at the shop. Meanwhile, Gordon and Evernham have proven to be mere
mortals _ as their four DNFs and fifth-place points standing in the
heretofore bulletproof No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevy
indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte envisions renewed chemistry developing between the
crews, beginning with more standardized Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good opportunity to do this while we're
building these new cars for next season,'' said Labonte, referring
to the redesigned 2000 Monte Carlo. ``You have to have the whole
package, and actually the cars are built kind of different by the
three teams. So it's hard to go down and say, `Give us your spring
and shock setups' and put it in the car and have it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're trying to do for next year. I think we're
stronger when we work together. It's not that we haven't been
working together, but we haven't been working near as well as we
could have been and as well as we're planning on being.''
\Nsubheds:INSIDE THE NUMBERS All for one? NASCAR powerhouse
Hendrick Motorsports has placed two drivers inside the Winston Cup
points top 10 after 18 of 34 races. But even three-time and
reigning champion Jeff Gordon's bid for a record-tying third
consecutive title is fading fast, considering he is nearly 400
points behind series leader Dale Jarrett. A statistical look at

\Nsubheds:QUICK HITS TMS races to ABC The season-ending Pep Boys
Indy Racing League event at Texas Motor Speedway on Oct. 17 has
received a TV upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Originally scheduled for the Fox Sports Network on a regional
basis, the race instead will be televised nationally by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are details still left to be worked out, but the race is
going to be on ABC,'' said Eddie Gossage, executive vice president
and general manager of TMS. ``We've been working to upgrade the TV
package, and we're going from a regional series of cable networks
to one of the big four. From the standpoint of reach, that's a big
improvement for TMS and the IRL.''
</P>
<P>
   The race remains scheduled for a 1 p.m. start. But that could
change at the network's suggestion. \Nsubheds:Hill to soldier on
Damon Hill's fifth-place finish Sunday in the British Grand Prix
has rejuvenated his desire to remain in Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 World Driving Champion announced yesterday that he
would complete the season with Jordan Formula One. Hill, 38, had
threatened to quit after crashing out of last month's French Grand
Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who has scored five championship points this season, is
scheduled to rejoin the team for testing at Monza, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is third in the constructors' championship. Hill's
teammate, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, is fourth with 26 points and eight
races remaining. \Nsubheds:Stewart apologizes NASCAR rookie
sensation Tony Stewart has apologized for dissing the media after
running out of fuel while leading the Jiffy Lube 300 last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, sixth in Cup points, was two laps from winning his
first Winston Cup race when he ran out of fuel. Stewart chugged
home 10th. Rather than meet the media afterward, he remained in his
team's trailer while crew chief Greg Zipadelli explained what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inexcusable to do what I did,'' said Stewart, driver of
the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac Grand Prix. ``I apologize to
everybody I inconvenienced. There was a lack of maturity there.
It's something I'm going to work on. It wasn't because I was trying
to be mean to the press. I was real consumed by the emotions. When
you work so hard and lose the way we did, it's hard to deal with
the emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``By time I got home, I felt bad. We all hope it's going to blow
over.'' \Nsubheds:Last words ``I really believe we can be a
championship contender. We're 30 points out, but that definitely is
within striking distance.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Oh, behave!
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, are we ever in one another's faces these days. There's such
a din of scolding and moral haranguing that the nation sounds less
like a republic going about its civic business than a preaching
contest with the pulpits in a shouting match.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, though itself never one of the recognized shrines of
moral instruction, thinks that whatever ails our kids _ and it is
assumed that much does _ will be cured by having public school
pupils hauled into passing proximity with one or another version of
the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   As another cure to what adults think is wrong with other
people's children, Louisiana has passed a law requiring students to
refer to their teachers as ``sir'' or ``ma'am.'' And if that
doesn't stop the little thugs from wearing their baseball caps
stupidly backwards, maybe a statute requiring them to curtsy and
bow would do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Brandi Chastain, in her exuberance at having just converted
the penalty kick that gave the U.S. women the World Cup, whipped
off her jersey and waved it like a flag. This exposed her decidedly
unsexy, no-jiggle sports top _ and exposed the rest of her to some
of the stoutest moral huffing of this indignant season.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that many women jog similarly attired, to no known
remonstrance. One newspaper editorial sniffed that Chastain is a
poor role model and hero and an offense to soccer moms everywhere.
Oh, grow up.
</P>
<P>
   And as if all that, and more of the same, were not enough, we've
got God pitching us from billboards _ and an insufferably
cutesy-poo God at that.
</P>
<P>
   He's saying, or she is, things like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep using my name in vain and I'll make the rush hour
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That `Love Thy Neighbor' thing? I meant it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make me come down there.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Have you read my number 1 bestseller? There will be a
test.''
</P>
<P>
   These and more are quips in the ``God Speaks'' campaign, and
although God may, as widely reported, move in mysterious ways, I
hope I shatter no one's faith by telling you this is not really God
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is the Washington, D.C.-based Outdoor Advertising
Association speaking and _ just a hunch _ rather less for God than
for the 900 member companies it lobbies for. It is putting up
10,000 of these billboards in 40 states, seeking innocence by
association.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no theologian, but I doubt that God would speak, as these
billboards do, in the voice of George Burns, who played him in a
couple of movies, or that he would speak in a manner that
notoriously fouls his own creation. God, I'm guessing, is not an
eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it's pointless to note that this in-your-face
moralizing is tedious and will get us nowhere and that the same
amount of energy directed to, oh, uplifting the poor, squaring up
Social Security and Medicare, toning down the gunfire and saving
patients from their health insurers might actually spruce up life.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry for the moralizing.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SCANNING THE NATION'S HATE CRIME AGENDA
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Come November, President Clinton plans to convene a
White House conference on hate crimes, which the FBI says have more
than doubled in the past decade. Although that issue touches some
raw nerves, it's unlikely that this gathering will explore them.
</P>
<P>
   Before November, Clinton hopes to sign into law a Hate Crimes
Prevention Act. There's a good chance he'll succeed, since the bill
already enjoys 40 co-sponsors in the Senate and 180 in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever local authorities fail to act, the bill empowers the
Justice Department to prosecute offenses based on race and religion
(already covered under a prior statute) as well as national origin,
gender, sexual orientation or disability. Before it can move, the
attorney general must certify that the prosecution ``is in the
public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice.''
</P>
<P>
   That trigger fails to mollify the Family Research Council, which
sees the bill as a lever to undermine the First Amendment by
punishing ``thought crime'' and making ``name-calling'' a ``federal
case.'' The conservative group also argues that the legislation
would create ``favored classes of victims'' _ gays and lesbians _
contrary to the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Smith serves as the posthumous poster boy of the hate
crimes bill. Smith, 21, killed himself as police closed in on his
stolen van after he drove through Illinois and Indiana shooting at
blacks, Orthodox Jews and Asians. Two of his victims died after
being shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to root out evil, could the feds bring charges
against the World Church of the Creator, an anti-black,
anti-Christian, anti-Jewish organization? (Before his deadly
rampage, Smith had placed about 2,000 World Church fliers under
windshields in Bloomington, Ind., exalting the ``Great White Race''
and assailing what the group termed ``a deceitful, alien
government, a controlled media, and a suicidal religion.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, but not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years ago, the Supreme Court held in Brandenburg v. Ohio
that the government is constitutionally barred from forbidding
``advocacy of the use of force or of law violation'' unless ``such
advocacy is directed toward inciting or producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or produce such action.'' The
Brandenburg ruling raises a constitutional shield over the World
Church's hateful message.
</P>
<P>
   But if hate groups have rights, so should their victims: 1997
saw an 8 percent rise in reported hate crimes based on sexual
orientation alone, making anti-gay crime the third-highest category
reported to the FBI, after race and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Even as those statistics roll in, the Vatican has ordered an
American priest and a nun to end their ministry to gay men and
lesbians, asserting that the pair's long-term work is incompatible
with the church's stance that homosexual activity is immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could do worse than to ask clerics from the Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith, the church body charged with
safeguarding its teaching, to join religious folk, cops and victims
at his upcoming hate crime conference.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the same agenda.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Picture this. You're watching ``Friends'' on your new
interactive television and love the BCBG cropped pants Rachel is
wearing. You click on the pants with your remote, see a list of
what colors and sizes they come in and order them directly from
your screen.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the pants show up at your doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   With the touch of a button _ and without ever leaving your couch
_ you can dress just like some of the hottest stars on TV today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually happening today, very quietly,'' said Larry
Namer, chairman of Steeplechase Media, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
interactive television content developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday, if you have Web TV, or a PC with Web for Windows
and a TV tuner card, you can watch `Judge Judy' and interact with
the show. You can click on the chat button and get into the
Internet chat room and watch `Judge Judy' at the same time. You can
guess how Judy will decide the case, or get information on the
plaintiff. You can click on Judge Judy's book and order it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clothes are not for sale, the technology is in
place to allow that, Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people reject home shopping, he said, this will be
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Namer, 1.1 million homes in America have the
capacity for interactive TV. Some 800,000 of them are Web TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 44 million home computer screens that don't show
TV. Web for Windows allows a computer to be a TV set too. Many
computers today are being sold with TV tuner cards that can turn
them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any
Day Now'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that
can be ordered through bloomingdales.com, or a purple cardigan sold
at saksincorporated.com. A pair of gray pants directs you to
Barneys New York's Manhattan store.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, items can be purchased only through manufacturers and
retailers, but eventually the site's creators hope to handle sales
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Stylebranding, a New York-based firm, has been
developing technology and fulfillment capabilities to sell
merchandise from TV shows. It has asked several apparel and
home-furnishings companies to supply their products, on
consignment, so they can be incorporated into the TV characters'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise will then be sold from a web site that's in
development. It has been showing its concept to the networks and is
currently in talks with NBC, said Joan Abraham, president and
executive producer of Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will be able to go into a character's closet on the
web site and see and buy different looks a particular character
might wear, even though the character doesn't necessarily wear them
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to do this with established programming and new
programming,'' said Bill Liptack, media executive with
Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed TV pilots that have merchandising
opportunities, as well, and has been talking to companies about
sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Stylebranding will offer back-end facilities through third-party
resources, providing e-commerce activity, including credit
checking, warehousing, picking, packing and custom shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sami, vice president, business development for NBC,
said, ``We have been looking at a couple of programs currently and
looking at ways we might be able to identify certain products that
we think people would have an interest in. I don't think it will
happen in a full-scale fashion in September. We're hopeful we might
have one program in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, NBC acquired a 19.9 percent interest in Valuevision,
the third largest TV shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to them about creating a seamless loop
between their shopping network and their web site _ and in turn to
promote some of that through NBC,'' Sami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a careful study and we're looking at
one or two programs that would kick this process off. I wouldn't
really want to use `Friends' as a testing ground. There are a
couple of reasons. One, we would be looking more toward shows we
totally own. `Will and Grace' could be one. And I really think soap
operas do lend themselves to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shows are a particularly good avenue for selling
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are extremely loyal and they like to connect with
their shows in many different ways. This is a continual story and
continual characters that our viewers know better than they know
their own families,'' said Sallie Schoneboom, director of media
relations for ABC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is in the early stages of exploring e-commerce
from its TV shows, a spokeswoman said. She noted that a line of
pajamas called Ism, based on ``Ally McBeal,'' is available at
Bloomingdale's, Jacobson's, Macy's East and Fred Segal.
</P>
<P>
   One company, TVstyle.com is already set up to sell merchandise
featured on major network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall
season,'' Roderick said. Her company is putting the content
together with various studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to have equity in our company,'' she
said, but she couldn't divulge the name of the shows or studios
yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''

   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?

   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming

   NEW YORK _ Critics have blamed Austin Powers for many things,
including an elusive sense of good taste. Now they can add one
more: That international man of mystery, now romping across the
nation's movie screens in one of the summer's blockbuster movies,
might singlehandedly be bringing psychedelia back to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Groovy, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lloyd Singer, president of ABS Allen Schwartz, sees it,
``Consumers needed the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers, he said, was that signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make the '60s Mod looks more mainstream,'' said
Singer, who increased offerings of psychedelic prints from 10 to 30
percent for fall/holiday selling, because of the movie's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ABS's other Austin Powers-inspired looks are aqua peasant
blouses and lace pants with bell flares.
</P>
<P>
   Singer isn't alone. Other fashion executives believe that
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' just might help raise
hemlines and further push hot pink and bright orange into pop
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion observers pointed out that the movie, which features
Heather Graham in such styles as HotPants, over-the-knee boots and
bright pink and orange micromini crocheted dresses, is a refreshing
departure after ``Elizabeth,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' Those films, said retailers, helped spur sales of romantic
styles, such as ruffled shirts, but the fashions were serious.
</P>
<P>
   The new Austin Powers movie is believed by Singer and others to
be much more of a fashion influence than the original film _
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' _ which came out
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that movie was set in the '90s, and the parts that took
place in the '60s were handled differently than those in the
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more in the world of pop art,'' said Deena Appel,
costume designer for both movies. ``There was a lot of vinyl.
Fashion was also doing a lot of vinyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel said she wanted the sequel to have an explosion of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can directly pluck everything out of the
film and wear it on the street, but we are becoming more
comfortable with color,'' Appel said. ``This is certainly the year
of pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they believe their consumers are relating
to the Austin Powers sequel _ at least as far as fashion is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about it is the optimism and the freshness that
people haven't seen in a while,'' said James Aguiar, fashion
director for women's ready-to-wear at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't used to so much color. I think people won't be
as afraid of prints, and they won't be afraid of going around in
microminis. I went to the movie with a friend of mine, and she told
me it made her realize how boring we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar said the movie has ``certainly helped'' push sales of
shift dresses by Girlfriend in Pucci-inspired prints and geometric
patterns. The dresses, which retail for $200, are ``blowing out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar added that Voyage's brightly colored camisoles and
scarves, as well as its skirts, are also doing well. In addition,
he believes that the sequel could help push sales of crocheted
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movie is definitely helping,'' said Ed Burstell,
general manager at Henri Bendel. ``It will push everything out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, attributed booming sales of Girlfriend's brightly
colored designs in part to the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will subliminally push the '60s and '70s trends,'' said
Kalman Ruttenstein, fashion director at Bloomingdale's, adding that
he liked the crochet dresses in the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short hemlines have been in the wind, and we are starting to
sell short right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's is working with several of its private
label suppliers to develop a junior line inspired by the film,
according to Robin Schuellein, the junior tops buyer. She said she
wants to develop a line of Hippie Chic clothing and plans to
promote it with images from the movie.

   NEW YORK _ Picture this. You're watching ``Friends'' on your new
interactive television and love the BCBG cropped pants Rachel is
wearing. You click on the pants with your remote, see a list of
what colors and sizes they come in and order them directly from
your screen.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the pants show up at your doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   With the touch of a button _ and without ever leaving your couch
_ you can dress just like some of the hottest stars on TV today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually happening today, very quietly,'' said Larry
Namer, chairman of Steeplechase Media, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
interactive television content developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday, if you have Web TV, or a PC with Web for Windows
and a TV tuner card, you can watch `Judge Judy' and interact with
the show. You can click on the chat button and get into the
Internet chat room and watch `Judge Judy' at the same time. You can
guess how Judy will decide the case, or get information on the
plaintiff. You can click on Judge Judy's book and order it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clothes are not for sale, the technology is in
place to allow that, Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people reject home shopping, he said, this will be
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Namer, 1.1 million homes in America have the
capacity for interactive TV. Some 800,000 of them are Web TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 44 million home computer screens that don't show
TV. Web for Windows allows a computer to be a TV set too. Many
computers today are being sold with TV tuner cards that can turn
them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any
Day Now'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that
can be ordered through bloomingdales.com, or a purple cardigan sold
at saksincorporated.com. A pair of gray pants directs you to
Barneys New York's Manhattan store.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, items can be purchased only through manufacturers and
retailers, but eventually the site's creators hope to handle sales
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Stylebranding, a New York-based firm, has been
developing technology and fulfillment capabilities to sell
merchandise from TV shows. It has asked several apparel and
home-furnishings companies to supply their products, on
consignment, so they can be incorporated into the TV characters'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise will then be sold from a web site that's in
development. It has been showing its concept to the networks and is
currently in talks with NBC, said Joan Abraham, president and
executive producer of Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will be able to go into a character's closet on the
web site and see and buy different looks a particular character
might wear, even though the character doesn't necessarily wear them
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to do this with established programming and new
programming,'' said Bill Liptack, media executive with
Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed TV pilots that have merchandising
opportunities, as well, and has been talking to companies about
sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Stylebranding will offer back-end facilities through third-party
resources, providing e-commerce activity, including credit
checking, warehousing, picking, packing and custom shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sami, vice president, business development for NBC,
said, ``We have been looking at a couple of programs currently and
looking at ways we might be able to identify certain products that
we think people would have an interest in. I don't think it will
happen in a full-scale fashion in September. We're hopeful we might
have one program in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, NBC acquired a 19.9 percent interest in Valuevision,
the third largest TV shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to them about creating a seamless loop
between their shopping network and their web site _ and in turn to
promote some of that through NBC,'' Sami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a careful study and we're looking at
one or two programs that would kick this process off. I wouldn't
really want to use `Friends' as a testing ground. There are a
couple of reasons. One, we would be looking more toward shows we
totally own. `Will and Grace' could be one. And I really think soap
operas do lend themselves to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shows are a particularly good avenue for selling
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are extremely loyal and they like to connect with
their shows in many different ways. This is a continual story and
continual characters that our viewers know better than they know
their own families,'' said Sallie Schoneboom, director of media
relations for ABC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is in the early stages of exploring e-commerce
from its TV shows, a spokeswoman said. She noted that a line of
pajamas called Ism, based on ``Ally McBeal,'' is available at
Bloomingdale's, Jacobson's, Macy's East and Fred Segal.
</P>
<P>
   One company, TVstyle.com is already set up to sell merchandise
featured on major network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall
season,'' Roderick said. Her company is putting the content
together with various studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to have equity in our company,'' she
said, but she couldn't divulge the name of the shows or studios
yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any
Day Now'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that
can be ordered through bloomingdales.com, or a purple cardigan sold
at saksincorporated.com. A pair of gray pants directs you to
Barneys New York's Manhattan store.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, items can be purchased only through manufacturers and
retailers, but eventually the site's creators hope to handle sales
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Stylebranding, a New York-based firm, has been
developing technology and fulfillment capabilities to sell
merchandise from TV shows. It has asked several apparel and
home-furnishings companies to supply their products, on
consignment, so they can be incorporated into the TV characters'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise will then be sold from a web site that's in
development. It has been showing its concept to the networks and is
currently in talks with NBC, said Joan Abraham, president and
executive producer of Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will be able to go into a character's closet on the
web site and see and buy different looks a particular character
might wear, even though the character doesn't necessarily wear them
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to do this with established programming and new
programming,'' said Bill Liptack, media executive with
Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed TV pilots that have merchandising
opportunities, as well, and has been talking to companies about
sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Stylebranding will offer back-end facilities through third-party
resources, providing e-commerce activity, including credit
checking, warehousing, picking, packing and custom shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sami, vice president, business development for NBC,
said, ``We have been looking at a couple of programs currently and
looking at ways we might be able to identify certain products that
we think people would have an interest in. I don't think it will
happen in a full-scale fashion in September. We're hopeful we might
have one program in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, NBC acquired a 19.9 percent interest in Valuevision,
the third largest TV shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to them about creating a seamless loop
between their shopping network and their web site _ and in turn to
promote some of that through NBC,'' Sami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a careful study and we're looking at
one or two programs that would kick this process off. I wouldn't
really want to use `Friends' as a testing ground. There are a
couple of reasons. One, we would be looking more toward shows we
totally own. `Will and Grace' could be one. And I really think soap
operas do lend themselves to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shows are a particularly good avenue for selling
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are extremely loyal and they like to connect with
their shows in many different ways. This is a continual story and
continual characters that our viewers know better than they know
their own families,'' said Sallie Schoneboom, director of media
relations for ABC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is in the early stages of exploring e-commerce
from its TV shows, a spokeswoman said. She noted that a line of
pajamas called Ism, based on ``Ally McBeal,'' is available at
Bloomingdale's, Jacobson's, Macy's East and Fred Segal.
</P>
<P>
   One company, TVstyle.com is already set up to sell merchandise
featured on major network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall
season,'' Roderick said. Her company is putting the content
together with various studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to have equity in our company,'' she
said, but she couldn't divulge the name of the shows or studios
yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Critics have blamed Austin Powers for many things,
including an elusive sense of good taste. Now they can add one
more: That international man of mystery, now romping across the
nation's movie screens in one of the summer's blockbuster movies,
might singlehandedly be bringing psychedelia back to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Groovy, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lloyd Singer, president of ABS Allen Schwartz, sees it,
``Consumers needed the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers, he said, was that signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make the '60s Mod looks more mainstream,'' said
Singer, who increased offerings of psychedelic prints from 10 to 30
percent for fall/holiday selling, because of the movie's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ABS's other Austin Powers-inspired looks are aqua peasant
blouses and lace pants with bell flares.
</P>
<P>
   Singer isn't alone. Other fashion executives believe that
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' just might help raise
hemlines and further push hot pink and bright orange into pop
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion observers pointed out that the movie, which features
Heather Graham in such styles as HotPants, over-the-knee boots and
bright pink and orange micromini crocheted dresses, is a refreshing
departure after ``Elizabeth,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' Those films, said retailers, helped spur sales of romantic
styles, such as ruffled shirts, but the fashions were serious.
</P>
<P>
   The new Austin Powers movie is believed by Singer and others to
be much more of a fashion influence than the original film _
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' _ which came out
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that movie was set in the '90s, and the parts that took
place in the '60s were handled differently than those in the
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more in the world of pop art,'' said Deena Appel,
costume designer for both movies. ``There was a lot of vinyl.
Fashion was also doing a lot of vinyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel said she wanted the sequel to have an explosion of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can directly pluck everything out of the
film and wear it on the street, but we are becoming more
comfortable with color,'' Appel said. ``This is certainly the year
of pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they believe their consumers are relating
to the Austin Powers sequel _ at least as far as fashion is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about it is the optimism and the freshness that
people haven't seen in a while,'' said James Aguiar, fashion
director for women's ready-to-wear at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't used to so much color. I think people won't be
as afraid of prints, and they won't be afraid of going around in
microminis. I went to the movie with a friend of mine, and she told
me it made her realize how boring we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar said the movie has ``certainly helped'' push sales of
shift dresses by Girlfriend in Pucci-inspired prints and geometric
patterns. The dresses, which retail for $200, are ``blowing out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar added that Voyage's brightly colored camisoles and
scarves, as well as its skirts, are also doing well. In addition,
he believes that the sequel could help push sales of crocheted
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movie is definitely helping,'' said Ed Burstell,
general manager at Henri Bendel. ``It will push everything out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, attributed booming sales of Girlfriend's brightly
colored designs in part to the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will subliminally push the '60s and '70s trends,'' said
Kalman Ruttenstein, fashion director at Bloomingdale's, adding that
he liked the crochet dresses in the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short hemlines have been in the wind, and we are starting to
sell short right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's is working with several of its private
label suppliers to develop a junior line inspired by the film,
according to Robin Schuellein, the junior tops buyer. She said she
wants to develop a line of Hippie Chic clothing and plans to
promote it with images from the movie.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Picture this. You're watching ``Friends'' on your new
interactive television and love the BCBG cropped pants Rachel is
wearing. You click on the pants with your remote, see a list of
what colors and sizes they come in and order them directly from
your screen.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the pants show up at your doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   With the touch of a button _ and without ever leaving your couch
_ you can dress just like some of the hottest stars on TV today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually happening today, very quietly,'' said Larry
Namer, chairman of Steeplechase Media, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
interactive television content developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday, if you have Web TV, or a PC with Web for Windows
and a TV tuner card, you can watch `Judge Judy' and interact with
the show. You can click on the chat button and get into the
Internet chat room and watch `Judge Judy' at the same time. You can
guess how Judy will decide the case, or get information on the
plaintiff. You can click on Judge Judy's book and order it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clothes are not for sale, the technology is in
place to allow that, Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people reject home shopping, he said, this will be
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Namer, 1.1 million homes in America have the
capacity for interactive TV. Some 800,000 of them are Web TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 44 million home computer screens that don't show
TV. Web for Windows allows a computer to be a TV set too. Many
computers today are being sold with TV tuner cards that can turn
them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any

</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.

   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that

   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall
season,'' Roderick said. Her company is putting the content
together with various studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to have equity in our company,'' she
said, but she couldn't divulge the name of the shows or studios
yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Picture this. You're watching ``Friends'' on your new
interactive television and love the BCBG cropped pants Rachel is
wearing. You click on the pants with your remote, see a list of
what colors and sizes they come in and order them directly from
your screen.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the pants show up at your doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   With the touch of a button _ and without ever leaving your couch
_ you can dress just like some of the hottest stars on TV today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually happening today, very quietly,'' said Larry
Namer, chairman of Steeplechase Media, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
interactive television content developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday, if you have Web TV, or a PC with Web for Windows
and a TV tuner card, you can watch `Judge Judy' and interact with
the show. You can click on the chat button and get into the
Internet chat room and watch `Judge Judy' at the same time. You can
guess how Judy will decide the case, or get information on the
plaintiff. You can click on Judge Judy's book and order it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clothes are not for sale, the technology is in
place to allow that, Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people reject home shopping, he said, this will be
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Namer, 1.1 million homes in America have the
capacity for interactive TV. Some 800,000 of them are Web TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 44 million home computer screens that don't show
TV. Web for Windows allows a computer to be a TV set too. Many
computers today are being sold with TV tuner cards that can turn
them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any
Day Now'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that
can be ordered through bloomingdales.com, or a purple cardigan sold
at saksincorporated.com. A pair of gray pants directs you to
Barneys New York's Manhattan store.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, items can be purchased only through manufacturers and
retailers, but eventually the site's creators hope to handle sales
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Stylebranding, a New York-based firm, has been
developing technology and fulfillment capabilities to sell
merchandise from TV shows. It has asked several apparel and
home-furnishings companies to supply their products, on
consignment, so they can be incorporated into the TV characters'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise will then be sold from a web site that's in
development. It has been showing its concept to the networks and is
currently in talks with NBC, said Joan Abraham, president and
executive producer of Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will be able to go into a character's closet on the
web site and see and buy different looks a particular character
might wear, even though the character doesn't necessarily wear them
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to do this with established programming and new
programming,'' said Bill Liptack, media executive with
Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed TV pilots that have merchandising
opportunities, as well, and has been talking to companies about
sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Stylebranding will offer back-end facilities through third-party
resources, providing e-commerce activity, including credit
checking, warehousing, picking, packing and custom shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sami, vice president, business development for NBC,
said, ``We have been looking at a couple of programs currently and
looking at ways we might be able to identify certain products that
we think people would have an interest in. I don't think it will
happen in a full-scale fashion in September. We're hopeful we might
have one program in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, NBC acquired a 19.9 percent interest in Valuevision,
the third largest TV shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to them about creating a seamless loop
between their shopping network and their web site _ and in turn to
promote some of that through NBC,'' Sami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a careful study and we're looking at
one or two programs that would kick this process off. I wouldn't
really want to use `Friends' as a testing ground. There are a
couple of reasons. One, we would be looking more toward shows we
totally own. `Will and Grace' could be one. And I really think soap
operas do lend themselves to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shows are a particularly good avenue for selling
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are extremely loyal and they like to connect with
their shows in many different ways. This is a continual story and
continual characters that our viewers know better than they know
their own families,'' said Sallie Schoneboom, director of media
relations for ABC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is in the early stages of exploring e-commerce
from its TV shows, a spokeswoman said. She noted that a line of
pajamas called Ism, based on ``Ally McBeal,'' is available at
Bloomingdale's, Jacobson's, Macy's East and Fred Segal.
</P>
<P>
   One company, TVstyle.com is already set up to sell merchandise
featured on major network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall

   NEW YORK _ Critics have blamed Austin Powers for many things,
including an elusive sense of good taste. Now they can add one
more: That international man of mystery, now romping across the
nation's movie screens in one of the summer's blockbuster movies,
might singlehandedly be bringing psychedelia back to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Groovy, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lloyd Singer, president of ABS Allen Schwartz, sees it,
``Consumers needed the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers, he said, was that signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make the '60s Mod looks more mainstream,'' said
Singer, who increased offerings of psychedelic prints from 10 to 30
percent for fall/holiday selling, because of the movie's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ABS's other Austin Powers-inspired looks are aqua peasant
blouses and lace pants with bell flares.
</P>
<P>
   Singer isn't alone. Other fashion executives believe that
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' just might help raise
hemlines and further push hot pink and bright orange into pop
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion observers pointed out that the movie, which features
Heather Graham in such styles as HotPants, over-the-knee boots and
bright pink and orange micromini crocheted dresses, is a refreshing
departure after ``Elizabeth,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' Those films, said retailers, helped spur sales of romantic
styles, such as ruffled shirts, but the fashions were serious.
</P>
<P>
   The new Austin Powers movie is believed by Singer and others to
be much more of a fashion influence than the original film _
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' _ which came out
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that movie was set in the '90s, and the parts that took
place in the '60s were handled differently than those in the
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more in the world of pop art,'' said Deena Appel,
costume designer for both movies. ``There was a lot of vinyl.
Fashion was also doing a lot of vinyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel said she wanted the sequel to have an explosion of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can directly pluck everything out of the
film and wear it on the street, but we are becoming more
comfortable with color,'' Appel said. ``This is certainly the year
of pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they believe their consumers are relating
to the Austin Powers sequel _ at least as far as fashion is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about it is the optimism and the freshness that
people haven't seen in a while,'' said James Aguiar, fashion
director for women's ready-to-wear at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't used to so much color. I think people won't be
as afraid of prints, and they won't be afraid of going around in
microminis. I went to the movie with a friend of mine, and she told
me it made her realize how boring we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar said the movie has ``certainly helped'' push sales of
shift dresses by Girlfriend in Pucci-inspired prints and geometric
patterns. The dresses, which retail for $200, are ``blowing out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar added that Voyage's brightly colored camisoles and
scarves, as well as its skirts, are also doing well. In addition,
he believes that the sequel could help push sales of crocheted
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movie is definitely helping,'' said Ed Burstell,
general manager at Henri Bendel. ``It will push everything out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, attributed booming sales of Girlfriend's brightly
colored designs in part to the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will subliminally push the '60s and '70s trends,'' said
Kalman Ruttenstein, fashion director at Bloomingdale's, adding that
he liked the crochet dresses in the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short hemlines have been in the wind, and we are starting to
sell short right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's is working with several of its private
label suppliers to develop a junior line inspired by the film,
according to Robin Schuellein, the junior tops buyer. She said she
wants to develop a line of Hippie Chic clothing and plans to
promote it with images from the movie.

 &HT;    MILLENNIUM EVE A TEMPTING TIME FOR TERRORISTS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On New Year's Eve, millions of people will look up
at midnight to watch fireworks erupting into bright blooms of
color. But security experts fear that in some places, the
thunderous booms will come from real bombs bursting in air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Jan. 1 will probably set an all-time record for the
number of bombings in a single day,'' said Neil Livingstone, chief
executive of GlobalOptions, a Washington-based crisis management
firm. ``We have every reason to believe that people are going to
try to mark that date'' for acts of terrorism, both in the United
States and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone said the risk of terrorism could be considerable for
several reasons. For one, very large crowds will be gathered in
easily accessible spots, with plenty of TV cameras rolling. A
terrorist group that wants to make global headlines might well
target New York City's Times Square, where throngs will be
assembled and police will have relatively little control.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many wealthy, powerful people will be staging elaborate
parties in exotic locations where terrorist groups have operations.
For example, thousands of well-heeled travelers plan to watch the
dawn of the year 2000 in the shadow of the Egyptian pyramids.
Terrorists have often targeted tourists in Egypt and probably will
find the New Year's parties exceptionally inviting marks,
Livingstone predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight madness might also be unleashed by doomsday cult
members who believe Jan. 1 will trigger an apocalypse. To make sure
their predictions come true, the groups might try shaking up the
world by exploding bombs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, terrorists may choose Dec. 31 as a target because
of the so-called Y2K bug, a widespread software flaw that could
cause many computers to misread the date rollover. If computers
malfunction amid the date confusion, all sorts of systems might go
haywire, leaving some cities without power, properly functioning
traffic lights or other vital services. Without electricity and
properly functioning 911 phone lines, cities could be very
vulnerable to attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics might note that Livingstone's company stands to profit
from fears about Jan. 1 chaos. But at least one national security
heavyweight backs up Livingstone's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Admiral William Crowe, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
under Presidents Reagan and Bush, has affiliated himself with the
firm, saying he gets no pay for his advisory work and is motivated
only by concern for his country.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, who appeared recently with Livingstone at a press
conference in Washington, said he fears ``the millennium is going
to usher in a period of intense activity'' among terrorists.
Livingstone and Crowe recommend that individuals, companies and
governments make emergency plans to cope with terrorist attacks and
stock up on vital supplies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Even if terrorists don't strike, travel in some parts of the
world may become very dangerous because of Y2K problems. Last week,
John Koskinen, head of the President's Council on Year 2000, said
the State Department plans to release a list of countries that
should be avoided in late December and January.
</P>
<P>
   The travel advisory, to be issued by Oct. 1, will list countries
in Asia, Africa and Latin America that are so far behind in fixing
Y2K-related problems that the basic infrastructure might fail.
</P>
<P>
   Adventurers who already have reservations for Egypt or other
foreign spots may want to change their plans after hearing Crowe's
assessment or the State Department's warnings. But if they do,
chances are they won't get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurers are warning travelers that cancellations caused by
the Y2K bug may not be covered by traditional vacation insurance
policies. The policies would cover theft losses or medical
treatments caused during Y2K chaos, but not the cost of the plane
ticket if an airline were shut down by computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the ability to file any claim will depend on the
insurer's ability to keep its own computers running. All of which
makes that popcorn party in grandma's basement sound surprisingly
appealing.

 &HT;    One small step for man, and nickels for me
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Thirty years ago, give or take a few days, Neil
Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon _ and I made
about $10 bucks selling an extra edition of the Longview Daily News
to the folks who were on my paper route near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Best as I can recall, the paper published three extras while I
was a paperboy, riding my Schwinn Stingray, silver in color with a
banana seat and chopper handlebars, the green-and-white canvas bag
tied between the wrist grips. The first was when Dwight Eisenhower
died; the second when some rednecks trying to stop integration blew
up the school buses at the barn on July 4, 1969, apparently hoping
the popping of fireworks would mask the sound of a few dozen large
vehicles being blown to kingdom come. Bad plan. They were caught
and convicted in no time. I hope they're still in prison. And the
third extra, a few weeks later, was the moon landing.
</P>
<P>
   Extras, rare beasts that they were, meant pure gold for us
paperboys, who usually had to split our take evenly with the
newspaper. An extra sold for a nickel instead of the usual dime,
and the paperboy kept all the money. I had about 200 customers, so
it was a fast sawbuck back when that would keep a 13-year-old
supplied in soft drinks, comics and Reeses Peanut Buttercups _
still my weakness _ for a week, easily.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cash, which was always paramount to a
lower-middle-class kid with a powerful hankering for the latest
Fantastic Four comic, the next-best part of selling an extra was
getting to yell, (SET ITAL)``Extra! Extra! Read All About It.''(END
ITAL) I did just that, my prepubscent voice cracking horribly. I
believe that is why I'm still in this line of work three decades
later, still waiting for a chance to hit the streets with an issue
that people are just dying to read. At least my voice doesn't crack
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Extras are all-but-extinct, done in by cable television, which
can bring live reports within seconds of an event happening. Still,
one of these days, before I hang up my green eyeshade, I want to
come out with another extra, and if I get the chance I'll be out
there hawking them with the rest of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   I drove by the downtown fire station in my hometown of Longview
some weeks back and spied the brass pole in the truck bay, still
shiny. I slid down that pole the day Armstrong landed on the moon,
after selling a few extras to the firemen lolling on their bunks in
the thick heat of an East Texas summer, landing lightly on my feet
and bounding out of the station to hit the old Sears store next.
One small step for man, one giant leap down a slippery pole for me.
OSHA, trial lawyers and a societal fear of being sued likely assure
the pole is merely a decoration these days.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing about half my route, I was ready to suck in some
needed air conditioning at Sears and peddle some copies to the
sad-eyed appliance salesmen standing around hoping to sell a window
air-conditioning unit to someone tired of trying to stay cool with
an evaporative cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Plow was my next big stop, an imposing place that
manufactured farm implements _ a hot, loud and spooky building to
one with an overactive imagination. It's long gone now, a victim of
progress, but in 1969 the foundry reminded me, years later, when I
read Dante, of one of the circles of hell.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I made my way up Green Street, peddling my product to
the residents of the shotgun houses that hugged Marshall Avenue,
the old Highway 80. I approached an old black woman fanning herself
on the front porch, a normally reliable customer willing to fork
over a dime (regular price) most days for the day's news. I'll call
her Miz Grimes, though her real name is lost to my memory banks.
After 30 years, I'm paraphrasing the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miz Grimes,'' I said. ``We landed on the moon. I'm selling an
extra edition here for a nickel. Want to buy one?''
</P>
<P>
   She fanned herself furiously with her funeral-home fan, a piece
of cardboard stapled on a popsicle stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw, I don't believe I want to truck with that foolishness.
Ain't no man landed on the moon. They just made that stuff up in
the studio. Trick photography, that's all that is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I could not convince her that an American astronaut had landed
on the moon. She never did buy the paper. Exasperated, I tried to
give her the paper, willing to eat the nickel. She pulled back as
if I was trying to hand her the devil's own preamble.
</P>
<P>
   I figure Miz Grimes went to her grave believing the moon shot
was pure fiction. Imagine what she'd think about the Internet, or
all the other new-fangled inventions of the last 30 years. More
trick photography, she'd harrumph.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I don't know. Sometimes I wonder if she might have been
right.

 &HT;    Attitude determines altitude
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Those of us who make our living by stringing
words together in an attempt to make compete sentences are often
criticized for seeming to emphasize the bad news over the good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the essence of what is (SET ITAL)news(END ITAL) is what is
(SET ITAL)new(END ITAL). While the routine is not necessary news,
the out of the ordinary and oftentimes tragic is nearly always
news.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to give readers a glimpse of what happened in the
world for one day, we give more coverage to the extraordinary than
the ordinary. Not because we take delight in it, but because it is
what is (SET ITAL)news(END ITAL).
</P>
<P>
   So to inject a little something positive into your day, I offer
these words sent to me via e-mail that put ordinary lives in
extraordinary perspective.
</P>
<P>
   I woke up early today, excited over all I get to do before the
clock strikes midnight. I have responsibilities to fulfill today.
</P>
<P>
   My job is to choose what kind of day I am going to have.
</P>
<P>
   Today I can complain because the weather is rainy or I can be
thankful the grass is getting watered for free.
</P>
<P>
   Today I can feel sad I don't have more money or I can be glad my
finances encourage me to make my purchases wisely and guide me away
from waste.
</P>
<P>
   Today I can grumble about my health or I can rejoice that I am
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Today I can lament over all that my parents didn't give me when
I was growing up or I can feel grateful they allowed me to be born.
</P>
<P>
   Today I can cry because roses have thorns or I can celebrate
that thorns have roses.
</P>
<P>
   Today I can mourn my lack of friends or I can excitedly embark
upon a quest of being friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Today I can whine because I have to go to work or I can shout
with joy because I have been given the power to ``create'' wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Today I can murmur because I have to do housework, or I can feel
honored because I have a shelter for my mind, body and soul.
</P>
<P>
   Today stretches ahead of me, waiting to be shaped. And here I
am, the sculptor who gets to do the shaping.
</P>
<P>
   What today will be like is up to me. I get to choose what kind
of day I will have!
</P>
<P>
   Have a Great Day ... unless you have other plans.

 &HT;    Clinton's New York run will hurt Gore
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for the U.S.
Senate in New York for the same reason George W. Bush is running
for president: because she can. She has the borrowed name
identification of a president along with the fund-raising ability
that that carries.
</P>
<P>
   When she takes a four-day ``listening'' trip to New York, 200
reporters dog her steps _ more than accompanied her husband on a
simultaneous tour of areas with lots of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, the Democrats are going to worry about this.
That includes most of all Vice President Al Gore, who is trying to
get a little distance from the Clinton White House in his effort to
win the job himself next year. Gore has no choice but to pay lip
service to the first lady's race, but it's with an even stiffer
upper lip than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary may win in New York. Even though some Republicans
suspect she's flirting with the race as a means to raise money to
pay for the Clinton's legal bills from the impeachment proceedings
over her hubby's fling with Monica Lewinsky, she wouldn't be this
far down the track unless polling data had shown she had a good
chance.
</P>
<P>
   But while she may be successful in New York's quirky politics,
she hurts the Democrats, and particularly Gore, in various ways.
</P>
<P>
   She reminds American voters ready for what Bill Clinton said
they needed seven years ago _ a change _ that the Clintons are
trying to hang around. While Gore is trying to establish himself in
his own right, she's in the media capital of the world, appearing
constantly in The New York Times, which in turn acts as the
unofficial assignment sheet for the national TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it deflects attention away from Al Gore's
campaign _ especially at a time when he's having a hard time
attracting support as well as attention,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a
University of Texas at Austin professor whose specialty is
presidential elections. ``And by reminding people nationally, more
so perhaps than in New York, that they're fatigued with Clinton, it
may hurt Gore even more by accentuating his connection to the
Clinton regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary already is making Gore's life more difficult. Former
U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey is raising a surprising amount
of money as the alternative to Gore, and having the Clinton
reminder around helps Bradley in his effort to elbow Gore out of
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to play to the voters of New York, Hillary is
already disagreeing with the president on matters such as Medicare
funding for teaching hospitals and whether the capital of Israel
should be in Jerusalem. Hillary may have disagreed with Bill on any
number of things in the privacy of their home, but this public
disagreement reinforces the suggestion that the Clintons are
opportunistic politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary's stumping may not be a problem with New York voters,
because she'll presumably have the political cash necessary to
respond to negative television ads with ads of her own.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere in the country, she won't have that paid podium.
And the continuing Clinton presence could taint the Democrats
outside New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the most serious problem is money, said Greg Hartman, who
has managed statewide campaigns in Texas for former Comptroller
John Sharp and for the Democratic ticket. Many smaller donors only
have so much discretionary money that they're willing to spend on
political candidates, and Hillary is sucking up some of that, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kind of people she hurts Gore with,'' Hartman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one female progressive Democrat in Texas reported
several days ago that she'd been called by a telephone bank boiler
room with a request she send Hillary a check _ days before Hillary
officially filed her exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe the Republicans soon will be cheering Hillary's
candidacy even more than the Democrats had hoped former Republican
House Speaker Newt Gingrich would stick around.

 &HT;    Soccer vs. baseball reminds us of what elevates us over beasts
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ My friend was remarking on why soccer is weird.
Human beings have these attachments _ hands _ which elevate the
species over others. And we have a game where only two players on
the field can use them.
</P>
<P>
   I don't agree with my friend on everything, but on this he's
right. Soccer is weird.
</P>
<P>
   And frustrating. That's why when Brandi Chastain scored the
winning penalty kick in the Women's World Cup 0-0 final, the first
thing she did was find a use for her hands by stripping off her
jersey _ introducing ``sports bra'' as a household term.
</P>
<P>
   I understand her frustration. Hands do make the sport, if you
ask me. That's why, for instance, the Professional Apple-Bobbers
Tour never made it, despite lining up a contract with ABC, with
Chris Schenkel to announce.
</P>
<P>
   Take baseball. Now, that's a sport that glorifies hands, and man
by extention.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Tuesday night's All-Star Game was another
midsummer night's classic. We got to see how the game's greatest
scratch themselves. We got to see digital dialogue from the
coaching box, from the catcher's crouch.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is a calvalcade of earthy, hand-to-orifice action. See
the pitcher step from the rubber. See him prepare the next
offering. Is there any wonder the batter whiffs?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is evolution's crowning glory. Consider, for instance,
the fact that man's nostrils have naturally selected a
circumference that's a virtual match for man's forefinger. Just
train the camera on the All-Star dugout and see how it works.
</P>
<P>
   Horses and hyenas cannot do that. They are lesser creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Were it not for our hands, other creatures would
run the planet. I have a collie in the back yard who would have me
walking on her leash every day from sunup to sundown if she had
hands. Instead, she must settle for a paltry but blissful few
minutes walking on my leash every evening.
</P>
<P>
   I have hands. I have command.
</P>
<P>
   My hands can open gates, doorknobs and dog-food sacks. My hands
can master a backyard faucet. My wife thinks I can't do anything
around the house with my hands. My dogs think I'm a regular
Leonardo da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   And of course those hands can administer the rubdowns and the
surgical scratches of a dog's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The human form is a good concept. But five out of five dogs
agree: Hands are the best concept.
</P>
<P>
   Hands continue to advance the human species. One misconception
is that we don't work with our hands anymore. That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that machines do a lot of things that hands used to
do. But to make the machines and to program the computers takes
hands _ hands which can fly over a computer keyboard and work a
mouse like cracking a whip.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that voice-data input will make those keyboarding
skills obsolete one day. Wrong. Some set of hands will have to
program that voice-data gizmo.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Carl Sagan, billions and billions of flying
fingers will continue to dictate how things work. Hooray for hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm wondering why everyone was cheering _ maybe they were
mocking _ those poor soccer gals as they ran back and forth trying
to make the ball do their bidding without the use of their hands.
We winced to watch them try to knock the ball into the goal with
their noggins.
</P>
<P>
   This is called using your head? I don't think so.

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ On the way over to Berkeley, I
practiced my chants and slogans. ``Power to the people, right on.''
``Venceremos.'' ``La Lutte Continue.'' ``Hey, hey, ho hum, how

or opinion pages to criticize ``The Feminists'' _ we all think and
act exactly alike. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

 &HT;    Hemingway's House a prize catch
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ This is the point in the tour of Ernest
Hemingway's house that usually gets the biggest chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The tour guide points to a penny embedded in the concrete by the
pool and begins the story.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway's second wife, Pauline, waited until her
husband was out of town to spend $20,000 for a huge saltwater
swimming pool. It was the island's first swimming pool and a luxury
that was the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline wanted the pool to be a surprise for Hemingway, who was
in Spain covering the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway was indeed surprised when he saw it and even more
stunned when he saw the bill.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that he pulled a coin out of his pocket and threw it
down on the patio. ``Here,'' he said, ``You might as well take my
last penny.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the stories that make a visit to the
Hemingway House and Museum more interesting than most monuments to
famous people.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not visitors are fans of the writer, they will
appreciate the intimacy of the house. His manual Royal typewriter
and still sits on the small table in the upstairs studio of a
cottage behind the main house, where he wrote all or parts of A
Farewell to Arms, To Have and Have Not, For Whom the Bell Tolls and
The Snows of Kilimanjaro.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY'S ROPE BRIDGE
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors walk up the stairs to see it, but when Hemingway
lived here he had a swaying rope bridge that connected the office
to the second-floor veranda of the house.
</P>
<P>
   In the gift store downstairs, you can buy his books. The one
that is most closely associated with Key West is ``To Have and Have
Not,'' published in 1937. Once you read it, it will be easy to see
the town through his eyes as you walk the narrow lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moon was up now and the trees were dark against it, and he
passed the frame houses with their narrow yards, light coming from
the shuttered windows; the unpaved alleys, with their double rows
of houses; Conch town, where all was starched, well-shuttered,
virtue, failure, grits and boiled grunts . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of his friend, John Dos Passos, Hemingway came to
the country's southernmost city to fish and drink, watch the sun
set and get into the occasional fistfight.
</P>
<P>
   You can still drink at Hemingway's favorite bar, Sloppy Joe's,
owned by his friend, Sloppy Joe Russell.
</P>
<P>
   When Russell moved the bar to its present place on Duval Street
in 1937, Hemingway was there for free drinks. He once locked
original manuscripts of ``A Farewell to Arms'' and ``To Have and
Have Not'' and uncashed royalty checks in the back room on his way
to Cuba. They weren't found until 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Another sure chuckle on the tour is the the urinal, porcelain on
cast iron, that Hemingway carried home one night from Sloppy Joe's
bar. Pauline put decorative tiles on it and used it as a drinking
fountain for their 40 or so cats.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE A NATIONAL LANDMARK
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the house will be sure to appreciate Hemingway's
anger when Pauline replaced all of the ceiling fans with
chandeliers. She didn't like the fans _ never mind that there was
no air conditioning and that without them the house was, and still
is, hotter than a steam room.
</P>
<P>
   The house is at 907 Whitehead St., one block from Duval, ``the
brightly lit main street . . . three poolrooms, two barbershops,
five beer joints, three ice cream parlors, the five poor and the
one good restaurant, two magazine and paper places . . . '' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The house, a National Historic Landmark, still has his
furniture. The small china figurine of a nude woman playing a flute
was a gift from Marlene Dietrich. There's an 18th-century traveling
desk with secret compartments, a 17th-century walnut bench from a
Spanish monastery, and his king-sized bed with a headboard made of
an old Spanish gate.
</P>
<P>
   A ceramic cat sitting on top of a chest was a gift from Pablo
Picasso. He painted a heart on the cat's chest to symbolize
Hemingway's love of cats.
</P>
<P>
   TO CUBA, BACK TO KEY WEST
</P>
<P>
   Fifty descendants of Hemingway's pride and joy, a tom cat with
six toes on each paw, roam the firstand second-floor verandas and
grounds. Many of them also have six toes.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway lived at the house from 1931 until 1940 with Pauline.
She divorced him in 1940 and continued to live at the house with
their two sons until she died in 1951. Hemingway moved with his new
wife, Martha, to Cuba but came back to Key West during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   While covering D-Day in Europe, he met his fourth wife, Mary. He
won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 for ``Old Man and the Sea'' and the
Nobel Prize for literature in 1954. In 1961, he committed suicide
with a shotgun in Ketchum, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The house is one of Key West's oldest. It was built in 1812 for
Asa Tift, a wealthy merchant who lived there until 1889. Tift, who
designed Confederate naval ships during the Civil War, used rock
quarried on the site to build the house and he imported Italian
marble for the fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Hemingway House and Museum: open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
(305) 294-1575; admission: adults, $7.50; children 6 to 12, $4.50.

 &HT;    Key West harborfront gets a makeover
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ The cast of characters who came through this
harbor couldn't be better if you made them up. And Ernest Hemingway
tried.
</P>
<P>
   First, there were the Spaniards who shipwrecked offshore and
made a few treasure hunters very wealthy 400 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were salvagers who made fortunes in the 1800s,
stripping the vessels wrecked on nearby shallow reefs.
</P>
<P>
   And the spongers who came from Greece, and were run off to Tampa
when they became too successful. And the shrimpers who sought
``pink gold.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Henry Flagler, who brought the railroad, and the
moneyed passengers from the north. They took the Key West ferries
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway was one of them. He used to walk over to Key
West Bight from Sloppy Joe's Bar at sunset and watch the ferries
come and go.
</P>
<P>
   The ferries stopped when Americans quit going to Cuba and Key
West's seaport became an ugly working port most tourists avoided.
</P>
<P>
   But with the completion of a five-year, $5.4 million
revitalization, Key West's Historic Seaport is now bringing back
tourists. A boardwalk, called Harborwalk, that opened in January
will be officially dedicated next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Harborwalk starts at Grinnell and ends at Front Street. It
connects 100 landand sea-based waterfront businesses including
restaurants, clothing stores, dive shops, a gourmet grocery and
even a wedding chapel.
</P>
<P>
   We docked our boat in one of the Historic Seaport slips, and we
were in impressive and eclectic company _ dive/snorkel catamarans,
Tall Ships and schooners offering sunset cruises, glass-bottom
boats, fishing charters and live-aboard sailing yachts.
</P>
<P>
   The ferries are back, although they don't go to Cuba. Now you
can catch a ferry to the Dry Tortugas National Park and Marco
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The 8.5-acre Historic District stretches along the north end, or
gulf side, of the island along Key West Bight. Near Grinnell is
Lands End Village where the Half Shell Raw Bar and Turtle Kraals
restaurants sit on the sites of the former shrimp docks and Turtle
Cannery. Both outdoor seafood restaurants offer superb views of
million-dollar yachts.
</P>
<P>
   Other restaurants include the Waterfront Market and Schooner
Wharf Bar. At night you can expect live music on the docks.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to come. The Conch Republic Seafood Company, which
recently opened in the former Singleton Fish House building, will
soon expand to include a fish market, botanical park, and a
historic and maritime education center.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration of the Turtle Cannery building continues, aided by a
preservation grant from the state that will also renovate the
historic Thompson Fish House.
</P>
<P>
   Reef Relief, a nonprofit organization working to preserve and
protect the Keys' living coral, has new offices at the Seaport.
</P>
<P>
   The seaport is easy to find. If you're on foot, and on Duval
Street, take Caroline Street east to William or Margaret, turn left
and you'll end up at Land's End. There's plenty of parking here.
There are also lots of bike racks to lock your bike.
</P>
<P>
   Boaters can call Historic Seaport at the Key West Bight at (305)
2938309 to reserve a slip. Dockage includes electricity and water.
There's a 30-foot minimum ($56).
</P>
<P>
   You can't ask for a better spot for sightseeing in Key West.

 &HT;    Down the Keys in five days, by boat
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ Dockmaster Kevin Walsh grinned when I told him
I was staying in a hotel near the Historic Seaport at Key West
Bight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have money to stay in a hotel, and you have that little
boat?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Our 17-foot fishing boat was the smallest, by at least a dozen
feet, of the 80 or so highly upscale international yachts docked at
the Bight. (We had to pay a 30-foot minimum docking fee since the
slips are not designed for wee little boats.)
</P>
<P>
   Kevin believes, as do most hard-core boaters, that you should
put all your disposable income, as well as indisposable income,
into your boat.
</P>
<P>
   I told Kev that we had come all the way from Key Largo _ 120
miles by sea _ and he was impressed. Any 50-foot yacht can do that,
but a 17-footer?
</P>
<P>
   ONE FINE 17-FOOT BOAT
</P>
<P>
   I set off on this odyssey with Palm Beach Post photographer Paul
Milette, and before Paul gets mad at me, let me say right away that
his boat is one fine 17-foot boat. It doesn't have a cabin, galley,
beds or toilet, but it does have a canopy and space for a cooler.
</P>
<P>
   His 14-year-old daughter, Amy, who took a Coast Guard-approved
safe boating course and has a boating license like her dad, served
as first mate.
</P>
<P>
   The boat had a Global Positioning System, which has satellite
communication that told us our latitude and longitude. This mostly
helped us find restaurants. But it also kept us from ending up in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   We also had a depth finder, which is crucial in the shallows on
the gulf side of the Keys. During the five-day round trip, we
rarely got in water over 10 feet deep and a couple of times ended
up in about 18 inches and had to back out into the deep channel.
</P>
<P>
   The water is so clear it's hard to tell the depth by eyeballing
it. You can see sponges, conch and sea urchins on the sandy bottom
as clearly at 10 feet as two. You can admire every stripe on an
angelfish, and you can clearly see the stingrays darting around
like spaceships.
</P>
<P>
   The flats are full of trails made by boat propellers that have
torn up protected grasses and coral.
</P>
<P>
   GO AHEAD, WRECK MY DAY
</P>
<P>
   The early islanders made a living from ships that wrecked on the
oceanside reefs. Legend accuses them of helping the mishaps along
by intentionally misplacing lights, perhaps thinking, well, that's
what outsiders get for intruding into the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   But a boat, especially one that can go in shallow water, is
still the best way to see this string of hundreds of
mangrove-covered islands, which separate the ocean and gulf. By
car, you go over 42 bridges. By boat, you're not bothered with such
manmade inventions.
</P>
<P>
   In a car, we would have missed the stingray jumping out of the
water and staying airborne long enough for us to make the
transition from ``What the heck is that?'' to ``It's a stingray!''
</P>
<P>
   In Marathon, we saw a manatee drinking fresh water from a hose,
its gray whiskered face out of the water as it gulped. (Don't do
this. Manatees shouldn't be encouraged to hang out with people
because they end up getting run over by boats.)
</P>
<P>
   Channel markers for the Intracoastal Waterway, which goes to Key
West, and other channels served as perches for anhingas. Anhingas
can go underwater to search for fish; as our boat neared, they
would shoot from the water like rockets.
</P>
<P>
   REAR VIEW OF MALLORY
</P>
<P>
   In Key West, we got to see the sunset from the water and saw the
backside of the performers at Mallory Dock, literally. The
tightrope walker's tights were so threadbare we almost had to cover
Amy's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set, a fleet of chartered clipper ships got smaller
and smaller on the horizon. I imagined the ladies up on the widow's
walks of the houses in Old Town watching their husbands leave in
the last two centuries. And the men _ what were they thinking? A
year out on a wooden boat with no GPS or depth finder, or cooler
full of cold drinks.
</P>
<P>
   We also saw some of the aftermath of Hurricane Georges, which
hit the Keys last year. Huge sailboats that had been thrown on
sandbars were still waiting to be towed. Miles of coastal trees
were brown, burned by saltwater during the storm. A houseboat's
windows had been blown out, but the tattered curtains remained,
billowing in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The eeriest moment was seeing empty plastic jugs tied together
and floating on the ocean several miles from land. As darkness
descended, the jugs swept by us in the current, and I saw that they
were attached to the bow of a big, upended sailboat. The boat
popped up about a foot out of the ocean as it passed us, like
Carrie's hand coming out of the grave.
</P>
<P>
   During our trip, I watched the colors of water and sky change by
the hour. In the middle of our first day, the gulf was flat and the
same light gray as the sky, making it impossible to distinguish the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ROUGH SEAS
</P>
<P>
   On the last two days, the water was dark blue and rough. On the
way to a restaurant in Marathon on our last night, we were drenched
when we broadsided an ocean swell. We sat through dinner wet and
sticky. But what the heck, we were starving.
</P>
<P>
   The nighttime excursions were the best. Skinny, skittish needle
fish, reflecting silver moonlight, jumped out of the water one
night. We stopped the boat and were surrounded by leaping,
splashing fish.
</P>
<P>
   We saw brilliant Venus in the west and red Mars in the east, and
a gazillion stars reflected on the water.
</P>
<P>
   It made me wish Paul's boat at least had a deck to sleep on.
</P>
<P>
   For information about the Keys, call (800) FLA-KEYS.
</P>
<P>
   HOW WE MADE THE TRIP
</P>
<P>
   The journey: We pulled our boat by trailer to Key Largo and
spent five days discovering the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   The boat: A 1996 Key West 17 with a 1996 Johnson 88 SPL outboard
motor. The 17-foot boat has a Bimini top.
</P>
<P>
   The seas: The sea conditions were mainly calm to a light chop.
The roughest water was when we went from the gulf to the Atlantic
at Bahia Honda State Park and traveled through to Key West.
</P>
<P>
   We found much nicer water on the gulf side, but don't be fooled.
The sea conditions can be as treacherous as the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment: Make sure you have all your Coast Guard approved
safety gear aboard your boat:
</P>
<P>
   Life jackets for all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   At least one throwable PFD (personal floatation device).
</P>
<P>
   A fire extinguisher, some type of whistle or horn, an anchor and
plenty of line.
</P>
<P>
   A VHF radio and a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure all your navigation and anchor lights are operating _
you'll be out for sunsets and dinner after dark. Our Global
Positioning System came in handy marking coordinates of snorkeling
spots and for its compass headings.
</P>
<P>
   Tips: Don't assume everything on your charts is accurate. We had
one chart that showed markers through the center of the lower keys,
but when we ventured that way, we could not find any of the channel
markers the map showed. Ask questions at marinas and try to gather
as much local knowledge as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The color of the water is a clue to its depth.
</P>
<P>
   Reef formations and sea grass beds that grow close to the
water's surface will make the water appear brown. Sand bars and
shallow rubble areas appear white. These two water colors should be
avoided in your boat, both for the health of the habitat and the
health of your boat's bottom. Green water usually indicates an area
free of shallow reefs or sea grass beds.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation of small, shallow draft boats in these areas is
generally safe. However, larger, deeper draft boats should exercise
caution.
</P>
<P>
   Information: The National Oceanic Atmosphere Administration
offers charts and navigational information for the Keys and can be
reached at its Charts and Publications Branch at 301-436-6990.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Sanctuary Program also has a lot of good
information for traveling the Keys by boat. One such pamphlet,
Keeping Your Bottom Off The Bottom, has valuable tips for water
depth in the Keys.

 &HT;    Pigeon Key a fascinating historic site
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARATHON, Fla. _ When the train on Henry Flagler's Overseas
Railroad passed Pigeon Key in the spring, it would stop so
passengers could admire the bright orange blossoms of the poinciana
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Our visit was well-timed. The poincianas were blooming.
</P>
<P>
   We pulled our boat up to the dock and set out to explore the
tiny settlement of tin-roofed, wood clapboard buildings _ base of
operations for construction of Flagler's Seven-Mile Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The island's buildings, constructed in 1908 and 1909, are on the
National Register of Historic Places. Anyone who has driven over
the Seven-Mile Bridge, has seen Pigeon Key, located directly under
Flagler's old bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, 400 people lived on the island, all employed by
Flagler. There was a post office and a school. A tent city was
inhabited by workers from New York City, and paths between tents
were given names such as 34th Street and Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The first building to be restored, a dining hall, was
hand-sanded _ sandblasting is not allowed on historic buildings.
New wooden ``pocket'' windows that slide to the side, identical to
the original windows, were installed.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings were constructed with the same technology used on
Flagler's bridges to withstand hurricanes. Steel rods run from the
roofs into concrete footings.
</P>
<P>
   Architects working on the restoration were excited to find
specks of the original paints. Paint was matched to the specks, and
the buildings are now painted in Flagler's favorite color
combination _ bright yellow with dark green trim.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists weren't allowed to drive down the ramp to Pigeon Key
from 1969 to 1988, when it was used as a marine research center by
the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But the island is now open to visitors. It can be reached by
walking or biking two miles on the old bridge from Knights Key,
just south of Marathon, to Pigeon Key. Cars are not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But you can take a tram, which runs from the Pigeon Key Visitors
Center, housed in an old train car, on Knights Key. Admission to
Pigeon Key is $7.50 and includes the tram, a short film on
Flagler's life, entrance to Pigeon Key including the museum and a
guided tour. Call (305) 743-5999. Trams run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the island serves as a base for coral research for Mote
Marine Laboratories and for children's camps.

 &HT;    Motel helps save ailing sea turtles
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARATHON, Fla. _ A half-dozen German travelers gathered around
Lucky, a threatened green sea turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Her name probably should have been Extremely Unlucky, but here
at Hidden Harbor Motel, they tend to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The motel supports the Turtle Hospital next door and guests are
encouraged to learn about sea turtles during their stay. Only motel
guests can see the turtles. They can visit the 150-by-50-foot
saltwater turtle pool and watch Sue Schaf feed the patients, give
medicines and IVs. Patients include all kinds of sea turtles
including several Kemp Ridleys, the rarest in the world. The
Germans had seen a TV documentary about Hidden Harbor and the
turtles and had made sure their Florida vacation included a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky, on the other hand, probably wished she'd never set a fin
in Florida. She had gotten tangled in fishing line and one of her
flippers had been cut to the bone. Unable to swim, she was hit by a
boat. She was dragging a gangrenous fin when she was found.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, X-rays showed she also had tumors caused by a
herpes virus. And she was starving. Schaf held her up to show her
underbelly and clearly visible skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis was bad, but turtles with severe injuries from
boat accidents and fishing line and illnesses such as tumors and
parasites have healed here.
</P>
<P>
   The Turtle Hospital and Hidden Harbor Motel are owned by Ritchie
Moretti, who ran a Volkswagen repair business in New Jersey before
he sold his business and moved to Marathon in 1980. He bought the
motel, docked his boat and planned to do nothing more than fish.
</P>
<P>
   But his love for fixing ailing cars soon turned to healing sick
turtles in the saltwater pool that came with the motel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we discovered the virus, and my interest wasn't casual
anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the hospital has three functions: education _ it hosts
4,000 to 6,000 children from visiting schools a year; research,
conducted with the University of Florida; and hospital care.
</P>
<P>
   The staff includes a veterinarian, two assistants and Moretti,
who has been trained to do diagnostic procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the sick turtles keep coming. Most have the virus
that is producing tumors that cause blindness and internal organ
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, we only saw the virus on green sea turtles, but
now it has spread to other turtles,'' Moretti said. The only common
denominator is that outbreaks always coincide with spikes in
temperatures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists believe this is one of the first effects of global
warming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And if this isn't bad enough turtles have plenty of other
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishermen put out their nets and put out long lines and take
away the turtles' food source,'' he said. ``And developers are
taking away the nesting beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   But fishermen are becoming more aware of the dangers of fishing
line, Moretti said. The turtles that have had tumors removed appear
to develop immunity to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, I called to ask about Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   She did indeed have the right name. The tumors were removed and
she has recovered and learned to swim with three fins.
</P>
<P>
   She should be fine in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden Harbor Motel, 305-743-5376; rates for two people are $65
and $70. You can launch your boat here. Dockage is $10 a night.
From July 25 to Aug. 22, there's a six-night minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Only motel guests are allowed to see the turtles.

 &HT;    `Little Green Men' shines comic light on UFO paranoia
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   William F. Buckley Jr., the often inadvertently funny TV and
print pundit and gadfly, has a son named Christopher, who is even
funnier on purpose than his famous father is accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   I am an ardent fan of son, Christopher, particularly after
reading his recent novel, ``Thank You for Smoking,'' which featured
a PR man for the tobacco industry as its hero.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Christopher Buckley had produced another hilarious novel.
It's titled ``Little Green Men'' (Random House) and reveals for us
the truth about all those reports of UFO's, their passengers and
those who have been kidnapped and probed by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Green Men'' is about a snobbish talk show host and
political pundit in Washington, D.C., who has an encounter with a
group of aliens from another planet. Or does he?
</P>
<P>
   What happens to the arrogant pundit after his encounter takes up
the bulk of the book. Suffice to say the aforementioned pundit's
life is altered drastically after he goes public with what he is
convinced has been a real alien kidnapping, complete with perverse
probes.
</P>
<P>
   John Oliver Banion, for that's the pundit's name, finds that he
must choose to either maintain his status as an icon for the
conservative establishment or become recognized as the leader of a
scruffy, fanatical millions who believe in UFO's, a category he has
always regarded as freaks.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley uses this scenario to satirize the people and goings-on
in our nation's capitol district, our duly elected officials and
their henchpersons, just as he did in his hilarious previous novel,
``Thank You for Smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Banion then launches a campaign to force the government to
``open its files'' on UFO's and the number of his supporters rise
rapidly. He assumes the celebrity of a rock star and finds, to his
surprise, that he loves it.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide has him on its cover. His talk show sponsor,
Gooey-Lube, is lubricating as fast as it can. ``Millions of
American automobiles hummed frictionlessly along the highways.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many of his former friends and congressional
fans are afraid to identify with him, some even pass him in the
halls without noting his presence. He is confused but determined to
pursue his goal and force the government's ``big secret'' out in
the open.
</P>
<P>
   There are many twists and turns in the plot, most of them more
or less expected once you're into the story, but all-in-all this is
a fun book to read. Buckley has the ability to surprise you with
the obvious, which is a fun talent for a writer to have. Fun, that
is, for his readers. Perhaps fun for the writer, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley even uses his brief biography on the book's jacket to
exercise his apparent obsession for satire. It declares that ``In
1998 he was inducted into the Legion D'honneur by the president of
France... despite the fact that his French is barely sufficient to
order a meal in a restaurant'' adding that ``he has been an adviser
to every president since William Howard Taft, a remarkable
achievement, since he was born in 1952.''
</P>
<P>
   This time of year critics and bookstores are talking about
``beach books.'' This is a perfect example of my idea of good beach
book, whether or not you find yourself on a beach.
</P>

   TURTLEAID _ MARATHON, Fla. _ A half-dozen German travelers
gathered around Lucky, a threatened green sea turtle. Her name
probably should have been Extremely Unlucky, but here at Hidden
Harbor Motel, they tend to be optimistic. The motel supports the
Turtle Hospital next door and guests are encouraged to learn about
sea turtles during their stay. Only motel guests can see the
turtles. They can visit the 150-by-50-foot saltwater turtle pool
and watch Sue Schaf feed the patients, give medicines and IVs.
Patients include all kinds of sea turtles including several Kemp
Ridleys, the rarest in the world. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post)

   BOOKS-SYRUP _ Halfway through his satirical novel about a cola
marketing campaign, Australian Max Barry added an X to his name.
Now he's Maxx. It's just the sort of thing a sharp marketing
executive would do. ``It's a joke,'' says Barry, 26, whose
fictional ``Syrup'' (Viking, $23.95) is set in the offices of the
Coca-Cola Co. in Los Angeles. ``Creative types live in mortal fear
of someone forgetting who they are, so they change their names to
make them stand out more.'' In the novel, Scat and a female Coke
marketing executive named 6 pitch the concept of a new cola
product. The soft drink would be sold in a black can with a
four-letter name that's unprintable in a family newspaper.

   BOOK-NOTES _ If Eric Jerome Dickey's books seem to have a lot of

professionals from a male point of view. One of his books,
``Friends and Lovers,'' has been optioned for the movies by Whitney
Houston. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 6 p.m.

   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ We had a family emergency. My daughter, who
should have been hoeing the garden or washing the dog, was busy
having a stroke _ the kind of something or other that goes
whindering off to your brain scaring you to death. We packed up
nightgowns and books and television tapes and hurried to the
hospital. She had no business being in precarious health, I told
her. It was my time. So we decided to go in tandem, me in one room,
her just down the hall. (Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BOOKS-SYRUP _ Halfway through his satirical novel about a cola
marketing campaign, Australian Max Barry added an X to his name.
Now he's Maxx. It's just the sort of thing a sharp marketing
executive would do. ``It's a joke,'' says Barry, 26, whose
fictional ``Syrup'' (Viking, $23.95) is set in the offices of the
Coca-Cola Co. in Los Angeles. ``Creative types live in mortal fear
of someone forgetting who they are, so they change their names to
make them stand out more.'' In the novel, Scat and a female Coke
marketing executive named 6 pitch the concept of a new cola
product. The soft drink would be sold in a black can with a
four-letter name that's unprintable in a family newspaper.
(O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   BOOK-NOTES _ If Eric Jerome Dickey's books seem to have a lot of
humor in them, there's a good reason. The Memphis native is a
former stand-up comic. Described by some as ``a male Terry
McMillan,'' Dickey writes about relationships between black
professionals from a male point of view. One of his books,
``Friends and Lovers,'' has been optioned for the movies by Whitney
Houston. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 6 p.m.

movies _ the kind of bumps in the night that toys with the mind _
are re-emerging with the inventive, spooky ``The Blair Witch
Project'' and mainstream Hollywood's remake of the
dark-and-stormy-night classic ``The Haunting'' . Also coming this
fall is a remake of ``The House on Haunted Hill.'' (BLongino,

goes looking for his roots and finds he may really be

   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, clusters of human skin cells that have been genetically
altered are approaching 400 divisions and still show no signs of
aging. They just keep multiplying. What gives? Shanti Menon reports
on what may very well be the discovery of the fountain of youth.

   When dinosaurs roamed Earth and South America nestled up against
Africa, Araripe Lagoon was a violent sea of death that collected
evidence of ancient life. Over millions of years the changing
climate dried and filled the sea many times. Today it's a
salt-saturated pile of sediment located in the northeast corner of
Brazil. Josie Glausiusz, an associate editor at Discover magazine,
reports on what scientists are finding in its depths.

Brazil. Josie Glausiusz, an associate editor at Discover magazine,

<P>
   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the
life span of these individual cells in the lab could eventually
pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal
cells is that we may be able to treat or prevent the onset of
certain diseases where cell aging plays a key role,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks
arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.
``If we can deliver rejuvenated endothelial cells, using the same
type of balloon catheter that cleans out the vessels, we think we
can achieve a permanent solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay are currently working with just a few cell
types, but the list of degenerative diseases they eventually plan
to target is extensive. In some types of late-onset diabetes, for
example, people don't have enough insulin-making pancreatic islet
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we could go in with a fine needle, take out one
pancreatic islet cell, and introduce telomerase into that cell?''
Shay says. ``We'd give the person back their own islet cells as if
they were from a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar procedures could regenerate skin for burn patients,
immune cells for people with HIV, retinal cells for blind people or
muscle cells to combat muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very potent direction to pursue,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these techniques in humans is still a long way off,
however. Identifying the best means of triggering a cell to produce
telomerase is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay have already had some success engineering
viruses to carry telomerase genes, instead of harmful viral genes,
into cells. This works fairly well in a petri dish, but when a
virus enters a living person, it has to sneak past the body's
defenses to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another means of delivery could be to encase telomerase genes in
sacs of fatty molecules called liposomes. These tiny sacs fuse with
the cells they contact and regurgitate their contents into the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tiny bubble fusing into a big bubble,'' Harley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has yet to perfect these methods, he's reluctant to
speculate about when people will be able to get telomerase therapy:
``I can say we'd be extremely disappointed if it wasn't in our
lifetime.''

   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the
life span of these individual cells in the lab could eventually
pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal
cells is that we may be able to treat or prevent the onset of
certain diseases where cell aging plays a key role,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down

<P>
   The sudden arrival of a flock of crested pterosaurs shatters the
eerie midday calm of Araripe Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   They swoop and soar as they jostle for position over the 70-mile
stretch of bubbling water, snapping for fish at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, swarms of mating cockroaches cloud the sky, their dark
wings whirring.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of rotting eggs fills the air. Mayflies, damselflies
and wasps flit through ferns.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic bubble of toxic gas seeps up from the water's depths.
Its first victim is a hapless pterosaur. Overcome by fumes, it
crashes into the water. Soon thousands of insects splatter the
surface of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed Earth 120 million years ago, and South
America nestled up against Africa, Araripe was a violent sea of
death that collected evidence of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years the changing climate dried and filled the
sea many times. Today it's a salt-saturated pile of sediment
located in the northeast corner of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon was so salty that a few fish could live only at its
surface in a thin layer of freshwater that flowed from a river on
its eastern edge. Any animal or plant that sank into the lagoon was
embalmed in a briny grave.
</P>
<P>
   The only inhabitants of its depths were bacteria; no predators
could survive in the saline waste.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria fed on the creatures that rained from above, they
produced toxic gases _ methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
_ that in turn bubbled up to poison the birds and insects flying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's paleontologist David Martill's theory. Martill,
of the University of Portsmouth in England, reached this conclusion
after 11 years spent unearthing an array of fossils in the driedup
lagoon, called the Crato Formation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of species he has found is unusual. Fossil hunters
typically find scraps of organisms _ a bone here, a leaf there.
Martill, however, has uncovered all kinds of intact animals and
plants, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-dwelling bacteria fed on soft guts, muscle and blood,
but they could not easily digest bone, insect cuticle or plant
cellulose, which explains why the fossils look flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive among Martill's finds are pterosaurs with intact
skin, teeth, claws and head crests.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens include fish, frogs, lizards, beetles,
damselflies, cicadas and even whole flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   And last year he came upon the coup de grace: more than a
hundred fossilized mite eggs clinging to a lone feather _ the
oldest ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these creatures, notably the insects, resemble their
modern-day cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A design that works well will not change,'' Martill says.
</P>
<P>
   After he had unearthed these treasures, Martill became intrigued
by the preponderance of winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's funny about this deposit,'' he says, ``is
that a dinosaur hasn't drifted into the lagoon. It's dominated by
things that dropped out of the sky.'' Which is how he came up with
his poison-gas theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bacteria ate the tissues of the animals,'' he says, ``they
deposited a mineral called iron pyrite over the animal. The iron
pyrite then preserved the fossil. The bottom sediments, rich in
bacteria feeding on organic matter, would give off large quantities
of gases. It's possible that in sheltered lakes there was a buildup
of gases over the surface water. And anything flying into that
could have been killed by the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, which were common in the region, might also have
forced gas to the surface of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the animals plunged to their death. Some,
such as the odd frog or lizard, may have drifted into the lagoon
from elsewhere. Plants may have arrived by a similar route, or
perhaps they were blown in.
</P>
<P>
   However they got there, Martill is grateful they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worked like a big pickling tank, preserving
everything,'' he says. ``It's a very special window into Cretaceous
life.''

<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks
arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.
``If we can deliver rejuvenated endothelial cells, using the same
type of balloon catheter that cleans out the vessels, we think we
can achieve a permanent solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay are currently working with just a few cell
types, but the list of degenerative diseases they eventually plan
to target is extensive. In some types of late-onset diabetes, for
example, people don't have enough insulin-making pancreatic islet
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we could go in with a fine needle, take out one
pancreatic islet cell, and introduce telomerase into that cell?''
Shay says. ``We'd give the person back their own islet cells as if
they were from a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar procedures could regenerate skin for burn patients,
immune cells for people with HIV, retinal cells for blind people or
muscle cells to combat muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very potent direction to pursue,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these techniques in humans is still a long way off,
however. Identifying the best means of triggering a cell to produce
telomerase is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay have already had some success engineering
viruses to carry telomerase genes, instead of harmful viral genes,
into cells. This works fairly well in a petri dish, but when a
virus enters a living person, it has to sneak past the body's
defenses to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another means of delivery could be to encase telomerase genes in
sacs of fatty molecules called liposomes. These tiny sacs fuse with
the cells they contact and regurgitate their contents into the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tiny bubble fusing into a big bubble,'' Harley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has yet to perfect these methods, he's reluctant to
speculate about when people will be able to get telomerase therapy:
``I can say we'd be extremely disappointed if it wasn't in our
lifetime.''

   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,

<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the

pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives

   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a

   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the

<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''

<P>
   The sudden arrival of a flock of crested pterosaurs shatters the
eerie midday calm of Araripe Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   They swoop and soar as they jostle for position over the 70-mile
stretch of bubbling water, snapping for fish at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, swarms of mating cockroaches cloud the sky, their dark
wings whirring.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of rotting eggs fills the air. Mayflies, damselflies
and wasps flit through ferns.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic bubble of toxic gas seeps up from the water's depths.
Its first victim is a hapless pterosaur. Overcome by fumes, it
crashes into the water. Soon thousands of insects splatter the
surface of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed Earth 120 million years ago, and South
America nestled up against Africa, Araripe was a violent sea of
death that collected evidence of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years the changing climate dried and filled the
sea many times. Today it's a salt-saturated pile of sediment
located in the northeast corner of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon was so salty that a few fish could live only at its
surface in a thin layer of freshwater that flowed from a river on
its eastern edge. Any animal or plant that sank into the lagoon was
embalmed in a briny grave.
</P>
<P>
   The only inhabitants of its depths were bacteria; no predators
could survive in the saline waste.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria fed on the creatures that rained from above, they
produced toxic gases _ methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
_ that in turn bubbled up to poison the birds and insects flying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's paleontologist David Martill's theory. Martill,
of the University of Portsmouth in England, reached this conclusion
after 11 years spent unearthing an array of fossils in the driedup
lagoon, called the Crato Formation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of species he has found is unusual. Fossil hunters
typically find scraps of organisms _ a bone here, a leaf there.
Martill, however, has uncovered all kinds of intact animals and
plants, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-dwelling bacteria fed on soft guts, muscle and blood,
but they could not easily digest bone, insect cuticle or plant
cellulose, which explains why the fossils look flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive among Martill's finds are pterosaurs with intact
skin, teeth, claws and head crests.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens include fish, frogs, lizards, beetles,
damselflies, cicadas and even whole flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   And last year he came upon the coup de grace: more than a
hundred fossilized mite eggs clinging to a lone feather _ the
oldest ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these creatures, notably the insects, resemble their
modern-day cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A design that works well will not change,'' Martill says.
</P>
<P>
   After he had unearthed these treasures, Martill became intrigued
by the preponderance of winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's funny about this deposit,'' he says, ``is
that a dinosaur hasn't drifted into the lagoon. It's dominated by
things that dropped out of the sky.'' Which is how he came up with
his poison-gas theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bacteria ate the tissues of the animals,'' he says, ``they
deposited a mineral called iron pyrite over the animal. The iron
pyrite then preserved the fossil. The bottom sediments, rich in
bacteria feeding on organic matter, would give off large quantities
of gases. It's possible that in sheltered lakes there was a buildup
of gases over the surface water. And anything flying into that
could have been killed by the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, which were common in the region, might also have
forced gas to the surface of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the animals plunged to their death. Some,
such as the odd frog or lizard, may have drifted into the lagoon
from elsewhere. Plants may have arrived by a similar route, or
perhaps they were blown in.
</P>
<P>
   However they got there, Martill is grateful they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worked like a big pickling tank, preserving
everything,'' he says. ``It's a very special window into Cretaceous
life.''

Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks
arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.
``If we can deliver rejuvenated endothelial cells, using the same
type of balloon catheter that cleans out the vessels, we think we
can achieve a permanent solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay are currently working with just a few cell
types, but the list of degenerative diseases they eventually plan
to target is extensive. In some types of late-onset diabetes, for
example, people don't have enough insulin-making pancreatic islet
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we could go in with a fine needle, take out one
pancreatic islet cell, and introduce telomerase into that cell?''
Shay says. ``We'd give the person back their own islet cells as if
they were from a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar procedures could regenerate skin for burn patients,
immune cells for people with HIV, retinal cells for blind people or
muscle cells to combat muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very potent direction to pursue,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these techniques in humans is still a long way off,
however. Identifying the best means of triggering a cell to produce
telomerase is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay have already had some success engineering
viruses to carry telomerase genes, instead of harmful viral genes,
into cells. This works fairly well in a petri dish, but when a
virus enters a living person, it has to sneak past the body's
defenses to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another means of delivery could be to encase telomerase genes in
sacs of fatty molecules called liposomes. These tiny sacs fuse with
the cells they contact and regurgitate their contents into the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tiny bubble fusing into a big bubble,'' Harley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has yet to perfect these methods, he's reluctant to
speculate about when people will be able to get telomerase therapy:
``I can say we'd be extremely disappointed if it wasn't in our
lifetime.''

   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas

skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>

pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.

   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal

<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''

<P>
   The sudden arrival of a flock of crested pterosaurs shatters the
eerie midday calm of Araripe Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   They swoop and soar as they jostle for position over the 70-mile
stretch of bubbling water, snapping for fish at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, swarms of mating cockroaches cloud the sky, their dark
wings whirring.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of rotting eggs fills the air. Mayflies, damselflies
and wasps flit through ferns.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic bubble of toxic gas seeps up from the water's depths.
Its first victim is a hapless pterosaur. Overcome by fumes, it
crashes into the water. Soon thousands of insects splatter the
surface of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed Earth 120 million years ago, and South
America nestled up against Africa, Araripe was a violent sea of
death that collected evidence of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years the changing climate dried and filled the
sea many times. Today it's a salt-saturated pile of sediment
located in the northeast corner of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon was so salty that a few fish could live only at its
surface in a thin layer of freshwater that flowed from a river on
its eastern edge. Any animal or plant that sank into the lagoon was
embalmed in a briny grave.
</P>
<P>
   The only inhabitants of its depths were bacteria; no predators
could survive in the saline waste.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria fed on the creatures that rained from above, they
produced toxic gases _ methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
_ that in turn bubbled up to poison the birds and insects flying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's paleontologist David Martill's theory. Martill,
of the University of Portsmouth in England, reached this conclusion
after 11 years spent unearthing an array of fossils in the driedup
lagoon, called the Crato Formation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of species he has found is unusual. Fossil hunters
typically find scraps of organisms _ a bone here, a leaf there.
Martill, however, has uncovered all kinds of intact animals and
plants, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-dwelling bacteria fed on soft guts, muscle and blood,
but they could not easily digest bone, insect cuticle or plant
cellulose, which explains why the fossils look flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive among Martill's finds are pterosaurs with intact
skin, teeth, claws and head crests.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens include fish, frogs, lizards, beetles,
damselflies, cicadas and even whole flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   And last year he came upon the coup de grace: more than a
hundred fossilized mite eggs clinging to a lone feather _ the
oldest ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these creatures, notably the insects, resemble their
modern-day cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A design that works well will not change,'' Martill says.
</P>
<P>
   After he had unearthed these treasures, Martill became intrigued
by the preponderance of winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's funny about this deposit,'' he says, ``is
that a dinosaur hasn't drifted into the lagoon. It's dominated by
things that dropped out of the sky.'' Which is how he came up with
his poison-gas theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bacteria ate the tissues of the animals,'' he says, ``they
deposited a mineral called iron pyrite over the animal. The iron
pyrite then preserved the fossil. The bottom sediments, rich in
bacteria feeding on organic matter, would give off large quantities
of gases. It's possible that in sheltered lakes there was a buildup
of gases over the surface water. And anything flying into that
could have been killed by the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, which were common in the region, might also have
forced gas to the surface of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the animals plunged to their death. Some,
such as the odd frog or lizard, may have drifted into the lagoon
from elsewhere. Plants may have arrived by a similar route, or
perhaps they were blown in.
</P>
<P>
   However they got there, Martill is grateful they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worked like a big pickling tank, preserving
everything,'' he says. ``It's a very special window into Cretaceous
life.''

   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks
arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.
``If we can deliver rejuvenated endothelial cells, using the same
type of balloon catheter that cleans out the vessels, we think we
can achieve a permanent solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay are currently working with just a few cell
types, but the list of degenerative diseases they eventually plan
to target is extensive. In some types of late-onset diabetes, for
example, people don't have enough insulin-making pancreatic islet
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we could go in with a fine needle, take out one
pancreatic islet cell, and introduce telomerase into that cell?''
Shay says. ``We'd give the person back their own islet cells as if
they were from a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar procedures could regenerate skin for burn patients,
immune cells for people with HIV, retinal cells for blind people or
muscle cells to combat muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very potent direction to pursue,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these techniques in humans is still a long way off,
however. Identifying the best means of triggering a cell to produce
telomerase is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay have already had some success engineering
viruses to carry telomerase genes, instead of harmful viral genes,
into cells. This works fairly well in a petri dish, but when a
virus enters a living person, it has to sneak past the body's
defenses to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another means of delivery could be to encase telomerase genes in
sacs of fatty molecules called liposomes. These tiny sacs fuse with
the cells they contact and regurgitate their contents into the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tiny bubble fusing into a big bubble,'' Harley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has yet to perfect these methods, he's reluctant to
speculate about when people will be able to get telomerase therapy:
``I can say we'd be extremely disappointed if it wasn't in our
lifetime.''

<P>
   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the
life span of these individual cells in the lab could eventually
pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal
cells is that we may be able to treat or prevent the onset of
certain diseases where cell aging plays a key role,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.

<P>
   The sudden arrival of a flock of crested pterosaurs shatters the
eerie midday calm of Araripe Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   They swoop and soar as they jostle for position over the 70-mile
stretch of bubbling water, snapping for fish at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, swarms of mating cockroaches cloud the sky, their dark
wings whirring.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of rotting eggs fills the air. Mayflies, damselflies
and wasps flit through ferns.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic bubble of toxic gas seeps up from the water's depths.
Its first victim is a hapless pterosaur. Overcome by fumes, it
crashes into the water. Soon thousands of insects splatter the
surface of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed Earth 120 million years ago, and South
America nestled up against Africa, Araripe was a violent sea of
death that collected evidence of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years the changing climate dried and filled the
sea many times. Today it's a salt-saturated pile of sediment
located in the northeast corner of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon was so salty that a few fish could live only at its
surface in a thin layer of freshwater that flowed from a river on
its eastern edge. Any animal or plant that sank into the lagoon was
embalmed in a briny grave.
</P>
<P>
   The only inhabitants of its depths were bacteria; no predators
could survive in the saline waste.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria fed on the creatures that rained from above, they
produced toxic gases _ methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
_ that in turn bubbled up to poison the birds and insects flying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's paleontologist David Martill's theory. Martill,
of the University of Portsmouth in England, reached this conclusion
after 11 years spent unearthing an array of fossils in the driedup
lagoon, called the Crato Formation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of species he has found is unusual. Fossil hunters
typically find scraps of organisms _ a bone here, a leaf there.
Martill, however, has uncovered all kinds of intact animals and
plants, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-dwelling bacteria fed on soft guts, muscle and blood,
but they could not easily digest bone, insect cuticle or plant
cellulose, which explains why the fossils look flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive among Martill's finds are pterosaurs with intact
skin, teeth, claws and head crests.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens include fish, frogs, lizards, beetles,
damselflies, cicadas and even whole flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   And last year he came upon the coup de grace: more than a
hundred fossilized mite eggs clinging to a lone feather _ the
oldest ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these creatures, notably the insects, resemble their
modern-day cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A design that works well will not change,'' Martill says.
</P>
<P>
   After he had unearthed these treasures, Martill became intrigued
by the preponderance of winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's funny about this deposit,'' he says, ``is
that a dinosaur hasn't drifted into the lagoon. It's dominated by
things that dropped out of the sky.'' Which is how he came up with
his poison-gas theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bacteria ate the tissues of the animals,'' he says, ``they
deposited a mineral called iron pyrite over the animal. The iron
pyrite then preserved the fossil. The bottom sediments, rich in
bacteria feeding on organic matter, would give off large quantities
of gases. It's possible that in sheltered lakes there was a buildup
of gases over the surface water. And anything flying into that
could have been killed by the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, which were common in the region, might also have
forced gas to the surface of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the animals plunged to their death. Some,
such as the odd frog or lizard, may have drifted into the lagoon
from elsewhere. Plants may have arrived by a similar route, or
perhaps they were blown in.
</P>
<P>
   However they got there, Martill is grateful they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worked like a big pickling tank, preserving
everything,'' he says. ``It's a very special window into Cretaceous
life.''

`THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT': NEW WRINKLES ON FACE OF FEAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When hearing hype, be afraid _ be very afraid.
</P>
<P>
   After 1996's ``Scream`` scared up $103 million at the box office
by cleverly skewering slasher-flick conventions, many believed it
would push the horror genre to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Surely ``Scream'' would trigger innovations and originality, not
heaps of creeps in the mindless masked-madman mold it had mocked.
</P>
<P>
   Then reality set in.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Disturbing Behavior'' and ``The Faculty`` to ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer`` to ``I Still Know`` _ well, you know _
filmmakers simply settled for the trite and true, with randy teens
being systematically slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer brings a chill. Now _ finally _ we hear bumps in
the night that could signal that a change is looming.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the buzz is back for horror films, thanks to a spooky
spate of hot-weather fear fests with more on their minds than gore
and more gore.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the hype. And hype can be a dangerously
two-sided tool, perhaps not for commercial products like ``The
Haunting,'' opening July 23, or ``Lake Placid,'' opening Friday,
but certainly for horror's most heralded new film, ``The Blair
Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance Film Festival adored it, and an elaborate Web site
is stirring the frenzy. Some reviews scream that it's the scariest
movie since 1974's ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   The horror, the horror.
</P>
<P>
   The hype, the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the truth? Are we on the cusp of a horror renaissance
or another grisly letdown?
</P>
<P>
   Judging solely by ``Blair Witch,'' yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, because the film is defiantly original. No, because its
challenging minimalism will make it a tough sell for a mass
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, Hollywood. Pack a theater with fans of ``Chainsaw``
``The Exorcist,`` ``The Omen,`` ``Hellraiser`` and other hard-core
horrors. Tell them ``Blair Witch`` is even scarier.
</P>
<P>
   Then listen as some viewers grumble, impatient with the
home-movie look of this pseudo-documentary about student filmmakers
who set out to probe a witchy legend _ then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   At least ``Blair Witch`` is getting a proper roll-out, first
playing art houses in only 20 markets. This is no shopping-mall
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing this film has been a challenge,'' admits Orlando,
Fla.-based Ed Sanchez, who wrote, edited and directed ``Blair
Witch,`` along with partner Dan Myrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know what to make of it. I definitely
think it's not for everybody. But that's the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go in with the idea that you're going to see a
conventional horror film with known actors or even good camera
work, you'll be disappointed. If you want blood and guts, this is
not that.''
</P>
<P>
   For a film about a legend, ``Blair Witch'' has generated a
legendry about itself. This stems from a meticulously detailed
back-story, touched upon in opening frames.
</P>
<P>
   For far more, you can trace the tale's origins _ and its
aftermath _ on the official Web site at www.blairwitch.com.
</P>
<P>
   It follows the fictional ``Blair Witch'' legend from a Colonial
woman accused of witchery in 1785 to the 1995 discovery of the
missing students' footage in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   For even more background, catch a one-hour Sci Fi Channel
special, ``Curse of the Blair Witch,'' airing at 7 p.m. CDT Sunday
and 10 p.m. July 22. There's even a tie-in CD, ``Josh's Blair Witch
Mix,'' with chunks of dialogue and sound effects lacing tracks of
music inspired by the film, which isn't scored.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Like the film itself, ``Curse of the Blair Witch`` is fiction
posing as a documentary. Actors portraying the family, friends and
teachers of the missing students are interviewed, and the
fabricated legend is further explored.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This all seems so real that many who watch the TV special or see
the film ``cold'' may believe the story is true _ just as some who
saw the 1984 mock documentary ``This Is Spinal Tap'' thought Spinal
Tap was a real rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sanchez and Myrick aren't trying to hide the fact that
``Blair Witch`` is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird line you have to walk,'' Sanchez said. ``We
didn't set out to do a hoax, just to make a film that seemed
completely real.''
</P>
<P>
   They have mixed feelings about how much viewers should know in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it's important to prepare an audience for the
crude camera shots (often in black-and-white) and a story with no
clear resolution.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, exposing the movie's process undercuts its
greatest power: a suspension of disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   When the students turn panicky after getting lost, when they
cringe from strange sounds outside their tent at night, and when
their bold leader, Heather, breaks down and tearfully tapes a
farewell message to her parents, the sense of dread and doom is
almost palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch`` may be as fictional as ``A Nightmare on Elm
Street,'' but it doesn't prop up flimsy fantasies with special
effects. Rather, it immerses the viewer in a darkly disturbing
sense of you-are-there reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought reality was the way to scare people these days,''
Sanchez said, ``to scare the jaded, high-tech, late-'90s audience
that knows everything about filmmaking and computer graphics and
has seen every monster imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   For their entry into feature films, Sanchez and Myrick made
``Blair Witch`` for ``about the cost of a new Ford Taurus,''
Sanchez said with a laugh. (Reportedly, the budget was $30,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Recognizable stars would have ruined their concept _ not that
Sanchez and Myrick could have afforded them. ``Blair Witch's``
starkness owes as much to financial limits as artistic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, unknown actors _ using their own names on screen _
essentially become the characters.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the eight-day shoot, they lived together in the
woods, sleeping in a tent and emerging in the morning to find the
day's instructions and rations of food left by Sanchez and Myrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch'' is surely the first film completely shot by its
actors. They were given situations, then told to improvise as their
characters recorded the experiences with a 16mm camera and a video
camcorder (later transferred to 35mm film).
</P>
<P>
   The situations included becoming hungry, cold and frightened _
first by being lost, then by being stalked by an unseen menace.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard were chosen
from among 2,000 actors for their ability to work without a net.
But a little luck didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quite blessed during shooting,'' Sanchez said.
``Nobody broke an ankle or got poked in the eye by a branch. Being
in the woods at night was creepy enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for asking the actors to keep the cameras zoomed out,
Sanchez and Myrick left shot compositions up to their cast members.
</P>
<P>
   The actors shot a total of 20 hours' worth of footage, and the
finished film is ``the worst 82 minutes of what they went
through,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are Method acting (fully inhabiting a
character) to an extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were definitely glad to get out of there,'' Sanchez said.
``We even started cutting down their food at the end. It was
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors weren't truly lost _ the Maryland park where they
shot was small _ but being lost was their most terrifying
situation, said Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   At Sundance, Artisan Entertainment purchased ``Blair Witch'' for
$1.2 million. In the months since, the film has had ``a bootleg
problem,'' Sanchez said, due to preliminary copies sent to film
festivals on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the old version,'' he said. ``This version adds
cool stuff, and the sound is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Sanchez is more sanguine about video. Due to its
intimacy, he thinks the film ``will make some money in theaters _
nothing huge _ but where it's almost guaranteed to blossom is on
video.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, he and Myrick plan a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll cost more money,'' he said, ``the price of a couple of
Lear jets.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now they plan to stay in Florida, where their Haxan
Films is based and their ``Blair Witch'' vision emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about classic horror films _ truly frightening films
_ is they let you picture a lot of the horror in your head,''
Sanchez said. ``That's what we tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know audiences are conditioned to getting a neat package of
a film wrapped in a bow. But I'm hoping they at least give this one
a chance as something completely new.''

`RUNAWAY' HIT? RICHARD GERE AND JULIA ROBERTS RETURN TO `PRETTY
WOMAN' TURF 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment column)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Richard Gere
with Julia Roberts and with Hector Elizondo in ``Runaway Bride.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It took almost a decade, but Richard Gere and Julia Roberts are
back in business as of July 31, hoping to strike box-office gold
again in ``Runaway Bride'' _ their first film since ``Pretty
Woman'' (1990), the smash hit that made Roberts the most bankable
female star in Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``Right after `Pretty Woman' there was a lot of pressure on us
to do a sequel,'' recalls the silver-haired Gere, who will turn 50
on Aug. 29. ``But expectations were so high we all backed away.
There wasn't any script, so it was a moot point anyway.
 &HT;    ``Lightning stuck with that movie,'' he adds, ``and nobody had
any idea that it would. But I think we are all smart enough to know
there couldn't be a sequel. You can't do that twice.''
 &HT;    Still, he's hoping that the Gere-Roberts combo, plus ``Pretty
Woman'' director Garry Marshall and supporting player Hector
Elizondo, will once again prove a winning formula, even with a
story much different from their previous tycoon/hooker odd-couple
love story.
 &HT;    In ``Runaway Bride,'' Roberts operates a small-town hardware
store and has a habit of getting cold feet every time she is about
to marry, leaving a trail of dejected fiances standing at the
altar. Gere is a misogynistic newspaper columnist who investigates
the story and, inevitably, falls for her.
 &HT;    ``The script was very charming and made me laugh out loud,''
Gere says. ``I couldn't help thinking, `This is Julia _ this is
her.' So I called and said, `Look, we've been trying to find
something, and I can't find a reason not to do this.'''
 &HT;    He sent her the script and she quickly called back and told him
it was terrific. Whereupon, Gere admits, he himself began to
equivocate.
 &HT;    ``I told her, `Look, whether I do it or not, it's perfect for
you and it's what people want to see you in,''' he recalls. ``She
said, `I won't do it unless you do it.'''
 &HT;    Thus ``Runaway Bride'' was off and running. But Gere is quick to
note that he's not the same man he was in 1990, and his approach to
acting is different.
 &HT;    ``I enjoy it and it's fun,'' he says. ``When it doesn't become
fun anymore, I won't do it.
 &HT;    ``But these days I don't take acting that seriously,'' he
continues. ``It's a job, it's not my life. Wherever I am, I want to
create a nurturing and comforting environment _ even on film sets.
After over 20 years in this business, I like to find time to think
about my beliefs, about music, photography and other things.''
 &HT;    As a devout Buddhist, Gere strongly supports the Dalai Lama,
which in turn has involved him increasingly in charitable
activities that have taken him around the world.
 &HT;    Shortly after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, the actor recalls,
he spent a week visiting a Kosovar refugee camp on the Macedonian
border. He had been speaking in Geneva at a human-rights conference
on Tibet when the opportunity to go came up, and he seized the
opportunity.
 &HT;    ``I had been helping Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders and felt
it was a good time to go _ at the beginning of the crisis,'' he
says.
 &HT;    He was impressed with what he saw.
 &HT;    ``Basically we were told the truth of what was happening,'' he
recalls, ``but clearly it wasn't black-and-white. There were no
heroes on any side.
 &HT;    ``I could talk about it for hours,'' Gere says, ``but what it
meant to me was that I could bring a little joy to the people who
were there, because they knew me _ it was part of the whole surreal
experience for them to be in no man's land between Kosovo and
Macedonia, and Richard Gere shows up and talks to them about what's
happening.''
 &HT;    On the personal front Gere, who was married to model Cindy
Crawford from l991 to l995 and of late has been involved with
actress/model Carey Lowell of television's ``Law and Order,'' says
that children aren't on his priority list.
 &HT;    ``I don't have a strong desire to have my own children,'' he
said. ``My voyage in this life is to find and understand myself,
and that's a far too selfish quest to involve children.''
 &HT;    How that statement stands now is open to question, however: At
press time, it was reported that Lowell is expecting a child early
in the new year, a baby who would be Gere's first.
 &HT;    It's the latest twist in a highly unusual life whose early years
were spent on a bucolic farm in upstate New York. Though he dropped
out of college to become an actor, Gere says that all along he was
more interested in studying philosophy and playing in a band _
acting was simply a good way to make money.
 &HT;    That decision, he says, turned him into a completely different
person.
 &HT;    ``I don't lead a normal life,'' he admits. ``I resigned myself
to that years ago.''
 &HT;    Gere made his movie debut in ``Report to the Commissioner''
(l975), and then became something of a sex symbol thanks to dark,
edgy roles such as Diane Keaton's dangerous pickup in ``Looking For
Mr. Goodbar'' (l977) and the lover for hire in ``American Gigolo''
(l980).
 &HT;    True stardom came with ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' (l982),
which cast him opposite Debra Winger as a passionate, confused
young would-be fighter pilot.
 &HT;    ``We were all _ Winger and I _ hungry and energetic and wildly
optimistic about the power of what we were doing,'' he recalls. ``I
saw the movie again last year while surfing TV at 2 in the morning.
I barely recognized myself, and didn't even know who that guy was.
 &HT;    ``I was struck by how unpretentious the film was,'' he adds. ``A
really straightforward, well-told story.''
 &HT;    Since then, however, most of his movies have been dramas, with
``Pretty Woman'' the most noteworthy exception. The pattern
continues with his next film, Joan Chen's ``Autumn in New York,''
in which he plays a womanizing restaurateur who falls for a
terminally ill woman played by Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    Next up is one of Robert Altman's notoriously offbeat
comedy/dramas, ``Dr. T and His Women.''
 &HT;    Given his history as a dramatic actor, it's surprising to hear
that Gere actually prefers comedy to drama. The only reason he
doesn't do more romantic comedies, he says, is that decent scripts
are few and far between.
 &HT;    ``Someone asked me what romantic comedies I've liked in the last
10 years,'' he says, ``and you know, I couldn't think of any. You'd
think there would be millions.
 &HT;    ``It's extremely difficult to write intelligent, adult romantic
comedies that are combative, with smart people engaging in sharp
dialogue,'' he says. ``It's easier to be wet and do a sentimental
piece.''

CHILLING FARE AHEAD: PREPARE TO BE SCARED

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are this summer's other fright films:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Lake Placid`` (opening Friday, R): It sounds like ``Gator
Jaws,`` but with TV golden boy David E. Kelley scripting, ``Lake
Placid`` has snappy dialogue and quirky characters for its often
comedic monster mash starring Oliver Platt, Bill Pullman and
Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Haunting`` (July 23, PG-13): This remakes 1963's ``The
Haunting,'' a subtle horror film directed by Robert Wise around the
same time he did ``The Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are based on Shirley Jackson's novel ``The Haunting of Hill
House,'' not to be confused with Richard Matheson's imitative ``The
Legend of Hell House,'' which became a movie in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson
stay at a large haunted mansion to research its strange powers,
often shown via computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, writing partner of Houston-born filmmaker Wes Anderson
(``Rushmore''), says that such scenes weren't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say, `OK, now imagine this wall is turning into the
most terrifying thing you've ever seen, even though right now it's
just this curtain,''' he said. ``Sometimes I felt like I was in a
`Scooby Doo' episode, doing faces like Shaggy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was impressed by the elaborate set, created in the huge
hangar once used to house Howard Hughes' ``Spruce Goose'' plane.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also thinks ``The Haunting'' will be a departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a slasher movie,'' Wilson said. ``It's kind of
psychological _ and with people older than teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Deep Blue Sea`` (July 30, R) _ Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2)
directs this action thriller, which could be called ``Bigger
Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientifically engineered sharks get larger and smarter, then
decide they've been poked and prodded long enough. Their potential
snacks include Samuel L. Jackson and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Sixth Sense`` (Aug. 20, PG-13) _ Bruce Willis plays a
psychologist trying to help a troubled boy (Haley Joel) who can
see, hear and communicate with ghosts. Not all of the spirits are
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Astronaut's Wife`` (Aug. 27, not yet rated) _ Johnny
Depp plays an astronaut who isn't quite right after returning from
a messy space mission.

BRIDGET FONDA HAS NO FONDNESS FOR LAKES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS _ When you see Bridget Fonda going into
crocodile-filled water in ``Lake Placid,'' her scared look is not
all acting.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda really didn't want to get into that lake, but the 30-foot,
people-gulping, mechanical ``crocodilus`` was not the reason. She
just doesn't like lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' said Fonda, being humorous about it but
also clearly serious. ``I don't like lakes; I never have _ not
since camp. There's something about when something brushes up
against your leg and you think, `What was it?' and you're thinking
about water moccasins.
</P>
<P>
   ``And lake worms. There's just something stagnant about a lake.
There's something dark, and what grows there kind of ... I don't
know. It's iffy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda takes the opportunity to point out that she's also not
fond of jumping out of airplanes and that she's afraid of heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't sky-dive; I'm serious about that,'' she said, giving a
rich, throaty little laugh.
</P>
<P>
   She said she can, however, overcome her fear of lakes, if she
has the proper incentive _ such as a movie to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for no reason at all?'' she said. ``Just going to go take
a dip in a lake? That ain't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Lake Placid,'' a big creature feature that's more
tongue-in-cheek than actual monster mash, Fonda plays Kelly Scott,
a nature-phobic paleontologist sent by her museum to find out what
game wardens have discovered _ the hard way _ in a
deep-in-the-Maine-woods lake.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out to be a giant crocodile, which everyone agrees
can't possibly be there but nevertheless is. And it has quite an
appetite, too.
</P>
<P>
   Scott reluctantly teams with a game warden (Bill Pullman), an
eccentric crocodile buff (Oliver Platt) and a local sheriff pretty
disgusted with them all (Irish actor Brendan Gleeson, ``The
General'').
</P>
<P>
   As the film's title hints, the movie is subtly witty, the
product of screenwriter David E. Kelley, creator of the TV series
``Ally McBeal,`` ``Chicago Hope,`` ``Picket Fences`` and ``The
Practice.`` (He's married to Michelle Pfeiffer.) Kelley is the
reason Fonda and the rest of the cast made &UR;  &LR; what is otherwise a
throwback to the drive-in movies of days gone by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't define David Kelley's style, but it's very real, and
yet it's funny without the gags, without real obvious (comedy)
setups,'' Fonda said. ``I was reading (the script) and I was
laughing out loud. It's kind of poking fun and kind of taking
itself seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing that attracted Fonda was that Scott is an
annoying character _ at least at first _ with a background. As
Fonda has shown before, in films such as ``A Simple Plan,'' she's
quite willing to play characters who are a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love a challenge _ somebody who seems it would be really
hard to gain audience sympathy for. I like that. I find most people
sympathetic. I empathize with most people. I can make all kinds of
excuses for behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that, David Kelley is not afraid of people's
annoying habits and having them still be likable. He doesn't need
to make people saccharin. I really respect that because it's a cut
above the regular screenwriting shtick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid`` is the latest in a long line of off-the-beaten
paths taken by the adventurous Fonda in her 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   While her performances have almost always been applauded by
critics, and she's made a name for herself separate from her
distinguished acting family (she's the granddaughter of Henry
Fonda, niece of Jane Fonda and daughter of Peter Fonda), she
remains somewhat overlooked and underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Since her screen debut in 1988 in ``Aria,'' she has not only
overcome the simultaneous crutch/handicap/blessing of a famous name
but also has sustained a steady string of distinctive roles in
unusual pictures.
</P>
<P>
   While many actresses of her generation have disappeared after
playing safe but forgettable ``girlfriend'' roles to male stars in
bigger pictures, Fonda has been the lead or at least her own person
in most of her films.
</P>
<P>
   She's averaged more than three films a year, including major
roles or leads in ``Single White Female,`` ``Point of No Return,``
``Little Buddha,`` ``It Could Happen to You,`` ``City Hall,``
``Jackie Brown`` and ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   She has yet to have the breakthrough role that makes a really
big star _ and at 35, she may not. (She has the youthful looks to
play younger than her age, but she doesn't want such roles. ``It's
lost its appeal,'' she said. ``Young tends to be trendy. I'm not
interested in that.'')
</P>
<P>
   But she's had the kind of career most actors at least say they
would like to have, playing strong roles.
</P>
<P>
   If she has a theory why her career has stayed steady while so
many others have shot up briefly, then crashed just as fast, she
doesn't say.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the luck of it,'' she said, spreading her extra-long,
elegant fingers on her knee. ``I don't know how much of it is my
power and how much is just the way it goes. And then there's the
other question: How much of it is the _ I guess nepotism doesn't
really cover what I'm talking about, but the fact that I have a
famous, identifiable last name? Maybe that's what's kept me there.
I'll never know exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lake Placid, Fonda has several films coming up. Already
done is ``South of Heaven, West of Hell,`` which she describes as
``a Gothic western with everyone under the sun in it'' (Vince
Vaughn, Billy Bob Thornton, Paul Reubens and her dad, Peter Fonda).
It was written and directed by Dwight Yoakam, with whom Fonda
became involved after her breakup from longtime beau Eric Stoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Currently she is filming ``Monkey Bone,'' in which she plays the
friend of an animator, Brendan Fraser, who is in a coma. It's a
dark comedy with Whoopi Goldberg as Death. Reubens is in this one,
too, playing the voice of Monkey Bone, an animated character that
harasses the illustrator while he's unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda admits she has concerns about the lack of meaty roles for
women her age and older.

 &HT;    Psychological thriller `Blair Witch Project' trades blood and
gore for less is more
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might forget to breathe at the end of ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' the Sundance Film Festival favorite that takes the shape
of a spooky campfire tale updated to the hand-held-camcorder age.
</P>
<P>
   It's a film chock-full of grainy and blurred images that leaves
you unnerved, exhausted ... and reluctant to turn off the lights at
bedtime. Not since ``The Vanishing'' (the original French version)
has a movie built such a palpable sense of mortal dread. It does so
without a single computer-generated special effect and only the
tiniest splash of blood. A small masterpiece of filmmaking and
storytelling, it's a reminder that real terror sometimes comes from
what you don't see. It's an exhilarating scare.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into primal terrors, it's a ``Hansel and Gretel'' for
the end of the millennium, rewritten in favor of the witch. It's
best to experience this movie fresh, free of preconceptions. With
that caveat in mind, here's the setup.
</P>
<P>
   Three University of Maryland students _ portrayed by actors
Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard, lending their
own names to the flick _ decide to make a documentary about the
fabled Blair Witch. According to oral legend, this was a
child-killing she-fiend in the 18th-century township of Blair, a
place that continued to be plagued by murders and eerie goings-on
even after the citizens fled and founded another settlement,
Burkittsville.
</P>
<P>
   The students make a pit stop there, quizzing the locals about
the old legends. They hear tales of ``an old woman whose feet never
touched the ground'' and of a 1940s loner responsible for the
ritualistic killing of seven children. Then the students continue
their project, heading into the woods with backpacks and rations
and enough camera batteries to ``fuel a small country for a
month.'' They never return.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the truly clever (and creepy) premise: That ``Blair
Witch'' consists entirely of the video footage shot by the trio in
the woods, capturing on tape what happened to them. It's a
first-person journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying
to glimpse something moving in the shadows just beyond the
campfire.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, a wickedly smart fusion of story, structure and
creative use of limited resources, wrings chills out of the
slightest effects: odd, twiglike contraptions hanging from trees.
An unexpected pile of stones. Strange noises in the night. Like the
1963 version of ``The Haunting,'' its power comes from
psychological intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez were savvy
enough to make it a point of tension for Michael and Joshua that
Heather insists on filming everything. This justifies all the
footage _ even if you personally think the last thing you'd do when
you're running in terror is remember to hit the ``record'' switch.
The movie crackles with the reality of a genuine documentary.
There's a reason for that. The actors endured a sort of boot-camp
experience _ spending eight days in the woods, improvising much of
the script according to notes left by the director-producers, and
subsisting on dwindling food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   They're all terrific, degenerating from sardonic college kids to
panicked wrecks. Their fight scenes are as scary as any of the
nighttime assaults by their unseen tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   But Donahue is the standout. She starts off as the team's
cheerleader, a perkily annoying project director (think of
``Election's'' perfectionist class-president contender Tracy Flick
with a camera). She also does a pitch-perfect parody of
documentary-speak, in shots of the unfinished film-within-the-film.
Finally, she embodies paralyzed terror, delivering an already
famous, up-close video confession near the end of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ingenious in its conception, consummate in its you-are-there
execution and unforgettably chilling, ``The Blair Witch Project''
is proof that sometimes simplicity is the most powerful artistic
choice. In a summer of bloated and boring Hollywood spectaculars
like ``Wild Wild West,'' this is one movie that actually lives up
to its buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
Rated R for language. At Tara. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: You may never go camping again.

 &HT;    Kermit, Miss Piggy and friends take hilarity into space
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teletubbies may come and go, but Muppets are forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muppets From Space'' is more Muppet madness _ a manic mix of
vaudeville shtick, kid-friendly slapstick and hilarious movie
in-jokes, ranging from ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' to
``Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot, of course, matters little. The Great Gonzo (that
vulture-beaked thingie voiced by David Goelz) is shown literally
missing the boat. No, not the Titanic. The Ark. See, Noah isn't
exactly sure what Gonzo is and won't let him on board. And besides,
there's only one of him.
</P>
<P>
   Skip ahead a few millennia. Gonzo is still hung up on his roots.
His search for family ties takes an extraterrestrial turn, and the
next thing we know he's been kidnapped by a paranoid government
agent (``The Larry Sanders Show's'' superfoil, Jeffrey Tambor).
Meanwhile, Miss Piggy (voiced by Frank Oz), who works for the TV
show ``UFOMania,'' intends to use Gonzo's spaced-out odyssey as a
career springboard from coffee pig to on-air anchor-ham.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, a lot of the jokes zip over the little ones' heads.
But parents will appreciate the many clever touches (check out the
fly-splattered wallpaper in Kermit's room or the Mice Girls poster
that provides a ``Shawshank Redemption'' gag). And the Muppets'
patented, post-1960s style of inherent sweetness and screwball
comedy works as well here as it did for kids 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Add a few celebrity cameos _ Andie MacDowell, David Arquette,
Ray Liotta, Rob Schneider, a ``Dawson's Creek'' kid or two _ and
you've got a winning family-film formula.
</P>
<P>
   This is a movie for families who, in theory, may be intrigued by
the much-trumpeted ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' but
really don't want to risk it. Besides, when it comes to sheer '90s
weirdness, you can read anything you want into this exchange
between Gonzo and his roomie, Rizzo the Rat: A frazzled Gonzo
confesses that he's had ``that dream'' again, and Rizzo sighs,
``Not the one about the dwarf and the jar of peanut butter?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Muppets From Space''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring the Great Gonzo, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
Directed by Tim Hill. Rated G. At metro
</P>
<P>
   theaters. 1 hour, 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Beam us up, Gonzo.

 &HT;    Reptilian hunk best part of `Lake Placid'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll dig the 30-foot crocodile in ``Lake Placid.'' But you'll
want him to eat all the humans, quickly. They include bland game
warden Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), paleontologist Kelly Scott
(Bridget Fonda) and wacko mythology professor Hector Cyr (Oliver
Platt), who've gathered at a remote New England lake to investigate
some strange killings.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda plays the feisty, nature-hating city girl who quips ``I'm
allergic to timber'' and sprays the open air with bug repellent.
You can imagine Calista Flockhart tossing off these lines; they're
the trademark work of glib writer-producer David E. Kelley (``Ally
McBeal''). What seems smart and charming on the small screen plays
precious and tinny on the big one.
</P>
<P>
   In this sometimes watchable, underpopulated ``Jaws'' retread,
the croc attacks are predictable and rudimentary. This is the sort
of movie in which no one but bit players gets their head bitten
off. Pity. The scares aren't scary, the laughs aren't funny and
poor Fonda has to keep falling off moving vehicles (boats, trucks)
directly into the path of the monster croc, like some hapless 1940s
heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Gleeson, the brilliant star of John Boorman's ``The
General,'' is reduced to pratfalls as a local sheriff. Betty White
is dragged in to do her familiar sweet-old-lady-with-a-foul-mouth
routine. And Pullman is so laconic that he's upstaged by the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Winston's crocodile (animatronic and computer-generated) is
a winner. But you know there's something wrong with the flick when
you're more worried about the fate of an imperiled heifer than any
of the humans.
</P>
<P>
   A weird mixture of thrills, snickers and political correctness,
``Lake Placid'' never hits a remotely believable note. It's the
first ecologically sensitive, feel-good monster movie. Huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda and Oliver Platt. Rated R
for violent creature attacks and related gore, and for language. At
metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A crock of a croc tale.

 &HT;    Friendship's the focus in `The Wood'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' is so awkwardly structured and meandering that you
might be surprised at how effectively it starts to grow on you.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Rick Famuyiwa's autobiographical feature film
debut charts the friendship of three buddies from Inglewood, Calif.
(``the Wood'' for short). We meet them as adults, first Mike (Omar
Epps), who gets the movie off to a very shaky start, addressing the
camera and shoveling exposition at the audience.
</P>
<P>
   He's a groomsman for pal Roland (Taye Diggs), due to be married
any minute now. The only problem is, no one knows where Roland has
gone on this, the morning of his wedding. So it's up to Mike and
fellow groomsman Slim (Richard T. Jones) to track down the wayward
hubby-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   When they find him, he's very, very, very drunk. So the morning
becomes a prolonged dry-out spell, as Slim and Mike drive Roland
around _ and reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``The Wood'' takes place in 1986, as young Mike (Sean
Nelson) arrives from North Carolina and learns the SoCal ropes from
young Roland (Trent Cameron) and young Slim (Duane Finley).
``Either you gang-bang or you play ball,'' young Slim explains.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, they also spend a lot of time thinking about girls,
debating who's hotter, Vanity or Apollonia. They compete to get the
most girls' phone numbers at school dances and place bets on who'll
lose his virginity first.
</P>
<P>
   The main girl in the film is Alicia (Malinda Williams), who is
given the sort of ogling, slow-motion entrance that has become a
cliche in teen movies. She's an idealized creature who's a little
bit of everything: gorgeous, down to earth, refined and
hot-hot-hot.
</P>
<P>
   But as ``The Wood'' gets longer, it also gets deeper. It
graduates from Mike's first boorish grab at Alicia's posterior to a
sex scene distinguished by well-observed humor and the kind of
real-life candor you don't usually find in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in the present, we hang with the adult version
of the boys and see all the ways they've grown up, and haven't.
Epps, Jones and Diggs have such airtight rapport, as they banter
over pizza, that you forget you're watching actors. Their
friendship rings true.
</P>
<P>
   That friendship is what sets ``The Wood'' apart from the usual
genre pigeonholing of African-American movies. It avoids the usual
urban-gangsta, raunchy-comedy niches and becomes something much
more universal. It's a male-bonding flick that transcends issues of
race.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a footnote: In a summer characterized by gross-out
sight gags at the multiplex, the movie holds its own with one
protracted barf scene that's as funny as it is vile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps, Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones. Rated R for
strong language and strong sexuality. 1 hour, 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A meandering but affecting tale of friendship.

VIETNAMESE BUSINESSMAN FIGHTS FOR TEJANO BAR IN SMALL TEXAS TOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For weekend release, July 17-18) 
(Eds.: Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALVIN, Texas _ There's a faraway look in the eyes of Michael
Thanh Lee, a would-be businessman who has the dull gaze of someone
who's just been hit between the eyes with a two-by-four.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese immigrant toiled unremarkably in real estate and
insurance before deciding to start a business in a downscale
shopping center in Alvin, which is about 30 miles south of downtown
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting an enterprise, Lee chose a different path from that
chosen by most of his expatriate countrymen. He decided to open a
Tejano bar.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Then he made another miscalculation. He chose as his location a
blue-collar town where he soon discovered a budding movement to
clamp restrictions on the beer-joint industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's biggest mistake, however, was his decision to promote his
business before the all-important beer license had been signed,
sealed and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   When he hung a big banner outside the 3,000-square-foot space he
leased at the Meadow Park Shopping Center that proclaimed, ``Coming
Soon Tejano Night Club,'' neighboring residents went into battle
mode.
</P>
<P>
   Their displeasure, they insist, has nothing to do with the
Hispanic clientele that would be attracted to a Tejano bar, or that
the proprietor would be of Vietnamese descent.
</P>
<P>
   They're just sick of bars and all the problems they bring, the
neighbors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two o'clock, when that thing lets out, it'll be a madhouse,
just like it was before,'' predicted C.B. Jolly, a 68-year-old
farrier who lives across the street from the shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   He and other residents tell stories of drunken men and women
venturing into their yards and driveways after stumbling out of
bars that were located in the shopping center in past years.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lee tried to open his bar, however, no one in Alvin had
ever protested the issuance of a beer license for a watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that is simple, say bar opponents. Unlike Lee,
none of the other bar owners ever advertised their plans before
obtaining a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where he screwed up,'' Jolly said.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee's banner went up, nearby residents persuaded the City
Council to sign a letter of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, police chief, a council member and residents showed
up at a March 31 license hearing convened by Brazoria County Judge
John Willy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like walking into a lynch mob,'' said Robert Clements,
an Alvin lawyer who represents Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lee's application for a beer license met all the
technical requirements of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission,
the judge denied the request, citing ``the general welfare, health,
peace, morals, safety and sense of decency of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers pursue that, Lee, 43, said he does little more
than sit around his home in southwest Houston and feel the walls
close in around him. He's broke and his wife is grumpy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's already mentioned divorce,'' he said. ``Every day she
says, `What happened to your club?' I feel terrible. I told her
it's not because of my failure. I try to be a man and support my
family, but they won't let me. It's like I live in a communist
country again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, whose business venture was inspired by a friend who owns a
successful Tejano bar in Houston, said he has spent $70,000 to try
to open his bar.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents are not sympathetic, saying he was a fool to
invest money in an enterprise that he knew neighborhood opponents
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's foes say they also want to clamp down on other beer joints
by restricting them to certain areas of town.
</P>
<P>
   Petitions that urge Alvin to take action are circulating, said
Laura Burton, the leader of the self-styled temperance movement,
who lives across the street from the Tejano bar that has been
stymied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't intend to give up,'' said Burton, a 45-year-old
bookkeeper. ``I don't think anyone is very happy with the number of
bars in Alvin.''
</P>
<P>
   In a weird way, she has Michael Thanh Lee to thank for the
public interest that has been stirred up over the issue. Without
his Tejano bar venture, no one in Alvin would have had a chance to
stage the city's first protest over a beer license.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse Lee, though, if he doesn't have that same sense of civic
pride as Burton and her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible,'' he said recently, standing in his empty,
windowless bar amid brand-new bar stools that never have been used.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Lee added: ``To be honest with you, I
don't know that much about Tejano music.''

LIFE ON THE EDGE: YOUTH GROUP SAYS `TERRORIST' IMAGE NOT JUSTIFIED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For weekend release, July 17-18) 
(Attn.: Utah)

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ To the Fur Breeders Agricultural Cooperative in Sandy,
Utah, Straight Edge is a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   To Anthony Calleo, it's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Calleo, an honors student at the University of St. Thomas in
Houston, said the controversial youth movement saved him from the
life of a junkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight Edge totally isn't a bad thing,'' he said. ``It's a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of this small, loosely organized group adhere to a
strict and wholesome philosophy: no drinking, no smoking, no drugs,
no promiscuous sex. Many are vegetarians; some won't even drink
caffeine. Their fondness for body piercings and loud music hardly
seems unconventional these days.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, the group also has been under fire
nationally after the arrest of some adherents for attacking smokers
or bombing stores, such as the fur co-op, in the name of animal
rights. In Salt Lake City, two face murder charges after a brawl
between Straight Edgers and members of other gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Calleo and other Houston-area young people who believe in the
movement say the national media have blown the exploits of a few
out of proportion, negating the positive impact it has had on
thousands. Those who take Straight Edge to the point of vigilantism
are known as ``hard-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me why I still associate myself with a movement
that has those kind of people in it and identifying themselves with
it,'' Calleo said recently. ``It's because if I didn't, it'd be
like giving up something that meant so much to me to people I think
are just going to ruin it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Straight Edge scene in Houston involves about 150 young
people, from teens to adults in their late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the Straight Edgers, Calleo, 19, is a white male
who has battled drugs and alcohol. His hair is shorn and he keeps a
bandana tied around his forehead. Calleo's arms are covered with
tattoos starting at his shoulders and his ears and lower lip are
pierced. To a recent Straight Edge concert he wore Converse tennis
shoes, baggy pants and a basketball jersey with ``Hatebreed'' on
the front of it.
</P>
<P>
   Before he started claiming Straight Edge, which he described as
a grass-roots movement, Calleo said he was well on his way to
becoming a statistic.
</P>
<P>
   Calleo has a history of alcoholism on both sides of his family,
he said, and by the time he was 12 he had already started drinking
and smoking. That led to marijuana, speed, acid and Ecstacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally I started getting more into punk rock and less into
drugs,'' Calleo said. ``I started listening to it and started
reading the lyrics, and more and more I started to see where doing
drugs was getting me. I didn't like doing them anymore and I didn't
like how it was making me feel. ... I was 16 then and that's when I
went Straight Edge.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next six months, Calleo said, he continued to hang out
with his old friends who were a ``bunch of drunk punk rockers.'' As
he straightened out he realized he needed his friends to be clean,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't just watch them kill themselves anymore,'' Calleo
said. ``It (Straight Edge) is a personal choice to make yourself
better. Before you can change the world you've got to change
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Cynthia Calleo, described his maturation and
decision to go Straight Edge as ``getting his snap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He found out he could be himself without alcohol, drinking and
doing drugs,'' she said. ``I'm very proud of kids who are Straight
Edge, not just Anthony. There are so many things out there to
influence them, and they just say no and stick to their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era where drugs and alcohol are common among youth, it may
not be surprising that teens turn to a movement such as Straight
Edge to resist peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I'm going to label myself Straight Edge is when
I'm in a situation where there are alcohol and drugs,'' said Emily
O'Neal, a sophomore at St. Thomas. ``People don't get it when you
say `I don't want any,' but they know not to mess with you if
you're Straight Edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teens who have decided to go Straight Edge said it is more
than just the decision to be drug-free. It's a united resistance to
all vices and abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Douglas Smith, 25, wears a beaded necklace that says
``Poison Clan.'' It, like the tattoos and shirts other Straight
Edgers wear, signifies his commitment to the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do take Straight Edge to the point to where it's a
brotherhood,'' said Smith. ``It's not really a gang, it's more like
we back each other up. It's something of a religious thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Straight Edgers slip from their path of sobriety, they are
said to have ``fallen'' or ``lost their edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of my friends were to fall, it's not like I would say,
`Hey, you're out. I don't care about you,' because that's not what
friendship is about,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be right there to help them up and say, `Hey man, you
chose Straight Edge for your life. You didn't want this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Straight Edge originated on the East Coast in the 1980s and
spread throughout the United States through punk and hardcore
music, which espouses the values of Straight Edgers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers old enough to get into clubs often are marked with Xs
to show that they aren't old enough to drink. As the Straight Edge
movement took hold, the X became its symbol because those who claim
it have no intention of drinking. At concerts, Straight Edgers
often mark the backs of their hands with a large X.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Xs are like Christian art,'' O'Neal said. ``They are
symbols there to remind you of who you are and to tell others:
`This is what I stand for.'''
</P>
<P>
   The name Straight Edge came from lyrics in a 1981 song by the
Washington, D.C.-based punk band Minor Threat:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a person just like you
</P>
<P>
   But I've got better things to do
</P>
<P>
   Than sit around and smoke dope ...
</P>
<P>
   I've got a straight edge.``
</P>
<P>
   On June 19, the Houston club Fitzgerald's hosted Metalfest III,
with a collection of hardcore and Straight Edge bands. They played
to a crowd of Straight Edgers and hardcore fans alike.
</P>
<P>
   The musical styles are the same, with punk and metal sounds
heavy on guitar riffs and loud drums. The singing is more like
deep, throaty screaming into a microphone. It sent some running for
ear plugs, but it led others into a dancing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is the lyrics, with Straight Edge songs focusing
on the movement's values.
</P>
<P>
   As Finer Truth, a local Straight Edge band, started to perform,
Straight Edgers thronged the front of the stage. Calleo was in the
thick of it, thrashing his arms, colliding with people and throwing
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards stood a few feet away with a watchful eye toward
the crowd, but despite the violent nature of the dancing everyone
seemed at ease. Those who didn't want to get involved simply stood
farther from the stage. Audience members there only for the
hardcore music smoked cigarettes and nursed beers by the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the energy I need to release, as far as negative energy, I
release through dancing. It's not like moshing, it's kick-boxing,''
said Smith.``The music is very angry, but that's how I get my
release.''
</P>
<P>
   Music has been a common thread in Straight Edge since its
beginning, and it is a way to reach others with the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be another 14-year-old kid out there who is just
like me, who gets into Straight Edge and ... for the first time
he's not hearing someone who's a cop, a teacher, a priest, a
parent, an adult ... saying that doing drugs, destroying your body
and hurting other people and getting drunk all the time is wasting
your life,'' Calleo said.
</P>
<P>
   Some teen-agers at the concert said Straight Edgers go too far
trying to persuade others to leave their vices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive movement, but a lot of times they get
overzealous with it, pushing their beliefs over the edge and
getting in fights with friends,'' said Brett Heinselman, 24, who
attended the Metalfest.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Lepine, a recent graduate of Klein High School, said,
``I think it's fine, but I just think people are taking it too far,
like when they are taking it to extremes or hurting other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other teens expressed similar concerns, but no one could
actually name anyone who had gotten in a fight with a Straight
Edger over beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the negative publicity, including a damning
report on ABC-TV's ``20/20,'' has been based on incidents in the
Salt Lake City area. But even Salt Lake officials said the
spotlight has been focused on Straight Edge unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't (cooperate with) any stories about Straight Edge
because there has been so much inflammatory, misinformation about
Straight Edge in the past,'' said Lt. Zane Smith, director of the
Salt Lake Area Gang Project. ``We have some problems with Straight
Edge, but comparatively it's minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite scattered incidents in other cities, the problems in
Utah have gotten most of the media attention. Houston Straight
Edgers said that means five or 10 hard-liners are giving a bad name
to a movement of several thousand across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to preach to anyone. I tell them who I am and why
I am, but if they don't want to do it, they're not going to do
it,'' said Chris Williams, 19. ``I'm not going to say, `Get away
from me, you're smoking or you're drinking.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Garcia, the Houston Police Department liaison to the
Mayor's Anti-Gang Office, confirmed that there have been no known
problems with Straight Edgers in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of the Straight Edge phenomena, but ... we haven't
had any incidents with Straight Edge here in Houston,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in Dallas and Los Angeles also said they were
following the story about Straight Edgers and their alleged
exploits in Utah, but that they have not had any problems with
them, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight Edge is not a popular thing in Houston, Texas.
Straight Edge is not for the masses,'' said Smith. ``I wish I could
be like everyone else, but I'm not. I have this conviction that's
stronger than anything else in my life other than the love for my
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Calleo, like Smith, said he agrees it would be easier to be like
everyone else, but he has to do what he believes is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say I'll be Straight Edge until I die. I'm not
going to be 35 years old putting Xs on my hands and going to shows
and dances, but I'll be drug-free and chemical-free with that
mind-set for the rest of my life,'' Calleo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it because it's better for me, it's better for other
people. I also do it because I think no matter what, my actions are
going to affect other people.''
</P>

GREATNESS ELUDES KUBRICK AGAIN IN `EYES WIDE SHUT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:   3 stars  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With so many expectations and varied anticipations
attending ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' it's doubtful many people will go to
it with anything like a sense of perspective. But that is precisely
the attitude required to appreciate Stanley Kubrick's sometimes
astounding, sometimes frustrating final work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes'' is more like Kubrick's last three films (``Barry
Lyndon,'' ``The Shining,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'') than the earlier,
flawless masterpieces (``The Killing,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,''
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'') that his genius
reputation stands on.
</P>
<P>
   It's a movie of brilliant individual elements and borderline
ludicrous excesses not quite orchestrated into a satisfying whole.
As in ``Lyndon,'' Kubrick's lighting here is exquisite enough to
induce tears. The emotionally riveting opening act is as powerful
as ``Metal's'' boot camp sequences. And there's a deeper, more
profound understanding of how runaway imagination can warp one's
personal relations than ``The Shining'' ever got to.
</P>
<P>
   But enough comparisons. Just keep in mind that this is very much
an imperfect, late Kubrick work _ and, since it's his last, one
with uncharacteristic undertones of summing up and taking stock. At
heart, ``Eyes'' is a simple, moral ode to marriage as the ultimate
source of adult satisfaction, no matter how difficult it may be for
a man and a woman to love, trust and satisfy one other. It's not
the most scintillating theme the often pessimistic,
above-good-and-evil artist ever worked, but it seems like the most
heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   Married actors Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play Dr. William and
Alice Harford, a wealthy New York couple who think their eight-year
marriage is very, very good until they start to believe otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   At a Christmas party hosted by immensely rich friend Victor
Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), both Harfords encounter _ and reject _
serious romantic temptation. While this has the initial effect of
inflaming their passions for one another (that eyebrow-raising nude
scene in the ads, which as it turns out is the only Cruise-Kidman
coupling in the 2{-hour film), it soon leads to a bout of
marijuana-fueled incriminations. In this, the best scene in the
movie, Kidman masterfully delivers a blistering, heart-rending
monologue, in which Alice reveals not an act of infidelity but a
powerful urge to commit one.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the raw honesty of the dialogue, coupled with
Kubrick's signature overglowing lamplight and his subtly yet
relentlessly inquisitive moving camera, establishes a remarkable
atmosphere of total exposure. One feels no thought can long remain
hidden in this hyper-illuminated environment _ not even from the
person who doesn't want to think it.
</P>
<P>
   But then the movie shifts into a more surreal, differently
paranoid gear. Stunned by his wife's resentment and revelations,
William runs out into the cold city night, where he'll both avidly
and reluctantly encounter evermore bizarre erotic possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not as mesmerizing as the husband-wife confrontation
the film initially seemed to be going for, ``Eyes'' nonetheless
does a good job of evoking the excitement and queasiness one feels
when seriously contemplating infidelity. It's been said that Cruise
gives a reactive performance here, but that's not entirely true.
William is often as insistent as a man fired by jealousy and
wayward passion can be; he just doesn't know what to make of some
of the stranger choices (and their consequences) he encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Which is an understandable response; frankly, the film is awash
in head-scratching motifs.
</P>
<P>
   The most elaborate one is a ritualized orgy inside a castlelike
Long Island mansion, where the rich male guests wear black cloaks
and Venetian masks and the hired female help wear masks, too, but
nothing else. The long, lascivious, undeniably virtuosic sequence _
it's the one where cheesy digital ``observers'' had to be inserted
between American viewers and vigorous copulators in order to secure
an R rating _ is meant to evoke revulsion over decadent,
voyeuristic and loveless sex.
</P>
<P>
   It probably will for some, but others will, not wrongly, respond
with derisive chuckling. And others would be equally justified in
questioning why so much perfectly formed feminine flesh was needed
to make so moralistic a point.
</P>
<P>
   The scene would have fit more naturally in !ital!fin-de-siecle
Vienna, where in fact Arthur Schnitzler's source story,
``Traumnovelle,'' was set, than in contemporary New York. On the
other hand, it more than visualizes the half-waking unreality that
engulfs William. The book's title translates into English as
``Dream Novel,'' and indeed Kubrick has good fun reflecting life,
cinema and the unruly unconscious off of one another throughout the
movie. Even Kidman's second indelible speech describes what Alice
calls a nightmare but nonetheless seems to have thoroughly enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is the feast of technique,
Freudian inquiry and personal audacity many people might go to it
expecting. It also could have used some judicious pruning,
especially in the last act, that one suspects Kubrick might have
done had he not died shortly after completing his first cut.
</P>
<P>
   Most will probably find the film alternately exhilarating and
inscrutable _ like a vital relationship, or the body of work of a
great artist who, like all of them, didn't always achieve
greatness. &QL;

BOYS MAKE GOOD IN `THE WOOD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:   2 1/2 stars  
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A wedding provides a convenient framing device for
films about young people who are in transition but haven't lived
enough to have had many other compelling live experiences. A
slightly sinking feeling overcomes the viewer about halfway through
``The Wood,'' when the realization sets in that its wedding story
is just that _ a framing device _ and that not much fresh and
interesting is really going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Wood of the title is Inglewood, described near the outset as
``a small suburb of Los Angeles.'' Told in flashback, the movie
follows three kids as they grow up and make good in the Wood.
Though we don't see them giving much thought to school beyond girls
and basketball, they all seem to end up getting into good colleges
and making decent money as young adults.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie unfolds, it becomes apparent that it's not going to
deal with the fact that everyone in the movie is African-American _
though the constant use of the ``n'' word by the all-black cast may
make white viewers a bit uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers aren't necessarily obligated to deal with race. But
the movie misses many dramatic opportunities by glossing over
issues particular to growing up black in a neighborhood like
Inglewood. For example, even in a scene where the three young
friends get pulled over by police after accidentally falling in
with two hoods, both officers are black.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this is a sweet but familiar coming-of-age tale. Mike,
Slim and Roland meet in junior high school and become fast friends.
In high school, they make a bet on who will lose his virginity
first. All of these scenes are played not by the film's top-billed
stars _ Omar Epps, Richard T. Jones and Taye Diggs _ but by three
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   These three _ Sean Nelson, Duane Finley and Trent Cameron _ are
all talented. Nelson is especially effective as the young Mike, who
moves from North Carolina and must learn to fit into the Southern
California culture.
</P>
<P>
   Their coming of age mainly consists of learning the ways of
love, 16-year-old style: that is, how to ask a girl to dance, how
to mask bad breath and how to conceal an embarrassingly
inappropriate erection. It's sometimes charming and mildly amusing,
but that's as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   In the too-brief scenes set in the present, Roland (Taye Diggs)
is agonizing over giving up his freedom by getting married. The
self-styled playboy of the three friends, he is the first one to
decide to tie the knot. But beyond the superficial reasoning that
no young man really wants to be ``tied down,'' we get little
insight into why he's gone on a drunken jag just hours before his
wedding _ or why his friends remain adamantly single. Is the
widespread absence of fathers in their world perhaps a cause? We
can only speculate.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to see these three fine actors _ Diggs, Epps
and Jones _ together again in a film with more teeth in it. This
film will likely win some modest popularity among the
African-American audience, but probably won't, on its own, win the
actors the more widespread praise they deserve. &QL;

TABLES ARE TURNED IN `DINNER GAME`

By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Francis Veber, perhaps the most successful and
least respected Gallic filmmaker of his generation, finally
achieves a kind of auteurist purity with his latest farce, ``The
Dinner Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusually acclaimed by the critics in France (where, more
typically for a Veber film, it was a huge popular hit), the movie
distills the director's characteristic odd couple formula to its
amusing essence. Most of the hits Veber has written or directed, as
well as their American remakes _ ``La Cage aux Folles,'' ``Le
Fugitifs'' and ``Father's Day'' are a few _ have been Abbott and
Costello updates, in which an obvious loser and a self-styled smart
guy are mutually made fools of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner Game,'' based on a long-running Parisian stage play
that Veber also wrote, is all that and not an extraneous note more.
And it's as well-timed and funny as a modern-day drawing room
comedy can conceivably be.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderfully cruel notion at the heart of the story involves
a special idiot's dinner that smug Paris yuppies stage at regular
intervals. Each of these guys is supposed to find an incredibly
pathetic guest to bring along for his fellow hosts' entertainment;
the dumbest, most boring entry wins the game. Of course, the
``guests'' are not to know they're there solely to be belittled.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre (Thierry Lhermitte), a successful publisher, figures he's
found paydirt in the person of Francois (Jacques Villeret), a
tubby, divorced Finance Ministry accountant whose passion in life
is building matchstick models of French monuments. Pierre befriends
the schlub and invites him for a predinner drink at his posh
apartment. He's so confident that he'll win that evening's game
that even his beautiful wife, Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot),
storms out in the face of Pierre's vicious self-satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Pierre wrenched his back on the golf course
earlier in the day. By the time Francois arrives, Pierre is in
enough pain to make attending the dinner next to impossible. Of
course, Francois wants to comfort and help his new friend. Just as
predictably, Pierre will be lucky to make it through the night
alive because he was eminently right: Francois is a spectacularly
inept individual. With the best of intentions and almost systematic
precision, he all but destroys Pierre's health, marriage, financial
security and overweening ego.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the main action almost entirely confined to a few rooms,
Veber exhibits a mastery of cinematic space, pacing and escalating
comic catastrophe you might think beyond the grasp of a mere
joke-writer. ``Dinner Game's'' scope and ideas may be limited, but
they're judiciously presented and satisfyingly realized. Though a
mere 80 minutes long, the film never feels rushed or cramped.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are, of course, all-important here. Lhermitte's
sophisticated, barely controlled contempt melds gracefully with
Villeret's eager doofishness, and as roles inevitably reverse
through the trying evening, each actor reveals facets of his
character that, considering they're just comic constructs, humanize
them to a refreshing extent. Supporting players are uniformly
excellent, too, especially Daniel Prevost as Francois'
soccer-obsessed, congenitally suspicious colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' is hardly complex, just slightly
sophisticated and not exactly brimming with surprises. Yet its
simple pleasures are so perfectly arrayed, it offers all the
satisfaction of a good, hearty meal. &QL;

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ ``The Blair Witch Project'' is a textbook case of
timing. Coming as it does after a slew of slaughterhouse horror
movies where blood was thicker than originality, this creepy
treatise in terror recalls a time when fear, not form, was the
filmmaker's goal. This is a truly original movie, tapping into
primal anxieties while blazing its own unique trail into the dark
and foreboding woods.
</P>
<P>
   The film's premise is so perfect that it's a wonder no one had
ever thought of it before. Then again, Hollywood was too busy
cranking out franchises like ``Friday the 13th'' (nine movies),
``Halloween'' (six) and ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' (six) to bother
with unprofitable invention. The ``Scream'' series and its clones
have continued the formula, albeit with a mocking, self-referential
tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch'' doesn't bother with gore or guts or glorified
serial killers. Its plot goes straight to the darkest recesses of
our collective imagination, borrowing from such diverse sources as
the brothers Grimm, MTV's ``Real World'' (from hell) and the
bogeyman demons that chase us in the pitch-black night.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the setup: Three student filmmakers hike into the
Maryland woods to make a documentary about a local legend, the
Blair Witch. They're never heard from again. A year later, the
footage they shot is found buried beneath an abandoned house. Those
scenes _ sometimes shaky, often out-of-focus, but always revealing
_ constitute ``The Blair Witch Project.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea provides an outstanding vehicle for a couple of
struggling first-time directors to make their debut. Film school
classmates Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick wrote and directed ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' although the movie's three cast members
actually handled the camera work and improvised most of the
dialogue. The special effects are limited to some spooky rock
formations and an alarming array of twig figures hanging from trees
near the kids' campsite.
</P>
<P>
   But budget restraints don't make the cumulative effect of the
movie any less disquieting. In the film's early moments, we watch
the earnest documentarians interviewing Maryland townsfolk and
filming solemn scenes outside cemeteries. Once they venture into
the woods, most of the footage comes from the behind-the-scenes
videotape shot by the group's leader, Heather (Heather Donahue), a
resourceful young woman with a Capt. Ahab-like determination to see
her project through to the end.
</P>
<P>
   The naturalistic footage perfectly captures the growing
frustrations and tensions that Heather and her fellow students _
cameraman Joshua (Joshua Leonard) and sound technician Michael
(Michael Williams) _ begin to feel as they wander the forest, their
bearings and their hope waning with each successive day. Rarely has
nightfall seemed so soul-shattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' works as a masterful piece of
psychological horror, but the movie stands as just one piece of an
elaborate mythology. The film's Web site (!bold!blairwitch.com)
sketches out a time line and continues the story with details of a
police investigation and interviews with family members left
behind. A special on the Sci-Fi Channel and various book tie-ins
will also expand the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   It's a kind of creative synergy that could make ``The Blair
Witch Project'' one of the most influential movies in years. As it
stands, it will likely have the same effect on forest camping that
``Jaws'' had on ocean swimming.
</P>

SECOND HALF WILL SHOW WHAT RED SOX REALLY HAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The party was a blast, but after a day of taking down
the bunting, sweeping out the trash, and tucking Pedro finally to
bed, the season must go on.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox resume play with that bane of Jimy Williams's
existence, interleague play, as the Philadelphia Phillies arrive
for a three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are 3-9 against their National League cousins, with
three games to follow against the Florida Marlins when the Phillies
leave town.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a moment to consider the obvious. The first
half exceeded all expectations. The Sox are on a pace to win 90
games, just two fewer than the total that got them a wild card last
season. They're just four games behind the Yankees in the AL East,
but the gap between second and third place is even smaller, as the
Toronto Blue Jays have crept to within three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have played the best teams in the league very well
head-to-head. In games against the division-leading Yankees,
Indians and Rangers, they're 12-6. Now, in the season's second
half, the schedule would seem to be in their favor. Of their last
74 games, only 23 are against teams with winning records.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra will be back in the lineup,
but while Tom Gordon is expected back in town, the jury remains out
on a return date. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan says the next two
weeks should be a good indicator of whether Gordon will avoid elbow
surgery and reclaim his role as Sox closer.
</P>
<P>
   There are just over two weeks to the July 31 trading deadline,
and general manager Dan Duquette has made it no secret that the Sox
are in the market for a big bat. Last season at this time, Duquette
reacquired Mike Stanley, who hit seven home runs and drove in 32
runs down the stretch. Duquette could be aiming for bigger game
this time.
</P>
<P>
   A look back, and a look ahead:
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Sox go into October with a pitching rotation of
Pedro Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, and Ramon Martinez, with Tom
Gordon back as closer.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Pedro tires, Saberhagen's shoulder acts up, Ramon
remains in rehab, and Flash never makes it back.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Sox pull off maybe the greatest All-Star show ever;
Dan Duquette doesn't have to hide from questions about Mo Vaughn
and Roger Clemens, since neither one were All-Stars, and Jose
Offerman has a great start, then goes into a slump; the other way
around, and critics would have been calling for Duke's head.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Tom Gordon hurts his elbow just as author Stephen
King, who built a best-selling novel around the Sox closer, tells
fans sitting around him, ``I hope I haven't jinxed him.'' King
himself is struck by a van and winds up in the hospital; Bret
Saberhagen cuts his foot on broken glass while hosting a team
party; Sox lose close game to Braves in extra innings when
third-base coach Wendell Kim doesn't see bunt sign from Jimy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Troy O'Leary. Sox left fielder had a brutal second
half and worse postseason (1 for 16) last year, then puts up Mo
Vaughn numbers (.297, 17 home runs, 58 RBIs) in the first half this
season. He's turned himself into a good Fenway Park outfielder,
too. Sox hope that his .205 average this July is related more to
Nomar Garciaparra's absence than another second-half slump.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Mark Guthrie. Lefty reliever has been a workhorse
when healthy, but the results have been dismal, and now he's on the
DL with a frayed Achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Pitching callups from Pawtucket _ John Wasdin, Jin
Ho Cho, Brian Rose, and Juan Pena _ have combined for 15 wins, and
at one point were unbeaten in 14 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Wasdin has lost three in a row since opening 7-0,
Pena is in the Gulf Coast League trying to come back from a bad
shoulder, and Rose and Cho are a combined 0-4 with a 8.86 earned
run average in their last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Nomar Garciaparra hits two grand slams and drives in
10 runs in one game, bats .394 in June, and takes a 17-game hitting
streak into the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Garciaparra misses last nine games after aggravating
a strained left groin, making a total of 11 games missed because of
the groin, and an additional six games with a hamstring strain
sustained in April.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Brian Daubach, Wilton Veras. Rookie Daubach, a punch
line when floated as a possible replacement for Mo Vaughn, has hit
over .300 all season in DH/1B platoon with Mike Stanley and hasn't
gone more than two starts without a hit. Veras, called up from
Double-A Trenton, spends a terrific couple of weeks filling in for
John Valentin, serving notice of becoming the third baseman of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Chad Fonville, Bob Wolcott. Fonville, summoned as
emergency infield help from Pawtucket, mishandled three consecutive
balls at second base in his only start and was gone two days later.
Wolcott pitched four times in a month and faded away as quietly as
he came.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Catcher Jason Varitek, seizing the chance to play
every day when Scott Hatteberg has season-ending elbow surgery,
shows himself to be a masterful handler of pitchers and superb
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Varitek is charged with five passed balls in five
innings with knuckleballer Tim Wakefield on the mound. Hatteberg
hurts his elbow when he slips in loose sand while making a throw
during spring training. Creighton Gubanich hits a grand slam off
Oakland's Jimmy Haynes for his first major-league hit, then is sent
down to the minors shortly thereafter before being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Jeff Frye returns from a year-long absence due to
knee surgery and reclaims his starting job as second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Three weeks into the season, Williams replaces Frye
at second base with Offerman, and Frye winds up having more knee
surgery. Offerman, meanwhile, has the second lowest fielding
percentage among AL second basemen.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Before he's hurt, Frye and Darren Lewis, slugging
flyweights, hit back-to-back home runs in the bottom of the ninth
for a walkoff win against the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Sox right fielders have hit four runs and 32 RBIs,
ranking last in the league in both categories. Rookie Trot Nixon
was hitting .136 after a month, but has been batting close to .300
since. Still, the production is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Mo Vaughn, in his much-heralded return to Fenway
Park with the Anaheim Angels, manages one hit in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Sox run production has dropped to 10th in the league
without Vaughn. Last season, they were third in runs. The Sox do
not have a player who ranks in the top 10 in home runs, RBIs, runs
scored, or hits.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Williams has the Red Sox just four games behind the
Yankees despite having to rotate No. 3 hitters, losing Gordon,
converting Tim Wakefield to closer, Valentin having an off-year,
Garciaparra out for extended time, Offerman nose diving, and other
assorted minidramas.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: On April 22 in Detroit, Williams starts a lineup
which has Lou Merloni at first, Creighton Gubanich catching, Damon
Buford hitting fifth and Donnie Sadler playing left field. Tigers
lefthander Justin Thompson shuts Sox out on one hit through eight
innings; Tigers need just 1 hour 49 minutes to beat the Sox, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Bret Saberhagen has won his last four starts and has
walked one batter or fewer in nine of his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Saberhagen won his first two starts, then didn't win
another game until after the summer solstice.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Rookie Brian Rose is holding lefthanded hitters to a
.144 average, lowest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: After failing to cover first base in a nationally
televised game, Rose is called an ``embarrassment to everyone in
the uniform'' by pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: For past favors, team in Japan gives Duquette a
little-known pitcher, Tomokazu Ohka. He goes 11-0 in his first pro
season here and starts the Futures Game last Sunday in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: Sox invite John Jaha for a visit this winter, but
take one look at his medical records and decide to pass. Jaha hits
19 home runs for the Athletics and is an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Good karma: Mark Portugal, who abruptly quit because he wanted
to spend more time with his family, is persuaded that he can be a
good dad and a working pitcher, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bad karma: The Sox are giving Portugal the worst run support in
the league, 3.82 runs per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Do these things all even out in the end? Red Sox fans know
better. But what better time than the last year of the century to
catch a break?

MEDITATING YOUR WAY TO A BIGGER BUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The strangest things appear on my desk, most recently the Athena
II Breast Beautification Program. Is someone trying to tell me
something?
</P>
<P>
   It's an impressively packaged box of audiotapes billed as ``A
Healthy, Natural Alternative to Breast Enlargement Surgery.'' It's
also cheaper, although not exactly cheap at $125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increase your bust size 1 to 3 inches in 2 months.
Guaranteed,'' a line on the the package promises. From her Chicago
office, Amy Radick, the Athena II marketing representative, said
the system uses relaxation techniques and guided imagery to
increase blood flow to the breasts, thus making them bigger.
</P>
<P>
   I told her that sounds preposterous. She conceded that it might
seem ``far-fetched'' to some, but that studies conducted by the
company proved it works. Radick said 60 women had participated in a
two month-long study and all but two had experienced significant
breast enlargement. The average gain was 1 1/2 inches. One woman
added 3 1/2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes aren't meant to be listened to while driving. This is
not because they might cause the breasts to deploy suddenly,
risking accident, but because total relaxation is required to
meditate upon a larger, firmer bustline. ``Picture the blood flow
increasing to your breasts . . . think about it, imagine it . . .
your breasts are growing bigger, firmer, and more beautiful . . .
relax . . .imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine indeed. What is it with breasts? Stupid question. I know
what it is with breasts. Still, I continue to be amazed at the
number and variety of things people are able to peddle to women
eager to make more of their bustlines. The back pages of women's
magazines are full of ads for breast enlarging creams, vitamin
supplements and exercise devices. The WonderBra, The Miracle Bra
and Curves, The Invisible Breast Enhancer are more popular than
ever. When the Wonderbra fails to work wonders, there's the ``It's
All You!'' bra, which gathers up any extra flesh on the back,
midriff, waist, wherever, and traps it in a formidable brassiere
that looks like it could have played a persuasive role in the
Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Breast enlargement surgery is, of course, the quickest way to
achieve observable results. It's the second most popular plastic
surgery procedure, trailing only liposuction. The surgical bosom
enlargement business is booming, up 302 percent since 1992,
according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   There's always something new on the bigger breast front. An
alternative to surgery still in the testing stages, caused a stir
when it was introduced at the May meeting in Dallas of the American
Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. ``It's a contraption that's
difficult to describe, kind of a vest, with a suction pump,'' said
Elliot Jacobs, a New York plastic surgeon who attended a
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   In tests, women who wore the device for 12 hours a day for 10 to
12 weeks had measurable increases, an average of half a cup size,
documented by MRI's and other tests. ``It's based on a sound
scientific principle,'' Jacobs said, ``If you put constant stress
on living tissue it will stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it stretch enough to undermine the breast implant business?
That's unlikely. However, if it does work, it could provide an
alternative for women who don't want to have surgery, to say
nothing of an alternative to questionable methods of breast
enlargement such as the Athena II program.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to those tapes I remembered how we used to joke in
high school gym class: ``We must, we must, we must increase the
bust.'' Could that be marketable? In the bigger bust business,
anything's possible.

 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The storm that took Susan Atkinson's life veered
southward without warning, packing 100-knot winds that turned an
idyllic lagoon in the Marshall Islands into a roiling deathtrap.
Anchored close to shore, Atkinson and her companion, Gordon
Chaplin, elected to ride out the typhoon aboard their 36-foot
sailboat, a foolishly fatal choice. The boat was ultimately driven
aground and splintered by the pounding surf.
</P>
<P>
   Roped together, Atkinson and Chaplin were thrown into the
churning sea. Their life vests were quickly torn away. ``Hold me
up,'' Atkinson implored. And then, according to Chaplin:
</P>
<P>
   (itals)We were underwater again. I opened my eyes and saw her
clearly, as if she were outlined in black fire. There was a little
smile on her lips and her eyes were half closed. Her long hair
spread out in the water. The top of her head was about a foot under
the surface, and when I put my hand under her chin and tried to
push up, another wave was there.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson's body was never recovered. Chaplin stumbled ashore,
battered yet miraculously alive. That was nearly seven years ago,
on Nov. 19, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin, a freelance journalist and novelist, has now published
a book about the tragedy, ``Dark Wind: A Survivor's Tale of Love
and Loss'' (Atlantic Monthly Press). It chronicles not only the
series of miscalculations that led to Atkinson's drowning but also
describes, in often harrowing detail, the couple's personal
conflicts and the guilt he still harbors about having survived
while Atkinson did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to figure out what really happened _ for both of
us,'' explains Chaplin, in an interview conducted at the Weston
home belonging to his ex-wife and daughter. Atkinson was a
Brookline native and author who began her professional life as a
nurse at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't necessarily see it as an accident,'' Chaplin
continues. ``It could have been. But I needed to show what led up
to it and whether something in our lives, or outside our lives, had
led us to do what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Laboring over his manuscript for five years was therapy for him,
says Chaplin. But he also wanted others to know the full story,
especially Atkinson's two adult daughters, Ashley and Page, even
though Atkinson's family had expressed reservations about seeing it
in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only survivor,'' he says. ``I felt a compulsion to
tell people who cared about Susan what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin dedicates ``Dark Wind'' to Atkinson's daughters and has
arranged for them to receive any profits generated by the book. His
text quotes from letters written by and to members of Atkinson's
family, not all of them flattering to Atkinson's private assessment
of Chaplin. He made the manuscript available to them before
publication, he says, and invited them to suggest changes, which
they acknowledge doing.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it surprises Chaplin to be shown a statement given to the
Globe by Atkinson's daughters. It reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it clear to Gordon Chaplin that we did not want him to
publish this work about our mother, Susan Atkinson. Based on our
knowledge, this book is not an accurate depiction of events as they
occurred. The publication of this work, and its inaccurate
portrayal of our mother, is a continuing unwelcome intrusion into
the lives of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin blinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part about it not being an accurate depiction bothers me
deeply,'' he says slowly. ``I can see where they might have a
different portrait of their mother than mine. Whether it's their
portrait is something I have no control over.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've read'' _ he stares into the distance _ ``they gave
me permission to use the material, they signed release forms. This
is very heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that to an extent he had not realized before,
Atkinson's family holds Chaplin responsible for her death?
</P>
<P>
   ``I faced that question when I got back,'' Chaplin replies.
``Her brother Ned believes to this day that both of us caused this
to happen. I don't agree. That was one reason I went over this
story so thoroughly, to satisfy myself that a pattern of
self-destruction didn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiles wanly. ``I hope they'll grant me that I'm being
accurate to my own picture of Susan,'' he repeats. And then, in
words you don't hear often from touring authors in today's
marketplace, he says, ``If canceling my book tour would make them
more comfortable, tell them I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached later, Ned Atkinson, Susan's brother and a Boston
attorney, says the pain Chaplin has stirred up has more to do with
the fact that the book exists at all than with its specific
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have our memories of Susan,'' says Atkinson. ``And no
matter how you read this book, it somehow diminishes them. Her
death has become an event in Gordon's life. He doesn't accept
responsibility for the person he is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood terms, Chaplin's tale combines elements of
real-life adventure sagas like ``A Perfect Storm'' with the
fictional boy-loses-girl pathos of ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Atkinson first met in the 1960s, when she was married to
Chaplin's former college roommate. Both grew up in privileged
circumstances _ Chaplin along Philadelphia's Main Line, Atkinson in
what Chaplin calls ``one of those New England families in which
insanity is passed down along with the Chippendale and the pewter
and the Harvard education.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, Atkinson's marriage had ended and Chaplin was literally
sailing away from his. The two began a life together that took them
from a remote Mexican village to rural New York State. It also took
them to sea, as Chaplin described in his book ``The Fever Coast
Log,'' about their adventures in Central America. Chaplin had
sailed all his life; in Atkinson he found a partner willing to set
aside fear of physical risk to master the intricacies of open-ocean
sailing.
</P>
<P>
   What made their relationship special, says Chaplin, was the
supposition that without taking risks, life offers few rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan believed you should do something every day that you're
not comfortable doing,'' Chaplin says. ``She wasn't a real physical
person, but she was very courageous. If she was more cautious than
I, it was because I'd been diving and sailing all my life. Her
fears had to do more with what might happen to me.''

KOSOVARS FINDING IT HARD TO RESTORE LEGAL IDENTITIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ It was the ultimate indignity for Kosovo
refugees lucky enough to make it to the border alive, and now it is
shaping up as a bureaucratic nightmare for those who have returned:
the destruction of the ethnic Albanians' personal documents.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the documents have been burned: hundreds of thousands of
identification cards, passports, driver's licenses, automobile
license plates and work records that made up the life history of
the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Those who made it to Morina Pass in Albania, or to Macedonia,
were forced to hand over all their documents to Serbian police,
reducing the Albanians to officially nameless figures without a
history, either as a people or as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't document anything about ourselves now,'' said Ali
Kelmendi, 39. ``It's like you're not a man anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody in town knows that I worked for 20 years, but I can't
prove it,'' said Kelmendi, who ran a small business before the war.
``It was all in my burned house.''
</P>
<P>
   In a war full of anonymous massacres, mass burials and unmarked
graves, even the survivors were deprived of their sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   Marched in long columns, packed into buses and trucks like farm
animals, and forced to leave Kosovo, virtually all of the refugees
all were subjected to the same parting shot. A card table was set
up at border stations, refugees say, and a gun-wielding Serb
policeman forced them to empty their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   This, the final step in the Serbs' ethnic ``cleansing campaign''
to drive Albanians from the province where they constituted 90
percent of the population, eradicated any record that the Albanians
had lived, learned, worked and owned property in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took everything, and they burned everything'' at the
border, said Naser Gjuka, 40. They didn't leave any chance for us
to prove we are Albanians, or even humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of identity papers is personally unsettling for the
returning refugees, and it also presents a massive complication for
a province struggling toward some kind of order and interim
governance.
</P>
<P>
   Without documents, the government-in-the-making cannot determine
who owns what, who worked where and for how long, and who is
eligible to drive or to receive a pension.
</P>
<P>
   International agencies haven't even begun to address the
problem, since they are still concerned with housing and feeding
Kosovars and helping them form an interim civil administration,
said Susan Manuel, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Mission in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees have registration cards issued at refugee camps in
Macedonia and Albania, but the cards show nothing other than the
fact that the individuals fled and returned to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina's City Hall re-opened this week, but it will be weeks
before the provincial administration is at full force, and much
longer before it begins to assess and credential the population.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents have been found, and are under protection
by Kosovo Force (KFOR) soldiers, said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But in many towns, records were completely destroyed, said
Volker Turk, the refugee agency's legal counsel. The only hope may
be convincing bureaucrats in Belgrade to hand over any duplicate
records they have, Turk said.
</P>
<P>
   But agencies here aren't expecting the Serbian government, which
lost total control of Kosovo when the war ended, to cooperate.
``It's a major problem,'' Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   International officials are hoping most of the documentation
problem will be solved informally. In villages and small towns,
most Albanians knew each other, and knew where everyone lived _
enough, officials hope, to prevent major disputes over property.
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic Albanians do not want documents issued from
Belgrade, despite the fact that Kosovo is still part of the
republic of Serbia and the nation of Yugoslavia. Passports, for
example, are typically issued by federal governments _ in this
case, the one centered in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovar Albanians, who have long hoped for the right to
travel freely and safely, say they would rather stay forever
tethered to Kosovo than to travel abroad on Yugoslav documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to get a Belgrade passport. Belgrade is dead for
me,'' said Shefkinazo Muhaxniri, 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anything from those who did this to me,'' said
Gjuka, gesturing toward his burned and looted house in Pec. ``I
don't want their documents now.''

ON WEST BANK, TWO VILLAGES NERVOUSLY AWAIT PEACE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALHOUL, West Bank _ This Palestinian farming town is tired of
waiting for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Halhoul is supposed to be the next West Bank town from which
Israeli troops withdraw and Palestinian forces take control under
the peace process. But for two years hopes for independence have
been on hold in this community north of Hebron, and its 26,000
people have descended into despair over a crippled economy.
</P>
<P>
   Just across a rocky valley, the neighboring Israeli settlement
of Karmei Tzur has also waited for the next phase of the peace
process and worried about its future.
</P>
<P>
   The laboriously negotiated Wye River accord calls for Israeli
troops to withdraw from land around the 450 religious nationalists
who've staked a claim in houses and trailers ringed with barbed
wire. When the troop pull-out happens, they say, they'll be left
vulnerable to attacks by Palestinian militants. They fear attempts
to remove them from land they believe God granted them.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of this valley know that when Israel's new prime
minister, Ehud Barak, meets President Clinton in Washington
Thursday the futures of their communities and the fate of the
Middle East peace process hang in the balance. How Barak will weigh
the disillusionment of the Palestinians against the fiery ideology
of the Israeli settlers is anyone's guess. But what's certain is
that he will have to find a solution, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of meetings Barak will lay out his strategic vision,
and is expected to urge the United States to play a less pronounced
role as a peace broker. He is also intent on convincing Clinton
that some time is needed to implement the Wye River agreement.
Clinton worked tirelesly to get both sides to sign Wye and is said
to be anxious to break the long deadlock that occurred under
Barak's predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs time, analysts say, in part because of the domestic
political pressure that will come to bear on him from the religious
right and settlers as his new coalition moves toward
implementation. The question is whether the peace process can
survive another delay.
</P>
<P>
   Halhoul's mayor, Mohammed Milhem, insists it can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see that peace means change,'' said Milhem. ``We
need to see that peace is real, and not an illusion. We've been
waiting a long time. Too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Halhoul has been uniquely frustrated by the stalled peace
process. For two years, it has been on the verge of what
Palestinians call ``liberation'' from the Israeli military control
of the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 Six Day War.
And for two years, it has waited.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, after the signing of the Wye agreemnt, Halhoul
unfurled banners in anticipation of troop withdrawals and a visit
by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. He never came. The official
transfer of the land from shared Israeli-Palestinian control to
full Palestinian control never happened. The banners have been
taken down.
</P>
<P>
   On the terraced hillsides of this fertile valley, peach trees
are weighted down with their harvest and grape vines form canopies
over the brown soil that clings to the craggy slopes.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers can't get their produce to market since Israel
restricts travel on the roads and requires expensive permits and
tariffs for any exports. Laborers who illegally sneak into Israel
to scratch out a living on low-paying jobs want official work
permits. Water wells are contaminated and bone dry.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Milhem, 70, who was born and raised in Halhoul, says that
his community has grown more than just weary of the peace process.
He believes that even when the pull back of Israeli troops happen,
it won't change much in Halhoul.
</P>
<P>
   What he says is most important is the opening of the so-called
``safe passage'' roads which will connect West Bank towns like
Halhoul to the pockets of Palestinian controlled areas throughout
the West Bank and especially in Gaza. The farmers need the broader
markets for export. They also care more about beginning
construction of a commercial port in Gaza, which will open the
market further for international exports. Both of these plans _
safe passage and construction of the port _ were agreed upon under
Wye.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Heinehan, 39, a Palestinian business man, asks, ``How long
can you wait? The sad truth is that we were economically better off
before the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   From Halhul, heading north on the wide, paved ``bypass road''
that leads to the Karmei Tzur, the growth of the settlement is
visible. Five trailers placed on a hillside sit next to the first
of 40 new foundations being poured. The work is being done hastily
because ``facts on the ground,'' as the settlements are often
called, matter. Settlement leaders fear in the next redeployment
their community will not only be imperiled but possibly evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Karmei Tzur's council, Esti Uliel, said, ``There is
a real possibility we will be left surrounded by Palestinians. . .
. The Palestinian Authority does not want peace. . . . The Wye
agreement is wrong, Oslo is wrong. We can only hope that Israel
will wake up to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has been vague about the further redeployment from roughly
13 percent of West Bank land called for under Wye. Some analysts
believe at least one or two settlements that dot the West Bank
would have to be removed. Palestinians say the settlements are
illegal and that their expansion is a violation of the peace
process. The settlers remain entrenched and defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never leave,'' says Shlomo Neeman, who came nine years
ago as a new immigrant from Russia. ``We believe in the
righteousness of our path.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep mistrust dwells in the valley between the settlers and
Palestinians. But there is an important piece of the history of the
land that binds Palestinian Muslims and Christians with their
Jewish neighbors. All three faiths embrace the prophet Jonah who,
the bible claims, was buried in Halhoul. Tradition holds that
Jonah's tomb is in the central mosque, where a stone shrine
shrouded in black attracts visitors of all three faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abu Yussef, 91, who has delivered the call to prayer at
the mosque for 50 years, recounted the biblical passages referring
to Jonah being swallowed by the whale and cast out only after he
expressed faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestine is like Jonah,'' he said. ``It has been swallowed by
the Ottoman empire, the British mandate, Jordanian rule, and the
Israeli army. Now it is about to be cast out to live under its own
government. But it is not the peace process that achieved that, it
is God's promise.''

O'MEARA FORECASTS SOME ROUGH GOING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ There will always be those major
championship flashbacks for Mark O'Meara. There he was, rolling in
a remarkable putt on the 18th green of the Masters in 1998 to win a
championship he coveted. There he was, sitting on a slope at the
British Open at Royal Birkdale watching Brian Watts make a
remarkable sand shot to set up a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Meara won that four-hole playoff, it made him the oldest
player (41) to win two majors in the same year. They were also his
first two majors, and he hasn't won a tournament since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream come true,'' said O'Meara Wednesday, on the eve
of the 128th British Open at the storied links of Carnoustie Golf
Course in the Angus district on the North Sea. ``The last year has
been a lot of fun. It was disappointing to have to bring the old
Claret Jug back to the R&AMP;S secretary's office earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to come out and have a great week and play
well. The golf course is very tough and very demanding. Of the 14
Opens I've played in, this is by far the toughest set-up I've ever
seen. Not only is the rough extremely deep and very difficult to
play out of, but the golf course is very narrow, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You throw the wind on top of that with the length (7,361
yards) that this golf course is, it's going to be a heck of a
contest to keep the ball somewhere in either the short grass or the
semi-rough, and try to make pars. On some holes bogey is going to
be a good score because it is a long golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a 1-iron on the ninth (a 474-yard hole) and hit a 3-wood
into the green. You're going to see a lot of guys sacrificing
distance for short grass and accuracy, because even though some of
the longer hitters will take out the driver you're going to see
some hitting 1-irons, keeping the ball low and just trying to chase
it down the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been the best of years for O'Meara, who has only one
top-10 finish _ third at The Memorial. ``I think a lot of it has to
do with my confidence,'' said O'Meara. ``I could be playing a
little better. I really haven't putted as well this year. It's a
combination of all those things together. Golf is a fickle game.
That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Royal Birkdale reared its nasty head in high winds,
O'Meara was up to the challenge. ``The fairways were a little
wider,'' he said, ``and I don't think the rough was quite as deep
as this. But even-par won the championship. It just seems this
course is narrower as any I've ever seen in an Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think here the rough has taken some of the bunkers out
of play. Players are not going to hit driver or 3-wood. They're
going to sacrifice once again the distance to put the ball on the
fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Some feel his success in 1998 may have taken a toll, but O'Meara
disagrees. ``I had more opportunities out there that presented
themselves of what I did last year,'' he said. ``I've tried to
capitalize on some of them. I've played a lot around the world
since last year. I've enjoyed that. You can say maybe it's taken a
toll. I don't think it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times where you're not playing as well or your
expectations are higher than what you are seeing in your
performance, and then it can be a little frustrating. I took a
little time off after the US Open, and I might take time off after
this championship.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for this championship, O'Meara knows it will be difficult
to turn his year around at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to get out and get a good solid round under my
belt,'' he said. ``I feel I'm starting to putt a little bit better,
and that's a good confidence boost. This is going to be somewhat
like the US Open. You're going to miss a lot of greens out there,
so your short game will have to be good and you're going to have to
make some putts.''
</P>
<P>
   The severeness of Carnoustie, where Tom Watson won the last Open
here in 1975, was evident in Wednesday's final practice round in
brisk, windy conditions. ``It's brutal,'' said Billy Andrade of
Bristol, R.I., after his third practice round. ``It's a brutal
test. The man who wins on Sunday here, in my eyes, will be the
greatest golfer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to test every part of your game. You're going to
have to have the patience. Who knows what's going to win? If it's
windy and it gets wet, I'd say a 295 or 300 would win this
tournament. You've got to keep the ball in the fairway. It's hard
to hit these fairways with no wind, let alone with wind. It's by
far the severest of all the Opens I've played in, US or British. I
love it. That's why I'm here. I think if you just hang in there
this week you've got a chance of winning.''

   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Conseulo Garcia didn't like to bother her
husband at work. After all, they shared the same place of
employment _ she in the clubhouse shop, he as head professional at
the Mediterraneo Golf Club in the seaside town of Bottriol, Spain.
She knew that the members' demands on Victor were incessant, and
right now he was at his busiest, organizing a club tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But she was afraid this matter couldn't wait any longer.
``Victor,'' she told him on the 10th hole, ``I'm having
contractions.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the tournament. Husband and wife rushed to the
hospital, where they became mother and father to a second son Jan.
9, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn, Sergio, had no say in the matter, but he certainly
wouldn't have been pleased that his parents dragged him away from
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The boundaries of his existence always have been from tee to
green, and now, suddenly, his horizons are planetary. Suddenly, but
hardly surprisingly. For while he seems to be blazing across the
pro golf scene like a comet, he has actually followed a
meticulously plotted course to the constellation. Still, his
emergence is unimaginable to the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   He is all of 19 years old, has more use for Clearasil than a
shaver, hasn't qualified for a driver's license, lives at home, and
has a year of high school to go. Yet he already has achieved the
ultimate in recognition _ single-name status _ on every course he
graces. Tiger. Greg. Jack. Arnold. Seve. And now Sergio.
</P>
<P>
   Which was why Wednesday's announcement on the eve of the British
Open _ trumpeted as a blockbuster by his manager, Jose Marquina _
was as extraneous as it was extraordinary: ``If you don't mind, I'd
like you to call me `Sergio' in the media if that is possible,
because I feel much better than (being called) `Garcia' . . . I've
always liked people to call me `Sergio' because it seems more
familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's an indication of the innocence lurking beneath
the virtuoso talent. His request is a bit like someone asking that
today be called Thursday. Throughout his week of preparation at
Carnoustie Golf Club _ capped by a 2-under-par 69 with no bogeys on
this 7,361-yard behemoth Tuesday _ one word from the galleries has
virtually punctured his eardrums: ``Sergio! Sergio!'' The refrain
has been as constant as it has been universal _ from small
children, teens barely his age, young adults, and senior citizens.
He has become a word in the golf dictionary in near-record time.
</P>
<P>
   The British Open will be his eighth pro tournament, although it
also will mark the third time he has teed off in this major
championship. Having turned pro in April a week after finishing as
the low amateur in the Masters, he got so rattled in his second
event for pay, the Byron Nelson Classic in Dallas, that he
struggled to an opening-round 62 and managed only a third-place
finish. It took him six tournaments to register his first pro win _
in the European Tour's Irish Open at Dublin two weeks ago. So taken
aback was he by that success that in his very next round, at the
Loch Lomond Open outside Glasgow last week, he ballooned to a 62.
And he threatened to make it two wins in a row before bogeying two
of the last three holes and winding up second to Colin Montgomerie.
That lifted him to seventh place in the European Ryder Cup
standings, and he's a shoo-in to be in Brookline, Mass., as part of
the team facing the United States at The Country Club Sept. 26-28.
</P>
<P>
   And the most amazing thing is that none of this is amazing.
Peripheral observers have labeled him the next Tiger and the next
Seve, but they're off the mark. The golf literati know him as the
original Sergio _ and they have for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has everything to be a great champion,'' says Seve
Ballesteros, Garcia's homeland idol and unofficial mentor for
several years. ``His game is so strong. I saw it from the beginning
that he was a very special talent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, the first time you put eyes on him,
you could see that there was something special about him,'' says
Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, the other member of the
Spanish pantheon. ``Maybe the most impressive thing was the mental
attitude. I think that's his strongest part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious he was ready to come out,'' says US Open winner
Payne Stewart. ``He's just beaming with personality. He's friendly.
He's fun. He's going to be around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they're banking on Garcia to galvanize European golf the
way Woods did the US PGA Tour two years ago. The only factor that
might prevent that is that Garcia belongs to the world _ he'll be
playing in the US and Japan as well as on the Continent. ``This
kid's gonna take me all over the place,'' says his caddie, Jerry
Higginbotham, who has carried the bags of Ben Crenshaw in the '70s,
David Graham in the '80s, and Mark O'Meara in the '90s, and expects
Garcia to be his millennial meal ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods, now a sage at 23, has no doubt about his impact: ``I
think what he has done is show the world how talented he really
is.'' And Tiger should know.
</P>
<P>
   Where matters of golf are concerned, Garcia _ uh, sorry, Sergio
_ seems to take it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I turned pro, I want to get my card and then I said in a
couple of interviews that I wanted to win one tournament or more
before the year end,'' he says. ``I've already won one and now I
try to go for some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing he does can surpass his own expectations. When he turned
pro, he announced that he would shave his head to signal his first
victory. He persuaded his father and Marquina to make a similar
promise. All now sport the skinhead look. Sergio did the honors.
He'd been carrying the razor in his luggage since his pro debut.
</P>
<P>
   But then, what other logical conclusion could there be for a kid
who has been programmed for success, who was placed in a golf test
tube before adolescence?

FENWAY SHOWED THE CLASS OF BASEBALL'S GRANDE DAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was as if grandma had invited the baseball world
over to her house for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   An All-Star Game at Fenway? With all that old funky furniture?
One bathroom for 33,000 people? The old icebox instead of a modern
fridge with the gargantuan freezer? All those embarrassing
knickknacks?
</P>
<P>
   And _ get this _ no food court!
</P>
<P>
   I mean, grandma's sweet and we love her to death, but is she
really up for it?
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's over, and Fenway Park, the Red Sox, and the city
of Boston put on a phenomenally successful All-Star Game, the
verdict is in: Grandma's got a few good years left. You can put
that number for assisted living back in the desk drawer for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to the idea. Fenway is going, and the 1999 Game was
indeed the final such occurrence in this park (figure the 2009 or
2010 game for Dot.Com Field, or whatever they'll be forced to name
the new one when fiscal practicality finally wins out over
romanticism). What we saw Monday and Tuesday night's was the
beginning of the countdown. That's why Larry Walker was smart to
grab that clump of right-field grass he was proudly brandishing to
the media after the game. So what if he is now permanently off Joe
Mooney's Christmas card list? He knows he'll never be back here
again (unless The Duke has something clever up his sleeve).
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Mooney, the venerable groundskeeper discovered that
his reputation had well preceded him. ``Someone from Major League
Baseball said to me, `Oh, we've heard all about you!' '' he
cackled.
</P>
<P>
   Mooney is part of the Fenway aura, every bit as much as the
ladder, the door, the red seat, or, God bless her, ageless Helen
Robinson, who Wednesday morning was on the job at the Fenway
switchboard, as she has been since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The Fenway ghosts had better seats than even the swells in the
reprehensible 600 Club for the goings-on. You think they're not
chuckling over the fact that, after 53 years and 27 innings of
play, the National League has yet to hit a baseball over any Fenway
fence, never mind The Wall?
</P>
<P>
   Start feeling sorry for the Atlanta Braves. They've got the 2000
All-Star Game. But that's all they've got. It turns out that the
game _ the last seven innings, anyway _ was by far the least
appetizing tidbit on the Fenway/Boston All-Star platter.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will have a Home Run Derby, but it's not going to have
the HOME RUN DERBY we had Monday night. Those Georgians can just
fuhgeddabouttit. Mark McGwire might hit 20 baseballs clear into
South Carolina next year and it won't have the impact those 10 he
knocked over the hallowed 37-foot-high left-field wall and the
23-foot screen perched atop it had in the first round of Monday
night's contest. (He hit two more into the screen and one to
center, giving him a record 13 for the round.) In years to come, no
one will recall that Junior Griffey actually won the contest, not
even Junior. But everyone who was there will take to his or her
grave the memory of McGwire sending baseballs to MIT, the Bunker
Hill Monument, Bell Circle, Bangor, Newfoundland, and Neptune, or
wherever those baseballs landed after they soared over the wall,
over the screen, and off into the balmy July night.
</P>
<P>
   And who's kidding whom? 488 feet? If three or four of those
babies weren't 520-footers, or more, then Ted Williams never hit
.300.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about what happened before the game Tuesday
night is that no one was remotely prepared for it. All the media
knew was that various members of the Top 100 Players of the Century
list would be introduced. But this is, after all, Boston, the only
city with a 128-year continuous run of major league baseball. The
sport is genetically implanted here, and its traditions are
thoroughly respected. These great players would be appreciated to
some degree anywhere, but in a town that truly understands and
loves how hard it is to play this game well, the greats of the past
are revered, all the more so if they have had a hand in frustrating
these very fans and their elders. The only place Bob Gibson and Lou
Brock would be received so well outside of St. Louis, for example,
is Boston. These men stood between the 1967 Red Sox and the
ultimate fulfillment of the Impossible Dream, and everyone who
follows baseball in Boston knows it.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the Kevin Costner introduction of the 31 Top 100
representatives who were on hand took on a life of its own. Seeing
these diamond luminaries assembled on the infield was a magical
moment.
</P>
<P>
   And then out from center field came that golf cart carrying
Teddy Ballgame himself.
</P>
<P>
   He waved his cap _ the wrong cap, thanks to his shameless
huckster son, John Henry _ and that was nice enough. Longtime Sox
employee Al Forester pulled the cart in front of the pitcher's
mound, and then the script fell apart. The great stars of the past
and the great stars of the present slowly encircled the Greatest
Living Ballplayer in a deep show of love and respect, and it was
hanky time.
</P>
<P>
   The great Theatre of the Absurd moment came when PA announcer Ed
Brickley was forced to request that the old stars and the new stars
leave the field so that the game could begin. It was as if they
were so much media scum, the difference being that the media must
slink off the field to the jeers of the fans when they are asked to
leave. Stan Musial, Willie Mays, Sammy Sosa, and Cal Ripken don't.
They can do what they damn well please, and who cares if the games
starts a few minutes late?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at that moment, who cared if they ever played a game?
They could have sent the 34,187 home without drawing a whimper from
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there was one more business matter to conduct. Pedro
Martinez, grandma's official host pitcher, took the mound and did
unto the great National League stars as he has been doing unto the
lesser folk he sees in regular-season play. Only Matt Williams put
a bat on the ball, and that was a feeble grounder somehow mangled
by normally reliable Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Six batters, five strikeouts. Winning pitcher. MVP. All that was
following the script.
</P>
<P>
   In a strict financial sense, this was just another convention.
Hah. We know better. All the doctors, lawyers, accountants, and
software salesmen in the world don't provide one-10th the glamour
and life that these ballplayers, old and new, brought to our
ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   You can say that about all these All-Star Games, but there was
something very special about this one. Grandma Wrigley and Grandma
Fenway, baseball's first cousins, are the only ballparks that can
give us what we had at this All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Atlanta. Good luck, y'all.

BOOK EDITOR MISSING AFTER UNITY CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Had things gone as planned, Joe Wood would have packed
his bags after a journalism conference last week in Seattle, and
flown home to New York Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He would have shown up for work this week at a Manhattan
publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   He would be headed on another cross-country trip to visit
friends and meet with some of his Los Angeles-based clients.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has heard from Wood, the 34-year-old, Yale-educated
book editor, since last Thursday. His car was found Wednesday night
at a Longmire parking lot, on the south side of Mount Rainier
National Park. A park-entrance receipt in the rental car showed he
arrived at Mount Rainier a little after noon on Thursday. Rangers
plan to search the area this morning with bloodhounds.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives Wednesday enlisted the help of a Seattle
detective agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know what's happened to him,'' said Wood's longtime
friend, Somini Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   Sengupta, a New York Times reporter, was in town last week with
Wood to attend UNITY '99, a conference of minority journalists. She
last saw him Wednesday evening at the opening ceremonies for the
convention in downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   When she awoke Thursday, she opened her laptop computer to check
her e-mail. She found a missive from Wood saying he planned an
afternoon hiking trip on Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I heard from him on Thursday, no one has,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, a former editor at the Village Voice newspaper who has
edited non-fiction books at the New Press since 1996, never checked
out of his Seattle hotel or returned his rental car. His luggage
remains stowed in an office at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Sengupta, Wood's parents and his employers want to know what
happened to Wood. This week, they began flooding the offices of
searchers on Mount Rainier and deluging the voice mailbox of
Seattle missing-persons detective Ray Holm.
</P>
<P>
   But there were few answers as the official investigation bounced
from police jurisdictions on both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sengupta, who began calling Seattle police Tuesday to report
Wood missing, learned Wednesday morning that she first needed to
file a missing-person's report in Brooklyn, where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the New York Police Department's 77th Precinct passed on
the report to the Seattle detective Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But while a private eye began searching for Wood on the snowy
foothills where Wood planned to hike and bird-watch last Thursday,
an official search remained on hold until Wednesday when his car
was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll begin a full search first thing in the morning,'' said
Maria Gillett, spokeswoman for Mount Rainier National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's white Mercury Marquis rental, with Oregon license plates
WVN-303, was found in the Longmire parking lot late Wednesday. But
there was no sign of Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Kong, a Boston Globe reporter who also attended UNITY,
had also planned to hike Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   But after a fellow reporter chided her about hiking alone on the
mountain just weeks after a Georgia doctor was lost while
snowboarding, Kong waited until she could hike with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then, there was a lot of snow at the parking-lot level at
the Sunrise visitors center,'' Kong recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Friends in New York are anxious. An avid bird-watcher who
eschews cell phones and beepers, Wood usually carries a purple
knapsack and dons a New York Yankees baseball cap while hiking.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Johansen, office manager at the publishing house, said

SELFLESS MARTIN GIVES ALL FOR THE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Chances are you've never heard of Jake
Haunty. You probably weren't at Northwestern a decade ago when he
etched his name into off-campus intramural basketball tournament
lore by sinking a 15-foot turnaround jump shot at the buzzer to
lead Delta Tau Delta to the championship. It's safe to say that
beyond the participants and their fraternity brothers, few people
couldn't care less about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Todd Martin makes you wish you were there. He was
there, a 6-foot-6-inch freshman seated on the Delta Tau Delta bench
with tennis skills worthy of leading Northwestern to its first Big
Ten title in 30 years but sorely lacking in basketball prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was merely pleased to have gotten a good look at the
winning shot. He was among those who soaked up the comraderie
during the team's run and stormed the court in celebration
following the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Martin left Northwestern in 1990 to pursue a career in tennis.
He has filled a resume that includes eight singles titles, four
doubles titles, a current No. 10 ranking in the world, $5,983,016
in prize money, an appearance in the 1994 Australian Open finals
and membership on every Davis Cup team since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still considers that moment on the Delta Tau Delta bench
among his greatest achievements in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made the finals of the Australian Open, I was just one
person when I was out there, and I celebrated by myself,'' said
Martin, the ultimate team player and the primary reason why the US
men's Davis Cup team enters Friday's quarterfinal tie with
Australia with no controversy surrounding who will play singles.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras joined the team in June, two months after the US
beat England, 3-2, in the first round. Many would assume that
Sampras, the third-ranked player in the world, would play singles
in the tie against Australia, but those spots are occupied by
Martin and Jim Courier, the latter of whom won two grueling matches
in England.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin has offered to give up his singles spot so Sampras
could play there. Team captain Tom Gullikson reiterated Wednesday
that Sampras has said he wants only to play doubles and, barring
injury, will do so. Still, Martin's willingness to give up his spot
for the sake of the team has all but smoothed over what could have
been a hot media topic this week.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Martin's gesture surprises no one. The player who
won the ATP Tour sportsman award in 1993 and 1994 is widely known
as one of the most amicable players in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus this week is to win as a team. winning as an
individual and being on the court as an individual is secondary,''
said Martin. In a sport in which one often celebrates victory and
endures setbacks alone, he said his most enjoyable triumphs have
been in the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Australian Open, I went into the locker room and I
had a coach who said, `Good job,' and then I lost a day or two
later,'' he said. ``It was a little anticlimatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-day, best-of-five tie features singles A and B
matches. Saturday features doubles at 1 p.m., and Sunday includes
singles C and D.
</P>
<P>
   Team lineups and order of play for the tie do not need to be
determined until one hour before the Davis Cup draw, which is at
noon Thursday on the Longwood grass courts. Sampras's name would
have to be in the draw pool to be selected for singles.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not, the only way he would be able to play singles is
if the US would clinch the tie by Saturday (Sunday's matches would
be played regardless) or if Courier or Martin would suffer from a
medical condition serious enough to allow Sampras to play.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Gullikson runs counter to what he has maintained since
Sampras joined the team, there won't be any surprises at the draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't changed,'' he said Wednesday after the second
of two US practices. ``I talked to Pete and we had a team meeting a
couple of nights ago, and Pete feels strongly that Jim and Todd
should play singles. Unless something happens injury-wise, he
doesn't anticipate playing singles.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 29, joined the Davis Cup team in Gullickson's first year
as captain. Gullikson said the team has benefitted from his
team-first attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd has really matured in one of our best Davis Cup
players,'' said Gullikson. ``He is extremely loyal to the program
and to the team and the country. He's been there virtually every
time for us when he's been asked to play singles or doubles or
both. He is really the ultimate team player. He brings a lot of
good character quality to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has an 11-4 career singles record at Davis Cup (14-9
overall). He is coming off a 1-1 singles mark in England; he gave
the Americans a 2-0 lead after beating Greg Rusedski, 6-4, 6-4,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he knows that defending Wimbledon champ Sampras is playing
at a level worthy of his No. 3 ranking in the world in singles. As
long as he can take the court in victory when the matches are over,
Martin doesn't matter watching the singles from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Gully to feel like he could put the best team out on
the court and not feel bad about it,'' said Martin. ``I think Pete
has swallowed enough pride by sayng he would just play doubles and
wants to be a part of it. That's more than enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there I think we should put the ball in the captains'
hands, and I think we should all mature about it and whoever he
thinks should play should play and we should accept our roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin playing singles doesn't necessarily mean advantage
Australia, which is expected to field Patrick Rafter (No. 2 in the
world) and 18-year-old sensation Lleyton Hewitt. A Martin-Rafter
meeting would mark a repeat of this year's Wimbledon quarterfinals,
which Rafter won, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 7-6. He beat Rafter in the third
round of the Paris Indoor last year, 5-7, 7-6, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Both matches came during Martin's comeback after missing seven
months due to shin and elbow injuries suffered in 1997. He sat out
of this year's French Open due to a right shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a week off and this is the second time I've hit since
Wimbledon,'' said Martin, ``and I feel like things are in pretty
good shape. I'm going to constantly work on my strengths this week
to allow things to keep from getting broken down.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin credited teammate Jim Courier's victory over Tim Henman,
a four-hour, five-set thriller, as giving him momentum to beat
Rusedski in straight sets during the tie against England in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Jim not beaten Tim, I think I would have assumed Rusedski
to come out on the court more prepared to play against me,'' he
said, ``and I might not have been able to play as well as I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get out to a 2-0 lead, although we lost the lead,
it's nice to have three opportinities to clinch the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said he was pleased with Wednesday's workout, which
ended with Courier and Martin playing an extensive singles match.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get a little rhythm going and getting our
game faces on,'' he said. ``(Wednesday) is when you start thinking
about the match a little bit more. Typically the guys have worked
hard on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday is usually the last day of
hard work. (Thursday) after the draw most of the guys just hit once
and lighten up on their work.''

RATINGS WERE A FALLING STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Ratings, schmatings.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are in and the millenium's last All-Star Game
demonstrated pretty clearly that freedom of choice has choked the
mass appeal of the former national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Something about this new generation. How in the world does
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' even compare to coverage of the
greatest assemblage of living baseball players on the planet?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the country hasn't gone completely mad. There
are some pockets of baseball fans still standing. A little wobbly,
but holding their own.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland led the nation with a 27.8 rating and 45 share. It's
no wonder. The All-Star Indians accounted for every American League
run to beat the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was second with a staggering 25.1 and 43 share. It
smashed ``Buffy'' 's 6.4 rating and offered further proof that
Boston is a baseball town. Not even Fox analyst Bob Brenly's quips
could deter the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to mention the Red Sox' inability to win a
championship since 1918. That would be Brenly. He was talking about
the autumn-like weather Tuesday night when he took a shot at the
team. ``Boston fans are not used to seeing games played in the
fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brenly didn't stop there. He told the national audience that
Pedro Martinez is known to ``fade'' at the end of the season and
that there was ``no way'' he would finish the season with 30
victories. Brenly failed to mention that Martinez, all praises be
due, might have only 14 or 15 more starts during the second half of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   That's all right. Bostonians are an enduring lot, and baseball
just wouldn't be baseball without a little poke every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and Boston understand the pain. So does St. Louis,
which came in third with a 19.8 rating and 34 share.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are all good, but nationally the game took another
hit. The ratings dropped 9 percent from last year to a 12, with a
22 share. It was the second-lowest rating for the game in the last
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The audience peaked from 9:30-10 p.m. EDT with a 14.1 rating and
stayed above 12.0 until 11 p.m. Once most of the starters were
replaced, the rating dropped to a 9.9 from 11-11:30 p.m., and a 7.7
from 11:30-midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials weren't overjoyed by the numbers, but pitching
duels are for the purists, not the casual fan seeking games filled
with spectacular highlights. And besides, the real star was the
ballpark. Not one of the All-Stars was able to even hit The Wall,
much less knock one over it. No video could ever replace actually
being at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy that we were able to provide fans with one of the
most memorable moments in sports history,'' Fox spokesman Dan Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   No number could ever do justice to the sight of Ted Williams
surrounded by the past and present All-Stars. Willie Mays and Ken
Griffey. Mark McGwire and Stan Musial. Hank Aaron and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing close was the coverage by Fox. By all accounts,
it matched the joy of the night, able to convey the raw emotion of
Williams shedding tears as he threw out the first pitch and the
sheer amazement of Martinez striking out four straight batters,
five in all.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras and microphones caught everything, including the
tacky cap Williams's son gave him to wear promoting his website.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's coverage withstood competition from its cable rival, ESPN.
The self-proclaimed sports leader re-aired the Women's World Cup
championship at 8 p.m., buying advertisements in USA Today touting
the telecast. But ESPN earned slightly lower ratings than what its
programming received last year directly against the All-Star Game.
That programming included shows on cheerleading, bloopers, and
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show the game again while it was still fresh,''
ESPN spokesman Dave Nagle said. ``It made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. What a cowinkydink, considering the legal spat between
ESPN and Major League Baseball over ESPN giving NFL games more
respect than baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is not alone. The country isn't giving the sport that much
respect either.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game was a night of childlike wonderment, a night
of the way things used to be, a night of nostalgia, not a night of
cheap promotion or silly competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at them all, smiling like Little Leaguers,'' Fox
announcer Joe Buck said as the cameras panned the crowded infield
of All-Stars surrounding Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, Little Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   And to think Fox, the zany network oft-criticized for its blue
hockey streaks, was able to make us all remember being kids in the
summer.

SHOWING BY MARTINEZ STRIKES HOME 
</HEADLINE>

Everybody goes home and I have to go back to work.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   _ Pedro Martinez &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Leave it to the Red Sox ace to put everything into its
proper perspective. The excitement of Tuesday night's 70th All-Star
Game will last only until his next start, which comes Sunday. But
the magic of yet another grand moment in Fenway Park history will
stay with him forever.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez will no doubt be telling his grandchildren of the night
he pitched two scoreless innings during a 4-1 victory by the
American League. The fact that he struck out the game's first four
batters, a record, and five of the six he faced will be mentioned
prominently. It earned him the Most Valuable Player award, which
only two other Red Sox _ Carl Yastrzemski (1970) and Roger Clemens
(1986) _ had previously won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really means a lot,'' said Martinez shortly after being
named the MVP. ``Not only to myself as an individual, but also for
baseball and for the fans, my people, the hometown, everybody. I
think this one had a little more taste than the previous ones I've
been in. I just glad that it went to my side. I thank God for the
things that have come to me. Especially since I didn't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last All-Star Game of the 20th century and almost
certainly the last at Fenway Park, Martinez came through as
advertised against a National League lineup that included two of
the game's top power hitters, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Most of
the sellout crowd of 34,187 were Red Sox fans, and they cheered
every strike by Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez became the second player ever to win an MVP award in
his home park, and the first pitcher to win at home since Jimmy Key
prevailed in relief at Toronto's Skydome in 1991. The last starter
to win at home was Steve Rogers of Montreal in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the sixth time that a pitcher born outside the
United States has gotten the win. The others were Juan Marichal
(Dominican Republic) in 1962 and 1964, Charlie Lea (France) in
1984, Dennis Martinez (Nicaragua) in 1991, and Bartolo Colon
(Dominican Republic) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez left the game, he was followed by David Cone,
Mike Mussina, Jose Rosado, Jeff Zimmerman, and Roberto Hernandez.
Cone allowed the only National League run in the third inning,
cutting the AL lead to 2-1. But the NL could get no closer. The
Americans did all their scoring in two innings, getting pairs of
runs in the first and fourth. For the first time since 1990,
neither team hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   It all came together on a perfect night for baseball. A year
ago, when the Red Sox agreed to replace Milwaukee as All-Star Game
host, skeptics were everywhere. The park, first opened in 1912, had
not hosted since 1961. Given its dimensions, the 13-8 rout by the
AL at Coors Field in Denver last year looked to be a low-scoring
game in comparison. There was nothing to suggest things would turn
out like this.
</P>
<P>
   But they did, thanks to Martinez, who had pitched twice
previously in All-Star competition in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was in place by game time Tuesday night. FanFest,
which drew 105,363 patrons to the Hynes Convention Center over five
days, had ended at 5 p.m. The pregame ceremonies at Fenway included
the introduction of 32 legends nominated for the All-Century team.
Finally, there was the return of Red Sox legend Ted Williams to
Fenway to throw out the first ball.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Pedro. With his 15-3 record and assortment of pitches,
how could he fail?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody gets a chance like this,'' said Martinez. ``And
here in Boston, no one appreciates it better than these fans. They
really understand what it's all about. They really understand their
baseball and their tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not only the last (All-Star Game) of the century but
also the last one with all those players being there. I never
dreamed in my lifetime in seeing all of them together. I don't
think anybody else is going to do it. It's probably bigger than
just participating.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Martinez showed a national audience that he is
baseball's best pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pumped up and sky high,'' said AL manager Joe Torre.
``I'm glad he's on my side. When you have a guy like like Pedro,
it's like hitting in a darkroom. With his arm speed, it doesn't
matter if he's throwing his fastball or changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight victory by an American League team
since a 6-0 loss in Philadelphia in 1996. Torre also managed the AL
team that posted a 3-1 victory in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a chance to pick nine or 10 pitchers from all
over the league, there is a good chance you will wind up with
quality,'' said Torre. ``We had quality tonight. I think you
appreciate a lot of things that went on here. It showed a lot of
class. It's going to mean a lot for me to say I was on the field
for the last All-Star Game of the century.''

AT CARNOUSTIE IN '53, HOGAN MADE A MAJOR STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a moment of great triumph, and Ben Hogan, in the
aftermath of his fourth US Open championship, had reason to smile.
</P>
<P>
   Until . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The British Open is the only major title you've never won.
Isn't that so?'' asked a reporter from the back of the crowd. The
locker room at Oakmont Country Club grew silent. Hogan's smile
turned into an icy stare. No one dared say a thing. Finally, Hogan
spoke in a voice that both informed and reprimanded: ``It's the
only one I never tried for.''
</P>
<P>
   After allowing that to sink in, Hogan, favored greatly by the
American golf writers of the day, again smiled and went on with the
locker room celebration. He had just concluded a six-shot win in
the national championship, which, on top of his five-shot triumph
at the Masters, had cemented his lofty position as America's
greatest golfer.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, he would be elevated to legend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six years have passed since Ben Hogan made his one and
only appearance in the British Open. Forty-six years since the Wee
Ice Mon was christened amid the heather in golf's birthplace.
Forty-six years since British writer Pat Ward Thomas penned: ``That
was Hogan. We shall never see his like again.''
</P>
<P>
   Years have past, but many would argue that Thomas's words hold
up. The Hogan visit to Carnoustie in 1953 holds that much appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story that will be repeated many times in the next few
days as the 128th British Open is played out over the grueling
links of Carnoustie's Medal Course, just 20 miles north of St.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie. The mere mention of it conjures up the image of
Hogan, smoking a cigarette beneath his trademark white cap, staring
straight ahead, his eyes colder than the wind whipping in off the
North Sea. Even if you weren't there, you can picture it. If you
were there . . . well, the memory is special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played four rounds right behind him,'' said Peter Thomson.
``It was pretty slow behind him. There was a fair amount of waiting
and waiting. So I got to watch him quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson was a 23-year-old Australian playing in his third
British Open, and though he would shoot 72-72-71-71 and threaten
the top spot all three days (in those days, the British Open
concluded with a 36-hole finale), Thomson never entertained
thoughts of a championship. ``I wasn't ready to win. I was still
fiddling with golf clubs,'' he said. There was only one winner in
his mind. ``Hogan. He was recognized as the best player in the US
at the time. We expected him to win.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an awe about Hogan, and the fact he had finally
relented and gone to play the British Open was major news. ``They
kept after him and kept after him and kept after him,'' said Frank
Stranahan, the dominant amateur player of the 1940s and early '50s.
``They kept telling Hogan, `You've gotta win the British Open. It's
the thing you have to do for your career.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They? It has been reported through the years that Walter Hagen,
Tommy Armour, Bobby Jones, and some key business associates were
the most vocal in telling Hogan he needed to play in the British
Open. But Stranahan, who considered Hogan a friend, said the event
would never have unfolded had it not been for Valerie Hogan, who
agreed it would be good for her husband to play. Stranahan was on
the plane that carried the Hogans across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   When Hogan arrived, said Thomson, there was no mistaking his
presence. ``He was friendly with someone from the National Cash
Register Company and stayed at their mansion (11 miles away), not
in Carnoustie,'' Thomson says. ``He lived in comfort; the rest of
us lived in digs _ that's what we called them. He took a big limo
to the course.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hogan in Scotland was no different from Hogan in the US.
Determined. Alone. Unflappable. Stranahan played several practice
rounds with him and continually drove it 25, 30, 40 yards farther.
He tried to talk Hogan into switching to the type of ball he was
hitting, a Dunlop 65 with 100 compression, but Hogan would have
none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stuck to his Acushnet, 90 compression. Hogan said, `Frank,
I want my ball to stay on the green.' If you knew Hogan, you knew
he never changed his mind, never deviated from his plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Scotland was made in late June to give Hogan a few
weeks to get used to the climate, the time zone, and, of course,
the golf course. It is hard to imagine the Royal &AMP; Ancient or the
US Golf Association forcing Tiger Woods to go through a 36-hole
qualifier, but that is how the opens were conducted back then. Thus
the great Ben Hogan, just a few weeks removed from his fourth US
Open championship in six years and a few months after winning the
Masters for the second time in three years, was treated no
differently from, say, Hassan Hassenein of Egypt. If Hogan wanted a
chance at history, if he wanted to become the first player since
the advent of the Masters in 1934 to win three majors in a season,
if he wanted to prove himself _ as Hagen and Armour had insisted he
do _ one of the game's greatest, then he had to do it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   A daunting challenge, no doubt, but then again, this was a man
who had escaped death in an awful crash four years earlier. Doctors
had said he would never walk again. Then they said he would never
play golf again. Now they were saying his battered legs would not
be up to the challenge of Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, people underestimated Hogan's will, said Ken Venturi.
``He prepared for that tournament. He felt it was the best time for
him to play the British Open.''

SEATTLE LAWYER WINS PRIZE FOR HIS PUTRID PROSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ David Hirsch must be a pretty good lawyer _ he
murdered the King's English and got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year veteran of the Seattle public defender's office
Tuesday won the Purple Prose award of the coveted and dubious 18th
International Bulwer-Lytton Fiction contest for bad writing. It is
named for the Victorian author who penned the immortal words: ``It
was a dark and stormy night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many ways of writing badly and I try to cover
them all,'' said Hirsch, speaking with tongue pressed firmly in
cheek. ``I submitted 15 entries; I'm disappointed the other 14
didn't win. But it's made my day, at least marginally.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's Purple Prose award would make a weathercaster weep,
with its projectile vomiting metaphors about the local climate at
its winter worst, said Scott Rice, an English professor at San Jose
State University, where the Bulwer-Lytton Awards were selected from
thousands of paragraphs written worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly ``Purple Rain,'' but Hirsch's prose was
inspired by the same stuff:
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain _ violent torrents of it, rain like fetid water from a
God-sized pot of pasta strained through a sky-wide colander, rain
as Noah knew it, flaying the shuddering trees, whipping the
whitecapped waters, violating the sodden firmament, purging purity
and filth alike from the land, rain without mercy, without
surcease, incontinent rain, turning to intermittent showers
overnight with partial clearing Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's paragraph outdistanced all others for the Purple Prose
Prize because, ``like his pasta, it was overdone,'' said Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an example of metaphors run amok and not knowing when to
quit. The whole range was ludicrous _ shattering, whipping,
violating, purging,'' Rice said, in painful admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch counts among his artistic experiences membership in the
defunct ``Mazeltones'' band _ ``we played hundreds of weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rice believes Hirsch's legal experience provided him with
the best tools:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been finding a way of justifying the unjustifiable and
speaking about the unspeakable for a long time,'' the professor
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch was outdone only by the Grand Prize winner, Dr. David
Chuter, a 47-year-old government official from London, who became
the first non-American in years to win the perverse competition.
</P>
<P>
   Chuter, who describes himself as ``a rather harmless and obscure
bureaucrat trying to serve the public interest,'' wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the gathering gloom of a late-October afternoon, along
the greasy, cracked paving-stones slick from the sputum of the sky,
Stanley Ruddlethorp wearily trudged up the hill from the cemetery
where his wife, sister, brother, and three children were all
buried, and forced open the door of his decaying house, blissfully
unaware of the catastrophe that was soon to devastate his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said the awards were conceived both to encourage
unpublished authors who do not have the time to write books, and to
honor the memory of the Victorian novelist Edward George Earl
Bulwer-Lytton.
</P>
<P>
   Bulwer-Lytton's 1830 novel, ``Paul Clifford,'' opened with the
words now timeless and synonymous with wretched writing.
</P>
<P>
   Taking time out to be serious, Rice said it's really encouraging
to see people from all walks of life go to such lengths to be
creatively bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``English teachers are always bemoaning the state of literacy,
but here are people from all walks of life who love to have fun
with words,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his efforts, Chuter gets what all winners have gotten, ``a
pittance,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch gets less. ``Hey, he'll be a household name, he'll have
groupies, he'll be the envy of his literate friends. Isn't that
enough?'' Rice pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he might celebrate the insult and honor with friends
or family, Hirsch said ``leave my family out of this. They're
respectable people.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's already plotting another assault on the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working up to the pittance. Maybe in a few years ... ''

<P>
   If a TV-14 is accompanied by V, S, L and/or D, expect it to be
very intense, warns Eisenstock, who lectures nationally on the
effects of media on children.
</P>
<P>
   FV is also a problem. Since it stands for ``fantasy violence,''
many parents incorrectly assume it means cartoon violence. Not so.
What it means is that some children may not be able to recognize
that the violence in the show is make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, FV is only added to TV-Y7, not to the more general
TV-Y label. That doesn't mean that there won't be mild violence in
TV-Y shows, however. ``Roadrunner,'' for instance, a cartoon,
contains isolated, animated violence but it's rated TV-Y. ``You
can't automatically assume TV-Y is free of violence,'' warns
Eisenstock.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several assumptions you can make when you see
TV-Y7-FV, Montgomery says: ``Violence is central to these shows,
it's presented in an exciting and realistic way, heroes are
justified and valued for their acts of violence, and the
consequences of the violence aren't shown.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger to children under 7 who watch FV programming is well
documented: ``Not only do they imitate the violence and accept it
as an appropriate way to solve conflict, but their tolerance of
aggression gets lower and lower until they accept it as normal,''
says Montgomery. ``When a kid tells you the violence in a
particular show is `no big deal,' that's what's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   --News, commercials, and sports shows are not rated at all.
Because of their inability to tell the difference between what's
real and what's not, preschoolers can be frightened by the news and
even by some sports programming. Commercials can be a problem not
just for inappropriate content but also because they makes young
children vulnerable to sales pitches. ``My 6-year-old only watches
public TV for just that reason,'' says Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the V-chip comes in. Some of the new TVs have an
option that allows blocking of any unrated program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real child-proof cap for the TV,'' says Cantor. She
would be quick to use this for a child who worries about his or her
personal safety or frequently has nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the V-chip blocks the level you program it for and
anything higher: If you block TV-PG, you also automatically block
TV-14 and TV-MA. Knowing what you need to block depends on your
child's age, stage of development, gender, emotional maturity, and
ability to separate fantasy from reality. ``If you have a
4-year-old who's getting into trouble on the playground and he's
fascinated by violence on TV, you may want to block anything that's
not TV-Y,'' says Eisenstock.

</P>
<P>
   The system:
</P>
<P>
   There are two ratings systems. The Recreational Software
Advisory Council rates on a scale of 1 to 4, for instance: V1,
little or no killing of humans, V4, a lot of killing of humans; S1,
little or no sexual touching or degree of undress, S4, lots of
sexual touching and nudity. The Entertainment Software Rating Board
gives an age demarcation: EC: early childhood; E: for everyone
(older games may be labeled KA, which means ``from Kid to Adult'');
T: teen, 13 and older; M: 17 and older; AO: adults only.
</P>
<P>
   What to be aware of:
</P>
<P>
   --The age ratings give you no clue about content.
</P>
<P>
   --Except for AO, video stores tend not to pay attention to
ratings when children are renting.
</P>
<P>
   --Just because it's a sports game doesn't mean there isn't
violence. Cantor tells of buying her son an NFL video game where
every play ended with players being smashed to the ground and the
commentator gleefully declaring: ``A crushing tackle!'' ``It was
violence, all right,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   --Violence, sex, etc., tend to escalate at higher levels of each
game. ``Video games at the early levels are pretty benign, but they
get more and more vicious as they go up in level,'' says Cantor.
Her advice: ``Don't just look at a game once and decide it's OK;
have the computer, Nintendo, etc. in a public space in the house,
where you can see what's going on without seeming to be a snoop.
Rent video games before you buy them.''

</P>
<P>
   --The V-chip provides built-in opportunities for teaching media
literacy. Use it to talk to your 3- and 4-year-old about why there
are only certain shows she can watch: ``Not everything on
television is good for kids. The V-chip is a way our family keeps
you safe. TV-Y shows are the ones for you.''
</P>
<P>
   --With older children who have had viewing freedom, it's
important not to suddenly become absolute about programming. Even
if you get a set with a V-chip, it doesn't mean you can't override
it: ``There may be some things that are blocked that you want to
see, and we can decide about that together.''
</P>
<P>
   --When you use the V-chip, if you block by content, for instance
TV-PG-V, you will still receive shows with TV-PG-L/S/D, unless you
also block those designations. It's also possible to block
programming for a specific time and channel.
</P>
<P>
   --By January, all new sets will be equipped with V-chips. For
older sets, you can buy a V-chip set-top box.

PROFITABLE POLAROID'S STOCK SINKS, DESPITE COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to PopShots, Wall Street is taking fewer pot shots at
Polaroid Corp.
</P>
<P>
   PopShots is the Cambridge, Mass. company's new single-use
disposable instant picture camera that reached the mass market in
February and is largely responsible for the company's first
quarter-to-quarter increase in revenue in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Strong sales of its ``Barbie'' camera, a dressed-up version of
the aging OneStep model, and increased sales of new products in
Japan, pushed Polaroid back to profitability for the first time in
nine months.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong financial results did not stop a sharp drop in
Polaroid's stock price, as the firm warned that in the second half
of the year earnings will be below initial projections because of
anticipated fluctuations in foreign currency markets and further
declines in some of its smaller, noncore businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast sent Polaroid shares into a tailspin Wednesday,
with the stock closing at 23 3/4, down 5 _ the steepest one-day
drop this year and almost half of the gain the company has made
since hitting a 52-week low of 17 1/16 in late January.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is ``a big chunk for Polaroid, but keep in mind that
the noncore stuff has little bearing on the long-term viability of
the company and the dollar fluctuations are beyond the company's
control,'' said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reversal in Polaroid's results is the first clear
sign that the strategy put in place by chairman Gary T. DiCamillo
when he took over the Cambridge-based company in 1995 _ churning
out dozens of new consumer products _ is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing Polaroid's turnaround and the second quarter
profitability was as we expected,'' said DiCamillo, who in the past
three years has cut 3,000 jobs from the 62-year-old company.
Polaroid, the world's biggest instant-photography company, employs
about 9,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But DiCamillo warned the strong dollar and changes in noncore
businesses such as sunglasses, polarizers, holography, and graphic
arts products would affect third-quarter profits. DiCamillo hopes
to sell off the noncore lines by the end of the year to concentrate
on instant and digital photography.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said the company's second-quarter results were
``pretty good with solid revenues,'' as new products were ramped up
on schedule. ``But the company is not out of the woods yet,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is growing concern that Polaroid's instant film
sales _ the company's main profit center _ are declining in the
markets such as residential real estate and insurance claims
because of digital technology. Filmless digital cameras can capture
images, such as pictures of homes, and save them on personal
computers where the images can be stored, put on the Internet, sent
as electronic mail, and later printed.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid also reported a second-quarter decline in European
camera and film sales, in
</P>
<P>
   part because some of the newer products that are available in
Japan are just arriving in selected markets.
</P>
<P>
   And while Polaroid will launch two new cameras _ the I-Zone
Instant Pocket Camera and JoyCam, each priced at $24.99 _ in
August, the new film for the Pocket Camera may be in short supply,
DiCamillo told Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not have enough to meet demand,'' in the second half,
DiCamillo warned.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is building capacity for the new instant
film, which will produce images about the size of postage stamps.
Polaroid is producing the new, smaller film in Mexico for the
Japanese market and is just beginning to expand production in
Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increased evidence that DiCamillo's new-product
strategy is working, but we will not know for sure how well until
the end of the year,'' said Ulysses A. Yannas, a longtime Polaroid
watcher at Mercer, Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reid in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Yannas and others noted Polaroid is making hefty bets on its
pocket camera, which has proven very popular in Japan, where it has
been available for 15 months. He said the firm expects its new
cameras to appeal to US preteens, teenagers, and young adults, many
of whom are new to instant photography.
</P>
<P>
   The new products, which accounted for about $70 million of
Polaroid's revenue in the first half of the year, should rise to
nearly $140 million in the second half, Yannas said. In 2000, the
company's new camera and film products should jump to about $365
million and reach $500 million in 2001, he added.
</P>
<P>
   DiCamillo has said the company is ``on track to deliver
profitable growth in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid reported second-quarter earnings of $14.8 million, or
33 cents per diluted share, compared with $1.34 million, or 3 cents
a share, last year. Worldwide revenue for the quarter ended June 30
rose 5 percent to $487 million, compared with $465 million in the
year-earlier period. US sales accounted for $267 million in
revenue, an increase of 9 percent over the same period in 1998. But
European sales slipped to $107 million from $117 million.

PRICES FALLING ON TERM LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a product that doesn't run on computer chips, term life
insurance keeps getting cheaper at a remarkable pace.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the plain vanilla policies most of us buy has
fallen 60 percent since the beginning of the decade and nearly 20
percent in the past two years, according to published data.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a chance that, between now and the end of the year,
prices may ratchet down again. ``We could see a two-minute drill,''
says Robert Sheridan, president of Savings Bank Life Insurance, a
Woburn, Mass. company and the state's leading writer of term
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Term policies provide insurance for a set period of time,
without the savings and investment features common in other types
of life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for this latest round of price cuts, ironically, is
a new government regulation that may raise prices starting next
year. The rule, known as XXX (called Triple X), would require
insurers to boost the reserves they must keep on hand to write term
policies.
</P>
<P>
   As the length of those policies has increased _ some insurers
guarantee flat rates for 30 years _ so have the fears of
regulators. They worry the companies are making promises they won't
be able to honor. Raising the reserve requirement will provide an
extra margin of safety for consumers, according to the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The group endorsed the new rules at its spring meeting and most
states are expected to adopt the regulations, possibly as early as
next January. Massachusetts has yet to take any action on the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   While there is considerable dispute about how much impact XXX
will have, there is an emerging consensus that prices will go up at
least a little and that some of the best deals may disappear.
Industry experts say insurers are likely to use the approaching
deadline as a way to drum up business with the message: Buy now
while the getting is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see companies try to leapfrog one another with price
cuts,'' predicts James Van Elsen, an industry consultant based in
Iowa. Massachusetts Mutual of Springfield recently announced a cut
in its rates. Savings Bank Life ``is seriously considering'' a cut,
says Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   For the industry, rate cuts have been the rule, not the
exception, in this decade. ``Rates have gone in only one direction,
down,'' says Milton Brown, who runs Insurance Information Inc., a
Cape Cod firm that compares prices for consumers on term insurance
policies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a healthy 35-year-old man could buy a 20-year, $250,000
term policy for $447.50 a year. Today that same man could get a
policy for as little as $165, says Brown, who tracks prices for 600
different companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that we are living longer has a lot to do with the
falling prices, say industry executives. The logic is pretty basic:
The fewer people who die, the less insurers have to pay out in
death benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Increased competition has helped too. Everyone and his brother
sells term insurance today. The rise of the Internet as a shopping
tool has heightened the competition by allowing consumers to make
simple comparisons among policies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is one thing the industry doesn't brag about much:
better underwriting. Using blood tests, medical records, and
questionnaires, insurers have become more skilled at separating the
good risks from the bad. Anything from high blood pressure to a
fondness for sky diving can make a consumer ineligible for the
rock-bottom rates that typically are advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will cheap term insurance still be available next year?'' asks
Van Elsen, the consultant. The answer, he says, is yes. But he
expects prices to rise somewhat and he thinks some companies that
now guarantee rates for 20 years, may shorten those guarantees to
five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine recently quoted an
insurance specialist who predicted rates could rise 10 percent to
40 percent, a range others consider too large.
</P>
<P>
   So should consumers run out and buy policies now to beat the
possible price hikes?
</P>
<P>
   The answer from experts is: maybe. They say that no one should
buy life insurance unless they need it and that the world after XXX
is not likely to be radically different from the world today.
</P>
<P>
   But for consumers who are in the market already, the next few
months may bring some very attractive deals, according to industry
watchers. Says Milton Brown, ``If you need it, this could be a very
good time to buy.''

A SAD WAY TO LEARN ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; was watering the new plants in front of the house at dusk,
standing in the deserted street with no company but myself.
</P>
<P>
   My thoughts were unusually dark.
</P>
<P>
   My granddaughter, Jessie, 8, had been rude to me. Having lost an
argument with me the day before, she'd flounced off without saying
goodbye. I felt defeated and unappreciated, as if our unhappy
parting revealed that as far as both my grandkids were concerned,
my only purpose was to indulge them. All the love I'd given them
was pointless in the light of this stunning revelation. I hadn't
built a lasting or reliable relationship with them. I saw that now.
Cross them once and I was off their list.
</P>
<P>
   I was feeling bad, too, that I'd let down my youngest daughter.
No need to go into detail here. In fact, the problem is that I'm
too willing to share information Julie considers no one's business
but her own. As a teenager, she'd once asked, ``Mom, why does
everything I say to you go in one ear and out your mouth?'' I
carefully check out the content of this column, but obviously I
still haven't learned when to keep my mouth shut with friends. She
was right to be angry at me. I was angry at me too. It seemed to me
that the best gift I could give her was to stay away forever.
</P>
<P>
   I was missing her already.
</P>
<P>
   The watering seemed endless, but even if I spent my whole life
watering, I wouldn't miss anything. My relationship with my husband
was nonexistent. He'd had meetings for the last three nights and
hadn't been home for dinner. As the shadows deepened, I felt
terribly lonely, but it was good preparation, I thought, for being
a widow. Jack was destined to die all too soon so I might as well
practice being alone all day and all night. It seemed to me that
once I got used to being estranged from everyone, the total
bleakness of my future wouldn't come as such a shock.
</P>
<P>
   I poured water onto another plant, too sad to cry.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny light flickered in the darkness of my mind like a distant
neon sign: (italsOIt's a bit unusual for you to feel hopelessly and
permanently alienated from everyone you love.(unitals) I've managed
to weather a lifetime of disagreements, a checkered career of
thoughtlessness, and a marriage full of temporary absences. Why did
everything seem so overwhelming now? What had changed?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was my brain chemistry. I was on a new medication.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six weeks, I've been waking up every morning with a
headache. I have pills that cure my migraines once they've started,
but they're to be used sparingly, so I recently went to a
specialist to see if I could prevent them. Several years ago, I
gave up on a drug that left me so devoid of energy that I could
barely get through the day, but I was now trying out another. I'd
been terribly tired and had recently noticed a molasseslike
consistency to my thinking, but I hadn't decided whether these side
effects were reason enough to quit or not.
</P>
<P>
   Now I wondered if the drug had triggered my depressive feelings.
They certainly felt like genuine emotions. It goes against the
grain of my common sense to think of them as chemically caused.
What's so shocking in retrospect is how totally justified they
seemed at the time, such a perfectly appropriate response to actual
events.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until I stopped taking the drug and returned to normal.
In two days, not only did my energy return, but I was sane again.
Jessie was a sweetie who occasionally lost her temper, Julie was
capable of forgiveness, and Jack, home for dinner, no longer had
one foot in the grave.
</P>
<P>
   I never realized how powerful, and dangerous, many commonly
prescribed medications are. If I hadn't made the connection, it
wouldn't have taken long for my personal life to have become a
shambles, perhaps irretrievably so, with no one the wiser as to why
I'd gone off the deep end. None of the information I received from
the pharmacy mentioned depression. I hadn't planned to report the
details to my doctor, but when I called one of the authors of
``Worse Pills, Good Pills: A Consumer's Guide to Avoiding
Drug-Induced Death or Illness,'' written by Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, Larry Sasich suggested I report my adverse effects
to my physician. Depression, it turns out, has been linked with
this medication. Given that this drug had been tested on fewer than
5,000 people, patient feedback is the primary source of knowledge
about side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness I didn't learn this lesson the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never be this naive again.

VERTICAL GARDENING DISGUISES EYESORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been interested in growing up (we're talking gardening, not
personal maturity) for almost 15 years, ever since we had that row
house in Philadelphia with a gorgeous stone facade on the steps
leading up to the front door. It cried for a vine.
</P>
<P>
   We considered ivies, Boston especially, but finally chose
trumpet vine, Campsis radicans. It grew, attaching to the stone and
mortar, but never flourished, being in too much shade. We returned
to New England before it had a chance to fully adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Here we have no appropriate places to grow trumpet vine (I don't
want it attached to our shingled house or the wooden shed), but we
do grow climbers. I'd like to say we got into climbing plants out
of a deep sense of design, mixing vertical elements in brilliant
and subtle ways to heighten the experience of our gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the chain-link fence that got us going. That would be
the chain-link fence we had to install immediately upon moving to
Marshfield because we had a small pool, and the insurance company
(not to mention the law) insisted on the fence. It marred our back
view. It had to be covered, disguised.
</P>
<P>
   I've been covering it ever since. For annuals, we have used
sweet peas, which I think have the best scent on this planet,
hyacinth beans (Dolichos lablab) for white and purple flowers and
purple beans, and scarlet runner beans (Phaseolus coccineus) for
their scarlet flowers followed by edible beans (not the best, but
the big dog likes them).
</P>
<P>
   We have two roses out there, a pink miniature that has yet to
take off and a Zephirine Drouhin that, despite the drought and
because of extensive watering by me, has decided to flower after
all. There is a hardy kiwi (Actinidia kolomitka), which has mottled
pink, white and green leaves, and two euonymus (Euonymus fortunei
`Emerald Surprise') have grabbed hold, hauled themselves up, and
are going hand-over-hand along the fence top.
</P>
<P>
   Two purple Clematis jackmanii flank the kiwi. One has finished
flowering, its large buds opening to equally large flowers, and the
other is about to, with much smaller buds opening to smaller
flowers (this leads me to believe it is another, mislabeled
cultivar, but I don't care).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, all this has led to other climbers, and we grow two
other climbing roses, a deep red mystery heirloom that came with
the house and a pinkish hybrid. We also have a honeysuckle
(Lonicera X brownii `Dropmore Scarlet'), whose orange flowers have
scarlet throats and some gold-tinged ivy headed up an oak. There's
also poison ivy and American bittersweet, two undesirables we mean
to deal with some day.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are more clematis. The clematis we have failed at
include `Henryi,' `Ernest Markham,' and `Ville de Lyon,' but this
is because of the hellish site we chose. A deep red `Niobe' is
adjusting, after three years, to the turkey-wire-covered wood fence
post it grows on by the pool, and a tangutica, a small-flowered
species with yellow flowers, is being encouraged near a spirea.
</P>
<P>
   Our best is sweet autumn clematis (Clematis maximowicziana),
which covers the front lamp post and has scrambled into an adjacent
ornamental plum tree, where its green leaves stand out like a cool
stream of green amid the plum's purple leaves. In September, we'll
have showers of small, slightly fragrant white flowers. I love it.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, I love clematis, and I am determined to grow more and
find better ways to do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Austin, owner of Completely Clematis Specialty Nursery in
Ipswich, Mass., is a fount of information, being an aficionado as
well as a grower.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they have a reputation for being finicky. ``They do because
of the clematis wilt, which affects the large-flowered hybrids.''
So, either deal with the wilt, which generally doesn't kill the
plant, though it does rob you of your show, or grow wilt-resistant
small-flowered varieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're terribly easy to grow, and they don't get the
wilt,'' Austin said of the small-flowered clematis. Their foliage
is more attractive, and the seed heads are quite extraordinary,
extending the season of interest. They can be quite fragrant, and
they don't require use of wilt-combating fungicides.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that clematis must have cool roots, while the tops
like the sun, is false, she said. They do like a good, fertile root
run, and Austin recommends planting the crowns 4 inches below the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, not full sun, is a good idea, but according to Austin,
`Silver Moon,' a whitish large-flowered cultivar, would grow in a
closet and certainly can light up a shady corner.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't all have to go up. ``Some varieties of clematis
make great ground covers,'' she said. C. heracleifolia `Mrs. Robert
Brydon' has masses of small lavender flowers and ``covers every
speck of open space,'' Austin said. The integrifolias, sprawly
nonclimbers, can be ground covers and can make nice border plants.
</P>
<P>
   Her nursery sells more than 135 kinds, including bicolors and
double-flowered cultivars. There are exotics as well as the
standbys, including the vigorous montana group, which can ramble on
for 30 feet and look stunning up trees.
</P>
<P>
   That ability to mix benevolently with neighbors adds to the
versatility of clematis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for fun I always plant annual vines, and sometimes I mix
them with clematis,'' Austin said. ``Things like canary creeper (a
yellow-flowered nasturtium cousin). When you have a young clematis,
they look very good. It gives it some fullness.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a lovely idea.

PORSCHE CARRERA 4 UNDERSTATED _ UNTIL YOU FIRE IT UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Porsche:
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry about what happened to your car (but more on that
later).
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, thank you for letting me drive your 911 Carrera
4. I have never driven anything quite like it. It is fast _ wicked
fast and wicked quick _ it is smooth, and it seems the only way you
can lose control of this car is to make a deliberate and crazy
attempt to do so (but more on that later).
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that the car whose prototype you built 51
years ago _ remember those military parts and the leftover
Volkswagen Kubelwagens that went into the 356? _ has evolved into
this quietly elegant but roaring piece of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it looks so benign from the outside. No bulging
fenders-on-steroids. No gaping air intake ports. Just the smooth
lines of a gently rounded wedge. Even the Carrera 4 tag on the back
probably means little to those who don't already know that this is
an all-wheel-drive car.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the first thing you notice is the dash: so simple, but
again, so elegant. The main gauges wrapped in a soft, stitched,
leather wedge shaped much like the car itself. And I love the way
you took all those gauges and scalloped them one behind the other
from the center out.
</P>
<P>
   There in the middle, as befits a true performance car, is not
the speedometer but the tachometer. At the bottom of this same full
circle is a digital speed readout and the trip computer that tells
you outside temperature, how far you can go before you run out of
gas, what your gas mileage has been, and, if you set it, will warn
you when you exceed your chosen speed limit. To the left, the
semicircles step away as analog speedometer, voltmeter, and
odometer. To the right are the shift indicator (for both the manual
and automatic options) and oil and fuel gauges.
</P>
<P>
   On stems behind the steering wheel are controls for the trip
computer, windshield and headlight washers, cruise controls,
wipers, and light beams. All so simple and so functional.
</P>
<P>
   And so are the climate controls and sound system centered on the
dash. Love the way the display face on the sound system pops open
to reveal a CD slot behind it, and love the CD stacker built into
the dash below.
</P>
<P>
   The leather seats are firm and comfortable, though again, they
are so simple in design they are understated. No bulging sides to
hold the outer thighs; no raised lip at the front for support; seat
flowing continuously into headrest. It all works.
</P>
<P>
   The rear seats, well, there's not much headroom back there, so
four adults on a long trip would be problematic _ but of course
that's not why you buy a car like this. Just as you don't buy it
expecting lots of storage space.
</P>
<P>
   No glove box. Bins with lids set in each door at armrest height,
small slots at the bottoms of the doors, a tiny covered box in the
center console. The trunk up front is a small box, as well _ no
golf clubs or large suitcases up here, though folding down the rear
seats would set two people up nicely for a trip.
</P>
<P>
   So simple, so understated. Until you fire it up and get that
distinctive sound from its twin pipes and look out the windshield
and down the hood, where the front fenders seem to be heading
toward a wedge, a tipped ``V'' that says, ``Point me somewhere and
step on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Step on 296 horsepower, cranking 258 lbs./ft. of torque from a
flat 6 aluminum block, aluminum head engine, and the V seems to
shrink before your eyes; becomes the point of an arrow, or the
sharp, guiding cursor in a video game.
</P>
<P>
   And driving this car _ shifting up and down with both thumbs
using the Triptonic manual shift buttons built into the steering
wheel _ is like being in a video game. Except, as Jake the Snake,
my 9-year-old guide in things electronic, pointed out to me, ``When
you mess up with this, you can't press the reset button.''
</P>
<P>
   Other select-shift transmissions I've driven have still had at
least some ``automatic'' feel to them, a certain lag after each
shift, even when set on manual. Not this one.
</P>
<P>
   Crank through the gears from first to third (0-60 in five
seconds) and each step is smooth but noticeable as you flash
through them. Downshift from fifth to fourth at high speed and give
it gas and you get a race car rumble from the twin exhausts as you
bolt forward. Playing with the car in a heavy way, I got just under
18 miles per gallon in a week of driving.
</P>
<P>
   It's a stiff ride, as it ought to be, and the handling is
impeccable. And for some, that is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   A problem because this Porsche is equipped with what is called
Porsche Stability Management. That means it is as smart as some
airplanes, and some folks don't want their cars helping them out
when it comes to on-the-edge driving.
</P>
<P>
   This new Porsche has sensors that monitor the steering wheel,
yaw of the car, wheels, brake pedal, clutch and gears and throttle
position. Viscous couplers feed torque to nonslipping wheels from
slipping wheels. The sensors can brake individual wheels to regain
stability or alter engine power to recapture control.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to get this car to oversteer or understeer so
severely you lose control, you have to do something seriously _
perhaps intentionally _ wrong. I tried it. Set the rear wheels on
sand as I entered a 90-degree turn. Goosed the gas. Felt the rear
try to kick out and send me into the World of the Incredible
Shrinking Radius Turn. Couldn't do it. The front wheels grabbed,
pulled the car ahead, and said, ``Oh no you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   So I switched off the PSM (for those moments when you want to
induce terror) and tried the same thing. Nice fishtail, wonderful
understeer. Oh yes, I do. But though I corrected easily, I could
tell that this car, without the computer- assisted stability, could
be dangerous in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   The speedometer goes to 175 miles per hour and though I didn't
take it there, I could tell in short bursts that it would eat up
most of that gauge. The brakes _ 12.5-inch vented discs up front,
11.8-inch vented discs in the rear _ coupled with antilock control,
brought the car to sudden, straight stops from high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mr. Porsche, you have built a beautifully understated,
rip-roaring beast of a car. A car I would love to own.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to that problem, and I hope you will understand. I
can't find your car. I still have the keys, but it just disappeared
one day when I wasn't looking. Somebody probably hid it in a garage
or an old mine up in New Hampshire where I live. But I figure
you've got lots more and, hey, what's one little Porsche to a guy
like you who has so many. If I do find it, I'll be in touch. And
again, thanks for letting me drive it.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The lateral, telescoping movement of the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   --An air conditioning system that kept me chilled right through
the recent sweltering heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   --The easy-to-use trip computer.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The danger of speeding tickets. Leave your local post office,
give the car moderate gas, shift 1-2-3, and look down. You are now
doing 50 in a 30. Hello, officer!

it, that is.

GOING TOO FAR TO STOP STEALING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computers like to accuse
Microsoft Corp. of stealing the Mac's graphical user interface for
Microsoft's Windows software. Microsoft defenders respond that
Apple itself stole the idea from Xerox Corp.'s Alto computer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they're both right, and thank heaven for it.
Intellectual progress doesn't happen in a vacuum. Nearly every
``new idea'' is based on previous ideas that somebody appropriates
for his own ends.
</P>
<P>
   How many truly original ideas have we seen in computing lately?
The most recent that comes to mind is the spreadsheet, invented by
a couple of Bostonians 20 years ago. Of course the Xerox Alto of
1974 goes on the list. As does Paul Baran's 1964 Rand Corp. paper
in which he thought up packet switching _ the central technology of
the Internet. Most of the other breakthroughs were big or small
improvements on existing ideas. Soaking up information from others,
and then imparting a new spin to it, is about as creative as most
of us will ever get.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why quite a few creative types are up in arms over the
US Congress's latest adventure in intellectual property law. North
Carolina Republican Representative Howard Coble is pushing a bill
that would provide new protections for companies that create
databases of information. The bill, HR 354, would make it harder
for people to use collected data without paying for it. But the
bill's critics seem to regard it as the worst threat to the
nation's intellectual life since Jerry Springer got his own TV
show. And they may have a point.
</P>
<P>
   These days, databases are everywhere. There's your personal
address book, for instance, or a telephone directory, or the
complete computer columns of Hiawatha Bray. These are all
databases. Companies create them by the millions, and a growing
number are available on the Internet _ stock market data, for
instance. Obviously this information is valuable, and it costs
money to assemble it all. No surprise then that big companies like
Reed Elsevier Inc. _ owner of the Lexis-Nexis news and legal
database _ support HR 354, which will impose criminal penalties on
people who steal information.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like justice. Thanks to computers and the Internet,
it's easy to copy somebody else's database and market it as your
own. Should I be able to go to a sports Web site, download reams of
statistics, then set up my own Web site to compete with the
original source? It hardly seems fair.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the flip side. Those sports scores may be in a
database compiled by someone else. But they're also historical
facts. Draw your database protection bill too broadly, and you
could end up making it illegal for historians to scoop up factual
data from the Net and use it in their next book.
</P>
<P>
   HR 354 prohibits the copying of ``substantial'' parts of a
database _ a fancy way of saying that a violation is whatever the
database owner says it is. Suppose a sports writer is working on a
book about the 1998 Chicago Bulls. Say he visits the National
Basketball Association Web site, collects the lifetime stats for
every member of the team, and includes this data in the book.
That's a pretty substantial chunk of information. Would the writer
have to pay the NBA to use it? Well . . . maybe. The courts would
have to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Now multiply that example by many thousands. Everybody from pulp
novelists to college profs use large and small chunks of other
people's data in their work. The expansive language of HR 354 will
have all these people breaking a sweat. Which is why an
extraordinary array of the nation's top universities are fighting
this proposal, along with the National Writers Union and the
American Library Association. Even Internet firms like Yahoo and
Lycos, which create their own databases and distribute others, say
HR 354 goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Republican Tom Bliley has offered up a rival bill, HR
1858, which has been endorsed by many of the same groups that hate
354. The biggest difference is that 1858 simply bans copying of
entire databases in order to sell the stolen data. Supporters of
354 say the Bliley bill still leaves room for info-theft, and
they're right. But we need a few loopholes in our intellectual
property laws _ just enough to encourage the kind of larcenous
creativity that gave us Windows and the Macintosh.

CABLE MODEM A POSSIBLE THREAT TO COMPUTER SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In April I got an e-mail message from a reader in California.
``My associate recently installed cable modem in her home and was
shocked to find that `Network Neighborhood' was, literally, her
neighborhood! She could see the desktops of all her connected
neighbors. This seems like an enormous oversight on the part of
cable modem companies, or maybe they just don't care (more likely
the latter.) In any case, I think it is important for cable modem
users to realize the risks of being connected to the Internet 24
hours a day, and the other vulnerabilities associated with cable
modem. What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   I think that stories like this are becoming far too common.
</P>
<P>
   The particular problem that the person in California is
experiencing has to do with the way the Windows operating systems
does networking. Because it is common for people in offices to want
to share files and printers, Microsoft made file sharing very easy
in its Windows operating system: Just click ``share'' and off you
go. This lax approach to security was understandable in 1994, when
Microsoft designed most of this technology: Then, most local-area
networks were confined to corporate offices _ offices in which it
was more important to make files and printers easily available over
the network than to try to keep them secret.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for better or worse, the networking protocols
used by today's cable modem systems are very similar to those used
in a typical office network _ indeed, most neighborhood cable
system looks like one big local area network. This similarity is
responsible for the low price of cable modem access _ much of the
technology is recycled from other parts of the computer industry.
But the recycling brings with it many security problems, as the
California reader's associate is experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   Unauthorized file sharing is less of a problem for people with
MediaOne cable modems in the Boston area. This is because MediaOne
blocks Microsoft's file sharing protocol by default. But file
sharing can still be a problem for Macintosh users. As recently as
a year ago, a friend of mine in Wellesley was able to see printers
and computers belonging to other Macs in his neighborhood using his
computer's ``Chooser'' program. He could even print messages on
other people's printers _ and sometimes he got surprising printouts
on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to protect yourself from unauthorized file and
printer sharing is to disable these services on your computers. If
you need file sharing yourself _ for example, if you have two
computers inside your house on the same network _ then you should
create user names and passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative that is more expensive, but is much more
secure, is to set up a personal firewall to isolate your internal
network from the cable modem network. A friend of mine bought such
a firewall, called the ``Sonic Wall.'' It cost $500 for the basic
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   This whole issue of cable modem security was driven home to me
on Sunday morning, when somebody attacked a computer that I was
setting up in my study. I had just finished a new operating system
on the computer that's connected to my MediaOne cable modem, when a
warning message flashed on the screen: Somebody else on the
MediaOne network was trying to break into my system using a
well-known security hole in a program called ``portmap.''
</P>
<P>
   The portmap attack is classic: I wrote about it in 1990 when I
published my first book on UNIX computer security. Unfortunately,
there are many computers on the Internet that are still susceptible
to this attack today. Somebody else on my cable modem network was
scanning all of the computers in the neighborhood, trying to see if
any were vulnerable. If I had been running an older operating
system, that person could have broken into my machine and taken it
over.
</P>
<P>
   Why would somebody want to break into my machine? The answer is
access. If an attacker can break into somebody's home computer on
the MediaOne network, he can then use that machine as a jumping-off
point for breaking into other computers on the Internet. By jumping
from one machine to a second and a third, an attacker can weave a
path that effectively hides his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Richard D. Jenkinson, Media One's director of communications and
public affairs for the Northeast region, says problems such as
being able to browse somebody's computers or being targeted in a
portmap attack aren't limited to cable modems. ``Any Internet user
should be concerned about security, whether they have a cable
modem, DSL, or dial-up connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, attackers do seem to be increasingly targeting
home computers that are connected to cable modems or high-speed DSL
lines. One reason is the speed: Because a cable modem is 50 times
faster than a standard dial-up, a bad guy can launch 50 attacks
against a cable modem user in the time it takes to launch a single
attack against somebody over a dial-up. This increases the chances
of actually breaking in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, because high-speed connections are ``always on,''
people frequently leave their computers turned on, connected to the
Internet, and unattended for long periods of time. Because it's
much harder to get caught breaking into a computer when nobody is
watching the machine, this makes these computers all the more
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a computer that is attached to the Internet, it's
important to take precautions to protect your safety. One of the
most important things is to make sure your software is up to date.
No matter whether you are running UNIX, Linux, Windows, or MacOS,
be sure to check the Web for security alerts. When bug fixes come
out, be sure to download and install them as soon as you can.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing to do is avoid running programs people send you
by e-mail. Although most programs sent by e-mail are harmless, a
growing number are actually computer viruses or other kinds of
``Trojan Horses.'' These programs can damage or compromise your
system within a split second, and often there is no way to easily
tell that damage has been done.

FOR MANY WOMEN, MARRIAGE NOT SO CRUCIAL ANY MORE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 15, Nikolai Loquez has already done a lot of thinking about
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting cross-legged on the floor at a Massachusetts shopping
mall, the teenager described her vision of the perfect marriage:
``He would be tall and handsome, and he would make good money and
we would live in a big house with a pool and have cute kids and he
would love me,'' she said, her excitement tangling her words as she
peered from underneath a white, wide-brimmed fisherman's hat.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, 14-year-old Jacqueline Crowley agreed, adding that
love was most important ``because everyone wants someone who loves
them to grow old with. It's what life's about.''
</P>
<P>
   The two girls also agreed that the storybook romance most likely
would end in disappointment and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be married to the same person forever but if you
look around, you see that just doesn't happen anymore,'' Loquez
said. ``That's why I am going to have my own money, house, car so
that I will be OK no matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls' views echo the findings of a report, ``The State of
Our Unions,'' issued this month by Rutgers University's National
Marriage Project. According to the annual report, which tracks
social indicators of marital health and wellbeing, 70 percent of
graduating high school girls said it was possible to have a full
life without marriage, compared with 61 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three percent of women said having a child without being
married is a worthwhile lifestyle, compared to 33 percent in 1980,
and about 36 percent of teenage girls said they believe their
future marriages are destined to be short-lived, compared to 32
percent in 1980, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this country's divorce rate is on the decline, the
country's annual marriage rate has dropped to just 49.7 per 1,000
women, the lowest since researchers started to measure it in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   One portion of the study singled out females, saying that while
young men were becoming slightly more optimistic about the prospect
that they will build a happy marriage, young women are losing
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``These girls are being realistic,'' said David Popenoe,
codirector of the project. ``Some of them have never seen a good
marriage so they naturally plan for the day when theirs comes to
what they see as its inevitable end.''
</P>
<P>
   America's divorce culture has taught a generation that they must
first provide for themselves before they think of a partnership,
Popenoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said she wants to go to college and find a good job
before she marries in case she gets divorced and is left to fend
for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to think that things will be cool forever and you can
try to make it work, but it might not,'' she said. ``I don't want
to end up by myself, without any money, and not be able to take
care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Marriage is changing as society has moved beyond the day when a
woman was seen first as wife and mother, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago, we were living in much more of a marriage
culture, highly centered around women marrying and marrying
young,'' Popenoe said. ``It was less desirable to be single and
interest in college and a career was not cultivated in young
women.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon Chirban, a Cambridge psychologist, said it can be
difficult for women to reconcile their desire to achieve in their
20s with their disinterest in being unmarried at 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's tough for more educated women because though
they are progressive and want to be equal partners, they still
think of relationships in traditional ways and expect the man to be
in a better position,'' Chirban said. ``This expectation becomes
more difficult as women acquire and accomplish more.''
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda James, 24, a public relations coordinator, said she
feels torn between her desire to succeed and the pressure to be
married.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start looking at you when you are in your late 20s and
wonder why you aren't married when all of your friends are making
down payments on reception halls,'' said the Roxbury native. ``I
think if I'm not married by 35, it would bother me. It's tough
because the same people who say they are proud of what I have
accomplished then turn around and question my ringless finger.''
</P>
<P>
   James has spent the last six years of her life working toward
her professional goals, putting relationships on the back burner
until just the right time. Now that she is more focused on settling
down in a long-term relationship, she is growing concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of successful women, older mentors of mine who
have everything but a man and I wonder if I can hope for a better
future for me,'' she said. ``In some ways, I think I am resigned to
it. People ask if I am scared that I will end up alone and I say,
`I got the job, got the house, got the car, what do I have to be
scared of?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chirban said that while women no longer attach self-worth to
relationships, many still want the fulfillment a marriage can
provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women now primarily don't define themselves by marriages so if
they don't get married, it's not a crushing blow to their
self-esteem because they have developed their sense of worth in
other terms,'' she said. ``But for those who do want to get
married, the fact that it hasn't happened can be a huge loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as women have begun to claim a more equal position in
society, so they have come to demand more from their marriages than
their mothers did. They are more accomplished than before, and with
increased stature comes greater expectations for equality in their
relationships, and they are less willing to accept the brunt of
household work and rearing children, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie McGovern expects her future marriage to be an equal
partnership. The 19-year-old Salem (Mass.) State College sophomore
said she has laid down the ground rules already with her boyfriend,
who she said she plans to marry after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure that we are both on the same page and that
we plan to share equally in the responsibility,'' she said. ``We've
talked about finances and raising the kids because I am not
planning to have to do everything myself. He has to meet me
halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty Hudson, a 27-year-old English teacher, said she was
starting to count herself among the disillusioned. She said she was
determined not to end up like her friends, either divorced or
sacrificing their goals to keep their marriages together.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson was in La Reine bridal shop in Brookline, just outside of
Boston, getting fitted for a gown for her Aug. 14 wedding, a day
she thought would never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-in-a-million thing,'' she said. ``Few women find a
man who is as giving and willing to compromise as I have. I look at
my parents, who have been married for 38 years, and I know how rare
and special that is. I think few women my age will experience
that.''

   OK. So you folks really are car nuts, just as I suggested at the
end of my 50 Dream Vehicles column a couple of weeks back. You
swamped me with e-mail and snail-mail to let me know what I'd left
off my list and what you'd add to it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the response was positive (excluding: ``Two Farm
Tractors? A Dodge Dart? Various odd models of foreign origin! But
no 1959 Cadillac. Get off the crack-pipe son.'')
</P>
<P>
   Some of you suggested single cars or motorcycles or trucks.
Others sent whole lists. And what struck me most as I went through
hundreds of suggestions was how few repetitions there were. Among
the latter were calls for the Datsun 240 Z, the McClaren F1, the
Jaguar XK-120 Roadster and the 1963 Chevrolet Corvette split-window
coupe. After that, it was free-wheeling down the aisles of fantasy

TV NETWORKS UNDER FIRE FOR DIVERSITY GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By 1984, having been a household name for two decades, Bill
Cosby might reasonably have expected TV networks to embrace his
idea for a new sitcom about a middle-class black family.
</P>
<P>
   But even Cosby was not exempt from television's historic
reluctance to showcase black characters _ an attitude the NAACP
said this week is rearing its ugly head again as the networks
prepare to roll out an overwhelmingly white fall lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School who was a script consultant on ``The Cosby Show,''
recalls that ``some of the networks shied away from it because they
didn't think it would appeal to the white audience.'' When it
became the most popular series of the decade, the same network
executives were ``stunned'' and ``confounded,'' leading Poussaint
to believe that ``the networks were behind the times in judging the
public mood.''
</P>
<P>
   With African-Americans virtually invisible in the two dozen new
dramas and sitcoms slated for the fall TV lineup on the four major
networks, Poussaint sees no reason to change his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporting roles in the new shows are scarce for black
actors, and Hispanics and Asian-Americans fare no better. But the
fall lineup only puts an exclamation point on a TV schedule that
was hardly the picture of diversity before.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the NAACP decided it had had enough. NAACP president
Kweisi Mfume, noting that none of the new shows feature ``a
minority in a leading or starring role,'' lashed out at what he
called ``a virtual whitewash in programming'' on television. On
Monday Mfume blasted the fall lineup as ``an outrage and a shameful
display by network executives, who are either clueless, careless,
or both.'' He warned of possible legal action and a possible
boycott of both programs and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume also demanded meetings with the heads of ABC, CBS, NBC,
and Fox _ meetings the networks are hastening to arrange. The
networks have released statements defending their overall records
on diversity in casting and programming but, in general, have
acknowledged shortcomings and vowed to do better. As a step in that
direction, several networks are recasting some shows with an eye
toward adding minority characters, though the chance is slim that
any of them will be leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   Even though boycotts have largely not worked for groups lobbying
against sex, violence, or other aspects of television programming
deemed objectionable, the networks appear to be taking the NAACP's
boycott threat seriously. ``Everybody feels they are very serious
about this, that they have the stamina to go the distance,'' said
one network executive who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Douglas, a spokeswoman for the NAACP, confirms that
assessment. Douglas said the NAACP's size _ 500,000 members, 1,700
branches _ enhances the chances for a successful boycott if the
organization goes that route. ``It is a top priority for us because
we feel very strongly about this issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the spotlight on diversity has now grown hotter, there
has been a steady decline in the percentage of ethnic minorities on
prime time since the beginning of this decade. Poor people, the
elderly, and rural residents are also a rare sight on TV, which
seems determined to wear a cosmopolitan, yuppified face in pursuit
of the viewers who flocked to ``Seinfeld'' and other
singles-in-Manhattan shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television has always been homogeneous, but it's become even
more homogeneous,'' remarked Steven Stark, author of ``Glued to the
Set.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Poussaint: ``They are sliding backwards. It doesn't make
sense in 1999 to believe you could get away with that, because
every year America becomes more and more diverse. They live in a
make-believe world.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to George Gerbner, a professor of
telecommunications at Temple University in Philadelphia who
specializes in TV demographics, is that television's make-believe
world has destructive fallout in the real world, especially for
minority children who don't see their lives mirrored on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have four or five conglomerates that basically control all
the stories our children grow up with, and the world they present
is a world of mostly white, middle-class consumers,'' said Gerbner.
Nonwhite children are led to believe ``that they're not as good as
anybody else, that they have fewer opportunities, fewer roles, less
potential. I call this growing up damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, noted Dan Amundson of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs in Washington, ``It's not just getting someone with the
same skin color. It's getting someone who is thinking about their
situation as a black or Latino would think about them.'' For that
to occur, the TV industry would need to bolster its low number of
minority writers, producers, and programming executives.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the dispute reflects an inherent tension
between the expectation that television will operate as a force for
social change and the reality that it operates as a bottom-line
business. Advertisers have made clear their preference for
youthful, affluent, and educated viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Poussaint note that many minority viewers fit all
three categories, but the networks have largely chosen to chase
their target demographic by developing copycat versions of
``Seinfeld'' or ``Friends,'' shows with all-white casts. The Big
Four networks who are the target of the NAACP's ire have
increasingly left black-themed programs to the upstart networks,
UPN and the WB. However, as with Fox, those networks have catered
less to black audiences as they have grown more established.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of nonwhite characters on prime time now stands in in
sharp contrast to the TV landscape 25 years ago, during the
so-called ``Norman Lear era.'' In the 1974-75 season, noted TV
historian Alex McNeil, six of the Top 10-rated shows either starred
minorities or dealt with racial issues on an ongoing basis (``The
Jeffersons,'' ``Sanford and Son,'' ``Chico and the Man,'' ``All in
the Family,'' ``Maude,'' and ``Good Times''). In the past season,
only two of the Top 10 shows featured minorities in leading roles:
``ER'' and ``Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   The visibility of ethnic minorities on American television has
eroded in this decade, even as presence in the US population has
grown. For instance, during the 1992-93 season, a study by the
Center for Media and Public Affairs found that 17 percent of the
characters on television were black. By this year, though
African-Americans make up 13 percent of the US population, the
percentage of black characters on TV had dropped to 10 percent,
according to Amundson.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in response to the overall underrepresentation of
minorities on television, black viewers have increasingly diverged
from white viewers when it comes to program choices. The racial
divide opened widest in 1997-98, when ``Seinfeld'' was the
top-rated show in white households, but ranked only 50th among
black viewers, while the top-rated show in black households,
``Between Brothers,'' ranked 112th among white viewers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the range of roles available to minority actors has
undeniably broadened. Robert Thompson, head of the Center for the
Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, noted the
``really good, juicy parts'' played by black actors on such shows
as ``ER,'' the recently canceled ``Homicide,'' and ``Ally McBeal.''
``We have definitely come a long way from where we were before,
though there's still a long way to go,'' said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   To traverse that distance, Poussaint believes black viewers need
to send a succinct message to the TV industry and the advertisers
who support it: ``If you don't pay attention to us, why should we
pay attention to you? Why should we give you our money if you don't
reflect our lives?''

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... happen to me.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chaplin is by his own description a compulsive adventurer, a man
who flies airplanes, drives fast cars, and enjoys scuba diving in
challenging locales. Many of the couple's quarrels centered around
safety issues. In ``Fever Coast Log,'' Chaplin describes how he
once pushed Atkinson out of a dinghy when she complained he was
going too fast.
</P>
<P>
   In her diary, from which Chaplin quotes, Atkinson wrote: ``Two
acts of abusive, violent behavior in two weeks which I have
accepted. I am very ashamed I haven't jumped ship, but I really
want to do this trip and if that's the trade-off, I'll accept it.
Another instance of cruelty will be the last. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   How fearful was Atkinson of Chaplin? And to what extent did
their quarreling over safety precautions reflect deeper conflicts
that may have played a role in Atkinson's death?
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin considers the questions carefully. ``She was very pissed
off about it,'' he finally answers. ``I never thought our
relationship was in jeopardy. But I saw it'' _ the pushing incident
_ ``completely differently. There was no danger where we were. I
saw it as horsing around. Obviously she didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   As to why include the scene, Chaplin replies, ``Because it
happened, that's why. There were editors and agents who invited me
to take that out, I'm sure because they thought I was going to lose
readers. And maybe I did. But I believe the best memoirs are the
ones that tell everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Wind'' is a darkly confessional tale, even without
Atkinson around to rebut Chaplin's version of events.
</P>
<P>
   In Belize, the couple returned to a port where Chaplin had once
had a fling with a female scuba diving instructor _ and lied about
it to Atkinson, who unearthed the truth anyway. Chaplin
subsequently returned to the United States for two weeks. Rejoining
Atkinson in Panama, he was told by her that she had slept with
another man while Chaplin was away. Later she confessed that the
sex was not consensual.
</P>
<P>
   The rape would have a profound impact on both of them, according
to Chaplin. Insisting they set sail across the Pacific immediately,
Atkinson seemed to harden in her fears about traveling with
Chaplin. A comically inept confrontation with the rapist only
seemed to worsen matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd lost faith in myself,'' writes Chaplin, ``as a man as well
as a sailor.'' Their lovemaking, which he previously described in
rhapsodic terms, all but ceased. Now, he writes, ``she needed to
make the voyage more than I did. . . . In some mysterious way she'd
gained confidence while I'd lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   With this as backdrop, Chaplin and Atkinson finally sailed into
Wotho atoll on Nov. 9, 1992. For 10 days they frolicked in a kind
of earthly paradise. And then along came Typhoon Gay, far more
potent than weather forecasters in the region had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm intensified, writes Chaplin, a strange feeling of
passivity settled over Atkinson and himself. ``We both seemed slow,
in movement and thought,'' he describes it in the book, ``as if we
were in a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect Chaplin defends some, though by no means all, of
the decisions preceding Atkinson's death. Sailing to the Marshall
Islands during the tail end of typhoon season was not imprudent, he
argues. Trying to outsail the storm was not a clear-cut option
either. Other choices such as not swimming for shore during the
storm, or Chaplin's electing to hold on to his own life jacket
while Atkinson slipped away, are less defensible, he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had asked _ she did not ask to go ashore. I did not
tell her to go ashore, either,'' he says, adding that he would have
never kept her from going. ``The question is, why didn't I make her
go ashore. And the only thing I can say is, because. Because I
didn't make her go ashore. That's why.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected in the storm things would be very clear,'' Chaplin
says. ``But they were not clear. The wind was unlike anything I'd
experienced before. Even when the boat blew over, I thought the two
anchors would snag. It never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Chaplin, there was also no reason to anticipate
that the valve on his life vest would malfunction, or that
harnesses on both vests would come apart in the pounding surf.
</P>
<P>
   Could he have saved Atkinson anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin nods slowly. ``It's a realistic possibility if I had
gotten to her,'' he says, ``I could have held Susan up until we
reached shore _ even though I had no idea where shore was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had the feeling she was gone, you know. I thought Susan
was gone.'' Chaplin looks away. ``I hoped she could make it, but I
was almost positive she couldn't. And I was sure I was drowning
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin writes of coming home to face Atkinson's family _ and
finding if not forgiveness, at least some measure of sympathy and
understanding. Later, he recounts his struggle with depression _ to
the point of contemplating suicide _ and of suffering rejection by
his own sister, his only sibling. The two have not spoken since,
says Chaplin, who blames the rupture on dysfunctional family
dynamics, not Atkinson's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Wind'' ends on an appropriately uneasy note. Addressing
Atkinson's survivors directly, Chaplin writes that he did his best
on a story he felt compelled to tell. ``This may ring hollow,
coming from someone whose best was not good enough,'' writes
Chaplin, adding, ``still, I had to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding in his hands the statement composed by Atkinson's
daughters, Chaplin shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally floored by this,'' he says as he absorbs the
latest aftershock from the storm that took one life and changed
numerous others. ``If they had told me categorically that they
hated the idea of my doing this book, I'm not sure that I would
have gone ahead and written it.''

A PARENT'S GUIDE TO TV RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There wasn't much fanfare to mark it, but July 1 was a landmark
date for parents: the first time we can walk into a store and buy a
televi-sion set with the much-touted V-chip. Unfortunately, just
because we finally can protect our children from violence on TV
doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet.
</P>
<P>
   The same parent who cares enough to buy a TV with technology
capable of blocking violent programming is probably also the parent
who pays attention to the movies his children see, the computer and
video games they play, and the CDs they listen to.
</P>
<P>
   And how is that parent rewarded? With rating systems that have
little in common, are difficult to understand, and ignore
children's developmental stages, the most important guideline a
parent has. Indeed, to make ratings work in a child's best
interests is time-consuming and confusing; no wonder many of us
give up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers urge us to make the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still isn't easy or simple but at least the V-chip and the
ratings combine to give us tools we didn't have before,'' says
Joanne Cantor, a professor at the University of Wisconsin and one
of the nation's leading TV researchers. She's also a mother who is
vigilant about what her 9-year-old son watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of my efforts as a kind of health insurance for
Alex,'' she says. ``Bad viewing habits are just as bad for kids as
too much junk food.'' Cantor also is the author of `` `Mommy, I'm
Scared': How TV and Movies Frighten Children and What We Can Do to
Protect Them'' (Harcourt Brace, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Here then is a rundown on the rating systems for various media,
as well as the major pitfalls of each one:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOVIES
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The system:
</P>
<P>
   G: general audience, all ages admitted;
</P>
<P>
   PG: parental guidance suggested; some material may not be
suitable for children;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13: parents strongly cautioned for children under 13;
</P>
<P>
   R: restricted; under 17 requires adult chaperone;
</P>
<P>
   NC-17: no one under 17 admitted.
</P>
<P>
   What to be aware of:
</P>
<P>
   --Movie ratings ignore developmental differences. Although they
divide children chronologically into three groups _ 0 to 13, 13 to
17, over 17 _ there is no allowance for the huge differences among
preteens and no help at all with children under 7. In other words,
the PG-13 movie that one 11-year-old can tolerate may cause
nightmares for her best friend, the PG movie that an 8-year-old can
handle may be overwhelming for a 6-year-old, and nothing about the
ratings gives you clues to this beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqui Sears, a mother in Southampton, experienced several years
ago how meaningless ratings can be when she took the G rating on
the ``Beauty and the Beast'' video at face value. Her daughter,
then 3, was so badly frightened by the scene where the dogs chase
Belle that she continues to have bad dreams about it, even five
years later. Sears formed MOM (Mothers Offended by the Media) and
has been lobbying the ratings board of the Motion Picture
Association of America ever since, trying to get it to adopt a G-6
rating to indicate a movie is inappropriate for under 7.
</P>
<P>
   Educators agree 7 is a critical age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger children typically aren't yet able to distinguish
between what's real and what's not,'' says early childhood educator
Diane Levin of Wheelock College.
</P>
<P>
   Children under 7 also are only able to take in the most obvious
feature of what's on the screen. All too frequently, that's what is
violent or grotesque, says Bobbie Eisenstock, a professor of
communication at California State University who specializes in the
psychological effects of media on children. ``They then become
frightened because they are cognitively unable to handle the
material,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   --Toy tie-ins to movies mislead children and some parents to
think a movie is for them. In addition, the toy typically
capitalizes on the grotesque or violent aspect of the movie that
probably earned it the PG-13 rating in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   A current summer movie release, ``Mummy,'' for instance, is
rated PG-13 but has toys marketed for 4-year-olds who are not yet
developmentally capable of understanding how the body works: A
4-year-old typically wants a bandage because he worries his body
will ooze out; when he has a broken arm he doesn't
compartmentalize, ``My arm is broken,'' he thinks, ``I am broken.''
Yet one ``Mummy'' action figure is the ``Impaled Mummy with
piercing action: Impale the mummy, watch as his intestines fall out
of his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin finds this appalling: ``The toy feeds into a child's
vulnerability by taking a developmental issue he's trying to
understand and making it scary and complicated.'' She urges parents
to be wary of all movie tie-in toys and to bear in mind that most
toy ratings are based on how safe they are for a young child, not
on a child's cognitive ability to handle the toy or whether the toy
offers good play potential for a child that age. Levin is
nationally recognized for her research on the impact of media
violence on children and is author of ``Remote Control Childhood?
Combating the Hazards of Media Culture'' (NAEYC Press).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The system:
</P>
<P>
   TV-Y: programming specifically made for young children of all
ages;
</P>
<P>
   TV-Y7: made for children 7 or older;
</P>
<P>
   TV-Y7-FV: contains fantasy violence intended for children 7 or
older;
</P>
<P>
   TV-G: made for general audiences;
</P>
<P>
   TV-PG: for general audiences, but contains mild to moderate
violence, sex, crude language, or sexual dialogue; parental
guidance suggested;
</P>
<P>
   TV-14: contains moderate to intense violence, sex, language, or
sexual dialogue; parents strongly cautioned against viewing by
children under 14;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MA: not suitable for children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   V (violence), S (sexual situations), L (crude langauge), or D
(dialogue about sex) may accompany a TV-PG or TV-14 rating so it
looks like this: TV-14-SL. This ups the ante on the rating. TV-14
already means there's some sex, violence, etc. SL tells you that
the sex and language are even more intense than usual.
</P>
<P>
   What to be aware of:
</P>
<P>
   --Ratings are not used universally or always easy to find. BET
(Black Entertainment Television) does not rate programs at all; NBC
does not add the content descriptors. Some newspapers, including
the Globe, print content ratings; some do not. When the rating is
shown, it's displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the screen
for the first 15 seconds of the show. ``If you aren't there to see
it, you've missed it,'' says Kathryn Montgomery, president of the
Center for Media Education, a public interest group based in
Washington, D.C. She urges parents to ask stations to flash the
rating now and then during a program.
</P>
<P>
   --You can't trust ratings to be complete. TV-G never has content
ratings, so even if there is mild violence, etc., there's no
warning. TV-PG by definition includes mild to moderate violence,
sex, bad language or sexual dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents don't realize that,'' says Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstock says this is a particular problem with TV-PG because
the contents can vary so much from show to show. ``One TV-PG may
not be a problem but another one is,'' she says.

EQUAL RIGHT TO BARE ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't anything men playing soccer don't do all the time.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you've seen the shot on television, in the Sunday paper,
adorning the covers of Newsweek and Sports Illustrated: defender
Brandi Chastain shirtless, in a sports bra, celebrating her winning
penalty kick against China, triceps rippling, sweat pouring off her
exhausted body from which she had ripped her jersey moments before.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of thing previously reserved for male sports
heroes, often prone to acts of partial disrobement at the height of
battle. It was something Dennis Rodman would do, or Latrell
Sprewell. It was a moment of true equality, the right of both sexes
to celebrate victory unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A moment of temporary insanity'' was the way Chastain
described her World Cup moment after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was convinced it was purely spontaneous. After all,
this is a woman who has posed in the buff (crouching behind a
soccer ball) for Gear magazine and a Nike ad, and whose teammates
nicknamed her ``Hollywood'' for her flamboyant personality. It
seemed in character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my body,'' she said a few weeks ago. ``I have
bigger biceps and shoulders than my dad. I'm not going to hide
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who cares why she did it? She captured the emotion
of the moment. She gave almost everyone with abdominal muscles
something to aspire to. She looked strong and sexy _ and any man
who tells you he didn't notice it thinks you're an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, pulling up your jersey to celebrate a goal is common
both in men's soccer and, increasingly, in women's soccer. It's
like spiking a football after a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Women's World Cup prompted a predictable,
politically correct debate over whether ``sexuality'' was being
used to sell the event, sullying its pristine perfection as a
stairway to heaven for suburban teenage girls arriving at soccer
games with their faces painted red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that there was less exposed flesh than you could see
this weekend at Singing Beach, or even at the finish line of the
Boston Marathon. But, it was enough to make some people uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, there was howling that Chastain's move was a
marketing ploy for the ubiquitous Nike, which she represents. Or
that it was in some other way calculated as an act of
self-promotion. (Nike officials admit to salivating when they
realized the bra was one of their ``Inner Actives,'' due to hit
stores later this month.)
</P>
<P>
   For Chastain, the goal was the culmination of a tournament in
which she had most attracted attention for kicking a ball into her
own net in a quarterfinal match against West Germany. She courted
disaster by firing a pass for goaltender Briana Scurry past her and
into the US net. She later scored the tying goal in the game, which
the right side won, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the historic appeal of the team, especially to
girls, the sexual subtext was ever present, as it always is in
sports. David Letterman led the way, displaying a picture of the
team in long T-shirts, and apparently nothing else, for most of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine did its part by naming superstar Mia Hamm one of
the 50 most beautiful people in the world. Julie Foudy posed for
Sports Illustrated in a bikini, playing soccer on a beach with her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   All along, there were some naysayers, even among the athletes
themselves. ``I am a bit uncomfortable with Brandi's deal,''
midfielder Michelle Akers told the New York Times after Chastain's
spread in Gear appeared. ``You don't want something like that to
detract from the excellence of this team and the message that we're
striving to put out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But sports and sex appeal have always been linked
and always will be. How many of Michael Jordan's fans were as drawn
to his physique as his basketball? Why do so many men cheer for
tennis player Anna Kournikova? And why did one of my friend's
girlfriend borrow his binoculars at Fenway only between innings in
the 1980s? (So she could leer at Dwight Evans' butt as he ran on
and off the field.)
</P>
<P>
   Title IX was passed a generation ago to bring parity to men's
and women's sports. Slowly it has. We found out Saturday just how
far down the road to equality men and women have come. All of a
sudden, we can all cheer the athletes, even as we ogle the bodies
underneath.

TECHNOLOGY'S CHANGING PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In about six or nine months, Lexmark is planning to bring to
market a new printer. What's remarkable about this printer is that
it has a chip in it that can publish Kodak-quality photographs
directly from a digital camera, in any size or shape you wish.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is plug the camera into the printer. If you
want a contact sheet, it'll do that. If you want to print out two
3x5s, it will do that. If you want one big picture on one sheet of
paper, it'll do that too.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you can print out digital photographs on any color
printer, but you have to go through a personal computer to do so.
That's easily done, once you get the hang of it, but it's daunting
for beginners and anything other than one picture per page is
equally daunting for experts. Since specialty paper sells for
anywhere from 80 cents to $1.20 per sheet, one picture per page is
cost ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   But these problems will soon disappear. And, probably, in two or
three years, the Lexmark printers with the smart chip for
``developing'' digital photographs will cost no more than the one
you can buy over the Internet today (which is to say $219). In
addition, the specialty paper will become a commodity and like
every other commodity see its price cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Once the price issue is moot, the larger issue of immediacy and
convenience takes over. Here the Lexmark printer wins, hands down.
It could not be more immediate. It couldn't be more convenient. No
more film, no more Photo-quick on your lunch hour; it's not even
close. Especially when you remember that the digital technology
will only get better, faster, and smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you turn these days, convergence is changing the
landscape. Five years ago, the notion that a company that
manufactures low-end printers could spell doom for the Eastman
Kodak Company would have seemed almost inconceivable. Kodak, after
all, is virtually synonymous with the business of photography. But
five years later, here we are.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of converging technologies is being felt in virtually
every business category. In New York, there's a fellow going around
Wall Street selling software that wakes up your computer, turns on
your printer, dials up your Internet service provider and builds
you a personalized newspaper. You tell it what you want (and from
which newspapers) and it goes out and gets it.
</P>
<P>
   You have your personalized op-ed page, your personalized sports
page, your personalized business section, your hometown metro
coverage, your national and international news, weather reports,
stock quotes, what have you.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hunting is done, the software informs your computer to
print it out in the order you wish to receive it. By the time you
roll out of bed, it's sitting there waiting for you, with
advertisements about products and services that you request. If you
don't want ads, then there are no ads.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea if this software actually works, but I suspect
that if it doesn't, someone out there will invent software very
much like it that will work just fine. And when that happens,
that's the end of your local newspaper as you know it. Because when
that happens, every newspaper will become your local newspaper. You
just have to decide which parts of which paper you want printed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, this newspaper competed with The Boston Herald
in the Boston media market. Today, The Boston Globe competes with
every newspaper on the Internet, including the newspaper company
that owns it, The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   This competitive set will only intensify as bandwidth and
Internet technologies advance. In five years, connection speeds to
the Internet will be 8 to 15 times faster than they are today.
Computers will be dirt cheap. Internet access will likely be
commodity priced at $10 per month and could well be free.
Organizations like AARP will bring millions of new users onto the
Web. And everybody who has information worth selling will be in the
``newspaper'' business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The task of navigating these waters at the Globe now falls to
Richard H. Gilman, who Monday replaced Benjamin Taylor as
publisher. The end of the Taylor era at the Globe was on some level
inevitable; new owners always move in to properties they purchase.
But on another level, Gilman's appointment marked the end of the
Boston Globe as a newspaper company and embarked it once and for
all on the uncharted waters of convergence.
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable is that the effects of converging technologies
are just beginning to be felt. The pace of change will only
accelerate. Gilman's task is to insure that The Boston Globe does
not go the way of Kodak. It's a tough task and one wishes him well.

BOSTON SURVIVES POSTWAR THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RESURRECTION DAY 
By Brendan DuBois 
Putnam, 389 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The stories appearing in today's Boston Globe have been
cleared by the U.S. Army under the provisions of the Martial Law
Declaration of 1962 and the National Emergency Declaration of
1963.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the state of American journalism, and the US at large,
in the what-if scenario spun by Brendan DuBois in his
post-apocalyptic thriller, ``Resurrection Day.'' What if the Cuban
missile crisis had boiled over into a catastrophic Soviet-US
nuclear war that wiped out half a dozen major American cities and
rendered the USSR a medieval wasteland?
</P>
<P>
   That's DuBois's premise, and in his grim, reeling post-war US of
1972, Boston _ one of the major American cities spared in the
attack _ is the main stage for an often entertaining but
hyperactive story. The Globe, realistically situated in Dorchester,
but with an Army censor on the staff imposing daily control on the
paper's contents, figures prominently in the overheated plot.
</P>
<P>
   The hero is a proverbially dogged reporter, Carl Landry, a
laconic Special Forces vet who was an adviser in Vietnam until the
'62 nuclear outbreak nipped that little misadventure in the bud.
Landry is called back from Indochina to serve in California. There
he resettles nuclear refugees and, more sinisterly, helps put down
mini-insurrections by Americans hostile to what looks curiously
like military rule, despite President Romney's lip service to
democratic values. John F. Kennedy, his family, and numerous
Washington-based politicians and officials perished in the bomb
blasts _ though graffiti nationwide eerily insist that ``He
Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry is rewarded for his military service with a job at the
Globe, where he sinks his teeth into a mundane-sounding but
increasingly mysterious East Boston murder story that he never
surrenders for the nearly 400 pages of DuBois's book. Despite dire
warnings from his editor and the censor, Landry pulls on the loose
strings of the suppressed story, which lead him toward the center
of a plot involving a resurgently predatory British Empire and a
homegrown revolution stewing in the bowels of depopulated Manhattan
and, of course, a pretty love interest (an ambitious ivory-skinned
reporter from The Times of London).
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Day'' has a lot to recommend it, especially a
level of hypothetical-historical detail that gives the better parts
of the novel a nightmarish authenticity. ``Orphie'' gangs of
rootless, hardened teens roam the night streets of Boston; food is
available but hardly plentiful; and the rundown city barely
functions as the country slowly, uncertainly decontaminates
lingering nuclear hotspots and haltingly rebuilds.
</P>
<P>
   And DuBois's evocation of an overarching US military, its long
reach extended through the brutal, fascistic Zed Force, generates
some scary action and an effectively cautionary message. He
knowledgeably takes our national penchant for violence and history
of atomic assaults and covert operations to their darkest
conclusion, a world so blighted by American power that US military
personnel are subject to arrest as war criminals in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But DuBois has difficulty sustaining our belief in the universe
he manufactures. The mechanics of his illusion-making can be
embarrassingly obtrusive. His dialogue, for example, often sounds
less like natural conversation than like stilted history lessons.
And his graceless and occasionally painfully cliched prose
trivializes the book's more serious intentions. Listen to Landry,
inspired by his lovely girlfriend Sandy to rediscover purpose in
his life and work: ``He remembered their special night together and
the energy that sparked something inside of him. . . . Sandy was
making him care again.'' True, that's as bad as it gets, but it
gets that way too often.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Landry himself: too decent, too clever, and,
finally, too almost comically heroic to be true. Suffice it to say
that he has a Houdini-like gift for escaping mortal danger and the
combined journalistic skills of Woodward and Bernstein. As much as
DuBois (a New Hampshire mystery novelist) appears to admire George
Orwell and Anthony Burgess, he finally sounds more like a fan of
Hollywood's ``Die Hard'' extravaganzas and their stylishly
blood-streaked, bullet-proof centerpiece, Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   For all its flaws, ``Resurrection Day'' is a fairly good read _
but I'll bet the movie, if there is one, will be far better.
Indeed, the novel reads as if DuBois himself made this same
discovery in the process of writing, and turned his attention from
crafting a book to imagining the weekend grosses of the screen
version.

WHEN BEETLES KNOCK ON THE DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am finding little black beetles in a wood door. What are
they and how can I get rid of them?
</P>
<P>
   AMY BUCKLAND, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. They could be powder post beetles or old house borers. Yep,
that is what they are called, and there are many kinds of each,
although powder post beetles generally attack only hardwoods. They
all tunnel in the wood, but you can usually see little holes where
they have entered. Mostly, they don't eat the wood, but extract the
starch from it, and they sure do tunnel!
</P>
<P>
   Your first step is to identify the bug; in most cases this is
done by an exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   But there are things you can do yourself, if you are willing to
take the time, and if the infestation is not severe. If the beetle
is the type that does not reinfest wood and you saw them outside
the door, there is nothing you have to do because they will not
return to the wood. You need an identification to determine if the
critters are nonreinfesters.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to come and go; sometimes you may have them and then
you don't. Your main concern is to make sure they don't go
elsewhere in the house.
</P>
<P>
   One treatment is to squirt bleach or paint thinner into the
holes, kill any escapees, and hope for the best. Insecticides to
use are borax-based products such as TIM-Bor or Bora-Care, and
pyrethrin/silica aerogel.
</P>
<P>
   Other methods are high heat (120 degrees) and an electrical
current in the wood. These can be expensive and so can fumigation;
they should be done if the infestation is severe, and it's a job
for an exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am regluing my kitchen chairs, but in one chair, the rung
doesn't come out so I can glue it. Is there any trick to separating
those rungs?
</P>
<P>
   FRANK McKINNON, Saugus, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really a trick, but what you ran into is a nail that is
driven into the leg that holds the rung and through the rung
itself. It's the only thing that is keeping the chair from
collapsing completely. You should be able to worry the rung out,
either bending or breaking the nail, which is not very big. This
was a common practice in building wood chairs with rungs. Once you
have the rung out, pull the nail. When you reglue, drive another
similar nail to complete the repair.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the hole is too big for the rung to glue properly, you
can decrease the size of the hole with Mr. Grip. This is a little
strip of aluminum perforated to look like a cheese grater; the
perforation holes retain small barbs that do the holding. Insert
one or more into the hole; usually you can fold one end-to-end and
stick it in. Then the rung will be tight when you push it in, but
you will still have to glue it. Mr. Grip is sold in hardware and
building supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I fished a fine old sideboard from a dump fire in Maine,
where I have a camp. It must date to the late 1800s or early 1900s.
I refinished it and it looks wonderful, except it needs hardware.
Where can I find old hardware appropriate for such an oak veneer
sideboard? I remember there was a shop in Boston that handled old
hardware, but I can't think of its name.
</P>
<P>
   LESTER PITCHER, Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. You may be thinking of Restoration Resources, a retail store
whose address is 31 Thayer St., Boston, MA 02118; telephone
617-542-3033.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of catalogs out there, too, where you might
find what you are looking for. Van Dykes' Restoration products is
one (800-843-3320). Renovator's Supply (800-659-2211) is another.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The wide floorboards in my 1800 house are really nice but the
nails tend to work themselves loose and pop up, causing a hazard to
walkers. I nail them back, but that only lasts a few months. How
can I keep them in place? The boards are random width rock maple.
</P>
<P>
   MARVIN KRIMS, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's a simple matter, really. The nail holes are too big,
after many years of expansion and contraction of the boards. There
are several cures, and since the boards are face-nailed (the nail
heads are showing), the fix is relatively easy. You have three
choices:
</P>
<P>
   --Buy hot-zinc-dipped galvanized box nails a size or two bigger
than the up-popping nails. Drive them in place of the old nails and
countersink. There is no need to fill the holes unless you really
want to. Such wide boards are rather informal anwyay. The handyman
used such nails to secure his wide pine boards 25 years ago, and
they are still holding strong. The galvanizing process makes the
nails hold well, and there are little barbs on the shafts that help
hold even better.
</P>
<P>
   --Pull the maverick nails and substitute solid brass screws of a
bigger size, countersink, and leave them, or fill the holes with
wood plugs.
</P>
<P>
   --Replace the old nails with screw nails, although this may not
be practical if you cannot find a screw nail bigger than the old
nail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Write him at the Boston Globe, Boston, Mass., 02107.)

   TAKE-BOS  
 CARNOUSTIE, Scotland: ... before adolescence?  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While he claims that he once dreamed of being a soccer star _
``I was thinking, `Ah, you can see me in the Bernabeau with Real
Madrid' '' _ golf has been Garcia's milieu since the gestation
stage. He would follow his mother around the pro shop in his
stroller as an infant. At age 2, he began swinging a duster like a
golf club. He started playing the game for real at age 3, and his
competitive career was launched at 6 when he would ask members who
made the mistake of wandering past him, ``You want to play three
holes for a Coke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He became the biggest Coke consumer in the province of
Castellon,'' says Marquina.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia got his first adult clubs at age 9, and his father was
his tutor, both concerning the game and the price it required.
Victor had been a professional caddie as a young adult. Forbidden
to swing clubs on the course, he had taught himself the game with a
jerry-rigged olive branch. He had worked his way up to this club
job, and he instilled that ethic in his son.
</P>
<P>
   By 12, Garcia was the club champion. By 13, he was a scratch
golfer. And at that point, he became the end product of a unique
assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Marquina, an international business liasion who had known the
family since he began taking lessons from Victor when Sergio was 5
or 6, recognized the prodigious potential and decided that it must
be properly nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, with Victor's and Consuelo's blessing, Marquina
set up what he calls Team Sergio. It seemingly left nothing about
Garcia the golfer _ and golfing commodity _ to chance.
</P>
<P>
   The team now numbers seven or eight people, by Marquina's
estimation. From the time Garcia was 13, he worked with an English
teacher whose curriculum included mock press conferences; judging
by many of his responses, he earned an A-plus in cliches. There was
a physical therapist to strengthen his back, generally the most
vulnerable part of a golfer's anatomy. He would run every day for
10-15 minutes to develop cardiovascular strength. The key was
elasticity, and that extended to the golf itself. Twice a month,
Garcia would play lefthanded to facilitate swing balance; he has
shot as low as 42 for nine holes from that side and Wednesday
played a lefty shot out of Carnoustie's rough.
</P>
<P>
   The dividends were immediate. Garcia won an estimated 70 amateur
events. At 15, he became the youngest European Amateur champion
ever, and later he added the British Amateur crown, both titles
earning him automatic entry into the British Open. But more
remarkable was his advanced placement work.
</P>
<P>
   Marquina already was brainstorming _ and scrambling _ in an
effort to hone Garcia's game on a grander scale. He approached
Garcia's father and said, ``Let's take Sergio to the US. It's a
different language, different courses. It will be good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor agreed, which left only one problem: How to get there?
</P>
<P>
   Marquina approached a friend who worked for an airline and tried
to cadge a couple of trans-Atlantic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be kidding,'' the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Marquina told him, ``He's going to be the greatest golfer in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline executive was sold and the tickets were donated.
Garcia went to Miami at age 14, entered a 16-and-under tournament,
and won it by 14 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing compared to Marquina's other avenue of
development. The best way for Garcia to prepare for life as a pro,
he figured, was to play as a pro. Some of his amateur victories
earned him exemptions to European Tour events. Marquina got him
into others by begging and cajoling tournament directors. In all,
Garcia played 28 Tour events as an amateur. He made the cut 21
times. At 14, he became the youngest player ever to make a European
Tour cut, in the Turespana Open. At 17, he won a local pro event,
the Catalonia Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, maybe when I was about 14, 15 years old, I
was a little nervous,'' says Garcia. ``But that helped me. That's
why I'm not afraid to be here. I've always said when I was an
amateur that I was playig all those many pro events because I
didn't want to be afraid now.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's not, because he was a veteran before he became a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been almost like a pro for the past few years,'' says
Vijay Singh. ``He's a good player who's going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But not necessarily cynical. If Marquina's grand game plan seems
manipulative on the surface, there are restraints. At his advisers'
insistence, Garcia will finish high school next year ``to get him
away from golf and keep him grounded,'' says Marquina. His
endorsement deals are limited to a pair, with Acushnet and Adidas,
``so he's not stretched too thin,'' says Marquina. ``The key for me
is for him to be comfortable, not to worry about having to make
money while he's standing over a putt.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why there's still a bit of the boy in the old
pro. When Marquina signed the Adidas deal, Garcia cared only about
two things: meeting fellow client Anna Kournikova and getting a
Real Madrid jersey. After he won the Irish Open, he immediately
demanded an appearance fee for next year _ a PlayStation and 10
video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a straightforward kid,'' says Marquina. ``What you see is
what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects to get much more, this composite of naivete and
savvy, though he realizes it won't always be a snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if I keep playing well, the expectations are going to
be high,'' says Garcia. ``I'd like you to be happy with me, but you
have to know sometimes that the sport is not as easy as it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he doesn't know any better. It only looks easy to
prodigies like Garcia. Oops, Sergio.

   BOMBING-PUERTO RICO (Washington) _ The Navy and the Marine Corps
launch a campaign to persuade President Clinton to permit
resumption of live-fire training on Puerto Rico's island of

<P>
   NIRELAND-PEACE (Belfast, Ireland) _ What was to have been the

</P>
<P>
   IRAN-PROTESTS (Islamshar, Iran) _ In a working-class suburb of

Sciolino.

governments. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-TELEVISED-WAR (Mokhra, India) _ India has fought three
larger wars with Pakistan, in 1947, 1965 and 1971, but the past two
months of fighting in the Himalayan land of Kashmir that lies
between the two countries have produced its first televised war. In
1971, less than 1 percent of Indian households had televisions.
Now, more than 30 percent of households own a television. By Celia
W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-NOSTALGIA (Moscow) _ A Moscow journal on Russians'
increasing nostalgia for the Soviet era. A patina of nostalgia, or
at least kitsch, has spread over that gray world of communal
apartments, chronic shortages, propaganda slogans, controlled
newspapers and political taboos. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)

here. China's prime minister has visited. The mayor will play host
to African leaders for a meeting on development and democracy.
Experts say the rapid internationalization of this city, 1,000
miles from the nearest seaport, is perhaps the highest profile
example of a larger trend: the increasing integration of the
nation's interior into the world economy. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>

Thursday called for immediate suspension of a vaccine against
rotavirus that is now recommended for all infants in this country.

   FASTER-COMPUTERS (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ A team of researchers
from Hewlett Packard Co. and the University of California at Los
Angeles have fashioned simple computing components no thicker than
a single molecule and are speaking openly about the possibility of
computers that are 100 billion times faster than today's fastest
personal computers. They envision a world in which supercomputing
power is so pervasive and inexpensive that it literally becomes an
integral part of of every man-made object. By John Markoff. With

   WARNER-BROTHERS (Undated) _ The co-chairmen of Warner Brothers,
Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel, the longest serving studio heads in

Festival was kicked off by events like the Starlight Parade.
Actually, make that the ``Portland General Electric/Solv Starlight

   Ibrahim Ferrer/``Buena Vista Social Club Presents Ibrahim
Ferrer'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch)
</P>
<P>
   Eliades Ochoa/``Sublime Illusion'' (Higher Octave/Virgin)
</P>
<P>
   Wim Wenders' marvelous documentary, ``Buena Vista Social Club,''
continues to spur interest in the forgotten Cuban musicians that
guitarist-producer Ry Cooder recorded three years ago. These albums
are every bit as good as the original project as they expand upon
the initial disc's gorgeous sound. Singer Ferrer, dubbed the
``Cuban Nat King Cole'' because of his supremely relaxed vocal
delivery, offers a beautiful set of ballads and big-band dance hall
numbers, infusing each song with extraordinary feeling and passion.
He may be age 72, but time has only enhanced his abilities. 3 1/2
stars
</P>
<P>
   Singer-guitarist Ochoa, likewise, has honed his talents through
years of hard work in Cuba, where he has been a major musical force
for decades. ``Sublime Illusion,'' featuring guest guitarists
Cooder and David Hidalgo plus Bay Area blues harpist Charlie
Musslewhite, is a stirring program of traditional Cuban music
highlighted by Ochoa's elegant singing and subtle mastery of a
custom instrument known as the tres-guitar. Fans of the film should
put both these albums on top of their shopping list. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Various/``Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram
Parsons'' (Almo Sounds)
</P>
<P>
   The goal of this highly recommended collection was to assemble
artists who were influenced by the late, great Parsons, whose work
with the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds and as a solo artist
paved the way for the country-rock explosion of the '70s. The
album, produced by Emmylou Harris and containing covers of Parsons
tunes by the likes of Lucinda Williams/David Crosby, Elvis Costello
and Chris Hillman/Steve Earle, plus Harris collaborating with the
Pretenders, Sheryl Crow and Beck, includes a second disc of the
original versions performed by Parsons. If you aren't familiar with
such gorgeous and poignant songs as ``She,'' ``A Song for You,''
``Sleepless Nights'' or ``Hickory Wind,'' this is the place to
start. Every track's a winner. 4 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lovano and Greg Osby/``Friendly Fire'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   This summit between two risk-taking sax players often misfires,
but has its share of inspired moments. Most of them come on the
standards _ the swinging connections made during Ornette Coleman's
``Broad Way Blues,'' the elegant lyricism in Thelonious Monk's
``Monk's Mood'' and Eric Dolphy's ``Serene,'' featuring Lovano's
debut on flute. The prolific Osby (usually playing alto) and Lovano
(tenor) bring improvisational fervor to a mostly cooking session. 2
1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp
</P>
<P>
   Tracie Spencer/``Tracie'' (Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   Working with the tip-top hip-hop production team of Soulshock
and Karlin, Spencer has crafted an album of mostly effective
pop-r&AMP;b jams and ballads. From the upbeat flavor of the hit single,
``It's All About You (Not About Me),'' to the late-night feel of
the sensual ``No Matter'' (one of seven tunes Spencer co-wrote
here), the album puts the accomplished pop diva in a slick,
contemporary setting that should appeal to fans of Brandy and
Monica. 2 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   London Suede/``Head Music'' (Nude/Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   London Suede helped define Britpop before Oasis splashed down.
But there's little chirpy about this moody, disaffected outfit. For
its fourth album, the quintet aimed for a hard-edged, spiky sound
with typically remote lyrical concerns. While at its very best on
the pop-rock ``Electricity'' and the funk-tinged ``Savoir Faire,''
London Suede may still have a hard time appealing to the U.S.
market. However, fans of cutting-edge Europop will warm to this
often cold, distant noise. 3 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Jones/``The Undiscovered Few'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist, composer and arranger Jones has worked with everyone
from Madonna to avant-garde saxophonist Arthur Blythe to Rosie
O'Donnell, with whose TV band he plays (but don't hold that against
him). Jones' fourth album as leader pairs him with an all-star
lineup on a program of hard-driving ensemble pieces and intimate
duets. Among the highlights: ``Tradewinds'' (which alludes to
George Benson's '70s sound), the meditative ``Dreamers in Love''
and the standard ``My Favorite Things,'' cleverly reworked by Jones
and pianist Mulgrew Miller. Jazz guitar fans will love this one. 3
stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   Jimi Hendrix/``Live at Woodstock'' (Experience Hendrix/MCA)
</P>
<P>
   Newly expanded, remixed and remastered, the double-disc
``Woodstock'' features 15 tracks, including 35 minutes of
previously unreleased music from the late guitarist's headlining
performance at the 1969 rock festival. Joined by future Band of
Gypsys bandmate Billy Cox on bass, Experience bandmate Mitch
Mitchell on drums, plus two conga players and a rhythm guitarist,
there are flashes of brilliance on display, but everyone was
obviously pretty burnt by the time Hendrix took the stage just
after 9 a.m. on the festival's final day. Still, dizzying workouts
like the seven-minute improvisation ``Jam Back at the House,'' the
smoking ``Red House'' and a lyrical ``Spanish Castle Magic'' make
this a must for Hendrix completists. And who isn't? 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   Soul II Soul/``Club Classics Vol. 1 _ 10th Anniversary Edition''
(Virgin)
</P>
<P>
   When the club and r&AMP;b worlds collided 10 years ago in the studio
of visionary producer-composer Jazzie B with Massive Attack's
Nellee Hooper, nobody guessed a new genre would result. The
adventurous grooves and melodies of Soul II Soul's finest moment
led directly to the trip-hop school of Tricky, Massive Attack and
Portishead. This anniversary edition of ``Club Classics Vol. 1''
boasts a handful of resonant rare mixes along with the influential
original hits _ including ``Keep on Movin''' and ``Back to Life.''
These decade-old jams sound fresh as anything. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   Luscious Jackson/``Electric Honey'' (Grand Royal/Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   Lilith Fair main stagers Luscious Jackson equals three ultra-hip
downtown ladies with friends in the right places. The well-scrubbed
grooves found on their new effort rarely inspire much excitement _
and by extension much dance floor action. Despite the slick r&AMP;b
backdrop and a cameo from Deborah Harry, ``Electric Honey'' falls
short of its title. 2 stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Jeff Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's marred by patches of obviousness, ``Arlington Road''
arrives in theaters with a sharp sense of timing. It's a variation
of Alfred Hitchcock's chilling 1943 film ``Shadow of a Doubt,''
hot-wired to a national nervous system that's already jolted by
heavily armed teenage commandos and Midwestern spree shooters. (SM)
1 hour, 57 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy
</P>
<P>
   Who Shagged Me'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers
</P>
<P>
   and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's fave dentally impaired British superspy, Mike
Myers goes back to the '60s to save his mojo from Dr. Evil and a
giant slob in a kilt (Myers and Myers, respectively). Shaggy but
still shagadelic, this worthy sequel also stars Heather Graham as a
curvy CIA operative, Seth Green as Dr. Evil's brooding son Scott
and Jerry Springer (don't ask). (SM)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest money-maker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair
</P>
<P>
   Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM) 1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Edge of Seventeen'' Not rated, but there are
</P>
<P>
   sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and adult themes.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   Not much cutting edge here, but this teen saga about coming out
and coming of age in 1984 small-town Ohio has a refreshingly
unforced tone and a really appealing young lead, Chris Stafford.
What works best here is the way Stafford doesn't just discover a
new sense of sexual orientation; he discovers a new sense of
himself as a whole. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' R (profanity, sexual content, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   drug-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often
frustrating peephole view at jealousy and sexual obsession that
confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece orgy doesn't
work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as performed by the
cast of ``Showgirls.'' (SM)
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. Somebody's got to
turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and disguised as an
A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is an over-directed,
overwritten and ultimately underwhelming whodunit B-grade thriller.
(Bob Longino) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett,
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam
</P>
<P>
   and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a blackmailer who knows a secret from his past. The
fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's literal-minded
approach. What remains is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. (ERG) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' R (intense violent behavior)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins
</P>
<P>
   and Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Resist your instinct to see it. Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins
plays an anthropologist locked up in a psychiatric prison
surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates. It seems that, after living for
months with gorillas in the African wilds, he went berserk and

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A follower of Hemingway in Paris
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Be careful what you let your daughter read. Otherwise
she might turn out like Noel Riley Fitch, devoting herself to the
bohemian lifestyle of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   If only she'd never read the Ladies Home Journal.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it started, in the mid-1960s when she was a graduate
student at Washington State University and her mother, ``concerned
that I was neglecting my domestic skills,'' sent her a copy of the
ladies magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Noel, however, skipping over items on the joys of housekeeping,
settled instead on an article by author Katherine Anne Porter, all
about the writers and artists who made Paris their home in the
1920s _ and made Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Co. bookstore their
second home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The description was so real, from the books on the shelves to
the fire in the fireplace,'' she said. ``It was where I wanted to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, she's been there ever since _ as a professor
and author, making the Paris life of Ernest Hemingway and others of
that era her life's work. A Ph.D. who has a striking resemblance to
Ann-Margaret, she divides her time between Los Angeles and Paris,
teaching at USC and the American University.
</P>
<P>
   I first had met her through her book, ``Sylvia Beach and the
Lost Generation,'' which is used as a text at the Sorbonne for a
course in American writers and artists of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   When I met her in person in Paris for an interview _ the
centennial of Hemingway's birth is July 21 _ it was at her favorite
cafe, Cafe Francois Coppe on the rue du Monparnasse, not a place
Papa had frequented.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Riley Fitch will tell you that ``no one had a better sense
of place that carried over into his passion for his art'' than did
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   But place is a matter of individual choice. So it is with cafes
in Paris, as much for her as it was for Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a cafe that is near your home, one that is convenient
to buses and Metro service,'' she said. ``This is my neighborhood.
This is my cafe.''
</P>
<P>
   The ones to avoid are those that have become famous. ``On the
menus, they may have printed, `Intellectuals meet here,' '' she
said, not so different from ``Rotary meets here.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you are looking for Hemingway's Paris, best that you look
for one of Noel Riley Fitch's guidebooks, ``Walks in Hemingway's
Paris'' and ``The Literary Cafes of Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   She particularly recommends the Deux-Magots, a literary cafe
since 1875, which Hemingway preferred for ``serious talks.'' It is
now much as it was then.
</P>
<P>
   Or visit the home where he and Hadley, his first wife, lived
when they moved to Paris in 1921, up the hill from the Sorbonne in
rue du Cardinal-Lemoine.
</P>
<P>
   You can read about it in the opening scene of Hemingway's
memoir, ``A Moveable Feast,'' or on the plaque on the building,
erected jointly by the Hemingway Society and the F. Scott
Fitzgerald Society.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the first Hemingway home that Noel Riley Fitch
was acquainted with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Idaho. My family camped out in the Sawtooth
Mountains. On the way, we would pass by Hemingway's house in
Ketchum. That was in the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to ask. ``But you never stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said, shaking her head, ``and he was probably at
home.''

HILLARY CAMPAIGN PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON PLIGHT OF TEACHING HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 18)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a boost from First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the plight of the nation's 400 teaching hospitals is
becoming a hot-button issue not only in her New York campaign for
the Senate but also in Congress as lawmakers debate the future of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In her ``listening tour'' of the Empire State, Clinton has heard
many complaints about how lawmakers' past cuts in Medicare are
starving the hospitals, which hone the skills of interns and
resident doctors in treating the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the beat, Clinton is calling the medical
college-affiliated hospitals the ``the crown jewels'' of the state
and saying that teaching hospitals everywhere ``are a particular
concern, and should be to a concern to everyone who cares about
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Such hospitals are all over the country. New York has 49, 28 of
them in New York City alone. California has 26, four of them in San
Francisco. Texas has 17.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of funding these hospitals is another early test of
how independent of her husband Mrs. Clinton intends to be. She has
already taken more liberal positions on gun control, health
insurance and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospital advocates point to the 1997 Balanced Budget
Act, agreed to by President Clinton and the Republican-controlled
Congress, as the main source of their troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates say that when the act stripped $71 billion in
federal reimbursements to all hospitals for treatment of Medicare
patients, teaching hospitals were hurt most because they have a
higher percentage of poor and seriously ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton's proposal to overhaul Medicare last month would do
little to pump new financial blood into teaching hospitals, these
advocates say. But Hillary Clinton has given them hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased she chose to speak out on this issue,''
said Dr. Jordan Cohen, president of the Association of American
Medical Colleges (AAMC). ``Clearly this is an opportunity for the
country to hear a prominent voice, someone who people can
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over teaching hospitals comes at a time of great
uncertainty over Medicare, the 34-year-old medical insurance
program for the elderly that serves about 39 million people. With
the 70-million-member baby boom generation set to begin retiring in
the next decade or so, the system's trustees predict Medicare will
lack sufficient funds to pay all its bills starting in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   As originally conceived by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Medicare
was a pay-as-you-go medical insurance plan as well as an
entitlement that, like its sister, Social Security, would in time
lift many senior citizens out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 18 years of its existence Medicare was a boon to
teaching hospitals, which have costs that regular hospitals don't
incur. Besides instructing young doctors and absorbing the costs of
treating sicker and poorer patients, they must pay for
state-of-the-art medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   So teaching hospitals built a portion of these costs into the
bills they sent to Medicare for treating elderly patients. And
through a complicated formula, the federal government paid them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teaching hospitals argued that training interns and
residents is part of their operating costs, that it's good for
society _ and Congress agreed,'' said Stuart Guterman, a Medicare
expert at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   But as the cost of Medicare skyrocketed through the 1970s and
into the 1980s, Congress looked for ways to economize. In 1983 it
came up with the prospective payment system _ PPS _ whereby
Medicare would pay hospitals a set amount up front for treating
each Medicare patient.
</P>
<P>
   If the hospital's cost per patient was less, then it made money.
If not, the hospital ate the loss.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress also set up a plan to reimburse teaching hospitals
for their special tasks of training doctors and caring for the very
sick and the indigent.
</P>
<P>
   As competition for patients among hospitals stiffened with the
advent of cost-conscious managed care health plans in the early
1990s, the added payments were a lifesaver to teaching hospitals.
In 1997, these payments totaled $9 billion, according to Guterman.
</P>
<P>
   But in forging the 1997 budget agreement, lawmakers were looking
for ways to drastically reduce federal spending, and Medicare
proved a ripe target. In an effort to slow the growth of Medicare
spending, Congress cut into the subsidies provided to teaching
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Such funds are slated to decline by 28 percent through 2002,
according to Cohen of the AAMC.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts took effect last year, and Cohen says their impact is
devastating. According to a study for the American Hospital
Association survey, 61 percent of the nation's 5,000 hospitals
(teaching and non-teaching alike) now are paying more for Medicare
patients than they are receiving from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the Association of American Medical
Colleges estimates that 40 percent of the nation's teaching
hospitals will be losing money by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Some Capitol Hill lawmakers are skeptical of the medical
profession's cries of woe. Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif., chairman
of the House Ways and Means subcommittee that oversees Medicare,
says the subsidies should be funded elsewhere in the federal budget
_ where they can scrutinized year by year. Or if they are dropped,
he says, the hospitals should compensate for their loss through
fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen insists teaching hospitals are too stretched already
and can be saved only by a recalculation of reimbursement formulas.
``The view that these institutions could absorb cuts is
unfortunate, because our data suggests the opposite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical college association opened a lobbying effort in
April to persuade Congress to change the Medicare formulas so that
some of the money would flow back to teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has introduced legislation to
block further cuts and to levy fees on health insurance premiums
that would go into a graduate medical education trust fund that
teaching hospitals could draw on.

EVERY HIKE SHOULD START WITH THE RIGHT TRAIL MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It doesn't matter if you're taking a day hike,
climbing one of the High Peaks or setting off on a considerably
longer journey. Packing the right trail snacks is as important as
choosing proper footwear.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jay ``Diz'' Dizacomo, a licensed New York state guide
from Latham who, when he's not overseeing white water rafting
trips, likes to head for the Appalachian Trail. He has thus far
hiked 1,800 of the historic 2,160-mile trail, from Springer
Mountain, Ga., to Rutland, Vt., and says he might complete the
final stretch later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ate snacks the entire time I was on the trail,'' said Diz,
who advocates eating early and often when hiking. ``You're going to
be burning a lot of calories when you're out there, and you want to
replenish those calories. You don't want to deplete yourself
water-wise or calorie-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   The best trail snacks, according to Diz, are dried fruit. He has
actually built a dehydrator and prepares his own dried fruit,
eschewing the sugar-laden dried fruit found in most supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   But it's easy enough to buy unsweetened dried banana and
pineapple and other fruits. Most natural food stores and food
co-ops routinely stock these.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no backpack is complete without trail mix, usually
referred to as gorp. A combination of nuts, dried fruit, raisins
and chocolate, gorp is as personal as homemade barbecue sauce. Diz,
for instance, prefers to use M&AMP;Ms and Goldfish crackers. Others
won't set out for even a short walk without including sunflower
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you make a trail mix, the more you fine-tune it,'' he
explained. ``There is no right or wrong trail mix. Everyone has
their own variation, and a lot of times it depends on what you have
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power bars and those types of things are good to pack
separately, but Fig Newtons are not too far away from the more
expensive energy bars,'' Diz said. ``You can spend a lot on the
energy bars or you can get a nutritious cookie like a Fig Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to stay away from things that will melt or get
sticky. You can bring a few candy bars but don't make them a big
staple. If you do bring candy bars, bag them separately in case
they do melt.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Rivezzi and David Trithart, authors of ``Kids on the Trail!
Hiking with Children in the Adirondacks'' (Adirondack Mountain
Club, 1997), recommend packing foods that will satisfy the
children's hunger and they will like.
</P>
<P>
   And if the kids get cranky, they offer a ``miracle'' cure: ``Our
all-time favorite motivator is the `power pill,' a piece of candy
for times when energy runs low. `It looks like we need some energy,
power pills are coming out at the next big rock.' Off they go to
await the treat. Candy should not be used to alleviate hunger, but
as that little extra we all love.''

NEW EVIDENCE THAT SIZE DOESN'T MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dean Falk's research has put an age-old gender
debate to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Size, she has concluded, doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent issue of the Journal of Human Evolution, she
outlined her findings that men's brains are larger on average than
women's, but that the discrepancy has no bearing on general
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   For Falk, a world-renowned paleoanthropologist, the discovery
meant overcoming politically correct views in her field that kept
the issue on the academic sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is well motivated,'' she said. ``People have misused
data on sex and race to form prejudices. But I'm interested in
knowing the truth. If I want to know something, I go after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk's research grew out of a 1996 graduate seminar at the State
University of New York at Albany. One of her students, Nicholee
Froese, wanted to delve into the hotly contested area of brain size
differences between the sexes. Science showed that on average,
men's brains are 10 percent larger than women's. The consensus was
that this was due to men's generally larger body size.
</P>
<P>
   But what if men and women were the same size? Would their brains
be the same size, too? Scientific opinion was split.
</P>
<P>
   To Falk's surprise, Froese discovered that even when controlled
for body size, men's brains are larger by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I recovered, I wanted to know why,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of rhesus monkeys found similar results, suggesting
that whatever accounted for male's larger brains was not a trait
unique to humans _ like reasoning, intellectual curiosity or
well-developed language.
</P>
<P>
   From rhesus monkeys, she turned to small rodents. An earlier
study showed that polygamous male voles performed better in mazes
than their female counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But in gibbon societies, where the males are monogamous and the
females are roughly the same size, there is no difference in the
weight of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Putting all of these factors _ brain size, gender, and polygamy
_ together, Falk arrived at an intriguing hypothesis: The larger
size of the male brain stemmed from the ancient necessity of
propagating the species; males needed bigger brains in order to
wander to different mates. From philandering rodents, she
speculates, arose the ability for men to score higher on the
spacial-visual portions of IQ tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression of that other species I sometimes drive to work
with is that they don't have to ask for directions,'' Falk said.
``Men have an intuitive sense of where they're going. I want to
know I have to go up 3 blocks, stop at the stoplight, make a left
and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she acknowledges that spatial relations play a role in
intelligence, she balks at the idea that a bigger brain makes men
smarter. Intelligence entails a whole range of factors including
verbal and written skills, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent conference in Salt Lake City, Falk dramatically made
her point with two slides. The first showed an early computer _ one
of the huge, lumbering machines that could occupy an entire room.
The other was a sleek, modern-day laptop underneath a woman's foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do heavy-duty computing, which would you
rather use?'' she asked the audience.

FINDINGS RAISE RUCKUS OVER HUMAN ORIGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Missouri, Ohio; note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Using modern medical techniques to re-construct
ancient fossils, a researcher has made a discovery she claims will
dramatically alter the way science views human evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The long-accepted theory is that the genus homo appeared roughly
two million years ago in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Falk, a paleoanthropologist at the State University of New
York at Albany, has rattled the bones of controversy with her
findings that homo _ including home sapiens, the scientific name
for modern human beings _ may have stemmed directly from an early
ancestor, Australopithecus africanus.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, the tiny australopithecines were already
showing human traits in their chimp-sized brains and evolved slowly
into homo over the course of three million years.
</P>
<P>
   If proven, Falk's theories would also deal a blow to ``Lucy,''
the 3-million-year-old pre-human fossil that was hailed as the
mother of humankind following its discovery in Ethiopia in 1974. In
the revisionist view, Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis) becomes an
evolutionary dead-end.
</P>
<P>
   The findings put Falk in the middle of one of the most heated
pursuits of the 20th century: the search for humankind's ancestors.
The so-called ``missing link'' between humans and the apes ranks
with splitting the atom as one of the great prizes of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field of paleoanthropology is notoriously contentious,''
said P.V. Tobias, a retired professor at Witwatersrand Medical
School in Johannesburg, South Africa, one of the world's leading
authorities on prehuman fossils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel threatened by studies that impinge on our own,'' he
said. ``When it comes to those that are close to humans, and
particularly the minds of such specimens, I think there is a
tendency for scientists to have an enormous emotional investment in
their findings.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, scholarship can turn ugly.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent conference in Columbus, Ohio, where Falk outlined
her findings, a rival anthropologist ended a talk critical of her
work by showing two slides: One was a milkmaid pouring milk; the
other showed a witch dripping poison into an upside-down skull. The
professor then asked the audience which one they trusted. To many
present, he seemed to be asking, ``Which one is Dean Falk?''
</P>
<P>
   She and a team of six co-authors are trying to have a lengthy
article on their findings published in the Journal of Human
Evolution. ``I have never in my years encountered so much
resistance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, 55, is best known as the author of the 1992
``Braindance,'' a popular treatment of her ``radiator'' theory of
brain evolution. She contends that the brains of our ancestors grew
as they began to stand erect and develop cranial veins that cooled
the brain. Those blood vessels control brain temperature much in
the same way a radiator cools a car engine, allowing for higher
cognitive functions.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The current debate began last summer, when she was asked by the
journal Science to comment on a paper by Glen Conroy, a professor
of anthropology at the Washington University School of Medicine in
St. Louis. Using a CAT scanner, Conroy made 3-D images of the skull
capacity of a 2.8-million-year-old hominid.
</P>
<P>
   The results were troubling. The skull was one of the largest
examples of Australopithecus africanus in existence; yet its brain
size was less than other specimens with much smaller skulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got me thinking that many of the brain reconstructions,
which were mostly done in the 1970s without the benefit of recent
finds and better technology, were wrong,'' Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, he and Falk have been re-measuring the brains
of a host of the most precious ancient fossils. Falk and
SUNY-Albany graduate student John Guyer use brain endocasts made of
plaster and silicon; Conroy makes sophisticated virtual images
generated by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings are twofold. First, they claim that
Australopithecus robustus, long thought to be an evolutionary
cousin to homo, has a small brain _ similar in size to africanus.
But there the similarities end. While the robust brains were pointy
and beak-shaped like those of modern apes, Falk believes the
africanus samples show the early signs of human brain features such
as those used for abstract planning and naming.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the robust and africanus brains were so
stark, Falk said, that a group of bystanders in her building were
able to correctly separate a dozen specimens into two distinct
piles.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the findings raised eyebrows among anthropologists
who question whether human traits can be found in a fossil so old.
They also complain about the limited number of africanus samples
and the incompleteness of those that do exist in museum and
university collections around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the most vociferous critic is the one who made
some of the original measurements Falk and Conroy are challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted at some of the calculations,'' said Ralph
Holloway of Columbia University. ``They were much less than what I
had come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway felt attacked by Falk for comments she made to The New
York Times attributing the earlier measurements to ``unconscious
bias on the part of various investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication seems to be that I artificially inflated the
numbers to make them look closer to human beings,'' he said. He
unabashedly owned up to making the offending slide presentation in
at the conference in Columbus, claiming that Falk had
misrepresented his work.
</P>
<P>
   Others traced it to their professional rivalry. ``This is a
long-standing clash of arms between two very fine scholars,''
Tobias said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias said he is ``overjoyed'' at new evidence linking
africanus to humans _ other factors being their canine teeth and
use of stone tools.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Falk eagerly awaits the publication of her research,
funded with a $20,000 grant from the National Science Foundation.
It will undoubtedly be met with a fresh wave of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole field has been controversial for most of the
century,'' Holloway said. ``Thank goodness. It's given us all
jobs.''

FOG HORNS PLAY A SYMPHONY BY THE BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HAL WESTON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sailors once listened intently to the basso
chorus of the San Francisco Bay's fog horns to find their way.
Today, with global positioning satellite systems (GPS) on board,
mariners look at blips on a screen to find their precise location
on a shifting sea.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us on shore listen to the fog horns for the echoes of
San Francisco's past, sonic ghosts we perceive only when all is
obscured. Once there were 91 fog horns in the Bay; now only 31
remain, of which 18 are in or near San Francisco. Fog horns on land
and bridges, and bells and clappers on buoys make the racket of the
Bay. These aids to navigation help ships find their way through
channels and around rocks, bridges and the shore.
</P>
<P>
   There are two horns on Alcatraz, ``The Rock'' (one on the north
side and one on the south), two on the Golden Gate Bridge (at
mid-span and on the south tower), several on the Oakland Bay Bridge
towers and one at Point Bonita, at the Bay's entrance. Other
navigation aids include lights on shore (such as lighthouses) and
on buoys, and radar reflecting buoys, called RACON, that identify
themselves on a ship's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   The big ships rely on GPS and radar in bad weather, but still
use fog horns and other reliable old aids as backup, says Pete
Sturges, a former second officer in the merchant marine and now a
lawyer in San Francisco. If the electronic navigation system goes
out, the captain will stop the ship and the watchman will ``get out
on deck and identify all the fog horns and ship's whistles you can
hear _ right away,'' he said. Smaller ships without sophisticated
navigation equipment are more dependent on the horns and lights.
</P>
<P>
   The old horns were diaphones, which made two tones _ a long
sound followed by a sort of grunt that could be heard five to 12
miles away, according to Colin McKenzie of the Nautical Research
Center in Petaluma. The horn on the Golden Gate Bridge at midspan
is one of the remaining diaphones.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the horns now are electronic and have one pitch that
travels only about a mile.
</P>
<P>
   For sailors, the horns are aids. But for those of us on land,
the horns can be a sort of music _ an orderly cacophony at night,
sounding most raucously at 4 in the morning when the fog settles
around the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Each horn enters when the downbeat of the fog triggers its
sensor; each horn repeats its slow, bleeping canon until the fog
lifts. The horns around the San Francisco shore usually wail until
sunrise, like exhausted late-night blues players. Those on the
Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz may moan in the mist, day and
night, during the foggy season.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard's light list shows the location of navigation
aids, including the horns, with the pattern of sound and silence
for each horn. For example, the horn on the south tower of the
Golden Gate Bridge has a 2-second blast followed by 18 seconds of
silence.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pitches of the horns, no one seems to know the score.
No one at the Maritime Library nor McKenzie knew the pitches. The
San Francisco Almanac lists a few, and R. Wiley Evans, a local
composer, identified some for a piece he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard doesn't list any because the Coast Guard doesn't
know. (Perhaps it's time to call in the Marines; their band plays
at the White House.) The old diaphones were mostly in the keys of F
and C. Music students will recognize this as tonic and dominant.
Probably a coincidence, but a nice touch: As the dominant resolves
to the tonic at the end of a phrase, so did the sounds of the horns
end a journey.
</P>
<P>
   The horns today don't seem to have any such tonal relationship,
which may reflect our modern society. A, G and C seem the most
prevalent _ a harmonic relationship (an A minor seventh) that
doesn't settle anything. The pitches may vary a little depending on
where you're standing and the way the fog is blowing. In all, it's
a band that can't toot straight. The most interesting fog horn is
Alcatraz South, which sounds like an Andrew Lloyd Webber chord.
You'll hear it as a C but it's probably an A minor chord in the
first inversion.

FREEZE HERBS TO PRESERVE FRESHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STEVENS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How do I preserve fresh herbs if I don't have a dehydrator?
Is there another way to dry them? Can I freeze them? I can't use
the pound of cilantro I've gotten out of my garden all at once!
</P>
<P>
   A: All herbs taste best fresh, but when the garden yields a
substantial bounty, freezing is the quickest way to preserve them.
Freeze the cleaned herbs whole, in freezer bags, making sure to get
as much air out of the bag as possible. Freezing is especially good
for basil, recommends the ``The Visual Food Encyclopedia,'' because
the herb loses a lot of its taste when dried.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is spinach a good source of calcium?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although food tables show that a cup of cooked spinach has
almost as much calcium as a cup of milk, the calcium isn't
available in a form our bodies can absorb. The percentage of a
nutrient that is absorbed from the food is known as its
bioavailability, says Dr. Paul Nakata, a plant physiologist at the
USDA's Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of
Medicine. Humans only absorb 5 percent, or 12 out of 244
milligrams, of the calcium present in one cup of cooked spinach. On
the other hand, about 100 of the 300 milligrams present in milk is
absorbed. Although bioavailability varies from food to food and
nutrient to nutrient, this isn't something consumers should worry
about if they're eating a healthy diet, Nakata says.
</P>
<P>
   The dietary recommendations set for nutrients, such as calcium,
have taken bioavailability into consideration and also have a
considerable margin of safety built in.

CITY QUESTIONS POSSIBLE SALE OF SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A committee of the Board of Supervisors wants to
find out how the city can help preserve San Francisco's two daily
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to protect the free flow of ideas,'' said Board of
Supervisors President Tom Ammiano. ``In a one-newspaper town, we'd
be beholden to monopolistic influences rather than democratic
influences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finance and Labor Committee directed the city attorney's
office to examine the potential anti-trust implications of the
expected sale of the 134-year-old San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing Co.'s board of directors announced last
month that its media properties would be sold. The privately-held
company is owned by descendants of Chronicle founder Michael H. de
Young.
</P>
<P>
   The company owns three newspapers, the Chronicle, the
Bloomington Pantagraph in Illinois and the Worcester Telegram and
Gazette in Massachusetts; three television stations, KRON in San
Francisco, KAKE in Wichita, Kan., and WOWT in Omaha, Neb.; a cable
television station; two book publishing companies; and an on-line
information service. The company employs 3,200 people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, a New York investment firm
managing the sale, has presented the company's board with a list of
prospective suitors for the Chronicle, including the Hearst Corp.,
owner of the San Francisco Examiner, the city's afternoon
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Chronicle and Examiner have shared all business
costs and split revenues while maintaining separate editorial
operations, under a joint operating agreement commonly referred to
as a JOA.
</P>
<P>
   The legal underpinning of the JOA was articulated in a
subsequent federal law, the Newspaper Preservation Act, which
provides exemptions to anti-trust law when the purpose of such
business arrangements is to preserve and foster editorial diversity
in cities.
</P>
<P>
   The JOA gives Hearst the first shot at buying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   At the city hearing, nine speakers, including two representing
newspaper unions, argued that a sale of the Chronicle to the Hearst
Corp. would ``mean virtually, certainly, San Francisco will be a
one-newspaper city,'' said syndicated columnist and author Norman
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon bemoaned that no public outcry had arisen to save the
Chronicle and the Examiner as separate papers, as had happened in
the early 1990s when the San Francisco Giants baseball team seemed
certain to be sold and moved to St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Barnett, a law professor at the University of California
at Berkeley and a specialist in anti-trust law, said the city
should prepare a lawsuit to head off the shutdown of one of the
newspapers. Barnett also urged the city demand to be notified
immediately if there are plans to close one of the newspapers and
require, instead, that the owners search for a new buyer rather
than close.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mark Leno said he was concerned about the importance
of two editorial voices and the potential loss of jobs that had
been seen in other cities after newspaper sales.

FEMINIST CENTRAL CALLING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For someone who's been a feminist as long as I
have, you'd think I'd know by now to check with Feminism Central
before I say or do anything that knocks me out of lockstep with my
millions of sisters around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as everyone knows _ especially people who take to the
airways or opinion pages to criticize ``The Feminists'' _ we all
think and act exactly alike.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe, I know. But The Feminists are a doggone,
monolithic juggernaut, organized to a microscopic degree that would
surprise even Rush Limbaugh. That's what makes us so powerful and
scary and explains why women dominate Congress and the executive
ranks of Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   You see, when you become an ``official feminist'' _ in an
ancient ceremony that requires bra burning, a pledge to forgo
lipstick, cleanly shaven legs and sex with men _ you are also given
a toll-free 800 number for Feminism Central. This is so you will
never be in doubt about what you must say and do to be one of The
Feminists.
</P>
<P>
   If only I'd remembered to call before the women's World Cup
soccer final. Then I wouldn't have had to learn via a syndicated
opinion columnist _ who heard it on a network TV magazine show _
that I was horribly out of step.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bonnie Erbe, who did not quote a single known or
unknown feminist, the so-called ``babe factor'' probably accounted
for some of the men who became fans of the championship U.S. team _
and that maybe-fact ticks off The Feminists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't pretend to speak for feminists, never having
embraced that or any other mantle myself ...'' Erbe wrote. ``But
that doesn't stop me from offering them advice nonetheless.''
(Thank goodness. I treasure advice that is unsolicited and comes
from someone who knows little about the subject.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the perfect physiques of team members such as Mia Hamm,
Brandi Chastain and Lorrie Fair are part of the attraction, then
let feminists now praise beautiful women.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing her lecture, Erbe said: ``If beauty and sex appeal
are simply two items on a long list of reasons why people may tune
in to watch women's sports, then women should be thankful for and
not resentful of that ... So should feminists put down, upbraid or
scorn the babe factor? No. They should applaud, support and promote
it for all it's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavens to Gloria, Betty, Germain, Susan and Naomi. You can't
imagine my embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   There I was _ still high from watching the U.S. and China put on
a clinic in teamwork, individual athleticism, heart, guts and the
miracle of the human body _ and I was expected to be resentful.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being thankful for the sight of Brianna Scurry _
pumped like a magnificent madwoman after her game-winning save _ as
an ``official feminist'' I was supposed to put down and upbraid.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than applaud, support, promote and praise the undeniably
female exuberance of Chastain _ ripping off her shirt and giving
tens of millions of us a good look at her black sports bra,
gorgeously-toned arms and glowing skin _ my women's lib mind should
have been churning with scorn.
</P>
<P>
   How did I get so far off The Feminist track?
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely possible that I missed a scathing comment from
Patricia Ireland, Gloria Steinem or Naomi Wolf about how the babe
factor forever taints the joy of the U.S. women's World Cup
victory. (I didn't see the same TV show Erbe did.) But miss any
comment I did.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, I have not encountered one other feminist since the big
game who had a clue that we were supposed to be offended,
resentful, scornful, etc. Every feminist I know is still on the
ceiling from excitement, pride and the satisfaction of knowing that
Title IX works.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this sort of thing seems to be happening more and
more. My feminist pals and I have to read or hear _ usually from
someone like Rush, George Will or Katie Roiphe _ what we're
supposed to be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   If this continues, that 800 number will be disconnected, and
we'll have only ourselves to blame.

 TALL ORDER: `IRON GIANT' AND THE NEW FACE OF ANIMATION

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of a scene from
``The iron Giant.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Coming from nowhere with incredibly positive buzz, but with no
toys, bed sheets or Happy Meals to boost awareness, ``The Iron
Giant'' just might conquer the planet anyway, when it stomps into
theaters on Aug. 4.
 &HT;    ``I wish we had a few more tie-ins than we have,'' says Brad
Bird, who directed the animated adventure about a 9-year-old boy
(Eli Marienthal) and his new pal, a 50-foot robot (Vin Diesel).
``On the other hand, I think it's wonderful to sneak up on people.
 &HT;    ``So many things are overhyped these days. Hopefully, we'll cut
through all of that and get people to see us.
 &HT;    ``If we can just get people into the theaters and into the
seats, I think they'll be happy.''
 &HT;    Audiences that give ``Iron Giant'' a shot may be in for a
surprise. The PG-rated film delivers its share of intense moments
and a few mild swear words, and its story _ the boy tries to hide
the robot from the increasingly fearful denizens of Rockwell, Maine
_ unfolds at an unhurried pace.
 &HT;    Bird suggests that kids as young as 6 can handle the action, and
he promises that parents won't be bored to tears.
 &HT;    ``My goal was to make it more adult-friendly than animation
usually is,'' he says by telephone from his production office in
Burbank, Calif. ``Too often it's been defined by lowbrow humor and
not more intelligent and sophisticated storytelling.
 &HT;    ``I've been saying for years that I think there's a larger
audience for animation than is currently being served.''
 &HT;    Bird pauses to gather his thoughts. When he speaks again, he
does so in a serious tone.
 &HT;    ``My career in animation has been a ``Sophie's Choice'' between
fresh material and great execution,'' says the Montana-born Bird,
who was mentored by Disney animation legend Milt Kahl and toiled on
``King of the Hill'' and nearly 200 episodes of ``The Simpsons.''
 &HT;    ``In other words, if you get to do a high quality of work and
refined animation, you usually have to take a pretty worn-out story
and put five Broadway tunes to it, and, if you're going to do
something that's different and new, you have to do it for $1.98 and
in two hours.
 &HT;    ``One of the many pleasures on this film has been being able to
do something a little bit different and being able to do it on a
high-quality level,'' Bird says. ``Warner Brothers gave us an
unusual amount of freedom on this.
 &HT;    ``That's very rare in Hollywood, especially in feature
animation, which tends to be micromanaged. Once Warners was
convinced that we'd make `Iron Giant' responsibly and come in on
time and on budget, they gave us a lot of leeway.
 &HT;    ``If the film is special, that's one of the primary reasons.
They truly let us make our movie.''
 &HT;    Fair enough. But now to the big Bird question: What precisely
does the director of an animated film do?
 &HT;    ``You're really doing exactly the same thing that you'd do on a
live-action film,'' says Bird, who plans to take a long rest after
``Iron Giant'' opens. ``It's just that the methods for doing it are
a little bit different.
 &HT;    ``You're still directing performances, first of the vocal actors
(which include Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick, Jr., John Mahoney
and Cloris Leachman) and then of the animators. I suppose that it's
different in that the duties are broken up more, meaning that the
vocal is only the start of the performance.
 &HT;    ``You then direct the animators through the visual aspects of
the performance. But you're still dealing with timing, cutting,
camera angles, rhythm and the balance between comedy and drama.
You're still dealing with questions like, `Do we know who this
character is?' and `Are these scenes playing well?'''
 &HT;    Do we? Are they?
 &HT;    ``Oh, we have a few shots here and there that I'd love to tweak,
but I think we did remarkably well,'' Bird says. ``There are always
things you want to tweak, but I'll be just as glad to see it in a
theater as I hope the eventual audience for it will be.''

CHEVRON ACCIDENT MAY BOOST CALIFORNIA GAS PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANITA WADHWANI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An explosion at Chevron's Richmond refinery last
weekend has significantly reduced gasoline production, raising the
prospect of soaring gas prices in California.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron officials said the Saturday accident _ the third at the
Richmond plant since March _ had reduced gas production at the West
Coast's largest refinery by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The decreased supply could drive gasoline prices, already among
the nation's highest, up.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists criticized the San Francisco-based oil company
for not immediately reporting the explosion, which was not
disclosed until late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A leak developed in the main gasoline producing unit Friday. The
explosion occurred Saturday, leaving the unit _ known as a fluid
catalytic cracker _ inoperable, said Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey.
There were no injuries and the plant was not evacuated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Libbey called the resulting reduction in production
``significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still analyzing the problem and we don't know when
things will get back on track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, hoping to avert the predicted gasoline shortage and
higher prices, the oil company asked California regulators for
permission to sell out-of-state gasoline that doesn't comply with
California's strict environmental laws. No hearing date on the
request had been set.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend accident follows two major refinery accidents that
have seriously depleted gas reserves in the state and are blamed in
large part for the recent surge in gas prices throughout
California.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices in the San Francisco area skyrocketed as much as
50 percent in March, following an explosion at Tosco's Martinez
refinery and another explosion at Chevron's Richmond plant. By
April 12, San Francisco had the nation's most expensive gallon of
gasoline _ $1.71 _ and prices kept going up.
</P>
<P>
   The increase prompted calls for federal inquiries and
accusations of price-gouging. Prices have since declined.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron is asking regulators at the state Air Resources Board
for permission to buy 3.5 million barrels of gasoline from outside
the state for the maximum allowed 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   If production at the Richmond refinery is not back on track by
then, Chevron will arrange for the purchase of cleaner burning
gasoline from other sources, Libbey said.
</P>
<P>
   But approval of such gas purchases comes with a price: Chevron
will have pay 15 cents for every gallon it purchases outside the
state because of environmental standards. For 3.5 million barrels,
that would be a whopping $22 million _ a charge that Chevron can
pass along to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These penalties always hit the consumer's pocket book,
especially when you're talking about the West Coast's major
refinery,'' said Donald Brown, a refinery safety consultant and
former refinery operator. ``It's going to have an effect on prices
statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the third at Chevron's Richmond refinery since
March.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, a fire shot an 18,000-pound plume of sulfur dioxide
into the air and sent more than 350 area residents to hospitals
with ailments including eye and throat irritation, breathing
trouble, dizziness and nausea. On June 2, a chemical release that
gave some nearby residents headaches and made them nauseous led to
a temporary shutdown of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists criticized the lack of public information
about the Saturday explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of Chevron being more concerned about
spin control than about threats to the neighborhood,'' said Denny
Larson, Northern California director for Communities for a Better
Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron described the impact on the surrounding community as
imperceptible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very minor explosion,'' Libbey said. ``It
happened quite some distance from the gates. If there was some kind
of air emission, you could see it or smell it, and we didn't see or
smell anything outside the gates.''

   Eliades Ochoa/``Sublime Illusion'' (Higher Octave/Virgin)
</P>
<P>
   Wim Wenders' marvelous documentary, ``Buena Vista Social Club,''
continues to spur interest in the forgotten Cuban musicians that
guitarist-producer Ry Cooder recorded three years ago. These albums
are every bit as good as the original project as they expand upon
the initial disc's gorgeous sound. Singer Ferrer, dubbed the
``Cuban Nat King Cole'' because of his supremely relaxed vocal
delivery, offers a beautiful set of ballads and big-band dance hall
numbers, infusing each song with extraordinary feeling and passion.
He may be age 72, but time has only enhanced his abilities. 3 1/2
stars
</P>
<P>
   Singer-guitarist Ochoa, likewise, has honed his talents through
years of hard work in Cuba, where he has been a major musical force
for decades. ``Sublime Illusion,'' featuring guest guitarists
Cooder and David Hidalgo plus Bay Area blues harpist Charlie
Musslewhite, is a stirring program of traditional Cuban music
highlighted by Ochoa's elegant singing and subtle mastery of a
custom instrument known as the tres-guitar. Fans of the film should
put both these albums on top of their shopping list. 3 1/2 stars

   Various/``Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram
Parsons'' (Almo Sounds)
</P>
<P>
   The goal of this highly recommended collection was to assemble
artists who were influenced by the late, great Parsons, whose work
with the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds and as a solo artist
paved the way for the country-rock explosion of the '70s. The
album, produced by Emmylou Harris and containing covers of Parsons
tunes by the likes of Lucinda Williams/David Crosby, Elvis Costello
and Chris Hillman/Steve Earle, plus Harris collaborating with the
Pretenders, Sheryl Crow and Beck, includes a second disc of the
original versions performed by Parsons. If you aren't familiar with
such gorgeous and poignant songs as ``She,'' ``A Song for You,''
``Sleepless Nights'' or ``Hickory Wind,'' this is the place to
start. Every track's a winner. 4 stars

   Joe Lovano and Greg Osby/``Friendly Fire'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   This summit between two risk-taking sax players often misfires,
but has its share of inspired moments. Most of them come on the
standards _ the swinging connections made during Ornette Coleman's
``Broad Way Blues,'' the elegant lyricism in Thelonious Monk's
``Monk's Mood'' and Eric Dolphy's ``Serene,'' featuring Lovano's
debut on flute. The prolific Osby (usually playing alto) and Lovano
(tenor) bring improvisational fervor to a mostly cooking session. 2

   Tracie Spencer/``Tracie'' (Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   Working with the tip-top hip-hop production team of Soulshock
and Karlin, Spencer has crafted an album of mostly effective
pop-r&AMP;b jams and ballads. From the upbeat flavor of the hit single,
``It's All About You (Not About Me),'' to the late-night feel of
the sensual ``No Matter'' (one of seven tunes Spencer co-wrote
here), the album puts the accomplished pop diva in a slick,
contemporary setting that should appeal to fans of Brandy and

   London Suede/``Head Music'' (Nude/Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   London Suede helped define Britpop before Oasis splashed down.
But there's little chirpy about this moody, disaffected outfit. For
its fourth album, the quintet aimed for a hard-edged, spiky sound
with typically remote lyrical concerns. While at its very best on
the pop-rock ``Electricity'' and the funk-tinged ``Savoir Faire,''
London Suede may still have a hard time appealing to the U.S.
market. However, fans of cutting-edge Europop will warm to this
often cold, distant noise. 3 stars.

   Guitarist, composer and arranger Jones has worked with everyone
from Madonna to avant-garde saxophonist Arthur Blythe to Rosie
O'Donnell, with whose TV band he plays (but don't hold that against
him). Jones' fourth album as leader pairs him with an all-star
lineup on a program of hard-driving ensemble pieces and intimate
duets. Among the highlights: ``Tradewinds'' (which alludes to
George Benson's '70s sound), the meditative ``Dreamers in Love''
and the standard ``My Favorite Things,'' cleverly reworked by Jones
and pianist Mulgrew Miller. Jazz guitar fans will love this one. 3

<P>
   Newly expanded, remixed and remastered, the double-disc
``Woodstock'' features 15 tracks, including 35 minutes of
previously unreleased music from the late guitarist's headlining
performance at the 1969 rock festival. Joined by future Band of
Gypsys bandmate Billy Cox on bass, Experience bandmate Mitch
Mitchell on drums, plus two conga players and a rhythm guitarist,
there are flashes of brilliance on display, but everyone was
obviously pretty burnt by the time Hendrix took the stage just
after 9 a.m. on the festival's final day. Still, dizzying workouts
like the seven-minute improvisation ``Jam Back at the House,'' the
smoking ``Red House'' and a lyrical ``Spanish Castle Magic'' make
this a must for Hendrix completists. And who isn't? 3 stars

   Soul II Soul/``Club Classics Vol. 1 _ 10th Anniversary Edition''
(Virgin)
</P>
<P>
   When the club and r&AMP;b worlds collided 10 years ago in the studio
of visionary producer-composer Jazzie B with Massive Attack's
Nellee Hooper, nobody guessed a new genre would result. The
adventurous grooves and melodies of Soul II Soul's finest moment
led directly to the trip-hop school of Tricky, Massive Attack and
Portishead. This anniversary edition of ``Club Classics Vol. 1''
boasts a handful of resonant rare mixes along with the influential
original hits _ including ``Keep on Movin''' and ``Back to Life.''
These decade-old jams sound fresh as anything. 3 1/2 stars

   Luscious Jackson/``Electric Honey'' (Grand Royal/Capitol)
</P>
<P>
   Lilith Fair main stagers Luscious Jackson equals three ultra-hip
downtown ladies with friends in the right places. The well-scrubbed
grooves found on their new effort rarely inspire much excitement _
and by extension much dance floor action. Despite the slick r&AMP;b
backdrop and a cameo from Deborah Harry, ``Electric Honey'' falls
short of its title. 2 stars

 &HT;    Women follow male author into minds of men
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some have referred to Eric Jerome Dickey as ``a male Terry
McMillan,'' but the former computer programmer and stand-up comic
has a style all his own.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he explores some of the same territory as McMillan, but
Dickey writes about relationships between young black professionals
with a generous helping of humor and a distinctly male viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever cries `victim' in my books,'' says Dickey, a
Memphis native who turned to writing after he was downsized out of
the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   After taking writing classes at UCLA, Dickey sold his first
novel, ``Sister, Sister,'' in 1996. The story of three young black
women in Los Angeles quickly soared to the top of the Blackboard
Bestsellers List in Essence magazine. He followed ``Sister,
Sister'' a year later with ``Friends and Lovers,'' a comedic story
of two couples' roller coaster relationships. Then, in 1998, he
dealt with the problems of interracial dating in ``Milk in My
Coffee.'' Both were best sellers, and Whitney Houston optioned
``Friends and Lovers'' for a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   Now on tour for his new novel, ``Cheaters'' (Dutton, $24.95),
Dickey has attracted a loyal following of women readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they like my books because they help them understand
men better,'' he says. ``There are some women who say they can
write about men characters better than male writers, who think they
know what guys think. Any guy who reads their books will tell them,
`I don't think so.' We feel things, just like women. We just don't
articulate it as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey will sign his books from 6:30 to 8 p.m. today at Shrine
of the Black Madonna, 946 Abernathy Blvd., 404-752-6125, and from 6
to 7:30 p.m. Friday at Medu Bookstore, 2841 Greenbriar Parkway,
404-346-3263.

   &QR;  Literary gossip: Before they were published authors, Margaret
Mitchell and Frances Newman were gossip columnists for The Atlanta
Journal Magazine. In a fascinating article in the spring/summer
issue of The Southern Quarterly literary magazine, Lithonia writer
Reginald Abbott explores Newman's influence on Mitchell's career.
Both wrote a series of conversational anecdotes under the pseudonym
of Elizabeth Bennet _ taken from a Jane Austen heroine. There
apparently was little gossip _ mainly accounts of who wore what to
which party. According to Abbott, some observers believe Newman's
scandalous success with ``The Hard-Boiled Virgin'' in 1926 goaded
Mitchell into writing ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Also featured in this issue are articles on novelist Kate Chopin
(``The Awakening'') and Georgia State University professor, poet
and novelist David Bottoms (``Easter Weekend'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tangled web: Seventeen-year-old author Katie Tarbox has sold
her first book, ``Girl.com,'' to Dutton after a three-day auction.
The book is a true account of Tarbox's experiences as the target of
a stalker who pursued her through Internet chat rooms. She was 13
when it began. The man ultimately was prosecuted for sexual
harassment of a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Tarbox's agent, Laurie Chittenden, told Publishers Weekly the
story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of the Internet.
``It's something many young girls can identify with, a search for
someone who understands them and gives them affection, but it can
also lead them into some dark, scary places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl.com'' will be published next spring.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More L'Amour: Author Louis L'Amour is dead, but that doesn't
keep him from making the best-seller lists. ``Beyond the Great Snow
Mountains'' (Bantam, $16.95), a collection of 10 stories first
published in magazines in the 1940s and '50s, is in its fourth
printing with 260,000 copies.

 &HT;    Summer reading: New nonfiction of note
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Moab Is My Washpot by Stephen Fry (Random House, $24).
</P>
<P>
   Writing an autobiography requires a certain amount of ego, and
many take the occasion to make themselves pitiable, persecuted or
larger than life. Actor-comedian-writer Stephen Fry certainly
possesses the necessary ego, but he's never less than painfully
honest. When describing his theft of money from a friend's
grandmother, Fry calls it a ``shameful act.'' ``There are few
crimes lower,'' he continues, in obvious distress, ``and nothing I
write in this paragraph will mitigate, deaden or palliate the pain
and fury it must have caused that family.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the book takes a more lighthearted approach. He turns an
often caustic wit on his life, chuckling at adolescent angst from
the perspective of midlife. Readers of his first novel, ``The
Liar,'' will recognize large chunks of this book. His debut novel
was transparently autobiographical, but truth is not only stranger
than fiction, it's also more poignant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Invisible Stranger: The Patten, Maine, Photographs of
Arturo Patten by Russell Banks and Arturo Patten (Harper Collins,
$32.50).
</P>
<P>
   Before his death in March, photographer Arturo Patten captured
these 37 remarkable portraits of the folks who live in Patten,
Maine. These haunting images have a radiant quality, each
containing enough character to fill a novel. Novelist Banks
(``Cloudsplitter,'' ``Affliction,'' ``The Sweet Hereafter'')
surrounded himself with these images in his Adirondack cabin and
recorded his impressions. His style is a perfect fit _ these people
could have sprung directly from the pages of one of Banks' novels.
The people of the northern reaches of our country, Banks writes,
``squeezed between the vast Canadian Arctic and the more temperate,
densely populated tier of American states below, are shaped by the
same strict forces as the land, and thus in many ways they have
come to resemble it. They are tough, unyielding and stoical.'' It
is a testament to Patten's artistry that these words, though a
welcome addition, are not even necessary. The photographs convey it
all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Nudist on the Late Shift by Po Bronson (Random House,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   Po knows Silicon Valley. Novelist and Wired magazine writer
Bronson (``The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest'') has spent
several years investigating the inner workings of the technology
business in California's Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurs,
programmers, venture capitalists and salespeople feed Bronson's
inexhaustible quest for knowledge. He gets at the heart of a
business that too often gives the impression that it doesn't have
one, finding the soul beneath the cold technology and ruthless
deal-making. Bronson's vivid description of the home of programmers
Kevin Hester and Mark ``Max'' Maxham, dubbed ``Geekhaus,'' is
typical of his smart, observant style: ``Every bedroom of the house
looks to have been decorated by an earthquake: clothes, books,
sporting goods strewn on the floor,'' Bronson writes. ``The
occupants seem not quite to have gotten the concept that certain
things, such as artworks, may be hung from the walls rather than
just leaned against them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The View From Babylon: The Notes of a Hollywood Voyeur by
Donald Rawley (Warner Books, $23).
</P>
<P>
   The late Donald Rawley, author of ``The Night Bird Cantata'' and
a former editor at Los Angeles' Buzz magazine, takes aim at a
rather easy target: the denizens of Hollywood. It's a shallow place
where, Rawley writes, ``world poverty and racism are meaningless,
but the fluctuation in real estate values is not.'' His pithy,
no-nonsense tone strikes just the right balance of world-weariness
and stinging sarcasm. He skewers celebrities and studio honchos,
sometimes in thinly veiled references to Oscar-winning actresses,
but often simply naming names. Were he still alive, Rawley, like
fellow Hollywood observer Julia Phillips, would probably never eat
lunch in that town again.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  QUICK HITS: Detroit music critic Dan Sicko's ``Techno Rebels:
The Renegades of Electronic Funk'' (Billboard Books, $16.95
paperback) is an excellent American answer to last year's
``Generation Ecstasy,'' Simon Reynolds' Anglo-centric look at dance
music and culture. Sicko is based in Detroit, the birthplace of
techno, the precursor to every dance music genre emanating from DJ
booths and radios today. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The Embrace: A True Vampire Story'' (Pocket Books, $23) by
journalist Aphrodite Jones (``The FBI Killer'') investigates black
magic and Satanism among a group of bored, disenfranchised
teenagers, including 16-year-old Roderick Farrell. The
self-proclaimed leader of a vampire cult is on death row for the
bludgeoning death of a rural Florida couple. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates doesn't fare very well in the new ``South Park''
movie, and he takes even more knocks in a couple of new books.
``How the Web Was Won: The Inside Story of How Bill Gates and his
Band of Internet Idealists Transformed a Software Empire''
(Broadway, $27.50) by Paul Andrews and Gary Rivlin's ``The Plot to
Get Bill Gates'' (Times Books, $25) prove that the rabble on the
information highway is still looking to make roadkill out of the
power elite. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Daring of the
</P>
<P>
   Soldier: Women of the Civil War Armies'' (Norton, $27.95) by
Colby College, Maine, professor Elizabeth D. Leonard adds important
and fascinating information to Civil War scholarship. Leonard's
research indicates that many women disguised themselves as men to
serve on the battlefields, while others did duty as spies. She
spins engaging tales of valor, patriotism and dedication through
letters and contemporary accounts. ...
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bordo casts a feminine eye on ``The Male Body'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25) with her penetrating examination of all
things physically masculine. It's a frank and very personal tour
that takes in the author's relationships with the opposite sex. ...
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Stainton delves into the conflicted, peripatetic life of
Spanish playwright and poet Federico Garcia Lorca in ``Lorca: A
Dream of Life'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $35). From his birth in
1898 in Andalusian Spain to his death at the hands of Franco
supporters in 1936, Stainton's meticulous research and skilled
writing draw a thrilling portrait of a fascinating life. ...
</P>
<P>
   In ``Forever England'' (Carroll &AMP; Graf, $22), lauded British
novelist Beryl Bainbridge examines her country's great North/South
divide. Through interviews with three families from England's
industrial North and three from the agricultural South, Bainbridge
reveals the facts and myths that have divided the regions, and
searches for what binds them together.

 &HT;    In the spirit of genuine psychological horror, two films
heighten Hollywood's chill factor
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday July 18.
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terror is playing mind games at the movies this summer.
</P>
<P>
   There's a distinct absence of teen slasher films on the big
screen. You know, the blade-wielding craziness of the ``Scream''
flicks, the ever-stalking bogeyman of ``I Still Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' the bloodletting ferocity of ``Urban Legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh-meat horror is taking a holiday. And in its place comes
psychological trepidation _ terrible things that go bump in the
night, unseen or mere glimpses of monsters, panic, disorientation
and primal fears moviegoers likely haven't felt in years.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's latest horror is a return to the spine-tingling
suspense of Alfred Hitchcock, the eerie shadows of ``Nosferatu''
and the wicked, wondrous mind manipulations in the first half of
``The Exorcist.''
</P>
<P>
   Already playing at the Tara in Atlanta is ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' a chilling, seat-of-the-pants ``mockumentary'' about
three young filmmakers terrorized while documenting a centuries-old
horror tale.
</P>
<P>
   And coming Friday is ``The Haunting,'' a remake of Robert Wise's
1963 creepy thriller directed by Jan De Bont (``Speed,''
``Twister''). Based on Shirley Jackson's story, the new
``Haunting'' is the tale of a group of insomniacs enticed by a
scientist (Liam Neeson) to unwittingly spend freaked-out nights in
a mansion that turns out to be haunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a refreshing change to be completely scared, and it come
from something other than somebody with a knife slashing people,''
says Atlanta moviegoer Phil Dutra, 33, who saw ``Blair Witch'' at a
recent early screening.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Baroco, 27, of Atlanta has also seen ``Blair Witch'' and
can't seem to stop talking about it to her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I necessarily believed the whole premise of
the movie, but I bought it,'' she says. ``I thought it was really
scary. We walked out of the theater, and we were all weak-kneed.
The psychological stuff is what scares the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Made for a mere $20,000 by a
</P>
<P>
   quintet of University of Central Florida graduates and
distributed by Artisan Entertainment, ``Blair Witch'' is likely the
freshest approach to the horror genre in decades.
</P>
<P>
   It stars three unknown actors as a trio of young filmmakers
making a documentary for a college class project about horrific
tales of child murders, curses, disembowelments and ghost
sightings, stemming from a 1785 witchcraft case in the Maryland
township of Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Its unique turn is that while ``Blair Witch'' is fiction, it is
presented to moviegoers as fact. The three on-screen filmmakers
vanish in the Maryland woods in the midst of making their
documentary. And what audiences see is their found film, displayed
in real time with all its raw graininess, blurry visions and weird
sounds recorded from the moment they set out to begin filming until
their mysterious disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   It's like MTV's ``The Real World'' meets ``Let's Scare Jessica
to Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a very realistic movie that transports you
into an incredibly real world,'' says ``Blair Witch'' producer
Robin Cowie, 27, a graduate of Cobb County's (Ga.) Walton High
School and one of the film's five creative partners. ``What is
really unique about the movie is that it takes the trappings of
low-budget filmmaking and makes them a part of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   All the film's footage and sound recordings were made by the
actors _ Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams;
their real names are also the names of their ``Blair Witch''
characters.
</P>
<P>
   They were sent into the forests of Seneca Creek State Park in
Maryland for eight days with a 16mm camera, a video camera, sound
equipment, camping gear and a mere outline of the movie and told to
improvise their search for the witch story.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the woods were the ``Blair Witch'' creators,
including co-directors/writers Dan Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez and
producer Gregg Hale. Dressed in camouflage and armed with
night-vision goggles, they orchestrated the actors' march through
terror, leaving script notes under orange flags, rousing them with
middle-of-the-night spook invasions and, ultimately, lowering the
group's food rations to heighten their psychological breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea kind of came from a combination of Dan and Ed wanting
this hyperrealism and Gregg having spent some time in military
intelligence,'' Cowie says. ``One of the things Gregg did while in
Special Forces was prisoner-of-war camp. Participants would be
blindfolded and led through the woods, and they'd do everything to
them but kill them. They'd wig 'em out. Gregg thought even though
(our actors) would know it's not real, they'd end up being
petrified.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's key scenes involves a late-night taped
confession by a wildly frightened Heather, the on-screen trio's
leader. ``I just want to apologize to Mike's mom and Josh's mom and
my mom,'' she wheezes while shaking and staring wide-eyed into a
video camera, a single tear hanging just under her right eye.
``Because it is my fault. Because it was my project. I am ... so
... scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who've watched ``Blair Witch'' like what they see. Pulitzer
Prize-winning film critic Roger Eber is a fan. The movie was a
late-night thriller at the recent Sundance Film Festival, and it
won the Prix de La Jeunesse (Youth Prize) at Cannes in May.
</P>
<P>
   The film ``appears to be the next evolutionary step (in horror),
not in the same spirit as `Night of the Living Dead,' but really,
in reverse and to the left,'' says Greg Dean Schmitz of the
Internet's upcomingmovies.com. ``Though both films seem to be based
in the horror of the real ... `The Blair Witch Project' is said to
utilize the sense of danger and threat more than any
special-effects intensive bogeyman thrills.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's creators say they were influenced by such unsettling
films as ``The Exorcist'' and ``The Legend of Boggy Creek'' and,
especially, old TV shows such as ``In Search of'' with its blurry
visuals of purported Loch Ness monsters, ghosts and an apelike
Bigfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our movie makes the viewer really invest in the sense of
watching to decipher what's going on,'' ``Blair Witch'' co-director
Myrick says.
</P>
<P>
   And he's right. During the dead of night when the actors are
awakened by chilling cries from the forest, they scramble to grab
video equipment and race into the woods, the camera often swinging
wildly as they point toward weird sounds emanating from different
places. ``When you work hard to see that _ like when you look at
some grainy photograph _ you carry that with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of suggestion is also at the heart of De Bont's remake
of ``The Haunting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Horror is at its best when things are barely seen or just
imagined,'' De Bont says. ``We're not going to show everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With its big Hollywood budget, ``The Haunting,'' however, will
naturally show a bit more than ``Blair Witch.''
</P>
<P>
   Special effects, especially those employed in the film's trailer
showing stone cherubs and statues moving to face the mansion's
unlucky occupants, will be much more in evidence than in Robert
Wise's original spooky masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   But De Bont says only 120 special effects shots are used, and
some are quite delicately perceived. ``It's very much a
psychological horror film,'' he says. ``Basically, the house will
come alive. It's not like huge, silly monsters. It's very subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   De Bont also developed and recorded the house's unnerving sounds
before shooting began so that his actors, including Neeson,
Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor, could react to something
authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing worse (for an actor) to hear than, `Now here's
where we'll add this and this sound,' and they never hear what is
supposed to be scaring them,'' De Bont says. ``During shooting we
had speakers in the right spots to have sounds audible, like the
creaks, so they not only react but get scared.''
</P>
<P>
   And he says ``The Haunting'' is very different from his most
well-known films such as ``Speed'' and ``Twister,'' in which the
story was propelled by the action sequences. ``In this movie, it is
character-driven and then things are happening. The suspense is
slowly built and maintained. Like in `The Shining,' it is like
those characters and how the house starts to play with their
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The creators of ``Blair Witch'' have gone beyond the film itself
to fiendishly toy with their audience's brains.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, an hourlong ``Blair Witch'' special aired on the
Sci-Fi Channel that presented the film's made-up story line as
fact. And just three months ago, they launched a Web site _
blairwitch.com _ that outlines back stories for the main
characters, the fictional town and the ages-old witch tale.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Blair Witch'' crew also has a comic book in the works,
plans for an extensive ``Making of ...'' to be included on DVD, has
secured the film's interactive and gaming rights and has first dibs
with Artisan Entertainment at a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really tried to maintain the mythology,'' ``Blair
Witch'' producer Cowie says. ``Anything that creeps us out, we go
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   HORROR CLASSICS
</P>
<P>
   Who needs Freddy Krueger? There are plenty of videos that up the
horror quotient with style instead of steel blades and buckets of
blood. Here are 10 to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Nosferatu'' (1922) _ As beautiful a film as it is chilling,
F.W. Murnau's silent classic, the tale of a particularly
wicked-looking bloodsucker (Max Schreck) inspired by Bram Stoker's
novel ``Dracula,'' demonstrates the director's brilliance with
subtlety and visual imagery.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Old Dark House'' (1932) _ James Whale, the director Ian
McKellen portrayed in ``Gods and Monsters,'' made this movie in
between ``Frankenstein'' and ``Bride of Frankenstein.'' It involves
insanity and disturbing shadows in a Welsh mountain retreat. Among
those in the impressive cast: Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Gloria
Stuart (``Titanic'') and Charles Laughton.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cat People'' (1942) _ What you don't see is what gets you in
Jaues Tourneur's weird psychological tale of women who turn into
panthers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Uninvited'' (1944) _ Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey play a
brother and sister who slowly discover ghosts inhabit their new
home.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Spiral Staircase'' (1946) _ The camera does most of the
work generating spine-tingling suspense in a gripping tale of a
mute maid (Dorothy McGuire) who ultimately comes face to face with
a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Diabolique'' (1955) _ Just pass on by the Sharon Stone
version and reach for director Henri-Georges Clouzot's original
with Simone Signoret. It's not so much a horror film as a
suspenseful tale of apparent murder, complete with dark hallways
and creaking doors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Curse of the Demon'' (1958) _ The occult is front and center
in another Tourneur film, this one the riveting tale of an American
(Dana Andrews) trying to expose a devil's cult in London.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Scream of Fear'' (1961) _ Susan Strasberg plays a woman in a
wheelchair subjected to weird happenings _ and startling death
images _ when she travels to her father's European mansion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Haunting'' (1963) _ Robert Wise's depiction of Shirley
Jackson's horror tale involves a large New England home, a history
of mysterious deaths, repeated disturbing nighttime sounds and what
must be creepy-crawling ghosts. Julie Harris stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Repulsion'' (1965) _ Is it all in the mind? Catherine
Deneuve plays a woman suffering from repeated hallucinations in
Roman Polanski's chilling drama.
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

   PHOENIX - Why do we save these people?
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of raging thunderstorm, someone drives his truck
or minivan or Ford Pinto into an obviously flooded wash, drifts
downstream until getting tangled up in downed trees, broken
guardrails or other debris, and we send out squadrons of police
cars, firetrucks, helicopters and whatever else it takes to pluck
him from certain embarrassment and possible death in the swift,
murky water.
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering _ why?
</P>
<P>
   Do we have some special affection for drivers with no judgment?
</P>
<P>
   Is there some secret ``Knucklehead Lobby'' I haven't heard about
but which has a stranglehold on the government?
</P>
<P>
   This happens every summer. Usually, several times.
</P>
<P>
   It's gone on year after year for generations.
</P>
<P>
   And no one ever seems to question the extremes to which local
authorities will go to rescue these people.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the ``stupid motorist'' law, as Arizona did a few years
back, isn't nearly enough. All that does is to allow the state to
pass on the cost of rescues to the nincompoops who make them
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Only it rarely happens.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, that's after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   The question we should be asking ourselves is: Why bother in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
NOT-TOO-SWIFT CURRENTS
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
We live in a state that has shown no real interest in spending the
money necessary to rescue thousands of children from dangerous or
abusive households, but will spend any amount necessary to pull a
motorist from the flooding cab of his El Camino.
</P>
<P>
   We won't spend the money necessary to provide adequate housing
for poor people or lifesaving medical care for those who need it,
yet we'll launch our own version of Operation Desert Storm every
time some urban cowboy gets his Toyoto Land Cruiser tilted sideways
in a gutter.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think, maybe, there might be a correlation between the
simpletons driving on our rain-soaked streets and the pathetically
small amount of cash the Legislature has been willing to put toward
improving our public schools?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, just after the local TV stations had spent the better
part of an hour with their helicopters hovering over Simple Simons
who had driven their vehicles into waist-high storm water, they
focused their cameras on a dog.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be a German shepherd that the storm had spooked,
causing him to wander out into the desert and in the path of an
oncoming flash flood.
</P>
<P>
   While cameras from the helicopters rolled, the dog did something
truly extraordinary, at least for this part of the country:
</P>
<P>
   He got out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   He moved.
</P>
<P>
   That's it.
</P>
<P>
   The animal trotted away from the banks of the wash, and the
floodwater moved past him. That was that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such a scene isn't nearly as entertaining as watching
some ninny drive headlong into a gully washer, then cry and moan
and wave his arms until rescuers manage to rig some contraption to
haul him out of the sinister deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Raging water looks great on TV.
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
CAUGHT UP IN THE UNDERTOW
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
And you can't help but cheer for the swift-water rescue workers or
the helicopter pilots who swoop in to save people.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's better than watching summer reruns. Or worse, the
Major League Baseball All-Star game. Or even worse, the WNBA
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should we assume that every motorist who ends up trapped in
a flash flood is brainless. Intelligent people sometimes make
mistakes. And they should be saved.
</P>
<P>
   But with every monsoon storm that strikes our city, there is a
great untapped potential for idiot cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   We could take the money we spend on rescuing numbskulls (as well
as the money we spend on news coverage of numbskulls being rescued)
and put it to better use.
</P>
<P>
   But we haven't, so far, and we won't.
</P>
<P>
   You can't change human nature. You can't beat showbiz. You can't
use a helicopter to rescue a kid from an abusive home. &QL;

WARNER RELEASES `BONNIE AND CLYDE,' `CABARET' ON DVD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One of the best things about being on the DVD beat
is the re-release of classic films on the new format. Not only is
it great to see them cleaned up in the digital format, but it also
gives film buffs a chance to see how well they bear up as we hit
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Two films that should be required viewing in 2000 and beyond are
Arthur Penn's ``Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967) and Bob Fosse's
``Cabaret'' (1972), both available from Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie and Clyde'' wasn't the first time Penn had made a film
about a dysfunctional outlaw. His first film, ``The Left-Handed
Gun'' (1958), starring Paul Newman as Billy the Kid, was an
interesting though stilted psychological study of the famed
gunfighter. Part of this probably comes from Penn's background in
directing, which until then was for stage and TV dramas, and
``Gun'' has that confined feel of '50s television.
</P>
<P>
   One of Penn's other westerns, ``The Missouri Breaks'' (1976),
veers in the opposite direction. It always seems out of control.
That's due somewhat to his stars, who clearly were allowed to
experiment with their characters, including Marlon Brando _ who was
playing a feared bounty hunter pursuing Jack Nicholson's character
_ wearing a dress and taking a bubble bath. But that was indicative
of the whole movie. It's a fascinating mess, though.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, however, hit his stride with ``Bonnie'' and ``Little Big
Man'' (1970). ``Bonnie'' proved to be a landmark film. The story of
the lives of 1930s outlaws Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde
Barrow (Warren Beatty) was told in very un-Hollywood fashion, owing
more to the French New Wave with its abrupt shifts in mood _ from
humor to fury. The glossy, romantically nostalgic surface belies
the film's undercurrents of sexual tension (specifically Clyde's
impotence), the real tragedies of the Depression and the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie'' and a number of other films of the late '60s helped
Hollywood move to a new level of sophistication in filmmaking.
Considering the number of utterly stupid teen movies populating the
screens these days, we have taken a lamentable step backward.
</P>
<P>
   If Penn upped the stakes in Hollywood, Bob Fosse pushed the
envelope. His most successful film _ though not his best _ was the
Academy Award-winning ``Cabaret,'' the musical starring Liza
Minnelli as the irrepressible and corruptible Sally Bowles. Set in
the ``divine decadence'' of 1931 Berlin, ``Cabaret'' included
promiscuous sexual activity, sadomasochism and the rise of Nazism.
Fosse, who died in 1987, didn't flinch from these themes. There was
a dark side to Fosse as evidenced by his subsequent films _
``Lenny,'' ``All That Jazz'' and ``Star 80.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cabaret,'' Fosse keeps a detached distance from his
subjects, as the gaiety of the seedy Kit Kat club does from the
social turmoil outside. One of the most jarring scenes occurs when
Bowles, Englishman and would-be novelist Brian Roberts (Michael
York) and wealthy playboy Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem) go on
an outing in the country. There, sitting outside at an inn, a blond
youth stands up and begins singing what seems a lovely folk melody.
What begins as an idyllic moment becomes horrific as the camera
pulls back to reveal the youth's Nazi armband, and the crowd joins
in. Suddenly, the song _ ``Tomorrow Belongs to Me'' _ becomes a
black omen of the Nazi terror to come.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way Fosse's career drew on darker and darker subject
matter, and given Sam Mendes' brilliant reimaging of the musical on
stage, it would be fascinating to see how he would film ``Cabaret''
today. Unfortunately, that isn't possible, but the version of
``Cabaret'' he left us is a spectacular balancing act. &QL;

TUNE INTO THE REVOLUTION

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ On my way over to Berkeley, I practiced my
chants and slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power to the people, right on.'' ``Venceremos.'' ``La Lutte
Continue.'' ``Hey, hey, ho hum, how humdrum can radio become?''
</P>
<P>
   The people's struggle for control of Berkeley's public radio
station, KPFA, made for dramatic radio, at least when station
management pulled the plug on reporter Dennis Bernstein and his
program ``Flashpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, it seemed like a bad '60s movie. But talk about
police brutality. It looked like the cops sprayed half the
demonstrators with gray paint and cellulite instead of Mace.
</P>
<P>
   So I had to go over Wednesday and see 1969 in 1999 for myself.
I'd read about the hundreds of protesters and the 52 arrests at the
station Tuesday night, but as we know from the '60s, crowd counts
always are biased.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they don't count how interesting the people are
in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   There was Susan Stone, who, until locked out by management, was
the station's programmer for drama and literature. ``Now I call it
`trauma and liturgy,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She still had a big smile, and put the situation at KPFA nicely
and with no radical cant, saying, ``It's a pickle we're in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavarne Williams, who violated every '60s stereotype with her
black business attire and cell phone, said, ``I worked in
fund-raising. Now I'm hell-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly galling to KPFA staffers locked out by the parent
Pacifica Foundation is the fact that the station has been playing
best-of-KPFA tapes _ interviews and stories they taped themselves.
After the police bust, the station played an old interview with
radical Angela Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder what Angela would think about that,'' said KPFA
loyalist Wayne Linse. ``It was a good interview, and I felt guilty
listening to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to make it seem as if they are KPFA,'' said
longtime radio commentator and Sovietologist Bill Mandel, who left
the 50-year-old station six years ago ``in the first purge,'' as he
put it.
</P>
<P>
   Mandel and I talked about the days when he was called before the
House Un-American Activities Committee, and the even older days
when he left the Hoover Institution after opposing the Truman
Doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, all you progressive youth who support KPFA. You
won't be tested. Even most of the graying radicals in front of KPFA
don't know what the Truman Doctrine is.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a Jim Carrey movie.
</P>
<P>
   People came and went in front of KPFA for the two hours I was
there. Here are few counts besides crowd counts: When I arrived,
five young staffers and friends were sitting in an old car
listening to Michael Krasny on KQED radio interview some of the
locked-out staffers. They listened with total intensity, as if this
was the last signal from Radio Free Berserkley.
</P>
<P>
   I heard two mentions of a possible CIA interest in buying the
station. No, not the Culinary Institute of America, although that
might make sense in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   I saw one young guy make the sign of the revolutionary fist. I
didn't know any young people knew how to do that anymore without
putting up one finger.
</P>
<P>
   I heard one reference to ``cyberfascism,'' although I forget
what that has to do with radio.
</P>
<P>
   I heard a guy playing ``We Shall Overcome'' on one of those
baritone horns played by the Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   A simple crowd count didn't do justice to this crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing that got me wasn't the Berkeleyness of it all, or
how old, white and gray I suddenly felt.
</P>
<P>
   What got me was the look on people's faces. One woman, with a
beautiful face just starting to show wrinkles, was on the edge of
tears as the speakers talked seriously of free speech and
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that look. She was someone who had lost a home, of sorts.
It was as if an earthquake had hit Berkeley, and left it
free-speechless and her speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Dennis Bernstein was still shaking with anger and
feelings of betrayal after getting the boot from management. He
said he hadn't slept since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave on Friday, and you get to your office on Monday and
find armed guards. It's unbelievable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and in Berkeley, I said. ``In Berkeley?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I called Vini Beachem, a friend who had been taping
his own radio plays with his company, Pagliacci's Fools, when the
station imploded. These remarkable plays are the perfect blend of
the old and the new.
</P>
<P>
   Beachem, a former member of the KPFA board, said he has to
protect his people and his project and probably will move his
shows, taped before live audiences, to the Oakland Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's the point of KPFA now,'' he said, ``taking the
spirit of the station and doing it elsewhere, taking it to the
museums, the streets and the parking lots.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds very '60s, but I think what he's really saying is
you have to protect yourself, your friends and your project in the
corporate '90s.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, don't forget taking it to the Internet, the
revolution that succeeded. Free speech is under threat there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Beachem doesn't have time to wait for KPFA to solve its
problems. ``If it comes down to litigation and lawsuits, how long
does that take?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot longer than the revolution has taken so far.
</P>

WARNER BROS.   BACKS CRUSADE STARTED BY KUBRICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: ``Today'' refers to Friday, July 16)  
 
  
By BOB MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They're raggedy, neglected and in need of good
homes, as orphans often are.
</P>
<P>
   A staggering number of American-made films that appeared before
1950 either have disappeared or are in danger of being lost
altogether because the film stock simply wasn't designed to last
this long.
</P>
<P>
   Known as orphans, these productions dating back to the early
part of the century are of such concern that eight high-profile
filmmakers banded together in 1990 to start the Film Foundation, an
organization dedicated to finding and saving as much of Hollywood's
film heritage as possible. One of those founding members was the
late Stanley Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. is honoring Kubrick on today's release of his final
film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' with a $100,000 donation to the Film
Foundation, whose other founders are Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen,
Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford
and Steven Spielberg. In recent years, Robert Altman and Clint
Eastwood have joined the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Warner co-chairmen and chief executives Robert A. Daly and Terry
Semel announced the gift ahead of Tuesday's world premiere of
``Eyes Wide Shut'' at Mann's Village Theatre in Westwood, where a
ceremony was held. Warner Bros. is the distributor of the film,
which stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation raises and distributes money that goes toward
recovery, reconstruction, reproduction and safekeeping of
endangered film stock. Among those group are Academy Film Archive,
the UCLA Film and Television Archive, George Eastman House, Library
of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, the American Film Institute
and the National Film Preservation Foundation, all of which are
active participants in the study and remedy of the problem and
methods of preservation.
</P>
<P>
   By copying a decaying film onto new film stock at a cost of
$15,000 for a black-and-white silent and up to four times that for
color, the preservationist has won half the battle. The other half
_ placing a new print with an archive, museum, university, library
or historical society _ ensures that the title remains intact and
kept under optimum conditions for a long life.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 study by the Library of Congress' National Film
Preservation Board found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer than 20 percent of U.S. feature films from the 1920s,
and only 10 percent from the teens, have survived in their
entirety.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many early films exist only in international archives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Half of the American films made before 1950 have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Films made after 1950 on acetate film stock will experience
color fading and a deterioration known as ``vinegar syndrome.''
Commercial studio films aren't in as much danger as non-mainstream
features, newsreels, silents, documentaries, experimental and
amateur footage, according to the National Film Preservation
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   An event next month at Glendale's Alex Theatre is sending up a
hooray for Hollywood's unsung heroes. ``Film Treasures: The Alex
Salutes the UCLA Film and Television Archive'' takes place Aug. 4
through 8, with screenings in the opulent theater.
</P>
<P>
   Being shown over the five nights are ``Hell's Angels'' (1930),
starring Jean Harlow and directed and produced by Howard Hughes;
``Holiday'' (1938), with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn; ``My Man
Godfrey'' (1936), co-starring William Powell and Carole Lombard;

STUDY SAYS PESTICIDE USE RISES DRAMATICALLY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Farmers and professional exterminators sprayed
more cancer- causing pesticides than ever before in 1997, nearly
twice the amount used in 1991, according to a new California study.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the pesticide use increased to 204 million pounds in
1997, up by 3.5 percent from 1996, according to the annual study by
the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Growers applied 93 percent of the total amount, pest control
operators sprayed 3 percent, landscapers used 1 percent and all
others, 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study doesn't include pesticides used in homes, gardens,
schools, hospitals and other buildings where no certified
professional is involved. Experts say that use would raise the
total number of pounds by another 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the state Department of Pesticide Regulation
reported pesticide use by the following categories: carcinogens,
reproductive toxins, air contaminants, threats to groundwater and
others. The Legislature asked for the information in the most
recent budget language.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups objected to the continuous increase of
pesticide use, particularly the carcinogens, reproductive toxins
and nerve toxins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be trying to reduce the use of chemicals that cause
birth defects, sterility and cancer,'' said environmental chemist
Susan Kegley, staff scientist at the Pesticide Action Network.
``Alternatives to these toxic pesticides are available. The state
needs to provide incentives and support to growers to reduce the
pesticide use.''
</P>
<P>
   Veda Federighi, a spokeswoman for the Department of Pesticide
Regulation, said, the agency offers programs aimed at reducing the
use of hazardous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The use of oils as pesticides, Federighi said, contributed to
the high volume of carcinogens. Using oils can be a less toxic
alternative, she said. The oils are used in the winter on barren
trees, which reduces the need for certain toxic chemicals during
the growing season.
</P>
<P>
   The department granted $750,000 in 1999 to growers and others
for developing ways to control insects without pesticides. The
grants since 1996 total $4.5 million, Federighi said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kegley responded that $750,000 a year out of an operating
budget of $40 million to $50 million is a very small portion.
``They need to allocate more resources to hit this problem hard,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study:
</P>
<P>
   _ Carcinogenic pesticides, known to cause cancer in lab animals,
increased by 81 percent from 31.2 million pounds in 1991 to 56.5
million pounds in 1997. Most widely used were petroleum and other
oils. Next most highly used were two soil fumigants, Telone and
metam sodium, which spilled during a train wreck in 1991 and killed
fish in miles of the Sacramento River.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reproductive toxins increased by 34 percent from 24.3 million
pounds in 1991 to 32.6 million pounds in 1997. They can cause birth
defects, miscarriages and infertility. Most frequently used were
metam sodium and methyl bromide, a fumigant used on strawberries,
grapes and nursery crops.
</P>
<P>
   _ The family of organophosphates and carbamates, both nerve
toxins, rose by 17 percent from 13.8 million pounds in 1991 to 16.1
million pounds in 1997. Chlorpyrifos and aldicarb, both used on
cotton, are the top chemicals. Chlorpyrifos, a component in Raid,
is commonly used around homes as an insecticide.

Ryan winds up with 27 seasons of memories
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to end this way
</P>
<P>
   No, we don't mean the induction of Nolan Ryan into the Hall of
Fame. Cooperstown is clearly the last station where this train
stops, this Ryan Express.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that Nolan kept a little something to himself
on his way to baseball's holy tabernacle. That is, he could have
pitched again _ and thought about it _ the season after he retired
in 1993. He might be pitching even now, for crying out loud, if the
only factor was the condition of his right arm, which Pete Rose
called ``the greatest arm that ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   We _ the fans, the media _ had assumed that Nolan had blown out
his elbow when he threw the last pitch of his storied career in
Seattle on Sept. 22, 1993. He left the field with his arm limp at
his side, while a crowd of strangers gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really a career-ending injury,'' Ryan said. ``That's
what people thought. I had announced before the season that this
would be my last one, and there was only a week or so left, and
everybody pretty much accepted that this was the final blow. I
never said anything differently. Nobody really asked me. I was
walking away from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a partial tear and it healed with rest. By the next
spring, I was throwing batting practice to the TCU kids and my arm
was sound. I know I could have pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have been tempted, but the calendar told him he was 47,
and logic told him no. He didn't want to be one of those athletes
who retired and kept coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would be fair to the club,'' Ryan said.
``The recovery time from the nagging injuries that I knew I'd face,
that was hanging over me. But I guess what surprises me even now is
that I still have that desire to pitch and to perform on that
level. That competitive edge, I've never lost it. Physically, I
think I could have continued to pitch if I really, truly had wanted
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if he had changed his mind and tried to go another
season, or two, this Hall of Fame weekend would have been
considerably less attractive. The King of Swing (and Miss) has made
many a choice over the years, and you don't recall many that turned
out badly. No matter how much money he earned, or banks and ranches
and homes he owned, he always returned to Alvin, and the small-town
values he never lost.
</P>
<P>
   He married Ruth Holdorff, school beauty and a state tennis
champion, in 1967. He wanted to quit that winter, having drawn a
cool $7,000 from the Mets. She convinced him to stick it out,
telling him that if he gave up now, he would always wonder if he
might have made it. Nolan had to take out a loan to support them
during the next spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows about Nolan, so wholesome that at 50-plus he
still looks like the poster boy for Future Farmers of America. He
became a special kind of sports treasure because he achieved big
things, and he did them without vanity or deceit or scandal.
Through it all, Ruth was more than the pretty blonde who lived with
Nolan's arm. They have made a splendid team, and when he retired
Ruth wrote her own story of life in the fast(ball) lane. The title
was Covering Home.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryans raised three handsome kids, Reid, Reese and Wendy. Now
they truly have a family business, a minor-league team in Round
Rock called _ what else? _ the Express, soon to move into a new,
town-supported ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of Nolan's story ought to be as familiar to the
devout baseball fan as the ingredients of an apple pie. How the
Mets worried that he would never find the strike zone, although he
helped them win a World Series in 1969, known as the Miracle of
Flushing Meadow. Then they traded him to the Angels, where he
blossomed as a strikeout artist and no-hit genius. Then the Angels
thought he was winding down, and they let him get away to Houston,
where he could drive his pickup truck from Alvin to the Astrodome
in less than 30 minutes. And how the fans all but burned down the
stadium when John McMullen tried to lowball him and cut his salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known then what I know now, I would never have let
him go,'' McMullen said later. ``But if I had known then what I
know now, I would never have voted for Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which led to one last move _ to the Texas Rangers, where
he seemed to set or extend a record every time he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Now we spin the calendar backward to the first day of May 1991,
when Nolan delivered a performance so compelling that it seemed to
distill his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched his record seventh no-hitter over the Toronto Blue
Jays, a 3-0 victory, in front of a crowd that kept growing at
Arlington Stadium, even as cable television flashed the game across
the land.
</P>
<P>
   His son Reid, then a freshman at Texas, dropped a report he was
writing on a Louis L'Amour novel to watch his father pitch the last
two innings. At Shea Stadium, the San Diego Padres and the New York
Mets put their postgame buffets on hold and crowded around the TV
sets in the clubhouses.
</P>
<P>
   And at the ballpark in Kansas City, while the Royals were
playing the Tigers, they picked up Ryan's no-hitter in progress on
the Diamond Vision screen in center field. Let the strangeness of
this sink in: The fans in Kansas City were ignoring a game they had
paid to see, taking place on the field in front of them, to watch
the telecast of a game being played almost 600 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Arlington, a scene both dramatic and eerily
symbolic was unfolding. From the press box, from the sixth inning
on, you could see the headlights of cars backed up for miles,
threading their way to the ballpark. Anyone who saw Field of Dreams
would have recognized the scene. Fans were desperate to buy a
ticket to a game that was nearly over, hoping to grab at least a
concluding glimpse of Ryan pitching one more hitless gem.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's final out was Roberto Alomar. When Ryan pitched his
first no-hitter for the California Angels 18 years earlier, his
second baseman was Sandy Alomar, Roberto's father. ``I've known
that kid since he was a toddler,'' said Ryan. ``He wanted to be a
pitcher.'' But Nolan showed him no mercy. He struck him out, his
16th of the game, and the seventh no-hitter was his.
</P>
<P>
   At that instant, in Kansas City, the fans gave a standing
ovation to the television screen, which showed a close-up of a
smiling Ryan, his right arm punching the air as his teammates
swarmed the mound. They hoisted him onto their shoulders and
carried him off.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Reid Ryan crushed a Coke can and jumped up and down.
In Arlington, Nolan's wife, Ruth, left her seat in the stands to
wait for her husband outside the clubhouse. She had arrived at the
stadium just before the first pitch, deciding at the last minute to
accept a ride on a private plane owned by an Alvin neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   He was young and restless in New York, celebrated in Anaheim and
idolized in Houston. But Ryan discovered the meaning of life in
Arlington. ``The secret,'' he said, ``is knowing that there is no
secret.'' There was just raw talent, refined by hard work and
humility.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his seventh no-hitter, with the reporters jockeying
for position around his locker and still lobbing questions at him,
he politely excused himself and walked over to the stationary bike.
He did his 45 minutes, already preparing for his next start.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan called that no-hitter his most meaningful, partly because
``it was a reflection of me as a complete pitcher,'' and partly
because it happened in Arlington, in front of the Rangers fans
``who have been so good to me.''
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the keys to Ryan's long and spectacular career.
This was how he could join a new club in 1989, adjust to new
teammates and new surroundings, and finish the season with 16 wins
and a major league-leading 301 strikeouts, all at the age of 42.
</P>
<P>
   Unless androids eventually take up baseball, no one will ever
duplicate his endurance: He played 27 seasons, still holds 48
major-league records, including walks and wild pitches, and his
most famous _ 5,714 batters who connected only with air, in 5,386
innings. He struck out eight father-and-son combinations, 12 sets
of brothers and 27 members of the Hall of Fame, among them two of
the newest, George Brett and Robin Yount.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the fans felt an attachment to Ryan that reached
far deeper than his statistics. It had to do with the fact that
this was one of the best human beings ever to play ball. The job
was temporary, and he understood this better than most.
</P>
<P>
   Are other examples in order?
</P>
<P>
   He pitched his sixth no-hitter in Oakland, against the
power-hitting Athletics, on June 11, 1990. He did it despite a
stress fracture in his lower back. His son, Reese, then 14, was on
the trip and in the dugout, working as a ballboy. Between innings,
he rubbed his father's back. After the last of the eighth, he
assured his father, ``We only need three more (outs).''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' manager, Bobby Valentine, who had played center
field for the Angels in Ryan's first no-hitter, said, ``It was a
Norman Rockwell scene.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a no-hit pitcher who too often labored for no-hit teams.
The pitchers on the 1919 Black Sox got better run support from
players trying to dump the Series.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of athletes seize on a modest amount of success to flaunt
their importance. Not Ryan. With remarkable patience, he mapped his
campaign over the years. He was his own coach, his own trainer, his
own chaperone. No one has ever heard of Nolan Ryan knocking a
manager or a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched in four cities under 10 managers without becoming
confused as a person. By the end of his career, he was the only
player who was a member of the FDIC, having purchased the Danbury
State Bank, 10 miles from Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   I covered his first start (a loss) and his first win for the
Mets, both occurring in the Astrodome before his family and
friends. Writing about him has been a source of unending
satisfaction. He made our jobs easier because success didn't change
him, not as a person and not as a competitor. He never saw himself
as a matinee idol or a showman. He is what he seems. If you search
for more, you risk missing the very essence of him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet writers always had to exercise particular care when it came
to Ryan because they tended to lose their critical faculties. I
remember when the Astros commissioned LeRoy Neiman to paint Nolan's
portrait. The finished work showed him halfway into his delivery,
with the flag visible behind him in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was how I saw him,'' said Neiman. ``I had at my disposal
a pitcher of such idealism that it was impossible to present him as
anything other than the All-American baseball player.'' You can
evoke all the rhythm and flavor and texture of the sport with one
freeze-frame of Ryan blowing a strike past a big hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 100 years, only six pitchers ever held more than
two teams hitless. The others were Sandy Koufax with four, and Jim
Maloney, Bob Feller, Cy Young and Larry Corcoran with three each.
Young retired in 1908. You may not remember Corcoran. His big year
was 1880, when he started 60 games, completed 57 and won 43. This
is the company Ryan keeps.
</P>
<P>
   Like an old man whittling wood, pitchers keep shaving their
thoughts until their philosophy is as smooth and fine as they can
shape it. Nolan studied the science of other pitchers, and this
helped him mature. Lew Burdette of the Braves put it simply: ``I
exploit the greed of all hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   There was this advice from Satchel Paige: ``Just take the ball
and throw it where you want. Throw strikes. Home plate don't
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan was still learning to pitch when he finally walked off the
job, with 324 wins and a list of strikeout records as long as his
arm. He was a very proud fellow, with a work ethic that was off the
charts. His humor was dry and often playful.
</P>
<P>
   So my favorite memory of Ryan isn't his classic duel with Rose
in 1981, when he allowed the single that tied Pete with Stan Musial
for the most career hits in the National League. It wasn't his
fifth no-hitter, over the Dodgers, in the Astrodome. It wasn't the
time he pitched against Ruth in a Fantasy Camp game and buzzed her
with a fastball high and inside, almost knocking her down. (I
jumped him about that. ``You jammed her? Your own wife?'' ``Had
to,'' he said. ``She was digging in on me.'')
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite is his 4,000th strikeout, an odd pick, I
concede. He was 12 short of that mark in 1985 when he started for
the Astros against the Mets. Running in the outfield before the
game, he passed Danny Heep, an ex-teammate who had been traded for
Mike Scott.
</P>
<P>
   As they crossed, Heep cried out a warning: ``You're not getting
me for 4,000, not me, not tonight!'' Nolan just laughed. ``That's
OK,'' he said. ``I don't figure it will be you, either.''
</P>
<P>
   As the innings rolled along, the strikeouts began to pile up.
After his total reached 11, Nolan glanced at the on-deck circle.
Guess who was stepping up to the plate. Yeah, Danny Heep. ``He just
stared at me,'' said Ryan, ``and he was shaking his head. It was
all over his face. I could see him thinking, Why didn't I just keep
my mouth shut?
</P>
<P>
   ``I started him off with a fastball, and he took it on the
outside corner for a strike. I threw him another over the plate and
he fouled it back to the screen: 0-and-2. I threw him a curve, down
and in, a tough pitch for a hitter to lay off. He swung and missed
and was gone on three pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, after he moved to the Rangers and Heep had joined the
Red Sox, they met at a restaurant in Arlington. Heep said, ``I wish
you would hurry up and get your 5,000th strikeout, so people would
quit talking about me being No. 4,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nolan: ``I didn't have the heart to tell him he was always
going to be No. 4,000. He just wasn't going to be talked about as
much.'' (Rickey Henderson, of Oakland, turned out to be No. 5,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really miss most about the game is the competition,''
said Ryan. ``I miss the routine of working out on a daily basis _
I'm probably one of the few guys who really enjoyed that. I miss
the camaraderie of the guys in the clubhouse, being a member of a
team. You don't replace that with anything else I know of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been in a clubhouse since the last time I took off
my uniform. Once you're not on the team, you're an outsider. I
don't care what you've done or what you contributed to the game.
You don't really belong there; it's not your clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   So this weekend, Lynn Nolan Ryan joins the most elite team of
all _ the one at Cooperstown. The train stops there.

NETWORKS DELIVER AN ALL-WHITE PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the networks are willing to do lunch with NAACP President
Kweisi Mfume to smooth over this race issue.
</P>
<P>
   Race issue as in oops, only one race on all the new fall shows.
Big surprise, the race is white.
</P>
<P>
   Even the space aliens are white. And by the way, there are more
of them in starring roles than blacks. Or Latinos. Or Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The implicit message is that as the networks figure it, white
viewers are more comfortable watching space aliens than watching
black people.
</P>
<P>
   I can spare Mfume the indigestion that would be sure to follow
his meal with network suits.
</P>
<P>
   With the utmost sincerity, the network execs would look Mfume
straight in the eye and tell him that nothing is more important to
them than rectifying the embarrassing shortage of minorities in
lead roles.
</P>
<P>
   They would also point out the ethnic diversity in their
supporting casts _ doesn't every white cop on TV get chewed out by
a black boss? _ and ABC might add that it features Nick Turturro on
``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Turturro? Last summer, critics were pelting Stu Bloomberg,
ABC Entertainment chairman, and Jamie Tarses, ABC Entertainment
president, over the absence of ethnic minorities on ABC's new
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Well, said Tarses, there was Jeffrey Sams in ``Cupid,'' which
has since been canceled. Bloomberg interjected, ``And Nick
Turturro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Tarses chirped. ``and Nick Turturro in `NYPD Blue.'''
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder why the networks are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sassa, NBC's top executive on the West Coast, was enduring
a similar grilling earlier this year. Sassa himself is Asian
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of ethnic diversity,'' he said, ``I think we need to
make sure that the shows we have on air accurately reflect the
composition of the audience that we're serving.''
</P>
<P>
   That was six months ago. And now, with the fall shows about to
drop from the shelf onto the air, Sassa seems to have met his
mandate _ provided that the audience NBC is serving is all white,
because Mfume won't find his own race reflected at the top of NBC's
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the NAACP's annual convention this week in New York,
Mfume noted that there isn't a minority lead in any of the major
networks' 27 new shows. True; you have to slide down to UPN, with
its ``Moesha'' spin-off and new Jaleel White comedy, to find
minority stars.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, TV was more amenable to black stars in 1951, when
``Beulah'' was on ABC and ``The Amos and Andy Show'' was on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   What the networks dare not say publicly is that they're
apparently convinced that black stars are anathema to ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that ``The Cosby Show'' was TV's smash hit of the
previous decade. Maybe Bill Cosby was unique in attracting a
crossover audience or maybe racial attitudes have hardened in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century into network TV, we're still awaiting the first
successful drama carried by a black lead. None, in 50-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have fared better in comedy. But the 1999-2000 television
season figures to be a scant year for sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume's complaint relates to a broader change in the television
business. The big networks, which are becoming smaller networks,
aren't in the practice of serving anyone well these days, except
for white urban viewers between the ages of 18 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   You could even argue that the networks are programming for a
minority. Their prime demographic is just that _ less than half of
the national population. But still, it's the group advertisers
crave.
</P>
<P>
   In other years, network programmers might have felt a moral
obligation to serve an audience that included blacks, older
viewers, children and rural Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After all, broadcasters use a public resource, the airwaves, to
operate for the interest, convenience and necessity of all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But TV is far more lightly regulated today, and the networks
have been taken over by bigger corporations with a bottom-line
obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Buckling under the pressure from cable and other competitors,
the broadcast networks have never been less interested in their
public obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Huge profits are no longer assured; the era of noblesse oblige
is over. Networks scrapping for survival are apt to postpone their
societal responsibilities. You'll sooner see people torn to pieces
by wild animals than a successful black family drama.
</P>
<P>
   Network behavior can be explained easily enough. It's
self-serving and loathsome almost by rote. But should the networks
have to force-feed shows to viewers that they apparently don't want
to watch? And sooner or later, doesn't the question shift from the
networks to the audience?
</P>
<P>
   That question is: Why won't sufficient numbers of white viewers
watch black TV stars, especially on TV dramas?
</P>
<P>
   On that topic, Mfume doesn't really need a candid exchange of
ideas with network executives.
</P>
<P>
   In one sore word, the reason is racism.

Solid roots in hometown become foundation for success
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all began at Shroeder Field.
</P>
<P>
   That was as close as you got to nirvana as a kid in Alvin, a
real Little League field with a real pitcher's mound, dugouts,
bleachers and even lights.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it began at Alvin Hardware, that day in 1954 when Nolan
Ryan was 7 years old and his father took him to buy his first
baseball glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of my favorite memories,'' Ryan said. ``Getting
to go with my dad down to Alvin Hardware and being the last of six
kids and getting to pick out, for the first time, anything new for
myself and it not being a hand-me-down. That was a new
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It was what kids in Alvin waited for and dreamed of _ being old
enough to move off the vacant lot and onto a real baseball field,
being old enough to play organized ball, to experience the
camaraderie of a team, the thrill of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As youngsters, the one thing the kids looked forward to was
getting old enough to play baseball in one of the youth league
teams,'' Ryan said. ``That was the highest thing you could look
forward to as a kid growing up in a small, rural town like that. To
go out to tryouts and stuff. That was a big event in your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my fondest memories of baseball were playing in the
youth leagues, playing the game for no other reason than for the
enjoyment of playing and feeling no pressure whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan can still remember the pride of putting on that uniform and
knowing that he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, to get your hat to start with, and you're on a team
for the first time '' Ryan said. ``And then the game rolls around
after practicing for two or three weeks and it seems like you'll
never get there. All kids probably get their uniforms on six hours
before the game, then beg their parents to get to the ballpark
three or four hours before they're supposed to. It's that
anticipation and excitement, and I still remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan pitched and played shortstop. There was no trip to
Williamsport, Pa., for the Little League World Series, no scouts
watching, no agents calling. It was simply a Little League
experience similar to that of millions of other kids, except that
his glove now hangs in a museum in Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so old you can't even read the numbers on it,'' Ryan
said. ``But you can read my name on it where I burned it in there
with a woodburning set to make sure nobody got it away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years later that Ryan went on his first date
with Ruth Holdorff, who would later become his wife. She was 13. He
was 15. He picked her up in his fire-engine-red 1952 Chevy (at the
time, Texas allowed teen-agers to get their license at 14). They
went to the movies, then on to DairyLand, Alvin's only fast-food
joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember him asking,'' Ruth said. ``He came up to me
and said, `Do you think your mom would let you go to a movie?' He'd
had a girlfriend, but they'd just broken up. She bet he wouldn't
ask me. I guess he got stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd known each other forever. Ruth's sister Lynn was in
Nolan's class. After their first date, their fates were sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just so definite; we knew,'' said Ingrid Holdorff,
Ruth's mom. ``But he was such a gentleman. You couldn't ask for
someone to be nicer to your daughter. She was very popular. I'm
sure there were lots of guys interested, but she was quite
definite.''
</P>
<P>
   The Most Handsome guy always dates the Most Beautiful girl in
the movies, but for Nolan and Ruth, that was real life as well.
Those were the tags given Nolan his sophomore year and Ruth as a
freshman by their Alvin High School classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love to tease them about that,'' said their son Reese. ``We
always tell them there must not have been much to choose from.''
</P>
<P>
   They were two of the most popular as well. Nolan was an
all-around athlete, also excelling on the basketball court. Ruth
was the 1965 Class 3A state doubles tennis champion, a member of
the student council and a cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   But all of Nolan's school-day memories aren't fond. Though a
leader on the field or court, he retreated in the classroom. As an
adult, it was discovered that he had dyslexia. But as a kid, he
simply felt stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really quiet,'' Ruth said. ``He struggled so much in
school because of the learning disability. One teacher thought he
was stupid and wanted to fail him. He was a C student, with a
couple of D's and F's mixed in. The hardest thing for him was
spelling. He also had a slight lisp, and as a result, he was shy in
the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   By Ryan's sophomore year, most of his free time was spent
playing baseball. By his junior year, he was unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophomore year, I didn't know he was that good,'' said former
Alvin High School baseball coach Jim Watson. ``He was real skinny.
He didn't have a whole lot of physical strength at the time. But he
threw harder than any other kid I'd seen. He was a good hitter, so
we used him in a lot of spots. He'd come up through Pony League,
and a lot of those coaches told me he was a pretty good pitcher but
a better outfielder.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked mainly in relief that first year. In his first start,
against Deer Park on March 15, 1963, he pitched 3 innings and gave
up seven hits and two walks. He struck out four, hit one batter and
came away without a decision in a 4-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first victory two weeks later, striking out 11 in 4
innings as Alvin beat Dickinson 2-1 on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan threw hard, but he was a bit wild. There was one game where
he hit four batters, another where he nailed three. But there were
just as many one- and two-hitters as Ryan began establishing
himself as one of the area's best pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, that ball jumped six to eight inches when it reached
the plate,'' Watson said. ``And he was wild. There were problems
with catchers who were afraid to catch him or couldn't hold onto
his ball.''
</P>
<P>
   George Pugh, a long-time neighbor and friend, was among those
who tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't blink and catch it, I'll tell you that,'' Pugh
said. ``You couldn't sit back and relax. If it wasn't right down
the middle, you were going to have to move to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan went 7-2 his junior year, catching the eye of Mets scout
Red Murff, who first saw him play against Deer Park in a tournament
on March 21, 1964. Ryan gave up eight hits and three walks in 4
innings as Alvin lost 6-1. Four days later, Ryan pitched his first
complete game, allowing only three hits and striking out 12 as
Alvin beat West Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Murff told me that Nolan had one of the top 10 arms in the
U.S., but I thought for sure he was exaggerating,'' Watson said.
``We didn't have a radar gun back then. I don't think I really
believed it until one afternoon when Nolan pitched a two-hitter.
Then my wife and I went to the Astrodome where Larry Dierker was
pitching against Jim Maloney. They were the two fireballers back
then. And I thought to myself, Nolan can throw faster than that.
That was the first indication that I had.''
</P>
<P>
   By Ryan's senior year, his fastball was becoming legendary
around small-town Texas. Alvin had only one .300 hitter on the team
that year, but it went to the state final on the strength of Ryan's
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan didn't have any idea where the ball was going, but he
didn't have to thread the needle either,'' Watson said. ``Those
kids were so scared, they'd swing at anything just to get out of
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He went 6-0 to begin the season and didn't lose until his 10th
appearance. That 2-1 loss to Wharton on April 9, 1965, would be his
last in high school.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, Ryan faced Brenham for the second time in the
regional playoffs. Three days earlier, he threw a complete game,
striking out 16 and allowing only six hits for a 2-1 victory in the
first of a three-game series. Brenham, the preseason favorite to
win the state title, tied the series by winning Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   As Game 3 started, Ryan clearly had his stuff. Alvin gave up a
run on an error, but Ryan got stronger as the innings passed,
striking out 12 and throwing his first official no-hitter in a 3-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brenham had five guys off that team sign pro contracts,''
Watson said. ``They could hit. But I knew in the first inning that
Nolan was going to be awesome that night. He'd thrown a lot of
one-, two-hitters and taken a lot of no-hitters into the sixth or
seventh (they only played seven innings in high school), but this
was special. There was so much on the line and he knew we weren't
going to score a lot. He was just awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   He got one more win in high school, sending Alvin to the state
final. The Yellowjackets lost the title 6-3 to Waxahachie, with
Ryan getting a no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Mets came calling. Their call came late, as New
York selected Ryan 295th overall in the spring 1965 draft. To Ryan,
that was a sign that he should take some college classes and have a
backup plan.
</P>
<P>
   With the goal of transferring to Texas A&AMP;M and studying to
become a veterinarian, Ryan enrolled in Alvin Community College and
took a few courses during the baseball offseason. It quickly became
apparent that school would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth recently was cleaning out some mementos when she came
across a notebook. For one of his courses, Ryan had been assigned
to write five future goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three of them were to own his own ranch (he now owns several),
to have his own cattle (he has herds) and to be able to play
major-league baseball,'' Ruth said. ``I think these were all things
he thought he'd never reach.''

New York doesn't become apple of young pitcher's eye
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the places he could have landed to start his major-league
career in the late 1960s, New York City seemed the least desirable
for Nolan Ryan, a young country boy from Alvin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was the square peg. The Big Apple was the round hole. The
match just wasn't there. He was used to wide-open spaces and
friendly folks, commodities in short supply in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated that place,'' Ryan once said of his days in New York.
``I'd get cabin fever, sitting around the house. Then you'd drive
to the ballpark and, no matter what time you went, there would be
traffic and people getting in fights, honking, flipping people off,
yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't in Alvin anymore, that was for sure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the culture shock, Ryan's formative years were
spent with an organization that was loaded with pitching talent,
another major factor in his 29-38 record over parts of five
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Ryan's control deserted him, or he developed those
persistent blisters on his right thumb and middle finger, or he had
to fulfill his military obligation by attending reserve camp during
the season, he slid farther down the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Led by farm director Whitey Herzog, the Mets had stockpiled
pitching. In addition to Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Gary Gentry,
they had layers of pitchers underneath their upper crust.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets gathered for the 1967 Instructional League, they
had 14 pitchers on their roster. Within one year, 11 of them had
made it to majors. It was easy for a pitcher with even Ryan's vast
potential to get pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   There was little room for missteps by a young, untamed pitcher
whose ability was far from being harnessed. As much an outcast as
he was living in Queens, Ryan was equally on the outside in the
Mets' pitching scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan had only one winning season, going 6-3 in 1969. In addition
to his well-documented blisters, Ryan had reserve duty and a groin
injury that kept him out of the mix for parts of that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, it turned out to be one of those situations
where things just didn't match up,'' Ryan said. ``The combination
of how many good, young pitchers there were and my military
obligations, that made for some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan was traded to the California Angels on Dec. 10, 1971,
he was hungry for the chance to escape New York. Frustrated by the
lack of clarity concerning his role and his own lack of success,
Ryan said he was close to quitting baseball in the summer of 1970
and again in '71. Only the persistence of his wife, Ruth, prevented
Ryan from returning to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's career in the Mets organization started out much
brighter. In 1965, the first year of baseball's amateur draft, Ryan
was selected in the 10th round. In Ryan's first full season in
professional baseball, he was 17-2 with 272 strikeouts in 183
innings at Class A Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   To get a first-hand look at their latest pitching phenom, the
Mets called up Ryan late in the '66 season. After pitching once in
relief against Atlanta, Ryan made his first major-league start at
age 19 on Sept. 18, 1966, at the Astrodome, but it was hardly
memorable. Ryan lasted only one inning, striking out three batters
but walking three and allowing four runs in a 9-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was back in the minors at the start of the 1967 season, but
the first in a series of injuries set back his progress. While
warming up for a game at Class AA Jacksonville, Ryan felt a twinge
in his right forearm and was finished for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, there was no such thing as exploratory surgery.
Ryan was sent home and told to report for the Instructional League
in October. His arm had improved by spring training in 1968, but
the Mets had a new manager in Gil Hodges and a pitching staff that
included Seaver, Koosman, Don Cardwell, Cal Koonce, Al Jackson,
Dick Selma and a host of young prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan made his first start that season on Easter Sunday (April
14) in the Astrodome. This time, he was overpowering, striking out
seven of the first 10 batters he faced and earning his first
major-league victory, 4-0 over the Astros and Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, however, had to leave that game in the seventh inning when
he developed blisters on the middle finger of his right hand.
During the 1968 season, he twice spent time on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the blisters and a stint in the reserves
interrupted what had started out as a good season. He was 6-5 on
June 23 but did not win a game the rest of the season, finishing
6-9 with 133 strikeouts and 75 walks in 134 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the Mets pulled off an amazing turnaround by winning
the National League pennant over Atlanta and then shocking heavily
favored Baltimore in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   For Ryan, it was a bittersweet season. He made only 10 starts,
slowed by military obligations and the depth of the Mets' staff. He
was used in relief 15 times, and at times it seemed the Mets were
leaning toward using him as a reliever despite his wildness.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges showed surprising faith in Ryan during the Mets'
clinching game of the National League Championship Series against
Atlanta. With runners on second and third, no one out and Rico
Carty at the plate, Ryan was brought in to relieve Gentry. He
struck out Carty, got out of the inning unscathed and allowed only
three hits the rest of the way in a 7-4 win that gave the Mets the
pennant.
</P>
<P>
   In the World Series, Ryan was bypassed as a starter and relieved
once. This time, he took over in Game 3 with the bases loaded and
two out in the seventh and gave up what looked to be an extra-base
hit to Paul Blair. A leaping catch by Tommie Agee in right-center
saved the day for the Mets, who went on to win 5-0, with Ryan
saving the win for Gentry. The Mets won the next two games and beat
the Orioles 4-1 in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   After coming through in the postseason pressure, Ryan seemed on
his way to stardom with the Mets early in the 1970 season. He
struck out 15 in a one-hit win over Philadelphia in April. In his
first 27 innings that season, Ryan allowed only six hits and struck
out 28 batters.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan never sustained that pace. He finished the season at
7-11 and set a team record with 97 walks. The death of Ryan's
father at age 63 in Alvin hung over Nolan throughout the summer,
causing him again to consider quitting baseball.
</P>
<P>
   By 1971, it was clear that Ryan was no longer considered a
phenom by the Mets. They had Seaver, Koosman, Gentry and Jim
McAndrew as their top four in the starting rotation, meaning Ryan
was the fifth starter and his turn was skipped when the schedule _
and his military obligation _ dictated.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the season, Ryan went to Mets general manager
Bob Scheffing and asked to be traded. The Mets had a chance to
acquire veteran infielder Jim Fregosi from California and included
Ryan as part of a four-player package.
</P>
<P>
   Fregosi lasted little more than one season in New York and was
Ryan's manager in California in the late 1970s. Ryan, meanwhile,
initially was not overjoyed when he learned where he was headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd gone in to Bob Scheffing in September and told him I
thought it might be better for both of us if they had an
opportunity to move me to go ahead,'' Ryan said. ``That December,
the last day of the winter meetings, I had told Ruth that this
might be the day it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just walking out the door to go to class at Alvin
Community College when Ruth said it was Bob Scheffing on the phone.
He told me I was going to sunny California. I thought, all right,
I'm going to the Dodgers. I'd never even thought that it might be
the Angels. I didn't know much about them. But it worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a team that was in the building stages and I got to
pitch every fourth day. My military obligation was over that year,
and I went from pitching 130 innings with the Mets to 300-plus
innings each year with the Angels. At that point in my career,
really, that's all I was looking for.''

With stakes high, contract dispute forces a final move
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Nolan Ryan signed as a free agent with the Astros on Nov.
19, 1979, money was no object. Astros owner John J. McMullen made
Ryan the highest-paid athlete in history by signing him to a
four-year contract worth approximately $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, when Ryan left the Astros to sign with the
Texas Rangers in December 1988, the relationship between McMullen
and Ryan had soured to the point where $300,000 prevented Ryan from
finishing his career in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the contract I signed (in 1979) would be my last
one,'' said Ryan. ``I'd be 37 when that contract was up, and I
figured that would be it. I thought I'd pitch (in Houston) till
that contract was up and I'd finish my career with the Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ryan lasted until 1988 with the Astros and wanted to
pitch at least one more season. The day Ryan signed with the
Rangers was one of the darkest in Houston sports history.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen, who started out the decade of the 1980s as one of
baseball's free spenders, had become fiscally conservative by 1988.
He drew his line in the sand with Ryan, wanting the all-time
strikeout leader to take a 20 percent cut in his base salary of
$1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives based on the number of starts could have made the
contract roughly equal to what Ryan made in 1988, but the way in
which the negotiations were handled turned McMullen into public
enemy No. 1 in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Astros offered Ryan the same amount of guaranteed money
in 1989, Ryan likely would have stayed. As negotiations unfolded,
Ryan quickly knew the Astros had no intention of keeping him, and
he was incensed that McMullen wanted him to take a pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   Astros fans were aghast when Ryan signed with the Rangers, who
gave him a two-year contract worth a total of $3.2 million before
re-signing him after the 1990 season. The publicity nightmare in
Houston lasted until McMullen sold the club to Drayton McLane Jr.
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plane ride home from Atlanta (where the 1988 winter
meetings were held) was one of the low moments in my career,'' Ryan
said. ``I had thought all along that I'd finish my career with the
Astros. Instead of living at home, I was going to have to go
elsewhere. I wasn't sure what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Ryan went to the Rangers and found the
national attention that had eluded him during his time in Houston.
After pitching well into his 40s _ throwing two more no-hitters and
leading the American League in strikeouts twice _ Ryan was able to
reflect on his stormy relationship with McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can look at my relationship now with John as a
positive,'' said Ryan. ``He brought me to Houston and gave me the
opportunity to pitch in my hometown for nine years. When things
didn't work out, I went to Texas for another five years. What I
thought was a negative turned out to be a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years earlier, Ryan had to overcome some negatives after
becoming the highest-paid professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, it seemed McMullen bid against himself in 1979,
raising the price for Ryan to make a splash by cracking the $1
million mark. Ryan, uncomfortable with the attention of being the
highest-paid player in history, tried to shrug off the contract as
a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, his first season with the Astros, the pressure was on
Ryan to deliver the team to its first division title. The Astros
started the season with a remarkable starting rotation, teaming
flamethrowers Ryan and J.R. Richard with knuckleballer Joe Niekro.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Richard suffered a stroke that ended his career. The
Astros let a big lead in the NL West over Los Angeles slip away in
the final weekend and had to win a one-game playoff for the
division title.
</P>
<P>
   They led Philadelphia two games to one in the best-of-five NL
Championship Series but lost the next two games in extra innings.
In Game 5, Ryan was on the mound with a 5-2 lead in the eighth
inning but failed to hold it. The Astros lost 8-7 in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Before that game, Ryan was 112-3 with three no-decisions since
1972 when he had a lead after seven innings. The sudden and
unsuccessful finish to his first season in Houston remains with him
to this date.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that close and don't make it, that stays with you a
long time,'' Ryan said. ``The same thing happened later (in 1986)
but that one stung, because we felt we were in good position to get
to the World Series. By then, I had played long enough to realize
what a unique opportunity it is to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   After going 11-10 in 1980, Ryan was dominant in the
strike-shortened 1981 season. He was 11-5 with a league-low 1.69
ERA. In 149 innings, he allowed only two home runs. On Sept. 26,
1981, Ryan pitched the fifth no-hitter of his career, passing Sandy
Koufax as the all-time leader.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-0 win over Los Angeles came as the Astros were on their
way to winning the second-half title in the NL West. They took a
2-0 lead over the Dodgers in the best-of-five first round of the
playoffs but once again failed to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won three straight games at Dodger Stadium. Ryan,
who won Game 1 on a two-hitter, was the losing pitcher in Game 5,
falling 4-0 to Jerry Reuss and the Dodgers, who went on to win the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 to 1985, the Astros were a bland team that finished 10
or more games out of first place three times in four seasons.
Attendance in the Astrodome dropped from 1.6 million in 1982 to 1.1
million in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan provided most of the few highlights during those years. In
1983, he became baseball's all-time strikeout leader, passing the
mark of 3,508 held by Walter Johnson. However, Ryan was a combined
52-44 in those four seasons, which were the hallmark of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Ryan was 10-12, his first losing season since 1978. He
had a 3.80 ERA, the highest since 1971, his final season with the
Mets. He was using a changeup more often and with greater
effectiveness by the end of the season, something that would allow
him to pitch longer than he ever dreamed he'd be able.
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, he had not lost much off his fastball. Nor had
he lost any of the competitive fire. Though he was closing in on 40
years old, Ryan agreed to two contract extensions that he thought
would surely keep him in Houston for the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He figured time was running out for him to return to a World
Series, where he had not been since 1969. In 1986, the Astros were
picked by one national sports publication to lose 100 games.
Instead, the Astros went 96-66 and won the NL West by 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The top two starters in the Astros' rotation were Mike Scott,
who won the Cy Young Award, and lefthander Bob Knepper. Ryan twice
was put on the disabled list because of an elbow injury, and a
decision was made by Astros medical personnel to limit his pitches
to 100 in an attempt to spare his elbow from getting worse. He was
12-8 in 30 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was hardly ready for the old folks' home, though. The night
before Scott clinched the division title with a no-hitter over San
Francisco, Ryan struck out 16 Giants in eight innings and had a
no-hitter through 6 innings. He struck out 10 of the last 12
batters he faced, including five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in Ryan's first seven seasons in Houston, the
Astros made it to the postseason. Once again, they failed to make
the World Series, losing one of the most memorable playoff series
ever in six games to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan lost Game 2 of the series in the Astrodome and had no
decision in Game 5, when he hooked up against Dwight Gooden for a
1-1 tie through nine innings. Ryan pitched most of the game despite
suffering a hairline fracture in his left ankle while sliding into
second base.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan struck out eight of the first 12 batters he faced. He gave
up two hits in nine innings, walked one and struck out 12. The only
run he allowed was a home run by Darryl Strawberry in the fifth.
The Mets scored off the Astros' bullpen in the bottom of the 12th
for a 2-1 win and 3-2 edge in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wanted to win that game more than any game I'd
pitched,'' Ryan said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros blew a 3-0 lead in the ninth inning of Game 6 the
next afternoon and eventually lost 7-6 in 16 innings. Once again,
Ryan was denied a chance for a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, still working under a limit of 100 to 125 pitches that
he grew to despise, Ryan had a truly unbelievable season. He led
the league with a 2.76 ERA and 270 strikeouts in 211 innings.
However, he was 8-16, as the Astros averaged 3.35 runs in his 34
starts. In his 16 losses, Houston scored 13 runs while he was still
in the game. He went 0-5 in July but had a 2.36 ERA that month.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, it became clear that McMullen was going to dump
Ryan. There were many theories as to what happened between the men.
But whatever mad logic went into the thought process, the Astros
and their fans were the losers in this confrontation. Ryan,
meanwhile, went on to greater glory with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a firm believer that things happen for a
reason,'' Ryan said. ``I was able to pitch in my hometown for nine
seasons because of John, and then I was able to move on to the
Rangers and have that great experience because of him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look back on it, and I guess things worked out the way
they were supposed to work out.''

Despite some shaky moments, California strikes gold
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the trade came down, folks in Southern California figured
it was the steal of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, most worried that they were on the wrong end of the
heist.
</P>
<P>
   Some kid named Nolan Ryan was coming to the Angels. Big arm, no
clue where the ball was going, tepid results in parts of five
seasons with the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   And for this, the Angels had parted with Mr. Angel, the great
Jim Fregosi.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that the transition from one coast to the
other and from National to American Leagues had its rocky moments _
all magnified by the arrival of son Reid and the specter of a
strike that threatened to delay the start of the season, and a
much-needed paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Ryan would describe his eight years in Anaheim as
``the foundation of my career.'' It began, however, with more
moments in which he considered packing up and going home than ones
spent pondering the text for his acceptance speech in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the looming strike threatened to make Ryan a
rancher. That first spring training camp, the Ryans lived in a
borrowed trailer in Holtville, Calif. When the team moved on to
Palm Springs, Nolan made a daily 180-mile round trip commute in a
borrowed Volkswagen Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Things were so tight that Ryan borrowed $1,500 to rent a house
in Anaheim for the season to come. Had the strike lasted very long
_ ultimately, opening day was delayed and eight games lost _ the
family would have been packing up and heading back to Alvin.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, some Angels fans probably wished he had done just
that. Ryan had what he termed ``a horrible spring,'' and it
continued with a 2-4 start in which he failed to last beyond the
fifth inning five times, rendering hearts all the fonder about the
departed Fregosi.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Tom Morgan, who in time would become a close
friend, worked on streamlining Ryan's delivery. In late May, they
began to get results as Ryan won nine of 10 decisions, pitching
five consecutive complete games in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The run culminated with a one-hitter in which he struck out
eight straight batters and fanned the side on the minimum nine
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the smoke cleared, few were lamenting Fregosi, who
went on to become another in a long line of failed third-base
candidates with the Mets. After going 29-38 in New York, Ryan
finished that '72 season with a 19-16 record, leading the league in
strikeouts (329) and walks (157) while completing 20 games and
compiling a 2.28 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grieve, then an outfielder with the first-year Texas
Rangers, says those numbers don't begin to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, they didn't keep pitch counts,'' Grieve said. ``And
he's walking nine or 10 guys in some of those games. There were
probably a lot of times when he was throwing 200 pitches a game
when he was 22, 23 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, later a Rangers general manager and now a television
announcer for the club, laughs at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a guy throwing 200 pitches now, you'll be taken in
front of a judge for child abuse. The agent will get into it. The
league will investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan threw plenty of pitches the next two seasons, starting a
total of 83 games and finishing with records of 21-16 and 22-16. He
struck out a major-league record 383 hitters in '73 and 367 the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   In each of those seasons, the Angels scored a paltry 22 runs in
the 16 losses. Undaunted, Ryan posted ERAs of 2.87 and 2.89 and
threw a total of 52 complete games.
</P>
<P>
   He tossed the first of his seven no-hitters on May 15, 1973, at
Kansas City. His second came two months later at Detroit. No. 3
would follow on Sept. 28, 1974, at home against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly gritty performance, Ryan threw 235 pitches
in a 13-inning outing against Boston and got a no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century later, Grieve vividly recounts the ``thrill''
of stepping to the plate against a young Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only pitcher I faced _ other than J.R. Richard in
Oklahoma City, where you couldn't see because of the lights _ that
fear entered into the at-bat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was throwing so hard, and he was wild, and you knew he was
mean. He'd knock you down, and you never knew whether it was on
purpose or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a curveball that he threw so hard, and it broke so
much. It started up around your head, and if you couldn't recognize
it and it turned out to be a fastball, you were going to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I backed off the plate a little bit. I backed up in the box a
little bit. Instead of being nice and relaxed up there, every part
of your body was alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Those years would showcase Ryan at his most dominant. In August
of '74, his fastball was clocked at 100.9 miles an hour, though
Ryan believes he has thrown harder than that.
</P>
<P>
   All that effort, however, would begin to exact a toll.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Ryan started the season 10-3 with five shutouts, seven
complete games and an ERA of 2.24. On June 1, he produced his
fourth no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble, however, was on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's elbow had been hurting for months. After one mid-April
start, he awoke to discover that he could not fully extend his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Jobe, the noted orthopedist, prescribed ice and
whirlpool treatments, but the pain persisted. In August, after
losing nine of 13 decisions (eight straight at one point), Ryan
finally told the club he could go on no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium deposits were removed. Once again, Ryan pondered the
question of whether he would pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my arm wasn't better the next spring,'' he said, ``I was
going to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be necessary, though Ryan was up-and-down in 1976.
He pitched in 39 games and struck out 327 hitters but went 17-18
with a 3.36 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues were mental. Some of the trouble was because
of stiffness, and the elbow occasionally would catch. In trying to
compensate, Ryan fell into bad habits as well.
</P>
<P>
   He lost five straight in May but came back to win seven of his
last eight decisions and finished with 21 complete games, seven of
them shutouts. The following year, he went 19-16 with 341
strikeouts and a 2.77 ERA, , with 22 complete games and four
shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the good times in Anaheim were coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Buzzie Bavasi arrived as executive vice president. A
month later, GM Harry Dalton left after Bavasi accused him of
running a ``country club.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan didn't like Bavasi or his ways, and physical problems added
to the pitcher's misery.
</P>
<P>
   A pulled hamstring put Ryan on the disabled list from June 14 to
July 5. Later, a rib separation landed him on the DL from Aug. 20
to Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a 10-13 season and a 3.71 ERA had Bavasi eyeing the
bottom line as Ryan eyed the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have come back as long as he was the general
manger,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   His contract, however, ran one more season, and it would be an
eventful one.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, then 7, was struck by a car, eventually losing his spleen
and a kidney. As his son endured a lengthy hospital stay, Nolan was
helping the Angels win the American League West for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the distractions, Ryan finished 16-14 with a 3.59 ERA
and 17 complete games. His contract was up, and agent Dick Moss
approached the Angels with an incentive-heavy proposal that could
have made Ryan the game's first $1 million player.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi scoffed at the offer. In one particularly colorful
moment, he indicated he could replace Ryan with two 8-7 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, that comment echoed when, in June 1992,
the Angels retired Ryan's number while he was still pitching in the
major leagues. And while Nolan speaks fondly of the California
years, life once again was changing.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi would save his money. The Ryans were on their way back to
Houston.

<P>
   A revolution within the revolution. Looking back, we might have
seen it coming.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming democratic vote for the Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami two years ago and then the repression, the closing
of newspapers, the trial of Tehran's mayor, the murder of
intellectuals, the repeated flouting by the old parliament of
Khatami's call for a ``civil society,'' for a place without fear.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a sign of the arrogance of the old guard _ the
bazaaris and the mullahs and those who clustered around the Supreme
Leader _ that they never guessed that an attack on the students of
Tehran would ignite the flame.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, it is the students who now find
themselves amid the flames.
</P>
<P>
   It was the students who were attacked by police on the Tehran
campus, the students who marched in the street crying for ``an end
to despotism'' _ how like the revolution of 1979 _ and the students
whose power forced the arrest of the senior policemen who assaulted
them.
</P>
<P>
   It was students, too, who appeared on the streets of Tehran
again Tuesday, ignoring even their president's appeals for calm as
they came under tear-gas attack from the police.
</P>
<P>
   And those very men who had achieved such total theocratic power
on the shoulders of Khomeini's students, who had wrested Iran from
the most powerful dictator in the Middle East with students' blood,
who had encouraged the ``students of the Imam'' to clamber over the
walls of the American and British embassies 20 years ago, forgot
the very source of their own street power.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, the interior ministry police and their vigilante
allies decided to teach Tehran University undergraduates a lesson
last week _ the students had been protesting at the closure of
another pro-Khatami newspaper, Salam _ and found themselves facing
a revolt.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into a familiar history. In January, 1962, the
Shah had sent his police into Tehran University, viciously
assaulting male and female students and prompting the chancellor to
resign with the angry accusation that ``when we inspected the
university buildings we were faced with the same situation as if an
army of barbarians had invaded an enemy territory.''
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the police of the Islamic Republic moved into the
same university _ just 37 years later _ prompting the resignation
of the university president and the minister of higher education
amid identical scenes of brutality. Tuesday, tear gas was still
drifting through the student dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   To generalize about the causes of the student revolt is easy.
Frustration and economic misfortune, a gathering fury at the
intolerance of the old and uneducated men who chose to shut off the
freedoms they had been promised, a conviction that they were being
cheated of the democracy they had voted for.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally easy to be taken in by the cliches of the
West: that this is a struggle between ``doves and hawks,'' between
``hard-liners and moderates'' and all the other characters from
satellite television's central casting.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the structure of the Islamic Republic set up
by Ayatollah Khomeini was deeply flawed. By creating both an
elected president and an unelected Supreme Leader, Iran would
inevitably fail to function as a nation-state.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the president tolerated a theocracy _ or, given the
Shia Muslim fascination with death, a necrocracy _ and as long as
the guidance of the Supreme Leader went as unquestioned as a
medieval pope, Iran could hold together.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment a president _ in this case Khatami _ demanded the
rule of civil law before the law of religion, he would come into
conflict with the theological regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   And so, what emerged after the May 1997 elections was
inevitable: the unelected regime of Khamenei became the government
and the elected government of Khatami became the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is extraordinary _ and a mark of Khatami's
peaceful intentions _ that it took two years for this contradiction
to explode into violence.
</P>
<P>
   And the regime's power _ the very theological edifice that
demanded the obedience of every Iranian in Imam Khomeini's name _
has now begun to crumble. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The students demanded _ unspeakable heresy _ ``explanations''
from the Supreme Leader who had never had to explain himself.
Khamenei tried to explain himself and condemned the security
forces. The two police chiefs were forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   There would be compensation for those arrested and a full
inquiry into the deaths of two students _ a Khatami man in Tehran
and a Khamenei man in Tabriz _ and a harsh condemnation from
President Khatami of the interior ministry police and their Ansar
e-Hizballah vigilante friends who stormed into the university
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, there were signs that the erring security
police would at last be transferred from the control of Khamenei to
the Khatami-run interior ministry _ a sure sign that the elected
government might be taking power from the unelected regime.
</P>
<P>
   That the conservatives in parliament have still not understood
this is inevitable. Guardians of the sacred memory of Khomeini,
they would not _ could not _ accept any criticism.
</P>
<P>
   When Salam published documents purporting to prove that an
Iranian secret service agent was not only guilty of political
assassination but of instigating anti-press laws, they rushed to
shut it down. And the students of Tehran objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were peaceful and no one expected this response from the
authorities,'' a Tehran businessman said Tuesday after prowling
through the ruins of one university block. ``But the police made a
big mistake _ to attack students like this and at night!
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the president and the guide (Supreme Leader) were obliged
to say `we support the students.' But it is positive for Mr.
Khatami. It has made our President very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   It has certainly weakened Khamenei. The Supreme Leader, speaking
to 10,000 demonstrating students in Tehran, was met with shouts of
derision from the crowd who yelled: ``Either Islam and the law _ or
another revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This bitter incident,'' Khamenei said of the police attack,
``hurt my heart.'' The students could scarcely hear him. &QL;

Chances of topping no-hitter mark far-flug
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Some of the numbers were inevitable. Pitch 27
seasons, throw 95 miles per hour _ or better _ for more than a
quarter-century, and certain things are likely to come a fellow's
way.
</P>
<P>
   Those 324 wins, for instance, represent a relatively modest 12
per year. The 5,714 strikeouts, impressive as they are, remain at
least partly a product of longevity as well.
</P>
<P>
   Magic moments, however, are a very different matter. There is no
grinding them out. They arrive, instead, as a by-product of
personal brilliance, of a rare sense of history and theater, and no
one enjoyed more of them along the way than Lynn Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Those seven no-hitters tell part of the story, but only part.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of other ones that were real close,'' he
said. ``You tend to forget them.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball _ the ultimate numbers game _ does not forget. Delve
into the record books a little, and the true extent of Nolan Ryan's
dominance becomes even more apparent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the magnificent seven, Ryan pitched 12
one-hitters between 1970 and 1990. He also had 19 two-hitters, 31
three-hitters and 27 four-hit games in the course of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Those may be the truest measure of 27 years of throwing heat. It
is those seven times Ryan walked off the mound with a ``0'' under
the ``H,'' though, that are at the heart of the legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan threw it down the strike zone harder than any human
being I ever saw,'' said Jeff Torborg, who caught Ryan's first
no-hitter on May 15, 1973. ``In 1973, against the Red Sox, he threw
a pitch a little up and over my left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached up for it, and it tore a hole in the webbing of my
glove and hit the backstop at Fenway Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Ryan was throwing hard enough when he overpowered the
Kansas City Royals 3-0 for no-hitter No. 1. He struck out 12 and
walked only three, and the lone close call came when shortstop Rudy
Meoli made an over-the-shoulder catch of a popup into short left
center.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Ryan would do it again, becoming the fifth
pitcher in history to throw two no-hitters in a season.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he would make it look even easier.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Tigers in Detroit, he struck out 17, with 16 of
those coming in the first seven innings. His arm stiffened a bit in
the course of the Angels' five-run eighth inning but he had enough
left to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was quick, and tricky as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an excellent curveball, too,'' catcher Art Kusnyer
said. ``He'd throw the curve 88 to 90 miles an hour. Guys would
swing straight down at it. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' Norm Cash evidently couldn't, either. Late in the
game, Cash came to the plate with a table leg instead of a bat,
telling home-plate umpire Ron Luciano that it would make no
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan nearly made it back-to-back no-hitters his next time out,
taking a no-hitter into the eighth, and he added a one-hitter in
August of that same season.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he would save his best for last. On Sept.
24, in his final start of the season, Ryan turned in no-hitter No.
3 in a 4-0 win over the Twins in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan definitely had it that day,'' said Tom Egan, who caught
Ryan's third no-no. ``It was like driving a powerful sports car. It
was fun going along for that ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Meoli again was a big part of the game, making two tough plays
on grounders in a game in which Ryan walked eight.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 _ the one that tied Sandy Koufax for most ever _ took
shape on June 1, 1975, again in Anaheim. It also came as something
of a surprise to catcher Ellie Rodriguez, who feared trouble as the
two warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have his good stuff at all,'' Rodriguez said later.
``He was having a tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to Rodriguez or anyone else on the team, Ryan was
having elbow problems. He gradually found his fastball as the game
went on, but his choice for the concluding pitch spoke of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With Bobby Grich at the plate and a 2-2 count, Rodriguez called
for another fastball. Ryan shook him off and went for a changeup,
which a stunned Grich took for a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw very few changeups in those days,'' Ryan said. ``But I
knew if I threw one and got it over the plate, I had him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be six years, and another change of leagues, before he
would add to the total and his legend. The record would become
Ryan's alone on Sept. 26, 1981, when he pitched at home for the
Astros against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the one thing I wanted,'' he said later. ``I'd had a
shot at it for a long time, but because of my age (then 34), I
thought I wouldn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the stamina I used to have, but that day I
really had my curveball working and I got ahead of the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   With Alan Ashby behind the plate, Ryan struck out 11 and walked
just three. Dusty Baker grounded to Art Howe at third for the final
out of a 5-0 game.
</P>
<P>
   That last pitch, Ashby recalls, flirted with disaster. It was a
high curve, but Baker _ looking for a fastball _ got too far out
front and hit the ball on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to catch that one, the one that broke the record,
was a mind-boggling experience,'' Ashby said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ryan, it was meaningful in another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan would not be done boggling minds, though it would be a long
wait between no-hitters _ so long, in fact, that he had just about
given up on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, June 11, 1990, didn't seem to be his day.
</P>
<P>
   His back hurt so much that he had an appointment scheduled with
a specialist the next day. In his previous five starts, he was 0-3
with an earned-run average of 8.86. In the course of the game
against the A's in Oakland, 14-year-old Reese sat next to his
father in the dugout, rubbing his back.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also was working for the first time with John Russell, a
journeyman catcher the Rangers had called up in the wake of
injuries to Mike Stanley and Geno Petralli.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some trouble with his back early,'' Russell said that
night. ``But then he started getting stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan needed 132 pitches to record No. 6, and 93 of those were
fastballs. He struck out 14 and was helped by the fact that the A's
were without regulars Jose Canseco (bad back), Carney Lansford
(bicep) and Mark McGwire, who had struck out against Ryan three
times the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   As he had done in his second no-hitter 17 years earlier, Ryan
called his own pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his game,'' Russell said. ``He had that look, unlike
anything I'd ever seen. He smelled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Ryan would pick up the scent one more
time. It would be perhaps the most memorable night in Rangers
history, and the man at the center of the excitement once more
displayed a keen sense of the moment, even at age 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he pitched that no-hitter because it was
Arlington Appreciation Night,'' Rangers broadcaster Tom Grieve
recalled with a smile. ``But he knew it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big crowd, and he was probably giving them something
a little extra. Once he realized it, he was going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching on three days' rest in order to appear on the special
occasion, Ryan was overpowering. He retired 27 of 29 batters,
walking Kelly Gruber in the first and Joe Carter in the seventh. He
tied his club record with 16 strikeouts, the last of those ending
the game when he got Roberto Alomar with his 122nd pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the victim underscored just how long this no-hit
business had been going on: Alomar's father, Sandy, was a Ryan
teammate with the Angels in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nolan was picking on a second generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me how to pitch when I was a little kid,'' Roberto
Alomar said. ``And I got my first major-league hit off him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this was his way of repaying me.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Ryan made the younger Alomar a footnote to history
_ the last out of the last no-hitter in a record that may never be
approached, much less broken.

   Just 1.6 percent of visits to online merchants result in a
purchase, according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group for
Shop.org, an industry organization for Web retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Why? After security and privacy concerns, consumers cite the
need to reenter personal data at different merchants as one of the
main drawbacks of shopping online, says David Pecaut, head of the
E-commerce practice at Boston Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wallet,'' he says, ``has the potential to make things much
simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   What's a virtual wallet? Simply a standardized form into which
you enter your name, address, and credit-card number. Every time
you make a purchase online, the affiliated merchant gets access to
your billing and mailing data from the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A boon for cyber-shoppers? It promises to be, but it isn't yet.
</P>
<P>
   The assortment of wallets is likely to confuse even hard-core
techies. Expect to encounter pitches for virtual wallets from
online stores, Web portal sites like Yahoo and Excite, and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a chaotic period,'' says Denis Yaro, executive
vice-president of CyberCash, an electronic-commerce company in
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberCash solution, InstaBuy, lets you sign up for a wallet
at a participating merchant and use it to shop at other InstaBuy
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Through partnerships with SkyMall and the Impulse Buy Network,
InstaBuy customers have access to more than 150 stores, including
such high-end retailers as Calyx &AMP; Corolla and Sharper Image.
</P>
<P>
   InstaBuy is a ``server-based'' solution: It stores your personal
data on a remote computer. Obviously aware of consumers' concerns
about hackers, CyberCash is teaming up with financial institutions,
such as First USA, to secure shoppers' financial information.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has a wallet of its own, enabling consumers to
shop at affiliated merchants without reentering personal data.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's Quick Checkout lets members store information for up to 10
credit cards and 50 shipping addresses; the data is kept on AOL's
servers. For security reasons, the full credit-card number is never
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another option is eWallet, a software application that can
be downloaded (at www.ewallet.com). EWallet stores your personal
data on your computer, which may be more secure, but this also
requires you to install and maintain the software yourself.
</P>
<P>
   EWallet works at nearly all Web stores; when you're ready to
make a purchase, eWallet helps you with the forms. During the
holiday season, about 250,000 copies of eWallet were downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   For all the uncertainty over the eventual standard-bearer, one
thing is certain: Not all of these wallets will be in use a year
from now.
</P>
<P>
   In the standard-less interim, choose a wallet with care. Don't
try them all, or you may find yourself with multiple accounts at
some merchants. Consider the stores connected with the wallet; for
now, selection is probably the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a regular at just one or two online shops, don't
bother with a wallet. As with much that involves consumer
technology, you won't miss a lot by waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, one or more of these systems will achieve that magic
combo of convenience and ubiquity. Until then, America Online and
the portal sites have an edge, largely because they have the
attention of millions of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate winner will let you buy from any store on the Web,
or close to it, without downloading software to your PC. By then,
the wallet will help you find the best prices for your items of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The wallet may even suggest, based on your past purchases, what
wines or books you might like to buy. Sort of scary, but
convenient, too. ``Chaos doesn't reign very long,'' says Yaro. ``It
won't be tolerated.'' &QL;

Arlington fans get hospitality repaid during five-year stay
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Baseball's winter meetings were in Atlanta that
year, and Tom Grieve had no idea what a big splash either he or the
Texas Rangers would make at the annual press-and-peddle-the-flesh
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a tepid 1988 season, the Rangers were generally
regarded as a second-rate organization, an image fostered by 17
pennant-free seasons since the former Washington Senators arrived
in North Texas in 1972. Playing at Arlington Stadium _ a converted
minor-league facility that very much looked the part _ didn't do
much to enhance the profile, either.
</P>
<P>
   All of that would change with a few unexpected strokes of the
pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any idea that Nolan was going to leave
Houston,'' Grieve, then the Rangers' general manager, said. ``I
think everybody in baseball assumed he was going to stay with the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it became apparent that things weren't working out in
Houston, I called Dick Moss, who was Nolan's agent, and told Dick
that if Nolan didn't go back to Houston, that the Rangers would
have a lot of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Angels, Nolan Ryan's old team. The San Francisco
Giants, who would go on to the World Series that year, made
inquiries, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan already had done California. He would have preferred to
stay in Houston, but owner John McMullen was trying to cut costs,
and a pitcher who had won just 20 of 47 decisions the previous two
years seemed _ to McMullen, at least _ like a good place to start
trimming.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels were turning for one final change of venue in Ryan's
remarkable career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie Chiles, who owned the team at the time, said to do
whatever it takes,'' Grieve said. ``So we pretty much gave Nolan a
blank contract, told him to fill in the blanks and signed our names
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A club with a long history of bad trades and ill-fated
free-agent signings never made a better investment. Not only did
Ryan bring instant credibility to a sad-sack franchise, but he
brought an added bonus:
</P>
<P>
   He could still pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season as a Ranger, Ryan won 16 games, struck out
301 batters (his highest total since 1977) and pitched six complete
games, two of them shutouts. That would be his most productive
season of the five he spent in Arlington, but it would not be the
end of memorable moments as Ryan put the finishing touches on his
Hall of Fame credentials.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched his sixth and seventh no-hitters. He registered his
300th win and his 5,000th strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason his impact was so great was that no one expected
him to pitch more than two years,'' says Gov. George W. Bush, who
headed an ownership group that took over the club soon after Ryan
was signed. ``We thought he'd be a two-year wonder, and he pitched
a lot longer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other images further enhanced the legend.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for instance, the time he stayed in the game after a
shot off the bat of Bo Jackson bloodied his lip and stained the
front of his jersey. Even more memorable was the sight of Ryan
corralling a mound-charging Robin Ventura in a headlock and
proceeding to give the younger player a Texas-style whupping.
</P>
<P>
   After the bench-emptying brawl subsided, Ryan went on to pitch
seven innings, allowing one earned run in a 5-2 Rangers victory.
</P>
<P>
   Those images underscored Ryan's toughness and competitiveness.
Off the field, his folksy manner charmed fans (and advertising
executives) as the one-time boy wonder became a timeless, ageless
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The years I spent with the Rangers were the ones that put me
over the top,'' Ryan said, explaining why he will enter the Hall of
Fame as a Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, everything old was new again.
</P>
<P>
   New league.
</P>
<P>
   New team.
</P>
<P>
   New image.
</P>
<P>
   All of it, though, was based on something very much the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he couldn't pitch anymore, he would have been just another
guy,'' Grieve says now. ``Because of his personality, the fans
accepted him a lot more easily, but if Nolan was the world's
biggest jerk and pitched the way he did, he would have reached the
same heights.''
</P>
<P>
   His first three years as a Ranger, Ryan won 41 games while
losing just 25. Those years were even more memorable for the
milestones passed and indelible memories made.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, 1989, Oakland's Rickey Henderson become Ryan's
5,000th strikeout victim, the record Ryan says he cherishes most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represented that many innings pitched and being able to
maintain that style of pitching my entire career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Ryan twice took no-hitters into the ninth before
falling short.
</P>
<P>
   No-hitter No. 6 finally came on June 11, 1990, at the Oakland
Coliseum at the age of 43 years, 4 months, 12 days, making him the
oldest pitcher to accomplish the feat. On July 31 of that same
year, he won his 300th game, beating the Brewers in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh and final no-hitter followed on May 1, 1991, in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Others have won 300, of course, and Ryan already had set the
mark for most no-hitters when he produced No. 5 as an Astro on
Sept. 26, 1981, breaking a tie with Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rangers years, though, that enabled Ryan to push
those records virtually out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   His 5,714 strikeouts virtually lap the field, and it is the
record that may never be approached, much less threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Carlton, No. 2 on the all-time list, trails by 1,578.
Fellow Texan Roger Clemens, the only active player in the all-time
top 10, entered the current season with 3,153 career strikeouts and
would need to average nearly 260 strikeouts for 10 seasons to catch
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan's record is so far out there it isn't even worth
thinking about,'' Clemens said this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will turn 37 in August, making a run at the record all
the more unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get motivated,'' Grieve said. ``If you're good
enough to be considered to break those records, you're making a ton
of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got a family. You've got kids. Is a guy like Roger
going to be able to stay motivated to pitch at that level until
he's 45 years old? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan was. Don't ask me how. That was the most amazing thing
about Nolan Ryan, to me, to stay focused and maintain that edge for
27 years.''
</P>
<P>
   To the end, a big part of the Ryan mythology was that he
remained accessible to the public throughout that career. In an era
of outrageous salaries and testy stars, Ryan became all the more
extraordinary by being ordinary. At spring training, he would stand
in the sun for hours, signing balls, caps, jerseys, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan was a hero who didn't let you down,'' Bush said. ``In
this day and age, you have heroes who let you down by the decisions
they make in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan never let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's career ended a little earlier than he had planned when he
injured his elbow in the first inning of a Sept. 22, 1993, start in
Seattle's Kingdome. His last appearance in a Rangers uniform came
on Oct. 3, when he exchanged lineup cards with Kansas City's George
Brett, who was playing his final game for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The two will be linked again in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the second base entrance at the Ballpark in
Arlington _ which opened the season after Ryan retired _ a likeness
of the most famous figure ever to grace a Rangers uniform greets
fans as they enter the team's state-of-the-art home.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he saw the statue, the honoree _ still very much
alive and well, thank you _ allowed himself a nod of approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a nice job,'' he said in typical low-key fashion.
</P>
<P>
   So did Lynn Nolan Ryan, though there was hardly anything low-key
about it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sought after though they have become, employment contracts are
fraught with pitfalls for executives.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as status symbol is, of itself, a danger. Managers
often are so flattered to have one they don't realize what they've
signed away to get it.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, even the most seemingly innocuous provisions _ such
as the basic job description _ can have unexpected consequences.
Boss to employee: ``It says here you agreed to work anywhere in the
U.S. I'm sure you'll just love your new assignment in Hammond,
Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: Your employer undoubtedly has negotiated a
lot more of these deals than you ever will (or at least let's hope
that's the case). So who's more likely to gain the upper hand?
</P>
<P>
   To help even the odds, here's a provision-by-provision guide to
the modern employment contract, along with some pointers.
</P>
<P>
   1. TERM: This section defines the length of the contract _ one
year, two years, etc. Its inclusion is more than a formality. In
most states, employers can fire an employee for any reason at any
time and without further compensation (unless civil-rights or
discrimination laws apply).
</P>
<P>
   However, if your contract specifies the term of employment,
you're entitled to receive the balance due if you're canned without
cause (as defined in Section 5 of this article).
</P>
<P>
   2. DUTIES: Many employment contracts are far too vague or
sketchy when it comes to defining the job itself. There's nothing
wrong with flexibility, of course _ so long as everyone's happy.
But if the relationship sours, latitude makes it possible for an
employer to dream up loathsome or even humiliating work assignments
_ perhaps in a deliberate effort to persuade the employee to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you and your employer can always agree to make changes
in a contract. So if your pride can't stand emptying the trash or
having your desk moved to the stairwell, make sure your contract
says something about what you'll be doing and where you will be
doing it. (One client of mine got a clause that allowed him to work
one month each year in Vail, Colo.).
</P>
<P>
   Get as specific a description of your duties and
responsibilities as you can. If that's not possible, at least make
sure this section of your contract says that your duties will be
restricted to those that are ``reasonable and customary'' for the
position you hold.
</P>
<P>
   3. COMPENSATION: The rule here: If it ain't written down, it
ain't going to end up in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that can be remotely considered compensation _ from
vacation days and perks to salary and stock options _ should be
detailed in this section. (This is where you can ask for a rabbi
trust or a paid-for vacation home in the Hamptons, as clients of
mine have done.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless you don't expect a raise during the time period covered
by the agreement, this section should also spell out the procedure
for determining pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   4. EXCLUSIVE EMPLOYMENT: Many companies today offer employment
contracts precisely because they want their charges to sign a
document that restricts their ability to jump ship _ or take
proprietary information with them when they do.
</P>
<P>
   The covenants contained in this section are where employers seek
to obtain this protection. In other words: Watch your flanks. Your
objective should be to give yourself as much career flexibility as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Employers like to push for extreme limits on whom you can work
for and when. In a sense, they'd just as soon have you drop off the
face of the earth if you're not going to be toiling for them.
</P>
<P>
   In examining the validity of the exclusions contained in this
section, courts weigh the employer's legitimate business interests
against the ability of an employee to earn a livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a court might agree to bar the employee of a
children's TV program on cable television from working for another
show with a similar audience. But the court might let the employee
work for a cable-TV show about monster trucks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there's no requirement for employers to offer employees
compensation for these covenants, such payments have sometimes
helped courts overcome their problems with employee livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you can't eliminate or soften restrictions on
where you can earn a living, try to shorten the period and/or get
compensation for them.
</P>
<P>
   You can also work to subtly undermine exclusions you can't
negotiate away through your choice of the law governing the
agreement (see Section 7. Governing Law. Jurisdiction).
</P>
<P>
   Companies understandably try to keep all internal information
confidential. Nevertheless, courts have ruled that there are limits
to confidentiality. Client lists, for instance, are protected only
if the information can't be obtained elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, publicly known or previously published contracts,
pricing policies, and buying habits aren't protected. That doesn't
mean the provisions don't have some teeth: Courts have held
employees liable for the disclosure of confidential information
whether or not the disclosure was willful. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. REASONS FOR TERMINATION: A paragraph should be added that
provides for a ``cure period'' during which, after a warning, you
are given a chance to address your employer's complaints about your
work. This should apply to performance issues _ a failure to
produce promised results _ instead of, say, a conviction for
insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   If your employer balks at such language, explain that the firm
will benefit by having its potential exposure to litigation
limited.
</P>
<P>
   An additional reason for termination is ``change of control or
ownership.'' This should be specifically listed here so that it can
be discussed in the subsequent section.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, wording should be included that calls or ample notice
(such as six months) if your contract isn't going to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   6. RESULTS OF TERMINATION: Ask for full payment of your
contracted salary if you're terminated without cause or if your
employer breaches the agreement. But be prepared to cut a deal. By
expanding the reasons for termination in the previous section, you
can include language here outlining your severance rights after a
change in management or ownership.
</P>
<P>
   7. GOVERNING LAW. JURISDICTION: This may seem like neutral
boilerplate. It's not. The common-law obligations of employers and
employees vary from state to state. So, too, does the way local
courts interpret and enforce the covenants outlined in Section 4.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of governing law and jurisdiction in the agreement
will ultimately determine what elements of Section 4 can be
enforced and how strenuously they will be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Use the state law most beneficial to you. If, for example, you
work in the California office of a corporation headquartered in
Alabama, your employer will want Alabama law to govern the
contract, since it's considered employer-friendly. But California
law is employee-friendly. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there's no requirement for employers to offer employees
compensation for these covenants, such payments have sometimes
helped courts overcome their problems with employee livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you can't eliminate or soften restrictions on
where you can earn a living, try to shorten the period and/or get
compensation for them.
</P>
<P>
   You can also work to subtly undermine exclusions you can't
negotiate away through your choice of the law governing the
agreement (see Section 7. Governing Law. Jurisdiction).
</P>
<P>
   Companies understandably try to keep all internal information
confidential. Nevertheless, courts have ruled that there are limits
to confidentiality. Client lists, for instance, are protected only
if the information can't be obtained elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, publicly known or previously published contracts,
pricing policies, and buying habits aren't protected. That doesn't
mean the provisions don't have some teeth: Courts have held
employees liable for the disclosure of confidential information
whether or not the disclosure was willful. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. REASONS FOR TERMINATION: A paragraph should be added that
provides for a ``cure period'' during which, after a warning, you
are given a chance to address your employer's complaints about your
work. This should apply to performance issues _ a failure to
produce promised results _ instead of, say, a conviction for
insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   If your employer balks at such language, explain that the firm
will benefit by having its potential exposure to litigation
limited.
</P>
<P>
   An additional reason for termination is ``change of control or
ownership.'' This should be specifically listed here so that it can
be discussed in the subsequent section.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, wording should be included that calls or ample notice
(such as six months) if your contract isn't going to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   6. RESULTS OF TERMINATION: Ask for full payment of your
contracted salary if you're terminated without cause or if your
employer breaches the agreement. But be prepared to cut a deal. By
expanding the reasons for termination in the previous section, you
can include language here outlining your severance rights after a
change in management or ownership.
</P>
<P>
   7. GOVERNING LAW. JURISDICTION: This may seem like neutral
boilerplate. It's not. The common-law obligations of employers and
employees vary from state to state. So, too, does the way local
courts interpret and enforce the covenants outlined in Section 4.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of governing law and jurisdiction in the agreement
will ultimately determine what elements of Section 4 can be
enforced and how strenuously they will be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Use the state law most beneficial to you. If, for example, you
work in the California office of a corporation headquartered in
Alabama, your employer will want Alabama law to govern the
contract, since it's considered employer-friendly. But California
law is employee-friendly. &QL;

Fastball helps blaze the way for record performance
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the records and accomplishments in Nolan Ryan's career,
this one could be the most telling:
</P>
<P>
   Ryan finished with 5,714 career strikeouts, which puts him 1,578
ahead of Steve Carlton, who had 4,136 and is second on the all-time
list. That is the largest percentage difference between first and
second in any major statistical category in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way. If a pitcher made his major-league debut
today and finished a few years later with 1,578 strikeouts, people
would say he had a nice career. Ryan finished his career with that
many more strikeouts than any other pitcher in the history of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If a pitcher broke in this season and had designs on overtaking
Ryan for the all-time strikeout lead, he would need to average 200
strikeouts for more than 28 seasons. If he averaged 250 strikeouts,
it would take nearly 23 seasons to catch Ryan. Averaging 300
strikeouts, he would need 19 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about records that won't be broken,'' said Astros
coach Matt Galante, ``but Nolan's strikeout record is right near
the top. You have to have the combination of high strikeout totals
and longevity. Those are two things that don't often go together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers with a lot of strikeouts, for a lot of reasons, don't
last that long. To do what Nolan did and keep doing it for as long
as he did _ you won't see that again.''
</P>
<P>
   From Pat Jarvis (No. 1 in 1966) to Greg Myers (No. 5,714 in
1993), from Hall of Famer Henry Aaron to bit player Paul Zuvella,
Ryan's strikeouts went on and on and on. He struck out a total of
1,176 players, including eight father-and-son combinations, 12 sets
of brothers and 27 members of Baseball's Hall of Fame _ including
1999 fellow inductees George Brett (18 times) and Robin Yount (16).
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Ryan's signature was his blazing
fastball. And while that pitch had much to do with his abundant
strikeout totals, he never would have reached the remarkable
figures without another pitch. One fallacy of Ryan's career is that
he was all smoke and no finesse.
</P>
<P>
   After he was traded from the New York Mets to the California
Angels in 1971, Ryan developed a devastating curveball. When
prodded, he admits he ``probably had as good a curveball as there
was in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's strikeout numbers indicate a pitcher who was able to set
up hitters and blow them away for a remarkable 27 seasons. Some
strikeout highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Ryan struck out 383 batters in 1973, the most in modern history.
In a three-year span with California from 1972-74, Ryan struck out
1,079 batters (329, 383, 367.)
</P>
<P>
   Ryan had 10 or more strikeouts in a game 215 times. Entering the
1999 season, the second-highest total was 102 by Arizona's Randy
Johnson. In 1973 with the Angels, Ryan struck out 10 or more
batters a record 23 times.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan led the American League in strikeouts seven times in eight
seasons with California from 1972-79 and then twice with Texas in
1989-90. When he did so in 1990 at age 43, he became the oldest
player to lead the AL in a major statistical category.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan led the National League with the Astros in 1987-88, his
final two seasons in Houston. When he led the league in 1988, he
became the oldest pitcher to lead the NL in strikeouts at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan had six seasons of 300 or more strikeouts, 15 seasons of
200 or more strikeouts and had 100 or more strikeouts 24 times,
including 23 consecutive seasons from 1970-92.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has special memories of the milestone strikeouts in his
career. Obviously, he had no way of knowing the strikeout of
Jarvis, a pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, would be the first of
5,714. In that game, he also struck out Denis Menke, who later was
a coach on the Astros teams Ryan played on in the 1980s, and Hall
of Fame third baseman Eddie Mathews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't remember anything special about that
strikeout,'' said Ryan. ``What I remember was coming into that game
and feeling very nervous. I was just 19 years old and had been in
high school the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There I was facing Henry Aaron and Eddie Mathews and Felipe
Alou and Joe Torre and Rico Carty. It was very intimidating. A
couple years prior to that, I'd had all their baseball cards and
here I was on the mound facing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's strikeouts didn't start to pile up until he left the Mets
after the 1971 season. He had 493 strikeouts for New York _ a total
he exceeded in less than 1{ seasons with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan recorded his 500th, 1,000th and 1,500th strikeouts in just
more than two seasons from 1972-74. In August 1976, he notched No.
2,000 against Detroit's Ron LeFlore, who struck out 22 times in his
career against Ryan. Less than two years later, Ryan got his
2,500th strikeout against Buddy Bell, who was with Cleveland at the
time but finished his career as Ryan's teammate in Houston in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   What Ryan remembers most about the 3,000th strikeout of his
career was that there wasn't much attention given to the feat. In
his first season with the Astros, Ryan struck out Cesar Geronimo at
Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. After the game, there was so
little fanfare that a reporter from a Houston paper had a
one-on-one session with Ryan _ in the empty team bus outside the
Astros' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, there wasn't any ESPN or as much TV coverage,
so it just kind of came and went,'' Ryan said. ``It really didn't
seem like such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Ryan and Carlton were locked in a battle to see which
pitcher would be the first to pass Walter Johnson's all-time
strikeout record of 3,508. Ryan entered the season needing 14
strikeouts to eclipse Johnson, while Carlton needed 60.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan went past Johnson in his third start of the 1983 season on
April 27. He struck out Tim Blackwell in the eighth inning to tie
the mark and threw a 1-2 curveball that froze Brad Mills, the next
hitter, who stared at strike three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got that strikeout, I was just relieved it was over,''
said Ryan. ``There were several pitchers who could pass that
number. I just wanted to be the one to do it first. Once I did, I
knew I could sit back and relax and get more satisfaction from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even 16 years later, Ryan still seems to be stung by the fact
that the baseball commissioner's office did not have a
representative on hand for the historic game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was a little strange that someone was
breaking a 60-year old record, and nobody from the league was
there,'' said Ryan. ``They didn't make much of a deal out of it,
that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan struck out Danny Heep of the New York Mets on an 0-2
curveball for strikeout No. 4,000 in 1985 _ a figure previously
thought out of reach _ he says the Astros did not have a photo of
the event. The only picture he received was from a free-lance
photographer who took an out-of-focus shot from the screened-in
area behind home plate at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case when Ryan reached the 5,000 strikeout
plateau with the Rangers in 1989. He says the buildup of that event
remains one of his biggest thrills in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drove up to the park (Arlington Stadium) that night,
the attitude of the fans and the electricity in the air was
something that overwhelmed me,'' said Ryan. ``It was a good four
hours before the game, but people were lining up for tickets.
Sensing the excitement as it built that night, and to see how much
the fans got into that, it was very memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan delivered, striking out Rickey Henderson of the Oakland A's
for No. 5,000. Ryan said the 5,000th strikeout represents the
accomplishment of which he is most proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that because of the longevity involved. It
represented that many innings pitched and being able to maintain
that style of pitching my entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the first strikeout of his career, the last one was
memorable only after the fact. Ryan struck out Anaheim catcher
Myers in the fifth inning of a game at Anaheim on Sept. 17, 1993.
Ryan had announced his retirement earlier that season, but he
suffered an elbow injury in the first inning of a game at Seattle
on Sept. 22 and did not pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vaguely remember that he chased a high fastball,'' Ryan
said. ``In my mind, I never thought that was going to be my last
one. I thought I'd have two more starts and get it at some point in
the final game. You can't predict everything, I guess.''

MRS. CLINTON'S SUMMIT MEETING WITH ISRAELI MAY HELP HER IN N.Y.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, vowing to
``learn how I can be helpful'' in the Middle East peace process,
hosted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at an intimate dinner for
four at Camp David late Thursday _ a summit that could prove useful
in her New York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton joined President Clinton, the Israeli prime
minister and his wife, Nava Barak, for dinner and an overnight
visit at the remote presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains
of Maryland about 60 miles north of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's White House press secretary, said
the first lady looked forward to the informal get-together with the
Baraks before an official White House dinner on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House setting provides an incredible historic
perspective and that is important,'' Berry said. ``Camp David is a
very comfortable environment and there's definitely a sense of
uniqueness about it. It's nice to blend both on a visit like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the Clintons chose
Camp David as the setting for their first get-together with the
Baraks since Israeli voters chose the former Israeli military
officer as the nation's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp David is a place where they'll have a chance to talk
privately in a more relaxed, informal setting,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak met earlier at the White House to discuss the
U.S. insistence that Israel fulfill an agreement to relinquish 13.1
percent of additional West Bank territory as part of a
comprehensive land-for-peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Barak that ``America will walk with you'' as Israel
presses ahead with a renewed quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak vowed to ``inject new momentum into the peace process and
to put it back on all tracks.'' But the Israeli underscored his
government's independence, telling Clinton that the United States
can bolster the peace process ``more as a facilitator than as a
kind of policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak later met privately with Vice President Al Gore, who is
seeking the Democratic nomination in 2000 to succeed Clinton as
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who has been courting New York voters on two
campaign-style visits to the Empire State in the last two weeks,
said in a letter to a prominent Jewish American leader that she
looked forward to her first meeting with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, a new prime minister of Israel is preparing to come to
the United States to discuss his own plans to move the peace
process forward,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote Mandell I. Ganchrow, head of
the Orthodox Union that represents about 750 orthodox Jewish
synagogues across the United States. Her campaign aides released
the letter to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I look forward to hosting Prime Minister and
Mrs. Barak on their first official visit, and I am personally eager
to learn how I can be helpful in this important effort,'' Mrs.
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Mrs. Clinton vowed that if she seeks the Senate
seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., she would be
``an active, committed advocate for a strong and secure Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   She also broke with White House policy and announced her support
of Israel's position that Jerusalem is the ``eternal and
indivisible capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration policy calls for the status of Jerusalem
to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians as part of
``final status'' talks to resolve disputes over borders, refugees
and Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Meanwhile, the city of Tel
Aviv continues to be the capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are an active political constituency in New York politics,
where they make up 9.1 percent of the state's total population of
more than 18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish voters were 12 percent of the electorate that cast
ballots in the bitter 1998 Senate contest in New York between
then-Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
Schumer swept 76 percent of the Jewish vote, helping him oust the
conservative Republican, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, Mrs. Clinton's White House spokeswoman, said the first
lady would visit Israel ``this fall,'' adding: ``We have no
specific time set at this point but it will be after September.''

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camp David has afforded privacy for first families since
President Franklin D. Roosevelt began using the wooded retreat at
the outset of World War II. Roosevelt called the retreat ``Shangri
La.''
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed it for his grandson
David.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter chose the isolated setting for an 11-day
summit in 1978 to foster the first Arab-Israeli peace agreement
between Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin and Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Carter later said that ``it was necessary (that) we be
completely isolated so that neither Begin nor Sadat nor their
representatives would feel constrained one or more times every day
to'' consult with their own varies constituencies to ``explain what
modifications were being made to previous promises or
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart ducked a question Thursday on whether the Clintons had
chosen Camp David as a way to recall the spirit of peace accords
that began the Middle East peace process in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let everybody else decide that,'' Lockhart said. ``I'll
let everyone else speculate on that.''

 &HT;    E-MAIL TAX: AN IDEA THAT WON'T DIE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This spring, e-mails bombarded many Internet users,
warning them that the U.S. Postal Service planned to impose a tax
on electronic messages.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners complained loudly about the new burden
government was about to place upon them, and members of Congress
were flooded with inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax talk was absolute nonsense, the Postal Service said.
It issued a press release reminding the gullible that the ``Postal
Service has no authority to surcharge e-mail messages sent over the
Internet, nor would it support such legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   But not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor mill can start grinding again, because the United
Nations Development Program this week urged governments around the
world to tax e-mails to raise money to help the underdeveloped
world get on line.
</P>
<P>
   A tax rate of one U.S. cent on every 100 e-mails would have
raised $70 billion had it been in place in 1996, according to a
U.N. economist. Given how quickly the Internet is growing, vast
sums could be raised each year to help poor countries purchase
telecommunications equipment to catch up with the wealthy world.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the U.N. recommendation quickly spread over the
Internet, prompting many to post comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never should the government be allowed to control anything
that happens over the Internet!'' one would-be Patrick Henry said
on the Web site called slashdot.org.
</P>
<P>
   But before the rumors grow too thick about a U.N. tax to support
black helicopters hovering over our homes, e-mailers should note
that the United Nations has no power to tax.

Ruthian effort helped keep the `team' running smoothly
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALVIN _ Ruth Ryan could have been a professional photographer.
</P>
<P>
   She can't begin to count the number of times a stranger has
sidled up to her famous husband, handed her a camera and pleaded
with her to snap a quick photo.
</P>
<P>
   She could have been a professional mover.
</P>
<P>
   For 24 years, she packed a house and eventually three kids three
times every year as the Ryans moved from Alvin to their spring
training site to their major-league town, then home again.
</P>
<P>
   She could have been a nurse, a teacher, a referee _ all jobs
baseball wives must perform when they spend half the year, or at
least half the season, as single parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My oldest brother once said that if the Ryans are a team, mom
is our quarterback,'' said 22-year-old Wendy Ryan, the youngest of
the three kids.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth also has served as fan, bullpen catcher and confidant for
Nolan from his Little League career at Shroeder Field in Alvin in
1959 to his Hall of Fame career in the majors. She was there for
his first major-league pitch for the New York Mets. She was there
when he threw that final fastball to Dave Magadan of the Mariners
toward the end of 1993, knowing instinctively it would be his last
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every spring before spring training would start, we'd long
toss in the yard every day, just throwing to each other,'' Ruth
said. ``During spring training if Nolan didn't make a trip, we'd go
out to the field and play. My job was usually to shag balls while
the boys would practice hitting. I probably got a lot more involved
with his career than a lot of wives, but I love baseball and wanted
to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball wasn't Nolan's job, it was the Ryan family business.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, the oldest son and now 27, pitched at TCU, then played two
seasons of minor-league baseball with the Rangers organization
before retiring to begin a joint venture with his father to bring a
minor-league team to Round Rock. The Astros' Class AA team begins
play there in spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of bonding through baseball,'' Reid said.
``We have this connection through baseball. When I was in the minor
leagues, I really got a chance to see what he and my mom went
through their first few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Nolan and Ruth grew up in moderate circumstances, without a
lot of luxuries and with parents who sometimes worked two jobs to
support their families. Budgeting, scrimping and saving had been
ways of life forever, so the Ryans never looked at it as doing
without.
</P>
<P>
   But they certainly had to. That $6,000-a-year salary his first
year with the Mets didn't go very far in New York. The $1,000
raises each of the next two years still left them without much in
savings when they moved to California in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   And when they got there, with one child in tow, the Ryans found
the Angels had a rule prohibiting children in their spring training
hotel. If they wished to be together, they had to rent a home. And
even though he was making $12,000 _ twice his original major-league
salary _ Nolan and Ruth couldn't find a home or hotel room they
could afford for the six-week training period the team split
between Holtville, Calif., and Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan's sister Mary Lou lent us a trailer and we lived in
that,'' Ruth said. ``It didn't have air conditioning, and we were
in the desert. It was fine at night, but it was 100 degrees during
the day. I had a child and no car, so I just sat in a lawn chair
outside the trailer all day long. It seems bizarre now, but that's
what we had to do to be together as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more financial problems soon after when the players
went on strike for the first eight games of the season. With no
money coming in, Ruth and Nolan had to borrow $1,500 against their
1971 tax refund to survive.
</P>
<P>
   But money wouldn't be a problem much longer. In 1973, Ryan
pitched his first two no-hitters and recorded his 1,000th career
strikeout. He broke Sandy Koufax's single-season record with 383
strikeouts and pitched 26 complete games. And at the end of that
year, he was rewarded with a six-figure salary.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Reese, now 23, entered the picture in 1976, Nolan
had pitched four no-hitters and the Ryans could afford to rent a
home during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy came only a year later, and Ruth found herself with three
kids and a couple of households to manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I was a more organized person it might have been
different, but it seemed like every few months, life turned upside
down,'' Ruth said. ``I felt completely unorganized. The entire
baseball existence is extremely nerve-wracking for a mother. It
starts with spring training when you pack the car, pack the kids,
take them out of school and turn their lives upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   For this baseball family to survive, life pretty much had to
revolve around the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``From February to October, your husband's job requires so much
focus, concentration,'' Ruth said. ``You have to eat at certain
times, sleep at certain times. The whole day is spent getting ready
to go to the ballpark. There were years when Nolan was getting home
at midnight and you'd have a toddler who was getting up at 6 a.m.
and a baby who was getting up during the night. I didn't sleep
much, but luckily back then I was young and I could get by on five
hours of uninterrupted sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Alvin was the steadying force. In the town in
which they grew up, the Ryans could shop, dine and go to school
without being hassled. Nolan wasn't the resident millionaire, he
was just a local boy done good. The kids went to public school, and
Nolan never felt the need to trade in his pickup truck for a
sportier vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Nolan prefers his pickup. Ruth enjoys her Suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was only five years at the end of Nolan's career,
the Ryan family's favorite times start and end with the Rangers.
Texas was the most family-friendly of his four major-league teams,
allowing kids on the field before the game and letting the boys go
in the locker room and sit on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   It was from this vantage point that Reese, then 14, watched
Nolan's sixth no-hitter on June 11, 1990, in Oakland. As the
cameras followed Nolan in the dugout between innings, Reese could
be seen rubbing his dad's back and offering encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``His arm was tightening up, so I rubbed it and his back,''
Reese said. ``It was really neat to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While with the Rangers, Ryan topped the 5,000 career strikeouts
mark (Aug. 22, 1991), posted his 300th career win (against the
Brewers on July 31, 1990), and recorded his seventh no-hitter (May
1, 1991 against Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   He also pitched against his son Reid when the Rangers faced the
University of Texas in an exhibition game in March 1991. Reid
allowed four runs in two innings. Nolan allowed one hit in three
innings. Reid transferred to TCU at the end of that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be totally draining for me, but once the
game got going, everything changed,'' Ruth wrote in her book,
Covering Home: My Life With Nolan Ryan. ``Suddenly I had the
proudest feeling I had ever known. It was hard to believe I was old
enough to be watching my husband and son on the same field.''
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly it was all over.
</P>
<P>
   There would be only the one World Series ring, earned in 1969 as
a young member of the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan didn't get to pitch much that year, but he won the third
game of the playoffs against Atlanta that sent them to the World
Series and he saved one game in the World Series,'' Ruth said. ``I
never knew baseball fans could be like that. It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, he'll never stop being Nolan Ryan, and it
took until each child was a teen-ager to really understand just
what that means.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time, I just thought I was growing up
normal,'' Wendy said. ``I didn't realize just how incredible he is
at what he does. The older you get, the more you can appreciate it.
But I have to give them so much credit for keeping our lives as
normal as they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Family activities have always centered around ranch life and
cattle (the Ryans own ranches in South Texas and near Gonzalez),
with hunting and fishing being particular favorites. And then
there's the sports. Backyard volleyball and tennis tournaments have
long been the norm. The newest craze, however, is golf (Nolan can't
play tennis anymore because of a bad knee). And no, he's not a
natural at it, with scores reportedly around 100.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Nolan's fame and accomplishments, some of the best
anecdotes about him occurred when he was not recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan and Ruth were up at their Gonzalez ranch recently when
they decided to head out to the nine-hole golf course nearby. On
the first hole, Nolan teed it up while the starter, a retired
football coach, watched. He took a big swing and the ball went
about three feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real aggravated and he started stomping around,'' Ruth
said. ``So the little man came over and told him, `Just relax.
Sports are all about having fun.' Nolan just looked at him and hit
the ball. When we drove off, the guys in the clubhouse said, `Do
you know who you were talking to? That was Nolan Ryan.' He was so
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Being part of the Ryan household has meant growing up in the
spotlight. But it also has meant seeing different sides of the
legend _ a dad who can be a strict disciplinarian, a prankster who
loves a practical joke, and a man who always puts his family first.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it like to be Nolan Ryan's son? That's a tough question
to answer,'' Reese said. ``I grew up always being Nolan Ryan's son,
so I guess I don't know what it's like to be a normal kid.''

MRS. CLINTON'S SUMMIT MEETING WITH ISRAELI MAY HELP HER IN N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, vowing to
``learn how I can be helpful'' in the Middle East peace process,
hosted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at an intimate dinner for
four at Camp David late Thursday _ a summit that could prove useful
in her New York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton joined President Clinton, the Israeli prime
minister and his wife, Nava Barak, for dinner and an overnight
visit at the remote presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains
of Maryland about 60 miles north of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's White House press secretary, said
the first lady looked forward to the informal get-together with the
Baraks before an official White House dinner on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House setting provides an incredible historic
perspective and that is important,'' Berry said. ``Camp David is a
very comfortable environment and there's definitely a sense of
uniqueness about it. It's nice to blend both on a visit like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the Clintons chose
Camp David as the setting for their first get-together with the
Baraks since Israeli voters chose the former Israeli military
officer as the nation's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camp David is a place where they'll have a chance to talk
privately in a more relaxed, informal setting,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak met earlier at the White House to discuss the
U.S. insistence that Israel fulfill an agreement to relinquish 13.1
percent of additional West Bank territory as part of a
comprehensive land-for-peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Barak that ``America will walk with you'' as Israel
presses ahead with a renewed quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak vowed to ``inject new momentum into the peace process and
to put it back on all tracks.'' But the Israeli underscored his
government's independence, telling Clinton that the United States
can bolster the peace process ``more as a facilitator than as a
kind of policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak later met privately with Vice President Al Gore, who is
seeking the Democratic nomination in 2000 to succeed Clinton as
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who has been courting New York voters on two
campaign-style visits to the Empire State in the last two weeks,
said in a letter to a prominent Jewish American leader that she
looked forward to her first meeting with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, a new prime minister of Israel is preparing to come to
the United States to discuss his own plans to move the peace
process forward,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote Mandell I. Ganchrow, head of
the Orthodox Union that represents about 750 orthodox Jewish
synagogues across the United States. Her campaign aides released
the letter to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I look forward to hosting Prime Minister and
Mrs. Barak on their first official visit, and I am personally eager
to learn how I can be helpful in this important effort,'' Mrs.
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Mrs. Clinton vowed that if she seeks the Senate
seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Ptrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., she would be
``an active, committed advocate for a strong and secure Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   She also broke with White House policy and announced her support
of Israel's position that Jerusalem is the ``eternal and
indivisible capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration policy calls for the status of Jerusalem
to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians as part of
``final status'' talks to resolve disputes over borders, refugees
and Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Meanwhile, the city of Tel
Aviv continues to be the capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are an active political constituency in New York politics,
where they make up 9.1 percent of the state's total population of
more than 18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish voters were 12 percent of the electorate that cast
ballots in the bitter 1998 Senate contest in New York between
then-Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
Schumer swept 76 percent of the Jewish vote, helping him oust the
conservative Republican, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, Mrs. Clinton's White House spokeswoman, said the first
lady would visit Israel ``this fall,'' adding: ``We have no
specific time set at this point but it will be after September.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camp David has afforded privacy for first families since
President Franklin D. Roosevelt began using the wooded retreat at
the outset of World War II. Roosevelt called the retreat ``Shangri
La.''
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed it for his grandson
David.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter chose the isolated setting for an 11-day
summit in 1978 to foster the first Arab-Israeli peace agreement
between Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin and Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Carter later said that ``it was necessary (that) we be
completely isolated so that neither Begin nor Sadat nor their
representatives would feel constrained one or more times every day
to'' consult with their own varies constituencies to ``explain what
modifications were being made to previous promises or
commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart ducked a question Thursday on whether the Clintons had
chosen Camp David as a way to recall the spirit of peace accords
that began the Middle East peace process in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let everybody else decide that,'' Lockhart said. ``I'll
let everyone else speculate on that.''

 &HT;    Horticultural horror: Landscapers did it
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a gardener's nightmare: After enjoying your
morning stroll in the garden you built with a huge investment of
time, money and energy, you leave home, returning that evening to
discover many of the plants you collected are gone, ripped from the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Lucia Duncan-Harrison, who gardens in
the north Atlanta neighborhood of Nancy Creek Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I've heard of thieves snatching people's plants (despite
the fact that most gardeners wouldn't dream of stealing from a
kindred spirit). But that wasn't the way it went in Lucia's garden.
</P>
<P>
   This was the horticultural equivalent of friendly fire in a war:
The landscapers did it.
</P>
<P>
   Seems laborers working in her garden somehow ``exceeded what
they were told to do,'' digging out desirable plants as if they
were common weeds, including many of Lucia's prized natives.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as we walked through her 1/3-acre space, surrounded by
big old trees, Lucia relived that day last summer. As happens with
anyone, her eyes saw what her mind expected when she first arrived
home. ``I didn't really notice anything missing,'' she recalls,
adding that she looked beyond her garden to focus on her next-door
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, it hit me. Omigod! I still get goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   On our afternoon walk, Lucia pointed to the land, describing
what had happened where. Here, grew birdfoot's-violet, she says,
adding that she had placed rocks around the two perennials, but the
workers ``moved the rocks, dug them up and put the rocks back.'' Go
figure. Right over there, was hepatica. And, in this spot,
bloodroot. And, nearby, five types of trillium. Ginger, iris,
phlox, sedum all were missing. Even four azaleas were uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the day her plants were dug out, Lucia said, ``I've
just got to tell somebody,'' so she telephoned her parents in
Athens, Wilbur and Marion Duncan, widely respected experts on
wildflowers and authors of several books, including their latest,
the beautifully informative ``Wildflowers of the Eastern United
States.'' (Her parents inscribed Lucia's copy to their ``late-
</P>
<P>
   blooming botanist.'') ``They were horrified about my collection,
too,'' says Lucia. And helpful. ``They said, `Calm down; we'll help
you replace it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As shock wore into determination, Lucia, who is a lawyer, began
compiling a meticulous list of the plants she had lost, contacting
sources, including nature centers and nurseries in the region to
find out which plants were available and how much they would cost.
At the same time, she combed through a pile of worker-discarded
plants, rescuing a few, including one of the four azaleas.
</P>
<P>
   After some discussion, the owner of the landscaping company
``remembered that he had insurance,'' and he and Lucia reached an
amicable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the plants cannot be replaced, she says,
mentioning Georgia mint, hepatica and a dwarf iris as examples of
those that are not sold.
</P>
<P>
   Lucia's uprooted garden is a reminder that what is lost in such
situations is more than unusual plants, of course. Gone is the
experience of collecting them or receiving them as gifts.
Replacement money cannot pay for this, just as it cannot make up
for property losses suffered in floods, tornadoes and other
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Experiences and connections are lost forever, not restored by
bringing in new plants _ or sofas, chairs, carpets. And, with trees
and shrubs, there's a distinctiveness about each one that is
impossible to replace; every plant is unique. You can replace that
prized azalea that you lost, but you won't be able to find one with
the same little curve in the main trunk. And, no matter how hard
you try, you can't train another spicebush to produce above-ground
roots that put the plant on curved stilts, walking it through the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we all suffer our losses, pick up the pieces and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with Lucia Duncan-Harrison. The other day, even as she
still felt the goose bumps from her chilling loss, she was warmed
by hopes of her plants' resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of nature means my plants are doing better than I
expected,'' says Lucia, taking heart in seeing a fraction of her
five dozen bloodroot plants peeping up this year.
Lily-of-the-valley and shamrock, which grew profusely in Lucia's
garden, may one day do it again.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, she's looking at a lot of empty spaces, filled
with anticipation.

 &HT;    Each weekend, Atlantans hooked on green take to their yards
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTANTA _ David and Bobbi Kelly avoid travel on Saturday. It's
not a religious holiday or flying phobia that keeps them home.
</P>
<P>
   It's their yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone on vacation before and left on Sunday so he could
be here on Saturday to do the lawn,'' Bobbi says.
</P>
<P>
   That's the day her husband whips out the Weed Whacker, revs up
the blower, yanks on the mower and steadies the edger for a
half-day ritual aimed at maintaining a look as manicured as a
Marine recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do the angle cuts, you betcha, trying to get it to look like
Turner Field, and I mow in different directions,'' Kelly says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children call them `Daddy's lines,''' Bobbi says.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly can't help it. Like many of the 53 million Americans with
lawns, the northwest Atlanta resident is consumed by the blade.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun rises high enough for neighbors to safely create a
racket, when the scent of freshly severed growth suddenly fills the
air, when property lines become defined by a half-inch-high
difference in turf, lawn junkies have to have their fix.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the gardening stuff. Maintaining a thick, solid carpet of
green is a guy thing _ a means for marking their territory, for
chipping in to improve the environment and, yes, for keeping up
with those blasted Joneses. Lawns unite neighbors to commiserate
about nematodes, to share fertilizer formulas and to help each
other survive those dreary days of winter after coming down from a
summer of lawn bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawn works in mysterious ways. It calls to men with a
thick and seductive voice,'' Warren Schultz writes in ``A Man's
Turf: The Perfect Lawn'' (Clarkson Potter, $35). ``It takes our
time during the weekend and occupies our thoughts during the week.
It pulls us up out of the easy chair and away from the television
to tend it. We pamper it, fuss over it, and curse at it. ... And we
expect it to always look its best. We wring our hands when it turns
brown or develops bare patches. We puff out our chests when it
turns rich emerald green in the spring. And, yes, we mow it every
weekend, whether it needs it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting an example: So what drives men to become die-hard
pushers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of lawn care is not to encourage rampant growth and
flowering but to control it,'' Schultz says. ``Our goal is not to
encourage _ heck, not to tolerate _ change, development and
diversity but to maintain order and sameness. Lawn care is an
exercise in control, bordering on domination.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kelly, nurturing a blanket of fescue allows him to weed out
the stress of a hectic workweek in wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains the entrance to his Hanover West subdivision
because he knows landscaping improves property values. ``We're big
into curb appeal here,'' he says. ``We're the first yard that
people see when they turn into our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kelly, Wesley Levy sets the standard on his Lithonia
street. Every seven days, the retired carpenter spends about five
hours mowing, edging and mulching his Bermuda grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also sits on a bench and pulls the roots of weeds up, one
by one, using (the claw of) a hammer,'' his wife, Carmen, says.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband believes that by setting an example, others will
follow. And they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do whatever Mr. Levy does,'' says next-door neighbor
Rudy Germain. ``I try to make mine perfect, but his _ his is always
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The two do their best to encourage a homogenous look along Great
Oaks Drive, Levy says. ``When we mow, we both cut our lawns up to
our neighbor's driveways to keep it all even.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsession or dedication? Once, while Levy traveled abroad for
two weeks, Germain mowed his neighbor's lawn three times, and ``he
wouldn't take a penny,'' Levy recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dickinson and Pat Apps can identify. The two live across a
cul-de-sac from each other in Alpharetta's Medlock Bridge, where
they exchange plenty of sod stories.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Paul's wife feels like a weed widow.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband's a lawn fanatic,'' Linda Dickinson says. ``His
idea of relaxation is 1) working on the lawn/landscaping, 2)
admiring the lawn/landscaping, 3) watching the sprinkler system
water the lawn/landscaping. It bothers him when people don't take
care of their yards. I agree that our yard looks great, and I
appreciate all of his hard work, but he is only 36 years old.
Shouldn't there be another topic of conversation that takes
precedence over lawn care?''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson, a technical manager at Lucent Technologies, downplays
his commitment and says he spends less than two hours mowing and
edging every Saturday. He relies on an irrigation system for
watering ``twice a week, 40 minutes per zone, 5 to 7 a.m.'' _ to
the tune every other month in summer of $350.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of work, but I like the exercise and getting
outside, especially in the evenings,'' says his neighbor Apps, a
product engineer. ``I try to mow and edge mine every five days, but
that's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Lawn Brother. Apps' lawn is like Dickinson's _ Bermuda in
front, fescue in back. ``I think the neighborhood requires it,''
Apps says.
</P>
<P>
   Community restrictions have become commonplace. Schultz, one of
the nation's foremost experts on natural lawn care, considers the
lawn a symbol of suburban conformity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It signals others that we conform to the unspoken rules of the
neighborhood design. (Sometimes these rules are not so subtle. In
certain communities, homeowners are required to keep 75 percent of
their lots in turf grass. In other communities, homeowners must
keep the lawn at a height under 3 inches.) Why? Anything else is
subversive, un-American. There might be communists hiding in the
weeds.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an age when fewer and fewer know their neighbors, lawn
conformity also satisfies a need to belong. ``Through the lawn, we
can join others without having to deal with the unpleasantness of
actually talking to them,'' Schultz says.
</P>
<P>
   But others see it differently; some lawns brings neighbors
together.
</P>
<P>
   From Tupperware to sod. Steve Arthur has spent nearly 40 years
transforming his Buckhead lawn into what at first glance resembles
a small golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to a beautiful fescue lawn, he says, is mowing it
high, 3 to 4 inches. The large yard requires a tractor mower, which
often leaves tracks. ``By the time the grass stands back up, it's
time to mow it again,'' Arthur says.
</P>
<P>
   The job takes about a half day, but at least fescue doesn't
require as much edging and trimming as other grasses. ``It gets
overwhelming sometimes, but I enjoy it,'' says the 81-year-old
retiree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of people stop by and ask me about it. We end up
pulling up a chair and visiting for 15 minutes or so.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mark Lieberman, sod became an instrument for meeting his
neighbors after moving into his Alpharetta neighborhood 13 years
ago. ``We had a sod party because we laid it on about the same
day,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his zoysia has spread over a bare spot in his
neighbor's yard, and Lieberman mows it.
</P>
<P>
   Got to love it. Twice, he's laid sod _ 5,000 square feet in the
front and 5,000 in back _ and finally he's achieved a thick, dense
carpet. Lieberman, a vice-president for sales at G E Capital,
attributes part of his success to his recent purchase of a $1,000
reel mower, which he says gives a cleaner, finer cut than a
rotary-powered one.
</P>
<P>
   Although zoysia is a slow grower, he mows it every week. ``When
it has that clean cut, it has a whole different feel _ that golf
course look,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The maintenance begins in February when he dethatches, followed
by applying a pre-emergent to prevent weeds. In late April, he
scalps the lawn to force new growth, then cuts it weekly to about
3/4- inches. During the growing season, he fertilizes every other
month and in November submits soil samples to the County Extension
Service to identify his lawn's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife says to hire someone for all of this, but I really
like doing it,'' Lieberman says. ``It's like people who wax their
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his dedication surprises even himself. ``Twenty years
ago, I couldn't have had a conversation about grass because I
couldn't have cared less,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you buy a house, everything changes.''
</P>

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Which of these numbers are most significant about America's
three largest churches?
 &HT;    -- The United Methodist Church, with 8.4 million members, lost
only 38,477 members last year, its smallest decrease in history.
 &HT;    -- The Southern Baptist Convention reported its first membership
decline since 1926, a drop of 162,000 members, bringing its
membership down to 15.7 million.
 &HT;    -- The Roman Catholic Church grew by a half million last year,
to 62 million.
 &HT;    The Southern Baptist figure appears the most important, because
it reversed seven decades of continual growth. Actually, the
decline appears to be a one-year anomaly due to the elimination of
double counting of some churches which were affiliated with two
state conventions, because they were located near state lines. The
new numbers are simply more accurate.
 &HT;    In fact, Baptist worship attendance grew in 1998 by 3 percent to
5,399,000 and church giving grew 5 percent to $7.45 billion. Sunday
School attendance grew slightly, to 8,148,000. These are positive
trends.
 &HT;    The more significant Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) fact is
rarely reported on. Of the 15.7 million reported members of the
denomination, 5 million are ''nonresident members.''
 &HT;    In 1988, I remember asking Dr. Adrian Rogers, who had just been
elected SBC President, ''What is a nonresident member?'' He
replied, ''The FBI couldn't find them.''
 &HT;    A more technical answer came from SBC statistician Cliff Sharp:
''A nonresident member lives too far away to attend, such as a
student off at college.'' A vastly larger group moved away or
changed churches but did not remove their names from Baptist church
rolls.
 &HT;    Ghosts should be eliminated from the rolls. There are not 15.7
million Southern Baptists, but 10.7 million.
 &HT;    That is still an impressive number, the largest Protestant
denomination in America. Compared to 10.7 million, a Sunday School
attendance of 8.15 million looks great.
 &HT;    A much greater inflation of membership can be seen in the
National Baptist Convention (NBC), the African-American
denomination that has been claiming 8.2 million members.
 &HT;    Scandals swirled around its president, Henry J. Lyons, who was
recently convicted of fraud, taking funds from the church for his
personal use and for mistresses. Press stories raised questions
about the size of the denomination, suggesting there were more
likely only one to two million members.
 &HT;    Dr. Nancy Ammerman, a researcher with Hartford Seminary,
recently went to NBC's new Nashville headquarters, built by Lyon.
She was shocked to discover ''There is no denominational
headquarters. There is a building, but there is no national staff.
I found an empty building. I rang a doorbell, and the only person
who was answering the phone by herself, would not open the door.''
 &HT;    Indeed, when I called, I only got a recording, referring me to
other numbers if I wanted to come to the NBC convention. No one is
counting church membership.
 &HT;    Other denominations with spongy numbers are the Eastern
Orthodox, whose counts include the third generation of immigrants,
though they may not attend.
 &HT;    Eileen Lindner, editor of the widely respected annual Yearbook
of American and Canadian Churches, has gotten a grant from the
Lilly Endowment to help denominations develop a consistent
definition of membership, and to offer technical aid to
denominations whose number-gathering has been weak.
 &HT;    By contrast, United Methodist membership numbers are credible,
because local churches pay apportionments to the national
denomination based on size. Thus, a church with 400 members on its
rolls, but only 200 attending regularly, has reason to be honest.
 &HT;    ''You can believe their numbers because there is an incentive to
not pad the rolls. This is the case with many of the mainline
denominations -- Episcopal, Presbyterian,'' says Ammerman.
 &HT;    Their problem is that of a massive hemorrhaging of members, a
loss of a third in 30 years.
 &HT;    Roman Catholics have a totally different way of defining
membership. In contrast to Baptists, who only baptize adults,
Catholics baptize infants and tend to count families, not
individuals, according to Prof. Brian Froehle of Georgetown
University. Millions of Catholics who no longer attend Mass still
identify themselves as Catholics, if asked.
 &HT;    Hispanics have flooded Catholic churches in border states
without registering as members. Southwestern dioceses tend to
estimate membership.
 &HT;    The overall growth of Catholics masks the fact that as Catholics
get older, many become Protestant. Gallup Polls reveal that 29
percent of Americans under age 30 are Catholic vs. only 23 percent
of those over 50. By contrast, the percentage who are Protestant
rises from 45 percent of those under age 30 to 64 percent over age
50.
 &HT;    The good news is that church attendance in America is two to
four times that of Europe.

   Good caulk job can last for years
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're planning to spruce up your digs this summer,
you'll want to add bathroom caulking to your to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   This is a job you can pay a plumber or contractor to do, but if
you're handy, the task is pretty easy.
</P>
<P>
   And how long will the caulking last?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use a good, 50-year silicone, it's going to stay good
indefinitely,'' said John Adivari, district trainer for Lowe's Home
Center in Woodstock (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Homeowners are far more particular than contractors. I try to
train homeowners to be particular, but to take shortcuts'' to get
the job done, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  100 percent pure silicone caulk
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plastic putty knife or caulk remover tool
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rubbing or denatured alcohol
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  2-inch wide quick release masking tape
</P>
<P>
   Step one: Remove old caulk with a putty knife or caulk remover
tool. With alcohol, clean the area where new caulk will be applied.
</P>
<P>
   Step two: Place masking tape above and below the area to be
caulked. Step three: Snip tip of caulk tube at an angle, so caulk
comes out with proper application edge.
</P>
<P>
   Step four: Apply caulk in a thin, straight line between taped
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Step five: Moisten fingertip and spread caulk until it is
smooth. Immediately remove tape before caulk dries. Wipe up any
excess with alcohol. Allow caulk to dry overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product: Newly applied caulk in the bathroom.

`EYES WIDE SHUT': DANGER AND DESIRE IN A HAUNTING BEDROOM ODYSSEY 
</HEADLINE>
 - (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the grippingly bizarre settings and situations that
Stanley Kubrick's films favored, what could be more startling than
the scene that opens ``Eyes Wide Shut''? It's only the sight of two
people who resemble glamorous movie stars getting ready for a
black-tie party. ``How do I look?'' she asks, and he says she looks
perfect _ even though she is perched on a toilet wearing eyeglasses
with her evening gown, and he is too busy studying himself in a
mirror to notice. Look no further than this for a sense of what
this film's title signifies, or how craftily its illusions of
ordinariness and intimacy seduce the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   There is consolation for having to read the words ``The End'' on
the posthumous work of Kubrick: As a literally spellbinding
addition to the Kubrick canon, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' would have been
greeted with the same fascination had its director not died four
days after completing it. And it would go on to rattle audiences in
the same quietly devastating way. In what is truly the riskiest
film of his career, the man who could create a whole new universe
with each undertaking chose the bedroom as the last frontier, to
the point where prolonged conjugal conversations mark the dramatic
high points in a long, winding and surreal story. Often accused of
creating icy characters, he touched the hidden part of the iceberg
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' provides a stunning epiphany for the summer
of the dirty joke. This is a dead-serious film about sexual
yearnings, one that flirts with ridicule yet sustains its
fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. The dreamlike
intensity of previous Kubrick visions is in full force here, in an
adaptation of a 1926 Viennese novella that is stark and haunting in
its own right. In Arthur Schnitzler's ``Dream Story,'' which the
film follows with such surprising ease that its New York has a
grandly Viennese flavor, a doctor and his wife are teased apart by
sexual jealousy as the husband is drawn into ``a wild, shadowlike
succession of gloomy and lascivious adventures, all without an
end.'' Step by step, this languorous yet precise film glides into a
similarly mysterious realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed unreal: his home, his wife, his child, his
profession, and even he himself, mechanically walking along through
the nocturnal streets with his thoughts roaming through space,''
wrote Schnitzler, describing the erotically charged odyssey that
Kubrick and his two intrepid stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman,
bring to life here. How hilarious Ms. Kidman must have found the
flap over her fleetingly bare backside in ``The Blue Room,'' since
``Eyes Wide Shut'' has her slipping gracefully out of her dress in
its very first frame. But that play, also derived from Schnitzler,
made a valuable undress rehearsal for the physical animation she
displays here.
</P>
<P>
   A word about the titillation factor, in a film that brings the
failings of the MPAA ratings system to the boiling point: ``Eyes
Wide Shut'' is suffused with sexual possibility at every turn and
uses frontal nudity to deliberately potent effect, yet its mood is
not strictly one of eroticism. Here sex and death are inextricably
interwoven, never more so than in the vision of sexual purgatory in
a ritualized, moribund orgy sequence, one that has been digitally
censored to win the film its R rating.
</P>
<P>
   The changes _ adding computer-generated figures that partly
obscure sexual activity during a 65-second sequence _ are a joke.
The meaning and effect of the acts witnessed remain the same.
(Critics were shown both versions.) And any system that puts such a
profoundly adult film in the same category as ``American Pie,''
``South Park'' and ``Lake Placid'' is inadequate to the nuances of
an R-rated world. As the R is allowed to disintegrate into an
outright goal for teen-agers, the system has left itself no way to
differentiate between crude frat-boy jokes about having sex with
dessert and this intricately nuanced exploration of the nature of
sexual bonds. The NC-17 rating has degenerated into a stigma, so it
would have been worse than useless for a legitimately adult film
like this.
</P>
<P>
   Ushered in with a waltz, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' written by Kubrick
and Frederic Raphael, begins by sweeping Dr. William Harford (
Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Ms. Kidman), out of their art-filled,
oddly insinuating Manhattan apartment and into the midst of a
lavish Christmas party. (The paintings, preternaturally vibrant
images of pets, vegetables and flowers, are by the late filmmaker's
wife, Christiane Kubrick, and Katharina Hobbs.) To the tunes of
mischievous musical selections like ``I'm in the Mood for Love''
and ``I Only Have Eyes for You,'' the Harfords mingle with the
crowd. Soon each of them is in the midst of a flirtation, Alice
with a debonair European who asks her, ``Don't you think one of the
trials of marriage is that it makes deception a necessity for both
parties?'' Bill, meanwhile, is arm in arm with two alluring women
who promise to take him ``where the rainbow ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's subliminal manipulation is already at work. As in
dreams, odd details stand out in bold relief. The word rainbow will
figure later in the story, as will the curious fact that the
pianist at the party, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), knew Bill at
medical school and is playing a downtown engagement at a place
called the Sonata Cafe. ``Hey, wasn't it around here that the
Donner party got snowbound?'' Shelley Duvall asks at the beginning
of ``The Shining''; ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is loaded with that kind of
sly foreshadowing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It also gives an otherworldly radiance and personality to
Christmas lights, just as it overpoweringly deploys certain colors,
most notably red and blue. The conjugal life is bathed in red, at
first, and death and danger in blue _ until the film begins
switching and juxtaposing them incessantly to create underlying
tension. The advent of purple, first on the dress of a young
prostitute and later on the sheets where Alice sleeps, has its own
innate drama. So does the jarringly red pool table used in one of
the few ill-advisedly earthbound scenes in the film, a denouement
that threatens to rupture the reverie with too much
cloak-and-dagger plot.
</P>
<P>
   When the party's slightly unsavory host, played by Sydney
Pollack in a role first meant for Harvey Keitel, summons Bill
upstairs to treat a beautiful, unclothed woman suffering a drug
overdose, the contrast between hidden and overt experience emerges
full-blown. Cruise, artfully using his golden-boy carapace in this
tricky role, saves the victim and tells her she's ``a very, very
lucky girl'' while seeming not even to notice her nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Back home and both fueled by sexual jealousy, the Harfords
retreat into conjugal ardor. But it doesn't take long for their
intimacy to escalate into a fight. Giving themselves over wholly to
the film's intimate range and mounting tension, Cruise and Ms.
Kidman play out a long, marijuana-laced argument in their
underwear, and all of the film's credibility hangs on their ability
to make the exchange seem real. They achieve this with obvious
bravery, to the point where the argument scene becomes the film's
driving force. Enraged (in a major holdover from Schnitzler) when
his wife confesses to having wildly desired a stranger, Cruise's
Bill moves bitterly into a nightful of vividly conjured
temptations, which are suddenly set off by a telephone call.
Throughout his adventures, like any dreamer, he is occasionally
saved by the bell.
</P>
<P>
   On goes ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' to the Sonata Cafe and over the
Rainbow, into a string of grippingly intense encounters that test
Bill over and over. Part of the film's sustained tension comes from
the slow, ribbonlike way in which these episodes unfold, with
fidget-prompting long takes and not much background music to
provide relief; part of it comes from the viewer's complete
uncertainty about what will happen next. These open-ended vignettes
feature small, indelible performances _ from Alan Cumming as a
conspiratorial hotel concierge, glowering Rade Sherbedgia as the
proprietor of a costume rental shop and Leelee Sobieski as his
naughty daughter (perfectly embodying the ``smile of impish
desire'' described by Schnitzler), Vinessa Shaw and Fay Masterson
as prostitutes who entangle Bill _ that define the film's landscape
as surely as topographical features would.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of this odyssey, which leads Bill to the masked orgy
sequence that must have been sheer insanity to film at Kubrick's
perfectionist pace, and ultimately takes him to a place where red
and blue are absurdly yet touchingly reconciled, is not easily
calculated while ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is under way. Despite some
abrupt editing in a work that the director never lived to
fine-tune, the film moves effortlessly, and it goes straight under
the skin. Its powerful and lingering resonance attests to a final
compassion and profundity in Kubrick, the body-and-soul commitment
of Cruise and Ms. Kidman, and the Rorschach-like ability of this
material to envelop audiences in ways unexplained and unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes on,'' Pollack's character says cynically late in the
film. ``It always does, until it doesn't.'' Along with that
sentiment, Kubrick left one more brilliantly provocative tour de
force as his epitaph.

`I'M LOSING YOU': WHAT CAN YOU DO AT DEATH'S DOOR? YOU CAN LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although ``I'm Losing You'' was adapted from Bruce Wagner's
scabrous, razor-sharp Hollywood novel by Wagner himself, it bears
surprisingly slender resemblance to his book.
</P>
<P>
   Acerbic as it is, Wagner's first film is still very much the
watered-down version. That ought to be enough, since on film, ``I'm
Losing You'' unfolds in a doom-tinged, AIDS-minded milieu where the
sardonic quips fly like tennis balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am death warmed over,'' says Buck Henry, as an AIDS patient,
to Frank Langella's character, a television mogul newly diagnosed
with lung cancer. ``You're death warming up.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``I'm Losing You'' was a busy, convoluted book, a nearly
unfilmable one. And it loses some of its cumulatively mordant
atmosphere when pared down this way. The cast is good, particularly
Langella as the big kahuna behind a ``Star Trek''-like franchise,
and Rosanna Arquette as a woman acutely sensitive to the grim
tidings all around her.
</P>
<P>
   And the production is archly evocative, noting some of the finer
nuances to be found along the Hollywood food chain. If the film
doesn't quite hang together, it does capture the black humor and
mournful angst at the heart of the material.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone in the film is somehow chicly entwined with
death, like a woman with AIDS (Elizabeth Perkins) who emerges from
a bathroom reciting Emily Dickinson and adding: ``You're free to
wash up now. I'm finished vomiting.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the mogul's son, played by Andrew McCarthy, whom she first
encounters this way, in a film full of dysfunctional relationships
and mounting dread. With a debt to the California anomie of ``Play
It As It Lays,'' this is a film in which a dying character develops
an interest in expensive watches as a means of dealing with
mortality.
</P>
<P>
   The film's obsession with tainted blood also carries Ms.
Arquette's character into the realm of Jewish ritual cleansing, the
kind of thing that calls for a more delicate introduction than the
film can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner successfully echoes his book's bleak resonance, but his
straightforward ability with a camera is no match for what he can
do on the page. He does give the film a cool, calculated look that
preserves its discreet mournfulness and saves it from emotional
overkill.

`THE WOOD': WHEN LOSS OF VIRGINITY IS THE BIRTH OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in ``The Wood,'' a savvy, good-natured comedy that follows
the 13-year friendship of three black friends who met in junior
high school in Inglewood, Calif., there is a flashback in which the
three boys, Mike (Sean Nelson), Slim (Duane Finley) and Roland
(Trent Cameron) pool their change into a kitty and swear a pact.
Whoever is the first to lose his virginity will be the recipient of
the accumulated cash.
</P>
<P>
   If the notion of virginal high school boys goading each other
into a sexual contest is similar to the central conceit of the hit
teen-age comedy ``American Pie,'' ``The Wood'' doesn't use it as a
hook on which to string a succession of sniggering gross-out jokes.
Nor does it view its adolescent characters as dirty young men
plotting and scheming to trick girls into sleeping with them.
</P>
<P>
   The contest's winner turns out to be so enamored of the girl who
initiates him into sex that he doesn't boast about his conquest.
The scenes of that initiation in the girl's bedroom find a lovely
balance between ardent passion, comic bumbling, joy (his) and
silent disappointment (hers). The bumbling involves a defective
condom, the boy's anatomical ignorance and the unexpected return to
the house of a family member.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood,'' which ricochets back and forth in time between the
late 1980s and the present, is narrated by Mike, who in 1986 moves
with his mother from Winston-Salem, N.C., to a middle-class black
neighborhood in Inglewood. The movie is narrated by the grown-up
Mike (Omar Epps), who occasionally turns to speak directly to the
camera. Different actors also play the grown-up Slim (Richard T.
Jones) and Roland (Taye Diggs). And the physical continuity between
the characters as adolescents and their older selves requires some
suspension of disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's rapid transitions back and forth in time are
handled smoothly, and each character is fairly well defined. As it
follows the friends from junior to senior high school, then leaps
back to the present, the film, written and directed by Rick
Famuyiwa, pays close, expert attention to changing hairstyles,
fashions and music. Famuyiwa's dialogue is easygoing and witty, and
the warmhearted comic performances mesh beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in the present, just hours before the wedding
of Roland, who has fled in a last-minute panic to an
ex-girlfriend's house where he has become falling-down drunk. Mike
and Slim ply the groom-to-be with coffee and manage to get him into
a car whereupon he gets sick all over them. Some of the film's
funniest scenes follow the three as they cope with this crisis,
dousing themselves with a garden hose in the former girlfriend's
backyard, then entreating a reluctant dry cleaner to have their
clothes ready within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate last-minute cleanup resonates with the threesome's
adolescent adventures, none especially harrowing. They include
being stopped by the police in a car in which one person is
carrying a gun, finding themselves in the back of a grocery store
while it's being robbed and of course, pitching inept lines at
girls who adamantly stand their ground.
</P>
<P>
   What gives the film its emotional center is Nelson's poignant
performance as the shy, hormonally overloaded Mike, whose
girl-chasing adventures begin on the wrong foot when he accepts his
new friends' bet that he won't have the nerve to grab a girl in the
schoolyard. Malinda Williams plays the girl, Alicia, with just the
right mixture of sweetness and sass. In the tenderhearted world of
``The Wood'' (the nickname for Inglewood), that rude prank doesn't
preclude the possibility of a later, blossoming romance. &QL;

Q&AMP;A WITH NICOLE  KIDMAN  ON  `EYES WIDE SHUT`
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having devoted close to three years of her and her
husband Tom Cruise's working lives to Stanley Kubrick's
secrecy-shrouded final film, Nicole Kidman is as excited as anyone
that ``Eyes Wide Shut'' finally is about to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   While it's been anticipated for many different reasons, the
late, legendary director's first work in a dozen years represents
another major professional step for Kidman. Born in Hawaii and
raised in a progressive, academic household in Sydney, she had made
an impressive mark in Australian film and television circles before
meeting Cruise on the set of ``Days of Thunder'' 10 years ago and,
soon after, marrying the megastar.
</P>
<P>
   Unfamiliar to Hollywood, it took the 6-foot-tall redhead a
number of years to convince American producers and audiences that
she had more to offer than statuesque beauty. But a series of
provocative and accomplished projects _ the black comedy ``To Die
For,'' the difficult Henry James adaptation ``The Portrait of a
Lady,'' last year's sellout run of David Hare's stage play ``The
Blue Room'' _ recently have established her as one of the world's
most interesting actresses.
</P>
<P>
   Though paired with Cruise, with whom she has two adopted
children, in ``Eyes,'' she cuts a memorably distinctive figure in
the sexually charged psychological study. In a wide-ranging
interview, the friendly, funny and fiercely intelligent Kidman
addressed, among other tough subjects, the most unique and
rewarding job of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Daily News: ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is certainly not your average
Hollywood, nor even your average independent, production. Does it
feel like just another movie to you, or is it something more than
that?
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: Because of all the things that are attached to this
film, it's certainly the most personal thing that I've ever done.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, it's because we spent so long doing it. Also then, the
subject matter, and making it with the person that I live with. And
with one of the people who I admired most in the world and loved
most in the world, who then died ... There are just so many things
in relation to it that take it away from just being another film.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you say ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is so personal, you realize
that it's going to fuel speculation over what it might reveal about
your and Tom's much-speculated-on marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: I doubt people are going to think that the characters in
this movie are us. And I know what we are. We really know each
other, we're very committed to each other and we have a great, deep
love, which, I think, will see us through anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There must have been some uncomfortable moments while you
were developing these characters, though. Their problems with each
other stem from very intimate, honest places.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: Well, in a rehearsal room, I'm very honest. You feel
protected by the four walls, that you can say whatever you want and
it's not going to be repeated or put down. That was a pact between
Tom, Stanley and me: Everything that was said was private and would
be kept secret from that time on.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, at times, quite difficult, because I'd hear things
that I maybe didn't want to hear and, I think, Tom would hear
things that he didn't want to hear. It wasn't like therapy, because
you didn't have anyone say, `And how do you feel about that?' It
was honest, and brutally honest at times. But that's why it was so
extraordinary to make it with my partner. If we had made this a
year into our marriage, I don't think we would have gotten through
it. When you've been married for seven years, which we had when we
started this, you've reached a stage in the relationship when you
want to dig a little deeper anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And Kubrick, the director of such sensitive relationship
studies as ``The Shining,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'' and ``Lolita,''
guided you through all of this?
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: We talked about marriage and commitment and all of those
things. He wasn't judgmental, but he did have strong views.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Kubrick had a reputation for not caring much about actors,
yet you and Tom apparently loved and trusted him like few other
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: Well, Stanley's extraordinary confidence and belief in
his own intelligence and talent was the strongest factor about him.
He would listen to actors, though. Ultimately, the decisions were
all his, but he would pull things from you, he would watch. He was
a great observer of life and a great thinker.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the time element? The main photography lasted
nearly a year, there were about two more years' worth of
involvement before and after that, many shots required 35 takes,
some substantially more ...
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: There was something quite beautiful about that. In this
day and age, you have everybody wanting to make film after film
and, quick, get it out in time for summer or for Christmas.
Sometimes, the wonderful aspect of filmmaking or any sort of
artistic experience gets lost in that pressure to just have it
done. Stanley would not buy into that.
</P>
<P>
   It's something that I would have no qualms about doing again.
The only thing you miss out on is other roles, but if you're
working with a great director and a great script, well, what more
could you wish for?
</P>
<P>
   Q: You had just seen the director's cut of ``Eyes Wide Shut''
when Kubrick died unexpectedly last March. After such an intense
collaboration, it must have been devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: I'm 32, and it was probably the biggest shock that I've
had in my life. I didn't believe it, I wouldn't believe it. I'd
never had to deal with the finality of death, the loss of somebody
you cannot call on the phone anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There must have been another jolt when that posthumously
released trailer he wanted of you and Tom making out in the nude
came out.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: I was shocked when I first saw it. (Earlier on) I said
to Stanley, ``You cannot release this as the trailer,'' he said,
``Why?'' and I said ``Because I'm naked, Stanley!'' But what I want
or don't want ... I have no say in the marketing of this film.
(laughs) I did the scene, but I was thinking, ``Oh, gosh, this is
going to be so embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Understandable, yet you seem to be so uninhibited. You
undress in the first shot of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' You took off your
clothes every night when you appeared in ``The Blue Room'' in
London and on Broadway last year ...
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: It's actually not part of my makeup. I was not the girl
in Australia who was topless on the beach; all of my friends were,
but I was not. It's just that you get lost in a character and then
you have to deal with all of the other things that surround doing
nudity. But the one thing you do have is a character to hide
behind. And particularly with this film, I had the protection of
Stanley. I did not feel that I was being exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of not being exploited, you and Tom are fighting
back against the tabloids and winning.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: Well, people want to say things that aren't true. Yes,
you're meant to turn the other cheek and ignore it. But I also
think that there's a time when you have to stand up and say,
``We're willing to fight this battle.'' You can't do it on every
one and you shouldn't do it on every one. But I think that when
somebody calls you a liar or says that (your marriage) is a sham or
any of those sort of things, you have to fight them because that's
not true.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been back home in Sydney, where Tom is shooting
``Mission: Impossible 2,'' since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: Yeah. My sister lives up the road, and my mom's nearby.
The kids are in school.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does that, and the fact that the kids are getting older, make
you feel more like settling down in one place now?
</P>
<P>
   Kidman: I think we've got another couple of years we're going to
travel, and, then, we'll settle. But just in terms of being actors,
part of your existence is moving around. And we're very lucky
because both of us love to keep moving. I love the change, the
unpredictable. &QL;

`LAKE PLACID': HE'S IMAGINING HOW WELL YOU'D FIT BENEATH HIS SKIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the DOA nature of the genre it satirizes, the demon
crocodile movie ``Lake Placid'' finds a good deal to work with in
newly reptile-plagued Maine. As written by David E. Kelley with
tongue firmly in cheek, it provides a good cast with the challenge
of keeping straight faces.
</P>
<P>
   So Bridget Fonda plays the tick-hating paleontologist who is
sent from a New York museum to investigate a strange, recently
discovered artifact. (``You want me to go to Maine to look at a
tooth?'') And the splendid Irish actor Brendan Gleeson, star of
``The General,'' affects the accent to play the local sheriff who
greets her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to call it Lake Placid,'' he says, while giving
her a tour, ``but somebody said that name was taken.'' Well, no
matter. This is a movie that begins with a swimmer suddenly savaged
by an underwater monster (while the sheriff eats a Twinkie), and
``Jaws'' was taken, too.
</P>
<P>
   The tooth turns out to be prehistoric. (``Evidently it's
nothing,'' some sage decides.) Still, on the chance that it may
lead to a 30-foot-long, tail-snapping brute designed by Stan
Winston, a group of usual suspects gathers at the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pullman is on hand as the obligatory stern local hunk. And
Oliver Platt turns up as the wisecracking eccentric mythology
professor, of whom it is said reverently: ``He also treks the world
to _ to swim with crocodiles.''
</P>
<P>
   While making his flamboyant entrance, his character looks at Ms.
Fonda and exclaims, ``Oh, the earth is round, and so should you
be!'' Later on he manages to bring up Ancient Melanesia while
discussing crocodile lore.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue can be delicious. (Pullman: ``Any recent bear
attacks?'' Gleeson: ``This was no bear. Bears don't attack people
underwater.'') And the horror effects can be divinely cheesy, like
the presumed underwater sprinkler hose whose churning effect is
described as ``scared perch.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, while not trading quips, the characters actually go
through the motions of being scared of the croc, menaced by the
croc and so on. And since even the gator horror satire is old hat
(remember ``Alligator?''), there's no remaining way to make this
interesting. It doesn't help that the director, Steve Miner, makes
murky underwater shots in the Maine lake suggest the New York City
sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   There's some moderate gore here, most of it jokey. (``Is this
the man who was killed?'' Platt asks, wielding a severed toe.
Gleeson replies, ``He looked taller.'') And there's also Betty
White on hand to play the crocodile's best human friend. Her
character's foul-mouthed dialogue is funny for its incongruity,
less so for its real purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' could easily have been made as a PG-13 movie, or
perhaps even a PG. But the better to tempt teen-age audiences, it
talks its way into an R.
</P>
<P>

EVERYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT KUBRICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With his 13th and final feature film, ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' opening today, at least one of Stanley Kubrick's closely
guarded secrets will be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the famously private, reportedly eccentric master
filmmaker himself? The Bronx-born Kubrick, who spent most of the
last four decades of his life at a rambling estate in England,
shunned Hollywood, avoided the media and fairly effectively
enforced a code of silence among his collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   But following Kubrick's death March 7 at the age of 70, some of
the people who worked on ``Eyes Wide Shut'' began talking. In the
process, they painted a much more accessible, affectionate picture
than what had been assumed of the supposedly inscrutible genius
behind such masterpieces as ``The Killing,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,''
``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ``A Clockwork Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a partygoer, absolutely true,'' says Jan Harlan,
Kubrick's brother-in-law and executive producer of his last four
films (``Barry Lyndon,'' ``The Shining,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'' and
``Eyes''). ``I mean, he came to my house for New Year's Eve or
birthdays, but because he didn't like to carouse, does that make
him a recluse? I don't think so. He loved his house, and he was a
very dedicated family man. He just wasn't accessible to strangers,
and he didn't talk to the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the Kubrick legend were true, of course. Harlan
confirms the director's legendary passion for total artistic
control of his projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a wonderful guy to work for, but he was not easy,''
Harlan notes. ``He could be very difficult and he was definitely,
in fact, like a general. There were no committee meetings; he
decided what would go on, and his few collaborators would try to
help him execute what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one world-class filmmaker, Kubrick's
expertise-laden confidence was inspiring to behold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's given a new name to the word `meticulous,''' says
Oscar-winning filmmaker Sydney Pollack (``Out of Africa,''
``Tootsie,'' ``The Firm''), who replaced Harvey Keitel in a small
but key ``Eyes'' role. ``He was the most amazing man in terms of
his patience and his attention to detail and his absolute
meticulousness. I would think that, overall, is the thing that I
learned from him. And I learned a lot from him; he was just a
pleasure to watch in every department.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Stanley really took on most jobs (on the set),''
according to Harlan. ``He was really the key lighting guy, the key
cameraman, which our cameraman will readily admit. And he was
highly involved in the editing; (film editor) Nigel Galt will be
the first to confirm this.''
</P>
<P>
   With all his focus on the technical aspects of filmmaking,
though, it's naturally been assumed that Kubrick gave his actors
short shrift _ even if he did elicit top-flight performances from
the likes of Kirk Douglas (``Paths of Glory,'' ``Spartacus''),
James Mason (``Lolita''), Peter Sellers (``Lolita,'' ``Dr.
Strangelove''), Jack Nicholson (``The Shining'') and R. Lee Ermey
(``Full Metal Jacket''), among many others.
</P>
<P>
   But some ``Eyes'' actors say Kubrick was completely available,
even graciously attentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find him difficult at all, he was a pleasure to work
with,'' says young Leelee Sobieski (``Never Been Kissed,'' TV's
``Joan of Arc'' miniseries), who plays a teen-age temptress in
``Eyes Wide Shut.'' ``They were a great two months, working with
him. I only wish I was working with him now; at the time, I was
such a little girl, I really didn't realize what a genius he was.
I'd like to ask him so many more questions, and I would be in so
much more of a state of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent my mother and me this box of seven chocolates from all
around the world, and they were really delicious,'' Sobieski
recalls fondly. ``And he wrote me this sweet letter: `Leelee, I'm
sorry I didn't have enough time for you; next time I'll have to
show you around London.' I don't know if that ever would have
happened. But I think that he had a lot more amazing things inside
of him to give to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose role in ``Eyes'' was ultimately
essayed by another actress when scheduling conflicts prevented her
from filming some of Kubrick's numerous reshoots, has nothing but
good memories of the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a mensch, sweet and so smart and funny,'' Leigh
says of Kubrick. ``Nothing like I'd heard, so horrific and hard and
such a perfectionist he left no room for anybody's input. I found
him a very open and lovely guy; and he loved actors, gave us such a
luxurious amount of time to explore and get things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kubrick completed his cut of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' mere days
before he died in his sleep, much post-production work _ scoring,
sound-mixing, even the controversial (but reportedly
Kubrick-approved) imposition of digitally generated figures in
front of the more enthusiastic attendees at a vast orgy sequence _
still needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he was missed the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what he wanted, and it just had to be executed,''
Harlan says with deceptive matter-of-factness. ``It just had to be
done by his standards. The biggest difficulty was the constant
asking yourself, `How would Stanley have done it?' You couldn't
say, `Hey, do you like it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I hope we did well by him.''

`THIS BLESSED PLOT' : THE VIEW ACROSS THE CHANNEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By SAMUEL HYNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last 50 years of British politics, no other issue has
been as important, as divisive and as stubbornly irresolvable as
the struggle to turn Britain into a European country. ``Europe''
has dominated British foreign policy, split political parties,
rattled the economy, determined elections and overthrown a powerful
prime minister. It continues to be a determining factor in British
politics: in last month's elections for the European Parliament,
the Tories, a party that has been in intensive care since the 1997
elections, won more seats than the ruling Labor Party, with no more
platform than its intransigent opposition to a single European
currency.
</P>
<P>
   On the Continent during those 50 years, the European Union
slowly but steadily took form, expanding from an agreement on coal
and steel to an Economic Community, extending into international
law, moving toward a common social policy, a common defense policy
and eventually political union. While that steady evolution toward
union proceeded, politicians across the Channel in Britain jittered
uncertainly, like children at the edge of a cold sea: one step
forward, one step back, a plunge in at the wrong time, then a quick
withdrawal from the shock of contact. For Britain it was a
half-century of stumbling national embarrassment; and the story is
still unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   No British writer is better qualified to tell that story than
Hugo Young. As political editor of The Sunday Times, political
columnist for The Guardian and biographer of Margaret Thatcher, he
has been for more than 30 years as close to the political
playmakers of Westminster as one could get without entering the
game.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of union with Europe, he is neither a Europhile
nor Europhobe, but a Euro-realist. In his view, union has been
Britain's destiny from the beginning; ``Europe'' was going to
happen, and British leaders should have recognized that truth and
joined in at the start. They didn't. They rejected the Schuman
Plan, stayed away from the Messina Conference, declined to sign the
Treaty of Rome, agreed to monetary union only tardily and
reluctantly (and then withdrew) and opted out of important clauses
of the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Young is impatient with this battle against the tide: ``British
perversity,'' he calls it. During the years when the European
Community was evolving, opportunities arose that Britain should
have seized at once, he says; but time passed, nothing was done,
and the opportunities were lost. The moral is clear: a nation that
denies its destiny will get it anyway, but on worse terms.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Britain's stumbling course toward union is not a
story of party against party; both Labor and the Conservatives have
split on the issue. For Labor's Old Left, union has sometimes
seemed a capitalist conspiracy and sometimes a socialist
opportunity, while for Tony Blair's New Labor it has simply been
the future, as easy to accept as next year's calendar. Conservative
moderates like Edward Heath have urged entry into Europe as an
economic necessity, but to Tories on his right, union in all its
stages has seemed a monster that would devour British sovereignty
and separate the nation from its two great alliances, with the
Commonwealth and with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Young's title comes from Shakespeare's ``Richard II,'' in which
the dying John of Gaunt mourns the decline of England, ``this
blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,'' Young's book
is a political drama with a cast of characters taken from what he
calls ``the political class,'' the elected members of British
governments and their advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Young has little good to say about them. He finds the class as a
whole guilty of ``incompetence and bad faith,'' ``vacillating
torpor,'' ``helpless ambivalence'' and ``evasion and duplicity.''
These seem to be peculiarly British political failings; the
political class in Europe works well enough, by Young's account.
</P>
<P>
   He compares himself at one point to a scientist, ``curious to
map the pathology'' of his specimens. But when the heat of the
drama rises, the specimens become individuals with their own
complex and memorable identities, often fixed in a vivid phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The stars are of course the prime ministers: Winston Churchill
at Zurich in 1946, the ``grandiloquent map maker'' breathing out
rhetorical promises; Harold Macmillan, ``besotted and ensnared by
the past'' and no match for Charles de Gaulle; Harold Wilson, whose
mastery of ambiguity amounted to genius; Margaret Thatcher, who
cried ``No!'' while she took Britain further into Europe and in the
end was undone by what she had done; poor John Major,
underqualified and overshadowed, whose photo in the book is
captioned, ``My hesitation is final.''
</P>
<P>
   Two are the heroes of the story: Edward Heath, the most faithful
and courageous of British Europeans, and Tony Blair, left at the
book's end confronting the completion of the job: a common
currency, a common defense and ultimately political union: a United
States of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Prime ministers are the stars, but there are many other strong
characters: the would-be prime ministers, Hugh Gaitskill and Rab
Butler and Roy Jenkins; the Continental players, de Gaulle, Jean
Monnet, Paul-Henri Spaak and Helmut Kohl, and a supporting cast of
minor figures, middle-level Whitehall officials whose names we
don't recognize, who understood the future and tried to move
Britain toward it but were impeded by the incompetence and
duplicity of their bosses. Young is a brilliant portraitist, a just
historian of this huge cast and a lucid teller of their complicated
story.
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of the book he quotes from the writing of Sir
John Tizard in 1949 when he was chief scientific adviser to the
Ministry of Defense: ``We persist in regarding ourselves as a Great
Power, capable of everything and only temporarily handicapped by
economic difficulties. We are not a Great Power and never will be
again. We are a great nation, but if we continue to behave like a
Great Power, we shall soon cease to be a great nation.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the year of the first meeting of the European Assembly.
It was wise advice then, and it is wise now, but it has not yet
been learned by all the members of the political class or by all
the people. Britain _ not ``Great'' Britain any longer _ is a small
nation on the edge of Europe, burdened by history and by memory,
still learning the difference between power and lower-case
greatness.

 &HT;    A serving of memories and mayonnaise
 &HT;    CORRECTION ADVISORY: nutritional analysis of fat grams in recipe
should be 2 grams instead of 17.
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On this day, Michael Lee West is again praising mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just any mayonnaise, though. It's her far-and-away
favorite _ Duke's _ unavailable where the author lives in Lebanon,
Tenn., outside Nashville. But here it is, she says with relish in a
phone interview, as given to her by a devoted reader at a book
signing in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply to the thoughtful giver? ``It transforms everything.
... I'm your devoted food slave.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an auspicious gift can mean only one thing to a woman whose
life, as well as the lives of a bunch of relatives she labels
``eccentric,'' revolves around food: Time to make potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the beginning of an essay from West's new book,
``Consuming Passions: A Food Obsessed Life'' (HarperCollins, $25).
(For information on her upcoming Atlanta book signing, see page
H1). In fact, one chapter is entitled ``In Praise of Mayonnaise.''
Another, ``Potato Salad,'' begins: ``When we lived in New Orleans,
my mama gave loud dinner parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Categorizing this book is not nearly as easy as reading it.
Nonfiction, it is a memoir with embellishments. Yes, her mother did
threaten to swing from the chandelier of a swanky club. But, no,
she did not actually swing, West says, admitting the exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a cookbook, though it contains an impressive batch of
recipes for such nostalgic fare as Lilly's Fried Cabbage, which
conjures a hungry ghost; Ary Jean's Gumbo, from her mother, who
objects vehemently to the mere mention of okra in such a stew, said
mention of which leads to said chandelier-swinging; and Sugared
Violets, to pretty up a coconut cake.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to writing fiction, West, 45, began the memoir when
asked if she would like to write something for the Junior League of
Atlanta's 1995 cookbook, ``True Grits: Tall Tales and Recipes From
the New South.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I came home and wrote a little essay on iced tea (published
in `True Grits') and enjoyed it so much I wrote another one on cast
iron.'' Soon her agent thought there was a book in it, the
publisher agreed and it was released in May.
</P>
<P>
   These days, West spends much of her 12-to-15-hour writing day on
a sequel to ``Crazy Ladies'' called ``Mad Girls in Love,'' which
should be out in a year. She also has plans for another novel, but
after ``Mad Girls'' will begin a screenplay for Laura Dern, who has
optioned ``She Flew the Coop.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing, she's been testing recipes. Raleigh News
&AMP; Observer food editor Susan Houston asked West to pick the best
reader recipes in a contest for covered dishes ``to take to someone
who's sick, just had a baby, or to a funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, we seem to be drawn to whenever there's a crisis
to bring food,'' Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly true in West's ``eccentric'' family, lovingly
pictured in ``Consuming Passions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very colorful relatives, all joined by our love of food.
And they still are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her oldest son, Trey, is sous chef at the Lodge at Little St.
Simons Island. When she's home at their renovated funeral home, and
cooking, husband Will and 15-year-old son Tyler are among the
beneficiaries. So are neighbors, one of whom, after receiving the
product of a recipe test, sent back the dish with a note saying it
was delicious and had prompted her to get back in her own kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what I wanted to do,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's getting older or getting my hands into
the flour, but I'm thinking this is wonderful.''

</P>
<P>
   This is one of two quick shrimp dishes West's mother claims are
``company-acceptable.'' To make 4 servings, use the smallest
amounts of butter, flour and shrimp listed. It is rich and
comforting, but some of the company might like to add a dash of
cayenne or Tabasco.

</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes, Chilling time: several hours
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 8-10 minutes per cookie sheet
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when Michael Lee West goes on a book tour, her husband
and son ask her to make and leave behind a batch of these cookies,
which, unlike most gingersnaps, are moist in the center. The recipe
is from a woman from whom the Wests purchased a bed said by the
owner to have belonged to Margaret Mitchell. She also said this
recipe was given to her by a Georgia woman who knew Mitchell and
made the cookies for her when she was writing.
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups granulated sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsulfured molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   In a medium mixing bowl, combine melted butter, 1 cup sugar,
molasses and egg. Mix well. Into another bowl, sift together the
flour, baking soda, cloves, ginger, cinnamon and salt. Stir dry
mixture into sugar mixture. The dough will be soft and sticky.
Cover dough and chill several hours. When ready to bake, preheat
oven to 375 degrees. Roll bits of chilled dough into 1-inch balls.
Then roll each ball in the remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Place 2 inches
apart on cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven,
let cool 1 minute on sheets, then remove to wire racks to cool
completely. Store in an airtight container. _ Adapted from:

billion articles of clothing and gave the Salvation Army alone
several hundred million pieces, well over 100,000 tons. The glut is

 &HT;    HOUSE MEMBERS CRITICIZE NEW LIMITS ON TUNA CATCH
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House members Thursday criticized a new federal
rule limiting recreational fishermen to three yellowfin tuna a day.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of a House Resources subcommittee, Rep. Jim Saxton,
R-N.J., called the rule issued by the National Marine Fisheries
Service ``premature.'' Prior to the new limit, ``the recreational
yellowfin tuna fishery had been successfully self-regulated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowfin tuna are a highly migratory fish species that inhabit
the Atlantic. In the United States, they are most commonly found
off the coasts of eastern Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which became effective July 1, is part of the
Fisheries Service's final fish management plan for Atlantic tuna,
swordfish and sharks. The plan was released in April and was
required by the 1996 amendments of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which
requires the rebuilding and maintaining of overfished areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These management measures are consistent with Magnuson-Stevens
Act requirements to prevent overfishing before it occurs,'' said
Dr. Gary Matlock, the service's director of sustainable fisheries.
``If this stock becomes overfished, fishermen would have to face
more stringent management measures in order to rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said that with the limit, U.S.
recreational fishermen will lose their desire to fish for yellowfin
tuna. ``The bottom line is that there's an incentive for people if
they know that they can catch more than three. If that incentive
isn't there, even if they don't catch them, it's a disincentive.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee members also asked why the service obtains its
scientific information on Atlantic tuna stock through ICATT, the
international commission for tuna conservation.
</P>
<P>
   They said it would have been more appropriate to use scientific
information provided by the states when developing a rule that
affects the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Freeman, a research scientist at the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection, agreed that the service isn't using
the best scientific information possible. Instead of limiting the
number of fish that can be caught, the service instead should
recommend minimum size regulations to prevent overharvesting, he
said.

NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: AN ODE TO OLD AGE, LIFE'S GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the age of 59, Marcia Tucker is bidding farewell
to the New Museum of Contemporary Art in her usual style. Her swan
song at the museum she single-handedly founded 22 years ago is
``The Time of Our Lives,'' an exhibition that is characteristically
personal, topical, rough around the edges and intent on raising
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately sappy and insightful, this exhibition ignores most
esthetic issues and instead brings together a broad array of art
and artifacts _ from paintings to television commercials _
pertaining to a complex human and social theme: growing old. The
result is less an art exhibition than a multifaceted learning
experience; therein lie its weaknesses as well as its intermittent
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Aging is a condition from which no one who is lucky enough to
live so long escapes, a condition that many, American women in
particular, view with sometimes crippling, self-negating, if
self-indulgent despair. With increased life expectancy and the
graying of the immense baby boomer generation, aging is an ever
more visible fact of American life, a subject of study on many
fronts and an economic factor as well.
</P>
<P>
   Geriatric specialists are on the rise in the medical profession.
``Age theory'' has become a subject for scholars and cultural
critics who are dovetailing it with existing theories about race,
gender and identity. Aging is more and more a subject of television
specials, talk shows and articles in fashion magazines; a spur to
the cosmetics and health industries and the building of both
retirement communities and ``old age'' residences.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these developments, however, ours is a profoundly
youth-oriented culture that often seems to believe that the aged
should be neither seen nor heard. Ageism, as Ms. Tucker points out
in her spirited catalog essay, is a prejudice like any other. It
permeates our lives from birth, affecting everything from
government policy to popular culture and the media. Youth is
equated with beauty, aging with death.
</P>
<P>
   As a crude measure of how society views aging, we have only to
consider the rather short professional life of the Hollywood
actress, the paradigm of youth and beauty, and the interesting
actresses on the far side of 40 who have not appeared in a movie in
years. Ms. Tucker means for her exhibition to take a look at all
this and in particular how society's notions about age affect
women's views of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The works of art, film and video on view here mostly confront
the joys or sorrows of aging head-on; others address the obsession
with youth or the passage of time itself. Also on view on different
monitors throughout the show are pertinent television commercials
and sitcoms, including the famous 1972 segments of ``Maude,'' in
which the 47-year-old Maude (Bea Arthur) discovers to her horror
that she is pregnant; and ``When You're Hot, You're Hot'' and
``Edith's Problem,'' segments from ``Cybill'' and ``All in the
Family,'' respectively, in which lead characters confront
menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the museum's ground-floor galleries are devoted to a
display of 35 works by 21 artists, some well known and some less
familiar, two-thirds of whom are women. Images of the aging female
body, usually nude, predominate.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with Jeff Wall's glowing Duratran-box image of
the interior of a modern library into which he has digitally
inserted the colossal image of a naked older woman who towers over
the library visitors.
</P>
<P>
   She stands on the landing of a sleekly 20th-century double
staircase, much the way an idealized statue of a Greek god might
occupy a landing on the marble staircase of a library at an old,
established men's college _ a symbol of pride, beauty and cultural
accomplishment so thoroughly taken for granted that no one bothers
to look at it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way is Lisa Yuskavage's ``Manifest Destiny,'' a
characteristically ambiguous image featuring one of the artist's
libidinous vixens, shown here in the shadow of a tall, icy,
columnlike woman, an idealized female who has in effect become her
own pedestal. Next to it is Marina Abramovic's ``Cleaning the
Mirror II,'' a vanitas image in video that consists of a close-up
of the artist lying naked beneath a human skeleton that shifts,
coming ever so slightly to life, when she breathes.
</P>
<P>
   Other works include a series of four photographs from Consuelo
Castaneda's ``Speed-Split'' series in which the artist is seen from
above lying beside her mother, their naked bodies tenderly curled
together in a pose that is both fetal and suggestive of the
``spooning'' of lovers; Nancy Burson's heartrending photographs of
children suffering from progeria, a rare genetic disorder that ages
them prematurely; and ``70 + 1,'' a startlingly three-dimensional
full-length hologram self-portrait by Harriet Casdin-Silver, in
which the 71-year-old artist stands tall (balanced on one foot),
while cupping her breasts.

 NEW YORK: her breasts.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Cindy Sherman's best-known ``Sex'' series images further
reminds us that desire is not the exclusive domain of youth. It
shows an old hag, constructed from prosthetic body parts, giving
birth to a string of sausages, a mad, toothless grin on her face.
Jacqueline Hayden makes a similar point in a large untitled black
and white photograph from her ``Figure Model'' series, which quotes
the pose of Venus and Cupid _ he pinches her nipple _ from
Bronzino's ``Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time,'' recasting them as a
dignified elderly man and woman.
</P>
<P>
   Like many photographs and portraits of elderly people, these
images suggest that spirit and flesh are separate entities, with
their own distinct time lines. But the scale and nakedness of the
figures here give the notion a visceral force. This is nowhere more
apparent than in the large black and white photographs from Manabu
Yamanaka's ``Gyahtei'' series at the end of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a life-size image of an elderly nude Japanese woman
whose shriveled, shrunken body makes the ravages of time shockingly
palpable. But in each case the eye is drawn to their open, animated
faces. These images also reflect the great respect accorded old
people in Asian cultures, which in China and Japan in particular
include frequent artistic portrayals of ancient beings in a host of
roles, as sages, ancestors, beggars and mischievous spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker is not above a cheerful heavy-handedness when it
comes to tweaking the details of her show to reflect its theme. The
exhibition's seating consists entirely of thickly cushioned
glider-rocking chairs, ghastly to look at but heavenly to sit in.
(Literally, you'll feel airborne.) Throughout her long
acknowledgments and in the requisite lists of the museum's staff
members and board of trustees in the catalog, the names are almost
always followed by their ages, her own included.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog also includes comments about aging excerpted from
Ms. Tucker's diary, starting at age 15. And just in case we haven't
grasped society's distorted views of the old, adjacent to
Yamanaka's photographs hangs a full-length mirror in which visitors
can see their own reflections. The primary weakness here, as in
most subject-driven shows, is that regardless of quality, the art
on view almost inevitably functions as mere illustration of the
larger theme. You could say that everything here is either part of
the problem or part of the solution, and either way subsumed within
the larger mood of piousness, public service and pedagogy.
</P>
<P>
   The works that elude this condition tend to be found in the
exhibition's video and film portions.
</P>
<P>
   It is only amid moving images accompanied by spoken words or
music that the richness of the subject of aging comes truly to
life. Worthwhile works include Carol Halstead's ``Why,'' a mostly
computer-animated collage that recounts her life's story in 16
action-packed minutes, and Gail Noonan's playfully caustic,
beautifully drawn animated short film, ``Your Name in Cellulite.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the films have the egalitarian, thrown-together feel
of the show itself. A prime example is ``Whisper, the Waves, the
Wind,'' by Suzanne Lacy, a California artist known for organizing
and filming participatory performance pieces. This particular work,
best described as a living Christo with Felliniesque undertones,
involved 150 women between the ages of 60 and 99, who dressed in
the white garments of their choice and converged on a beach near La
Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   There, they gathered at white tables and talked about their
lives, creating a ready-made grass-roots documentary full of vivid
glimpses of personalities, lives and hard-won wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   But the film program also includes impeccably thought-through
and structured works of art, like Yvonne Rainer's 1990
``Privilege,'' which shows Ms. Rainer's resonant style _ a
slow-moving but riveting mixture of paradocumentary and popular
film clips, theory and humorous self-reference, dramatic flashbacks
and quiet conversation _ at its best.
</P>
<P>
   The subject here is menopause, but the film weaves its theme
into an intricate transparent web that probes racism of the most
subtle sort (between women of different races, for example), the
role of racial prejudice and class in sexual attraction, and
women's ambivalence about being objectified. Throughout, a string
of medical authorities, seen in old documentaries, demonstrate
their pathetic ignorance of menopause, women and aging.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker's exhibition provides a kind of aerial view of the
changing landscape of thought about aging that tells us repeatedly
that this condition is not a burden, but a gift to be savored and
appreciated to the benefit of all. It does this in ways that veer
from simplistic to complex. As Ms. Rainer's film confirms, complex
is better.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saskia Webber, a goalkeeper on the U.S. women's
soccer team, did not play even one-half of a match in the Women's
World Cup, which the team won Saturday. Instead, she spent the
entire, excruciatingly thrilling tournament on the bench, her hair
spray-painted red, white and blue, cheering her team and watching
Briana Scurry, the starting keeper.
</P>
<P>
   This is a story about persistence and defeat, three times over,
and finally, victory: being chosen second best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I never become No. 1, I can retire and say I've done
everything I could,'' Ms. Webber said Wednesday, during a
conversation at a Manhattan hotel. ``Maybe I couldn't be better
than Bri, but I was good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The wistfulness flashed in her eyes and was gone. At 28, Ms.
Webber is no slouch. In college, she won a Ms. Rutgers bodybuilding
competition and, in her senior year, was named the country's top
goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's soccer team, she would be a serious contender for
Ms. Congeniality, known as fun-loving, easy to be around and
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   For there comes a lousy moment, after the third time she was cut
from the national team, when she is summoned back, allowed to train
as the second backup goalkeeper for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   During those matches, she cannot wear the team uniform or sit on
the bench, and so must take her place in the stands. Her friends
and family have flown in.
</P>
<P>
   The team's hard-fought Olympics triumph arrives. ``The National
Anthem started and I stood and cried,'' said Ms. Webber, who glows
with muscular fitness. ``I was so happy and so empty. I rushed down
to the field to celebrate with them. And then I was handed
everyone's camera so that I could take their pictures as they got
their gold medals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webber, of Princeton, N.J., has been a jock since forever.
Her mother, an executive chef, and her father, who does computer
operations, are outdoorsy and they applauded her whenever she
seized upon a new sport. She swam, played softball, tennis,
basketball, lacrosse and, of course, soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother is Dutch, her father black. ``I'm proud of both sides
of my family,'' said Ms. Webber, who identifies herself as of mixed
race. ``Growing up, I hung out with the white kids in the community
and the black athletes. I had the most problems, name-calling, from
the black kids who weren't into sports.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rutgers, where she played for four years, she settled into
goalkeeping, because she could be part of a team but also stand out
on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with mild dyslexia and a demanding soccer schedule,
she needed five years to graduate, and played in scrimmages with
the Rutgers men's team to stay sharp.
</P>
<P>
   She had already been accepted and cut from the national team in
1991. In 1992, while still at Rutgers she was again picked for the
national team, and in 1993 she started as goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Then Briana Scurry joined the team, and Ms. Webber's fortunes
faded. She couldn't keep her focus for a full 90-minute game and
made mistakes, crying about them in the shower. Cut from the team
in 1994, Ms. Webber started working with a sprint coach. She lost
10 pounds, gained speed and rejoined the team, moving to its North
Carolina camp at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
   Like her teammates, Ms. Webber made soccer her life: morning
goalkeeper practice, team practice, lunch, team practice, supper,
collapse. Weight-lifting and running in her spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from being at Rutgers, where I was a constant impact
player, to fighting for time to play at all,'' Ms. Webber said.
When the team went up against weak opponents, she and another
backup goalkeeper would each be allowed to take a quarter of a
game, while Ms. Scurry collected her full half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Harvey and I would get 22-and-half minutes and if I was
pulled out at 21, I'd be mad,'' Ms. Webber said. ``You have to
prove yourself. With Bri there, you have to accept your role as a
reserve but you are never satisfied with that.''
</P>
<P>
   At a 1995 World Cup match in Sweden, Ms. Webber almost had her
moment, when Ms. Scurry was given a red card and had to leave. ``I
was, like, oh my God, freaking out, hesitating, the zipper on my
sweats got stuck, and I was finally pulling the jacket over my head
when a voice said, `Saskia, we've used up all our subs.'''
</P>
<P>
   She did play in the next match, but fumbled badly. Several
months later, as a romantic relationship was collapsing, Ms. Webber
was cut from the team, for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `I'm 25, I've got to play!''' Ms. Webber said. She
went to Japan for a corporate team. She stayed for three seasons,
happily getting ``beat up,'' playing three matches a week, calming
down, gaining confidence, growing up.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spring of 1998, Tony DiCicco, who coaches the
American women's soccer team, once again invited her to training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I felt like nobody owed me,'' she said. ``I had no
chip on my shoulder. I was just happy to be there and it showed in
my soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   She was picked as first backup goalkeeper for the 1999 World Cup
team.
</P>
<P>
   During the Americans' match against Denmark, Ms. Scurry was hit
hard. DiCicco told Ms. Webber to get ready. ``I bent over and
picked up my gloves and I wasn't nervous or hysterical,'' she said.
``I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But then Bri got up and brushed it off and I sat back down.
Fine.'' In the retelling she seemed at peace. ``Because I knew that
things were going the right way.''

`MONSTER BALLADS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANN POWERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VARIOUS ARTISTS: ``Monster Ballads'' (Razor and Tie). In a
startling demonstration of just how strong warped memories can be,
the 16-song retail version of this 1980s pop-metal anthology (also
available as a double disk through television and Internet
promotions) recently made its debut at No. 29 in the Billboard Top
200. Thousands are revisiting the pinnacles of schmaltz reached by
the androgynous demigods of Winger, Whitesnake, Poison and Extreme.
This once-shunned oeuvre is being reclaimed as great pop theater
that outclasses today's stupid kid stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Partly because such music really is fun, especially when
it's history instead of the only thing on the radio. ``Monster
Ballads'' satisfies myriad sugar cravings, whether for earnestly
generic love ballads, sing-alongs by hunks relaxing, the socially
conscious musings of great dudes, operatic exercises in which
singers endanger their vocal cords, or mind-numbing collections of
musical and lyrical cliches. Every song is an excuse for onstage
fireworks yet somehow deeply sincere.
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason folks now long for these wildly
sentimental tirades. Pop's current division between ``soft''
teen-age bands and ``hard'' rappers or heavy rockers leaves little
room for epic romanticism. Although ``Monster Ballads'' overlooks
some greats, like Jon Bon Jovi, it recaptures that glorious moment
when tough guys enjoyed baring their hearts. ``Every bad boy has a
soft side'' the album's promotional campaign announces, but now
pop's bad boys fear softness, and its soft boys lack emotional
muscle. Nostalgic retreats like this one remedy that lack.

<P>
   RAYMONDVILLE, Texas _ Whether it was the take-out order for 200
hamburgers or bulk sales of pre-cooked chicken and jugs of water,
there have long been hints of smugglers stashing legions of illegal
immigrants here.
</P>
<P>
   But few residents openly spoke of the covert industry before a
dozen people, including a former city commissioner and six members
of his family, recently pleaded guilty to roles in a ring that
allegedly smuggled thousands of people over a 15-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a two-horse town where everybody knows everybody, and
there are no secrets,'' said George Pitts, as he took a break from
reading the Bible in his discount store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody and their grandmother knew they were smuggling and
had been for years,'' said Pitts, a former missionary, who concedes
he smuggled a few immigrants in his younger years.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, few outsiders knew the extent of the underground
network that pumps through this South Texas town of 9,400 people,
50 miles north of Brownsville and the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Raymondville, located on the northern edge of the Rio Grande
Valley, is seen as ``choke point'' for all foot and vehicle traffic
headed out of the Valley and a prime place to plot evading a U.S.
Border Patrol checkpoint 40 miles up U.S. 77.
</P>
<P>
   The patrol got its first taste of Raymondville's open secret in
January 1997 when agents discovered 356 would-be immigrants stuffed
in shacks owned by a local family.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were everywhere,'' recalled Rick Aguirre, head of the
Border Patrol's anti-smuggling operations. ``It was wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Javier McClain added: ``We'd knock on a door, and there
were a hundred eyes staring at you.''
</P>
<P>
   In dingy, musty-smelling rooms with soiled mattresses,
immigrants would spend up to a week waiting to move north. Dirty
windows were often nailed shut, and boards were placed across doors
to keep them closed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place where immigrants could hook up with smugglers,
also known as ``coyotes,'' or where smugglers could trade off
immigrants depending on where they were headed or how much they
could pay for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials could not estimate how much money was
collected over the 15 years of smuggling operations, they said an
illegal immigrant could pay up to $500 to reach Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everybody in town knew what was going on but would
never do anything about it,'' said a resident who asked not to be
named publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 raid resulted in what the Border Patrol called
``Operation Snake Pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the initiative, the patrol infiltrated this town, which
had become a major staging ground for those preparing to sneak
across ranchlands that separate the Rio Grande Valley from the rest
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some agents openly patrolled the streets, while others set up an
office in a mobile home and sought tips from cooperative residents.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leads they gathered were about masses of food being
passed into vacant buildings and about shoppers buying in large
quantities at downtown groceries.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a handful of Hispanic officers posed as
``coyotes'' and would-be immigrants headed for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants pay to be smuggled into the United States to
search for jobs. Most of the time they are sent back to Mexico
voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   During the first two months of the operation, agents apprehended
more than 6,900 illegal immigrants here, along U.S. 77 and the
surrounding brushlands, and more than 150 people were charged with
transporting or assisting them, Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents would sweep past motels, looking for excessive window
condensation caused when rooms are abnormally packed.
</P>
<P>
   The would also sniff the openings of doors for excessive body
odor left by large numbers of rugged travelers who had not bathed
in days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smell of success,'' Aguirre called it.
</P>
<P>
   The new pressure was a change of pace for a town that had been
all but immune to a patrol already stretched trying to keep agents
along the Rio Grande, an hour's drive south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Martin, Raymondville's chief of police, said he passed on
information to the patrol because his officers were powerless to
make arrests for violations of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concerns are everything from dog bites to killings,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was surprised by what agents discovered during that
initial raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea of the magnitude of the situation. The day they
arrested three hundred people, my jaw was on the floor,'' he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``We went in there full force, hit it with everything we had,
and created havoc in the town,'' Aguirre said of Operation Snake
Pit when the first indictments were returned by a federal grand
jury in February.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve people, including seven members of the Contreras family,
pleaded guilty to numerous charges in federal court in Brownsville
late last week.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Contreras Sr., the 61-year-old former city commissioner,
declined to discuss the charges, but he said their lives have been
turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   All are free on bond, face sentencing in October and could spend
up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been hard. I sold groceries here for thirty years,''
Contreras said solemnly as he stood in his all-but-empty store that
was a combination grocery, restaurant and bar.
</P>
<P>
   With his guilty plea, he can no longer sell alcohol, and with
mounting legal bills and declining numbers of customers, he's even
had to sell his pool tables.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plea bargain, the National Guard will bulldoze
several pieces of property that housed illegal immigrants,
including a house, two small apartment buildings and a small motel,
all owned by the Contrerases.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows why these things are happening. There is a reason
and a purpose,'' said his daughter, Yolanda Hernandez, 37, who also
pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has always been good to me. He has always been my
provider,'' said Hernandez, who stands to lose the Los Milagros
Apartments, a six-room complex across the street from the grocery
store her family has operated for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   About two miles away at the Rock Courts Motel and Lounge, which
is also set to be bulldozed, her brother David Contreras, 41, said
he doesn't know what the future holds.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a wood floor in his bar which is thick with
mementos, including posters of Marilyn Monroe, Malcom X and a host
of ``Star Trek'' models, Contreras said it will hard to watch the
bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not hit me right away,'' he said of the thought of
losing his place. ``The most important thing is I still have my
family. I just want to put this behind me and get on with my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol says Operation Snake Pit threw smuggling
efforts into disarray, but they are quick to say someone else
already has filled the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other business,'' Aguirre said.

   Perfect Timing For Kubrick Set
</P>
<P>
   Adept at the commemorative tie-in, video scored impressively on
June 29 with the Stanley Kubrick collection, 10 films released
collaboratively on videocassette and digital video disk by Warner,
Columbia Tri-Star and MGM/UA. A boxed set of seven of the films on
DVD, priced at $149.92, is already on best-seller lists, with
interest fanned by Kubrick's death in March and the opening Friday
of his last film, ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   For a box of good movies from a single director it's hard to
beat the Kubrick seven: ``Lolita'' (1962), ``Dr. Strangelove''
(1964), ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968), ``A Clockwork Orange''
(1971), ``Barry Lyndon'' (1975), ``The Shining'' (1980) and ``Full
Metal Jacket'' (1987). ``Dr. Strangelove'' is from Columbia
Tri-Star. All the others are from Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Three more Kubrick films _ ``Killer's Kiss'' (1955), ``The
Killing'' (1956) and ``Paths of Glory'' (1957) _ have been released
separately by MGM/UA but are not included in the set. Why not?
David Miller, the marketing manager, said that their inclusion
would have made the boxed collection too unwieldy. ``It was pushing
it as it was with seven disks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in their slender jackets the DVD set takes up less than
3{ inches on the shelf. Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home
Video and the liaison with Kubrick on the series, expressed
disappointment that the earlier MGM/UA films weren't included.
``Stanley wanted `Paths of Glory' in the collection, but he didn't
have the kind of contractual rights to impose that on MGM,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberfarb, a principal backer of DVD, said that he had talked
with Kubrick about the format for seven years. But while Kubrick
was attracted to DVD's superior image and sound, he didn't involve
himself with the extra features that are plentiful on many disks
but decidedly on the light side throughout this set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The production and post-production of `Eyes Wide Shut' limited
the time that he had to create and research the extra content,''
Lieberfarb said. Warner, he added, didn't presume to add material
on its own, though other elements could be stirred into future
releases.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the films have interviews or documentaries. ``2001:
A Space Odyssey'' includes an after-lunch talk by Arthur C. Clarke,
on whose novel the film is based. ``The Shining'' has an excellent
documentary by Kubrick's daughter Vivian about the making of the
film.
</P>
<P>
   It is Kubrick's sole appearance. At the start, Jack Nicholson,
who plays a writer gone murderously berserk, brushes his teeth
before a late-night shoot. Nicholson says he always brushes in
consideration of his fellow actors. ``It's grueling enough without
a face full of lamb cutlets,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On the set Kubrick is civil but aloof. Stress is palpable.
``Stanley doesn't relate to it,'' Nicholson says, ``because he's
doing exactly what he thinks he should be doing.'' That's all right
with Nicholson. ``I want to be out of control as an actor,'' he
says. ``I want him to have control.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW RELEASES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   `The General'
</P>
<P>
   Having actually broken into the home of the director John
Boorman some years ago, the Irish master thief Martin Cahill makes
ideal grist for Boorman's canny, elegant film. More mischievous
than malicious, Cahill (played by Brendan Gleeson, left) kept his
face from public view, maintained two-household domestic
arrangements with his wife and her sister and kept one step ahead
of his police nemesis, Inspector Ned Kenny (Jon Voight), until his
death in 1994. Presented with the chance, Boorman, Janet Maslin
wrote in The New York Times, ``tells this tale of an Irish
underworld original with an unerring instinct for the captivating
detail.''

   When the Chicago inner-city environment imperils her drug-prone
daughter (Alfre Woodard) and grandchildren (Mpho Koaho and Kulani
Hassen), Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice) packs them off for the summer to
her brother, Earl (Al Freeman Jr.), who lives in the family
homestead in Mississippi. All families should have an Uncle Earl,
whose concern and patience begins to melt his relatives' Chicago
shell and who introduces them to the nurturing strength of loving
care and family heritage. Maya Angelou's film ``may be an
impossible dream, a cinematic Hallmark card of familial
togetherness, but the vision it offers is still a dream worth
dreaming'' (Stephen Holden).

   `Eight Millimeter'
</P>
<P>
   A sedate widow asks Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage), a private
detective and family man, to look at film belonging to her late
husband that appears to depict the authentic slaughter of a
teen-age girl. It's enough to set even the violence-hardened Cage
to wincing and cringing. On the trail of the apparent victim and
killer, Tom finds himself in the sleaziest precincts of Los
Angeles, where he gets some help from a porn-shop clerk (Joaquin
Phoenix) and runs into suitably sinister characters. But Tom
remains pretty much a bore. Supposedly discovering the darker side
to a buttoned-down character, Joel Schumacher's film ``barely makes
his reactions apparent'' (Maslin).

<P>
   Described as ``lightning that can think _ a new life form,'' the
threat is really the latest gimmick from the ``Alien'' school. This
time it comes in the form of robots who regard humans as the virus
and threaten a tugboat crew captained by a greedy wacko (Donald
Sutherland) and navigated by an admiral's daughter (Jamie Lee
Curtis). Fortunately, the director, John Bruno, ``knows enough to
keep the drivel flowing too quickly for anyone to slump unconscious
over their popcorn and sticky soda with a bad case of deja vu''
(Lawrence Van Gelder).

   `FOR EVER MOZART'  &UR;  &LR; An extended meditation on the relation
between movies and life, Jean-Luc Godard's film follows an aging
French director and a group of actors to the former Yugoslavia,
where they hope to stage and film an Alfred de Musset comedy, ``One
Must Not Play at Love.'' In Bosnia, the actors are caught up in the
war, arrested and shot. So much for the pretensions of cultural
literati who think that injecting a little intellectual largess
into a far-off hot spot will make a difference. But then, the
director, who slipped away before the executions, retreats to make
a political film. At this point, Stephen Holden wrote in The New
York Times, `` `For Ever Mozart' sharpens its focus and becomes a
melancholy, exquisitely beautiful elegy to the dream of movies as
high art.'' 1996. New Yorker. $89.95. 85 minutes. French with

   `GUIMBA'  &UR;  &LR; A wandering griot describes the evil ruler Guimba as
a ``tyrant in his own time,'' but mainly the malevolence in this
movie is directed at meddling in other people's lives for the sake
of matchmaking. Directed by Cheick Oumar Sissoko, who is from Mali,
the film, Janet Maslin wrote in the New York Times, is ``less
interesting for its parable about tyranny than for the fairy-tale
look Sissoko gives its props and settings.'' 1996. Kino. $79.95. 93

   Remember the floating sparring partner that darted about helping
Luke Skywalker refine his lightsaber skills in Star Wars?
</P>
<P>
   Well, NASA is busy creating similar robots for its astronauts.
Called personal satellite assistants, or PSAs, the
tennis-ball-sized robotic helpers will float around spacecraft
monitoring oxygen levels, taking snapshots and even fixing minor
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A roving PSA will be able to go where people can't. For example,
astronauts could send it to investigate alarms. ``When a fire broke
out on the Mir space station,'' says the PSA project leader Yuri
Gawdiak, ``it would have been nice to have a PSA to send into the
area to see what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspended in microgravity, a PSA will need only tiny fans to
move about. It will use range-finding sensors to detect objects _
such as astronauts _ that get in its way. The battery-powered
device will be armed with sensors to detect changes in gas levels,
temperature and atmospheric pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to work without human supervision, the PSA will
communicate with the spacecraft's computers via a wireless network,
shifting tougher tasks to the ship's computers to save power. It
should also respond to human voice commands or be controlled using
a hand-held remote control device, or even by crews on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its monitoring duties, the PSA will serve as a
communication port, equipped with microphones and video
conferencing capabilities. It will act as a stand-in for scientists
who send experiments into space.
</P>
<P>
   Through the PSA, Earthbound researchers could watch procedures
being carried out and communicate in real time with the astronauts.
``The PSA will allow scientists to interact naturally with the
crew,'' Gawdiak says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting project that has great potential to enable
the human exploration of space,'' said Ken Ford, head of the
information technology unit at NASA's Ames Research Center in
California. He introduced the PSA concept last week at a Silicon
Valley conference on data fusion-which examined the integration of
data from multiple sources into single, more manageable streams.
The array of sensors used by the PSA will need just such a system
to allow the device to make sense of the space it inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists say it will be at least two years before the PSA
is ready for use on the space shuttle or the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major challenges of a device like this,'' says
aerospace expert Jonathan How of Stanford University, ``is how to
keep the thing from running into people or doors.'' Another
challenge is keeping its size down. ``Small sensors tend to drift,
that is, they lose their accuracy over time,'' he says.
</P>

   Remember the floating sparring partner that darted about helping
Luke Skywalker refine his lightsaber skills in Star Wars?
</P>
<P>
   Well, NASA is busy creating similar robots for its astronauts.
Called personal satellite assistants, or PSAs, the
tennis-ball-sized robotic helpers will float around spacecraft
monitoring oxygen levels, taking snapshots and even fixing minor
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A roving PSA will be able to go where people can't. For example,
astronauts could send it to investigate alarms. ``When a fire broke
out on the Mir space station,'' says the PSA project leader Yuri
Gawdiak, ``it would have been nice to have a PSA to send into the
area to see what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspended in microgravity, a PSA will need only tiny fans to
move about. It will use range-finding sensors to detect objects _
such as astronauts _ that get in its way. The battery-powered
device will be armed with sensors to detect changes in gas levels,
temperature and atmospheric pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to work without human supervision, the PSA will
communicate with the spacecraft's computers via a wireless network,
shifting tougher tasks to the ship's computers to save power. It
should also respond to human voice commands or be controlled using
a hand-held remote control device, or even by crews on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its monitoring duties, the PSA will serve as a
communication port, equipped with microphones and video
conferencing capabilities. It will act as a stand-in for scientists
who send experiments into space.
</P>
<P>
   Through the PSA, Earthbound researchers could watch procedures
being carried out and communicate in real time with the astronauts.
``The PSA will allow scientists to interact naturally with the
crew,'' Gawdiak says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting project that has great potential to enable
the human exploration of space,'' said Ken Ford, head of the
information technology unit at NASA's Ames Research Center in
California. He introduced the PSA concept last week at a Silicon
Valley conference on data fusion-which examined the integration of
data from multiple sources into single, more manageable streams.
The array of sensors used by the PSA will need just such a system
to allow the device to make sense of the space it inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists say it will be at least two years before the PSA
is ready for use on the space shuttle or the International Space
Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major challenges of a device like this,'' says
aerospace expert Jonathan How of Stanford University, ``is how to
keep the thing from running into people or doors.'' Another
challenge is keeping its size down. ``Small sensors tend to drift,
that is, they lose their accuracy over time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA team is now working on collision control software for
the device, Gawdiak says. As for its size, Gawdiak says the team is
working with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California to keep
the unit's volume down _ while keeping its productivity up. &QL;

<P>
   Divorcing couples wrangling over possessions and executives
embroiled in corporate disputes could benefit from a mathematical
recipe that guarantees fair shares for both sides. Academics in the
United States have just been granted the first-ever patent for a
method of resolving disputes called Adjusted Winner, which they
have mathematically proved is the best way to divide up anything
from homes to corporate responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brams, a political scientist at New York University, and
Alan Taylor, a mathematician at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.,
devised the algorithm after working on ways of solving an
apparently simple problem: how to divide up a cake fairly between a
group of three or more people.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge in such decisions is to ensure the division is
``envy-free,'' so everyone feels they have a slice at least as good
as anyone else's. With a cake, where one slice is pretty much like
any other, this isn't hard to achieve. But in many other
situations, from divorce settlements to corporate mergers, avoiding
envy can be very difficult. Even so, Adjusted Winner does it
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   To see how, suppose Adam and Barbara are in the throes of a
divorce and can't agree on who gets the town house, the holiday
cottage and the sports car. First, Adam and Barbara allot points to
each item out of a total of 100, according to how much they value
them. Adam is besotted by the car, giving it 60 points, and quite
likes the town house (25 points). But he isn't particularly
bothered about the cottage, which gets his remaining 15 points.
Barbara, in contrast, wants the town house (65 points) and the car
(25 points), but is also unimpressed by the cottage, which gets her
remaining 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Each item initially goes to whoever allotted them the most
points. So Adam gets the car and cottage, and Barbara gets the town
house. But this doesn't seem fair: Adam has two items, and 75 of
his 100 points, while Barbara got just one, worth 65.
</P>
<P>
   So now the ``adjustment'' part comes in. The item rated most
similarly by both Adam and Barbara _ the cottage, at 15 and 10
respectively _ is taken from Adam's heap, so his total drops to 60.
Simple algebra then shows that if the cottage is sold off with Adam
keeping three-fifths of its selling price, worth 9 points to him,
and Barbara getting the remaining two-fifths, worth 4 points to
her, both end up with the same final total: 69 points.
</P>
<P>
   So the final division is fair, as both parties get the same
number of points. It is also envy-free, as both ended up with the
bulk of what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Brams and Taylor stress that the algorithm is no panacea. ``But
it takes much of the worry out of being an inept bargainer by
providing a guarantee of fairness,'' Brams says. They expect
software that runs the algorithm to become available soon.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Siddle, chairman of the Family Law Committee of Britain's
Law Society, says the idea of a formula for solving divorce
disputes is attractive. But she doubts it can deal with common
complexities such as dividing up homes suffering from negative
equity. ``I'd be very interested to see it, though,'' she adds. &QL;

GOD IS SPEAKING FROM BILLBOARDS

 (For release Sunday, July 18)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ God is speaking to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   From billboards and posters, along highways and in bus shelters
across the nation, the Lord is delivering short messages with
Madison Avenue flair designed to amuse _ and prod the fallen back
to their pews.
</P>
<P>
   In large white letters against a stark field of black, one
poster in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., asks, ``You think it's hot here?''
A billboard in Baltimore says, ``We need to talk,'' while another
in Dallas says, ``Keep using my name in vain, and I'll make rush
hour longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another says, ``Big Bang Theory? You've got to be
kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   All are black with white lettering, and all are signed simply
``God.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs _ there are 18 different versions _ are part of a
public service campaign to promote a return to religious values. It
is sponsored by the Washington, D.C.-based Outdoor Advertising
Association of America, which represents 900 companies specializing
in billboard and outdoor advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called God Speaks campaign, which began as a one-time
effort in Florida last year, is expected to reach 281 markets in 40
states on 10,000 billboards and other outdoor advertising venues,
says Sheila Hayes, a spokeswoman for the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   It all began last summer when an individual walked into the
offices of the Smith Agency advertising agency in Ft. Lauderdale,
wrote out a check for $150,000 and asked the firm to devise a
non-denominational ad campaign promoting a return to God. The ad
agency is honoring the client's request to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Robb, an agency vice president, ended up writing most of
the one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   By last September, messages from ``God'' began appearing on bus
posters and billboards around Ft. Lauderdale. They included, ``What
part of `Thou shalt not' didn't you understand?'' and ``Let's meet
at my house Sunday before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Robb says his favorite is, ``Don't make me come down there.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs were an instant hit among many different religions.
For example, the Catholic Archdiocese of Miami praised them, while
a Florida rabbi asked the agency for permission to reprint them for
his flock.
</P>
<P>
   Not all responses, however, were positive. The atheists, for
example, were unhappy. They gripe that the ads ``are promoting what
they consider a mythical being,'' Robb says. ``And once in a while,
we get a call from someone who considers the signs blasphemy,'' he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Following the generally positive reception in Florida, the
advertising trade group in January asked its members if they would
take the campaign national as a public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response was phenomenal,'' Hayes says, with members
pledging $15 million in advertising space and materials.
</P>
<P>
   The national effort began in Dallas in March and has steadily
expanded to other markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities where the signs have already appeared or are
scheduled to appear include Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Houston,
Los Angeles, New York, San Diego and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The messages appear on any of three types of outdoor advertising
media: large billboards (14 feet by 48 feet); medium-sized
billboards (12 feet by 25 feet); and posters (six feet by 12 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Hayes says that the popularity of the campaign is comparable
only to two others _ Smokey the Bear and the Vince and Larry
seat-belt dummies.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Robb, ``I've worked on a lot of ad campaigns in 20 years,
and in my experience for something to take off like this, it's
really unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes believes that the signs strike a special chord following
the shock and tragedy after several deadly schoolyard shootings,
such as the gun rampage at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Littleton was a reminder of the violence going on in the world
and why it's the right time for messages like this,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   People find the signs refreshing, Robb says, after being
inundated for a year with news stories of President Clinton's
sexual escapades with a White House intern and his attempts to
conceal the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are thinking a lot about morality after Clinton,'' he
says. ``These are friendly messages.''

   If you thought the fate of the Universe was certain, think
again. Last year, in a blaze of publicity, it was announced that
the Universe would expand forever in the grip of an exotic
``antigravity'' force. But now the evidence is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion depended on the observation that exploding stars
in distant galaxies seem fainter than expected. This suggested that
the expansion of the Universe is speeding up because of a
mysterious force, represented by a cosmological constant in
Einstein's equations of general relativity.
</P>
<P>
   But that holds true only if these distant supernovae are
inherently as bright as the stellar explosions happening nearby.
The new findings hint that this may not be true, and reopen the
possibility that the Universe's expansion will cease _ and maybe
even reverse until all matter collapses in a ``big crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a warning flag,'' says Robert Kirshner of
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's conclusions came from teams led by Brian Schmidt of
the Mount Stromlo and Siding Springs Observatories in Australia and
Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California.
They studied ``type Ia'' supernovae. These occur when matter from
one star falls onto a companion white dwarf star, which then
becomes unstable and explodes.
</P>
<P>
   In galaxies near ours, the explosions grow brighter over about
20 days, then fade over the following months. But the peak
intrinsic brightness is always roughly the same _ which means that
how bright an explosion appears should depend only on how far away
it lies. So when supernovae billions of light years away were
revealed to be consistently fainter than expected, astronomers
concluded that an acceleration in the rate of the Universe's
expansion was forcing the light to travel a greater distance.
</P>
<P>
   But a nagging doubt remained. Might distant supernovae be less
powerful _ and therefore intrinsically less bright _ than those
nearby? Adam Riess of the University of California at Berkeley, a
member of Schmidt's team, decided to check. If the peak brightness
of the distant supernovae is different, the time they take to reach
this point should also be different. So Riess and his colleagues
studied the rate at which 10 nearby explosions brightened and
compared it with provisional data from Perlmutter's team for over
30 distant supernovae. They found that the distant supernovae lit
up more rapidly, reaching peak brightness around two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Why distant supernovae are different is unclear. They could have
different compositions. ``Or it could be something different about
the explosion itself, although that would be hard to understand,''
Riess says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it certain that the faster brightening means that the
brightness of distant supernovae is different from those nearby.
But if those 5 billion light years away are less than 75 percent as
luminous as nearby ones, the case for accelerating expansion would
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make an ironclad case for it when you see
something like this,'' says Riess, who has sent a paper on the
findings to The Astronomical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter is keeping an open mind. ``It's very premature to
draw a conclusion,'' he says. ``The analysis has not been
completed.'' But unless the discrepancy vanishes, cosmologists will
be back to what they do best: arguing about the ultimate fate of
the Universe. &QL;

<P>
   Nor is it certain that the faster brightening means that the
brightness of distant supernovae is different from those nearby.
But if those 5 billion light years away are less than 75 percent as
luminous as nearby ones, the case for accelerating expansion would
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to make an ironclad case for it when you see
something like this,'' says Riess, who has sent a paper on the
findings to The Astronomical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter is keeping an open mind. ``It's very premature to
draw a conclusion,'' he says. ``The analysis has not been
completed.'' But unless the discrepancy vanishes, cosmologists will
be back to what they do best: arguing about the ultimate fate of
the Universe. &QL;

<P>
   If you want to sneak into a harem, the best strategy is to dress
up in drag. At least, that's the tactic favored by male giant
cuttlefish, which turn transvestite to slip past other males
guarding their mates.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttlefish and their cousins octopuses and squid are masters of
disguise, transforming their color, shape and texture to evade
predators. The animals also use these abilities in elaborate
courtship displays. For instance, male giant cuttlefish (Sepia
apama) flash black and white stripes over their bodies to attract
the smaller, mottled females.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of the cuttlefish gather to mate on rocky reefs at
Spencer Gulf in South Australia. Whilst watching the courtship
behavior of these animals, Mark Norman of James Cook University in
Townsville and Julian Finn of the University of Tasmania in Hobart
noticed that small males often tagged along with breeding pairs in
the guise of females. The males' arms are usually fringed with
webs, but the smaller males can retract these to impersonate the
females, as well as adopting the female body color and pattern.
</P>
<P>
   When the larger male is tied up fending off other rivals, the
sneaky male reveals his true colors in an often successful attempt
to woo the female. Furthermore, if the larger male returns to find
his paramour flirting with the sneak, the smaller male can rapidly
don female disguise again to avert the wrath of the spurned male.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the cuttlefish that are fooled. The biologists
also have a hard time telling the impostors from the real females.
``We have to follow them and see when they change back,'' says
Norman and Finn's colleague Tom Tregenza of the University of
Leeds, who studied their videos of the cuttlefish. He says that
although there are other male animals that mimic females, none can
switch its disguises on and off as easily.
</P>
<P>
   The cuttlefish originally transformed itself as a means of
camouflage and only later turned to female impersonation, according
to Tregenza. ``Once you've got those abilities, they start to come
into play for something else.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear whether the transvestite males are undersized
or simply younger than those they cuckold _ later abandoning the
strategy once they are large enough to compete for mates openly.
``The larger males don't need to _ they can win contests with other
males,'' Tregenza says.
</P>
<P>
   There may now be an evolutionary ``arms race'' between the
males, the researchers suggest. Larger males may be developing
better ways of spotting the impostors, while the smaller males may
be refining their disguise to overcome this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there's a potential pressure for the impersonation
to get better and better,'' Tregenza says. As very little is known
about the mating behavior of cuttlefish, octopus and squid in the
wild, transvestitism may turn out to be more widespread under the
waves than anyone realized. &QL;

   `WILD WILD WEST'
</P>
<P>
   Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek, Ted
Levine
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld
</P>
<P>
   PG 107 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sporting with a woman in a water tank, the United States marshal
James T. West (Smith) peers through a knothole and spies a bunch of
boys associated with the former Civil War general Bloodbath McGrath
(Levine).
</P>
<P>
   After the tank tips over, West spills into the town brothel,
where he encounters McGrath (the one with the ear trumpet implanted
in his head), and another marshal dressed in drag, Artemus Gordon
(Kline), who is working undercover as a lady of the house and
ducking assignments by pleading tonsilitis.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, really a polished gadgeteer who rolls around in his
lavish railroad car playing with gizmos and knitting bullet-proof
vests, and West are assigned by President Ulysses S. Grant to
apprehend Bloodbath's boss, a master fiend who has been kidnapping
the country's scientists. They have a week.
</P>
<P>
   Grant then hikes himself off to Promontory Point, Utah, where he
is to open the transcontinental railroad. But the journey plays
into the hands of the embittered and brilliant Dr. Arliss Loveless
(Branagh), a dandified mechanical genius of Southern extraction.
</P>
<P>
   Or half a genius. Having lost his body from the waist down,
Loveless propels himself about in a steam-powered wheelchair
devising mad schemes of revenge. As it evolves, he has also made
off with the scientists, who have been employed to build a gigantic
mechanical spider with which to abscond with the president and put
the Loveless stamp on the nation's destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Violence: People are shot point-blank and Loveless tests a
weapon by luring a band of McGrath's men into a designated space
and slaughtering them. Battles claim many victims, unmistakably if
not gorily.
</P>
<P>
   Sex: Many situations and references, from the bordello onward,
and double-entendres fly.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: Now and then the air turns bluish.
</P>
<P>
   FOR WHICH CHILDREN?
</P>
<P>
   Ages 3-6: Too big and loud, too profane, too violent. Leave the
littlest ones at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 7-9: One could reasonably wonder why the PG rating wasn't
stepped up to a PG-13 in this instance. In any event, PG stands for
parental guidance, which will fall where it may. Much in this film
isn't for young children, though no great harm would be done.
</P>
<P>
   Ages 10-12: By this age group, the coast is clear, or relatively
so, depending on individual standards. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MUPPETS FROM SPACE'
</P>
<P>
   Gonzo, Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Rizzo the Rat, Fozzie Bear
and the rest of the Muppets, with cameo appearances by Andie
MacDowell, F. Murray Abraham, David Arquette, Ray Liotta, others.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Tim Hill
</P>
<P>
   G 82 minutes
</P>
<P>
   A cross between a turkey and a chicken, Gonzo gets shut out of
Noah's ark when he can't come up with a similar being to embark
with two-by-two (Noah does toss him an umbrella). That only
increases his frustrations over his identity and roots, which seem
to extend to another planet. Then at breakfast in the Muppet
boarding house, the alphabet cereal suddenly spells a message:
watch the sky.
</P>
<P>
   At a space center disguised as a cement factory, aliens are
spotted headed this way. Grabbing a chance to be a media star, the
never-retiring Miss Piggy fills in for Shelly Snipes (Ms.
MacDowell) as anchor of the ``UFOmania Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzo and friends infiltrate the installation, where Rizzo gets
caught and locked up in the basement with other rats, who are
testing caffeine substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzo is scheduled to have his brain removed by a Dr. Van
Neuter. The aliens are to land at Cape Doom at midnight but are so
late all the space freaks go home. Finally they appear for a
``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' landing. On board are many
Gonzos. Now this Gonzo has to decide whether to go off with them or
stay with the Muppets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Violence: None.
</P>
<P>
   Sex: None (though sex, or the suggestion of it, is always an
arrow in Miss Piggy's quiver).
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: None.
</P>
<P>
   FOR WHICH CHILDREN?
</P>
<P>
   Ages 3-5: They love the Muppets, of course, but the film is
talky and they could get squirmy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ages 6-8: This is a sweet little movie, if slow in places. All
told, they should enjoy it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PIE`
</P>
<P>
   Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye
Thomas, Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari,
Shannon Elizabeth, Jennifer Coolidge
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Paul Weitz
</P>
<P>
   R 100 minutes
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a space shuttle launch; it's sex,'' says a student to
a friend at East Great Falls High School. Maybe so but sex is a
last frontier to four male seniors who pledge to lose their
virginity by the time diplomas are handed out.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin (Nicholas) is practically already in bed with his
girlfriend (Ms. Reid), but the three others have hurdles ahead. Jim
(Biggs) is prey to all the social and physical embarrassments of
late adolescence, as are most of his schoolmates, and why shouldn't
they be? (Given their toilet habits, some of them belong in
diapers.)
</P>
<P>
   Finch (Thomas) feels it necessary to pay the sexually active
Jessica (Ms. Lyonne) $200 to spread word of his prowess (as yet
untested). Oz (Klein), a lacrosse star, thinks seduction means
driving a girl to a deserted spot and naming his pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, these are children _ all with a peculiarly '50s
outlook for the late '90s _ slouching none too confidently toward a
rite of passage. Condoms are procured; Web sites are baited with
come-ons (no takers).
</P>
<P>
   Jim lures a great-looking exchange student (Ms. Elizabeth) into
his bedroom and then botches it. Oz studies flower arranging and
takes up singing to attract Heather (Ms. Suvari).
</P>
<P>
   Of girls, ``Ask them questions and listen to what they have to
say,'' Kevin advises.
</P>
<P>
   Success is achieved, sometimes in unexpected ways. Thinking he's
landed a geekish flute player (Ms. Hannigan), Jim finds himself
with a wild dominatrix. Shunned by his peers, Finch scores with a
latter-day Mrs. Robinson (Ms. Coolidge). On to college. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Violence: None.
</P>
<P>
   Sex: Since this is a film about sex, there is a representative
sampling, including standard intercourse, masturbation and oral
sex. The many allusions spread to related body parts and functions,
and incidental sexual references take in pornography and other
topics.
</P>
<P>
   Profanity: Much obscenity and a flood of bathroom activity and
talk.
</P>
<P>
   FOR WHICH CHILDREN?
</P>
<P>
   Ages 15-17: Not to belabor individual parental standards, but
another R-rated movie about students who are around the age of 17
will attract many viewers who are younger. Going by the book, that
will require the presence of a parent or guardian. &QL;

   Not only is Spenser the toughest private eye who ever broke
another tough guy's nose with the flick of a knuckle, but he's
quick with a quotation, whether from Matthew Arnold or Rhett
Butler.
</P>
<P>
   His main problem in Sunday's zesty A&AMP;E adaptation of ``Small
Vices,'' Robert B. Parker's 24th novel, is another tough guy, known
as ``the Gray Man,'' who's out to kill Spenser. Nothing personal,
unless you happen to be on the receiving end of the Gray Man's
sharpshooting.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mantegna makes a likable and businesslike detective who is
not embarrassed about doing on his cooking in a frilly apron. And
viewers are assured that despite a dire beginning that finds him
underwater, he will manage to dry off, get back in shape and meet
the Gray Man (Eugene Lipinski) under more satisfactory
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Spenser has been hired to look into the case of Ellis Alves, a
black youth who has been convicted or framed for the rape and
murder of a young white woman from an affluent family. There are
intimations here of a class struggle, but don't take it too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Spenser casebook will recognize his wisecracking pal
Hawk (Shiek Mahmud-Bey) and his smart-aleck girlfriend, Susan
Silverman (Marcia Gay Harden).
</P>
<P>
   There are also several inept tough guys who pop in and out so
that they can have their noses and other body parts damaged by
Spenser or, in one acrobatic episode, by involvement in a hockey
game.
</P>
<P>
   The rudimentary plot should strain no fan's attention. There are
enough cryptic encounters between bad guys and good ones to keep
the insults perking, and the dialogue is wry if a little stiff:
``You are an odd combination of violence and concern for violence.
I would not have you change.''
</P>
<P>
   And incidentally, that ex-CIA agent who turns up so handily is
played by Parker himself. &QL;

MUSIC OFF THE INTERNET POSES ISSUES OF PIRACY AND TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBY McGILL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the accolades, media hype and
revolutionary rhetoric, digital music downloaded from the Internet
is not a ready-for-prime-time player, according to a recent study
of the online music industry.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Internet analysis firm Jupiter
Communications, concluded that digital music distribution must
overcome major obstacles before becoming a mainstream consumer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Graves, lead analyst on the Jupiter study, explained what
he sees as a less-than-stellar future for digital downloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that it isn't as significant as people say. It's just
that it is going to take a lot longer than they say it will,'' said
Graves.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in addressing digital music's ``riveting hold on the
media and the recording industry,'' found that its problems revolve
around the established recording industry's fear of piracy, coupled
with the consumer's lack of familiarity with finding, downloading
and playing digital music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hardly a consumer-friendly technology,'' Graves said,
referring to the MP3 compression technology commonly used to make
audio files small enough to download. ``It's for Net-savvy people
at this point. You have to know your way around the Net. It's not
something that Joe and Jean Music Buyer are going to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Smith, a business appraiser in San Francisco and a frequent
downloader of digital music, agreed. ``If I am looking for the
latest hit single, it's hard to find,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report predicted that by 2003, only 3 percent of online
consumers in the United States would buy digitally downloaded
music, compared with less than 1 percent buying downloaded music
this year.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the number significant is that by the time 2003 rolls
around, most major music labels should have much of their content
available online.
</P>
<P>
   However, finding content on the Net is a problem, according to
the Jupiter study. Even if surfers do find the latest hit single
for download, chances are it is an illegal post, and thus an
illegal download, said Graves.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the digital downloading of music has gained much attention
in recent months, the record industry's fear of piracy threatens
the evolution of Web sites that specialize in music distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The situation bears a striking resemblance to the decades-old
problem with cassette tapes. On the Internet, as with cassettes,
people can easily make copies of music and distribute them for free
or for profit without the artists or the labels receiving a dime.
Neither are too crazy about that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the potential to make _ or lose _ money, major labels
have been working to embrace and control the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a 110-member coalition made up of the major U.S.
record labels and their counterparts in the technology industry
agreed on a preliminary set of security guidelines. The Secure
Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) essentially seeks to imprint a
digital watermark on digitally distributed music. This code is an
attempt to prevent copying.

ALL-STAR FEVER HAS RECUPERATIVE EFFECT ON TORRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM REYNOLDS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Days after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in
March, Joe Torre was asked if he thought he would be healthy in
time to manage the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the question seemed trivial. Soon, though, the
chance to be part of a historic night helped fuel Torre's
aggressive recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a participant is most important,'' Torre said. ``In
March, I have to say, this was the last thing on my mind. But once
I was feeling better I was looking forward to it. It's going to
mean a lot to me to have been on the field for the last All-Star
Game of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre managed the American League All-Star team for the second
time in three years Tuesday night, guiding the club to a 4-1 win in
the 70th edition of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The honor of guiding the All-Star team goes to the manager of
each league's reigning champion. Torre, the 24th man to both manage
and play in the midsummer classic, became the sixth manager to win
his first two All-Star attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know a few months ago where I was going to be at this
point and time,'' Torre said. ``But once I started feeling well, I
looked forward to this with great anticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his managerial success over the past three-plus seasons
_ two World Series championships, a record-setting 125 total wins
last year, twice being named American League Manager of the Year by
the Baseball Writers Association of America _ it's difficult to
imagine Torre was a man without a job as recently as 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre remembers those days, and that's why he relishes every
chance he has to bask in baseball's spotlight. It was a long time
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great honor,'' Torre said. ``These are the best players
in the world on both sides of the field. To be able to say that and
to know that I'm writing the lineup down and making the changes ...
you know, if you tell me in 1995 when I was fired as manager of the
Cardinals that a couple of short years later I'd have this kind of
power and this kind of memory, I'd find it hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre played in nine All-Star Games, was the National League
Most Valuable Player in 1971 and won the NL Gold Glove as a catcher
in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He played or managed in 4,268 games before getting to the World
Series in 1996, when he led the Yankees over Atlanta. Torre has
been larger than life in New York City ever since, but he takes
everything in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice memory for me to take back,'' Torre said. ``I
think the best part about these few days that you have off is you
don't have to mess with the scrambled eggs in your head, thinking
how we're going to win. You see the names of the players on my
lineup card, you can't make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenway has been filled with those nice memories for Torre this
season. He rejoined the Yankees there on May 18, having missed the
first 36 games of the season while recovering from the prostate
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Torre was prodded by Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer to take the
lineup card to home plate that day. The result was a standing
ovation from a near-capacity crowd at Fenway, all applauding a man
who was wearing the colors of the hated Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed my first game back from my recuperation here and had
such a wonderful, warm reception, there was no question I was
looking forward to coming back here _ when they were going to pull
for our ballclub,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to this. I had no question I would be
able to do this, unless for some reason I was totally exhausted, or
if my stamina wasn't back. Boston and Fenway Park, you love coming
in here. ... It couldn't have been better in my mind.''

   WASHINGTON _ Sun, sand and. . .pollution?
</P>
<P>
   That's the picture at many of America's beaches, according to a
study released Thursday by an environmental action group.
</P>
<P>
   Though more states and localities are adopting monitoring and
public notification programs to warn visitors about polluted
beaches, there are still record numbers of swimming advisories and
closings, said the Natural Resources Defense Council in ``Testing
the Waters,'' its ninth annual vacation beach quality guide.
</P>
<P>
   The group found there were 7,253 closings or advisories
nationwide last year, a 75 percent increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The jump was due partly to storms that hit Southern California
in 1998 caused by the weather phenomenon known as El Nino, the
group said. Advisories and beach closings in California jumped to
3,273 in 1998 from 1,141 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, the group noted, the nationwide rise in closings and
advisories also is partially due to the increased beach monitoring
by state and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we're pleased to be getting more information, the
number of advisories and closings indicate that too little is being
done to prevent pollution _ especially from sources such as storm
water and sewage,'' said Sarah Chasis, and NRDC senior attorney who
was project director for the beach report.
</P>
<P>
   The NRDC advocates effective monitoring and public notification
programs as the first step in eliminating beach water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Four states _ Alabama, Louisiana, Oregon and Washington _ were
labeled ``beach bums'' this year for lacking regular monitoring or
notification programs. The NRDC said only nine states _
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois Indiana, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
North Caroline, Ohio and Pennsylvania _ ``comprehensively monitor
most or all of their beaches and notify the public when health
hazards exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The group added that beach quality could be improved through
stronger action by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
state governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make people aware that when there is no monitoring,
we don't know whether the waters are polluted or not,'' Chasis
said. ``Our feeling is that people should be able to go to the
beach and not worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi, Puerto Rico and Texas do not have public
notification procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the NRDC report has been criticized for not
recognizing distinctions among states with beaches. State officials
in Washington, for instance, have pointed out that their beaches
are used far less for swimming and surfing than beaches in states
like Florida, New Jersey and California.

 &HT;    FEC ASKED TO ADD FUND-RAISING SIZZLE TO CAMPAIGN WEB SITES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Election Commission is under bipartisan
pressure to make it easier to raise money on the Internet for the
2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While candidates have found fund raising on the Internet to be a
highly efficient undertaking, the flow still remains a trickle
compared to the steady stream of contributions pouring in through
more traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, for example, the Democratic presidential campaign
of former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey announced it had raised
$240,000 in the year's second quarter through its Web site. This
amounted to only 2 percent of its overall contributions, and other
campaigns have reported similar meager results.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to cyberspace reveals that both presidential
front-runners, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, are hazy about the federal rules that govern fund raising on
their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   To complete Gore's online contribution form, donors must include
their occupation and employer's name. But federal regulations
require such data only for political contributions of $200 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Bush requires the same information on his site. In addition,
donors are erroneously told that credit card contributions aren't
eligible for federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the commission voted unanimously to allow Internet
credit card contributions to presidential primary candidates to
qualify for matching funds. ``We recognize the reality that the
Internet is here and a big part of our life,'' FEC Chairman Scott
Thomas said after the 6-0 vote. ``We need to let it be used
freely.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are taking the FEC at its word.
</P>
<P>
   Law partners Joseph Sandler and Neil Reiff, former officials of
the Democratic National Committee, said in a joint article in the
July issue of Campaigns &AMP; Elections magazine that Congress should
amend the campaign finance laws so that candidates can ``facilitate
use of the Internet for grassroots political communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush's campaign is seeking an FEC advisory opinion
that could make life easier for candidates in the fast Internet
lane.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC's June ruling allows campaigns for the first time to
collect and store contributor data solely in electronic form. To
take advantage of this change, however, candidates must ask a
series of screening questions online.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign site, for example, asks donors to attest,
among other statements, that:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The funds I am contributing are my own personal funds and
not those of another.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I am not a foreign national who lacks permanent resident
status in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrong answer (or no answer) to any item instantly blocks the
transaction from going through. By contrast, campaigns that solicit
through traditional means enjoy a 30-day grace period in which they
can keep the money while seeking to resolve any potential legal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign says the commission's rulings ``do not in all
cases take into account the new ways a campaign may now utilize
this virtually cost-free means of mass communications.''
</P>
<P>
   In his request for a more relaxed approach, Benjamin Ginsberg,
the campaign's national counsel, has asked the commission to review
a series of ``cutting-edge issues, all of which are designed to use
the Internet and other emerging technologies to increase
participation and interest in campaigns at a time when citizen
involvement seems to be diminishing rather than increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has until Aug. 7 to respond to Bush's request.

THE RUINS OF EMPIRES CAST A SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vestiges of the ancients are cropping up all over.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sale of antiquities in New York on June 5 added up to
a whopping $6.4 million, with 85 percent of the lots sold. The
buyers were responding to the quality of the works and the
impeccable provenances.
</P>
<P>
   A Hellenistic bronze sculpture of Alexander the Great of the
third century B.C., from the collection of the late Ian Woodner,
sold for $244,500, more than twice the high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Roman Imperial bronze hunting hounds, circa the first
century, from the estate of Mrs. John Hay Whitney went for an
amazing amount, $211,500; their estimate was $80,000 to $120,000.
And Mrs. Whitney's bronze Greek statue of a horse from the
Geometric period (eighth century B.C.) sold for $189,500, compared
with an estimate of $40,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The results were almost as good at Christie's, whose antiquities
sales on June 3 and 4 netted a respectable $3.7 million, although
only 66 percent of the lots sold.
</P>
<P>
   Even beyond the salesrooms, interest in ancient art is
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Elyse Topalian, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, said 10,000 to 15,000 people a day visited the new ancient
Greek galleries in the first two weeks after they opened on April
20.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Rome, preparations for the Holy Year of 2000
include a thorough renovation of the Capitoline Museum, which first
opened in 1471 and boasts one of the great collections of
antiquities in the world. Unlike the Met, the Louvre or the British
Museum, the ancient sculptures in the Capitoline Museum are not
from Greece, Iran or Turkey; they were all discovered in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greek originals and Egyptian works conserved in the
museum, all excavated in the city area, confirm Rome's commercial,
political and cultural contacts with the major centers of the
Mediterranean,'' wrote Anna Mura Sommella in ``Masterpieces of the
Capitoline Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Capitoline is closed, its ancient sculptures are in an
unlikely temporary setting: the Centrale Montemartini, a
decommissioned 1912 power plant on the edge of the city. The
building, which looks like a Magritte painting come to life, has
been transformed into a stunning exhibition hall by the Roman
architect Francesco Stefanori.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Tate at Bankside in London, another power plant being
turned into a museum, the Centrale retains its immense black
turbines and massive carcasses of cast-iron machinery. They now
form the striking backdrop for ancient white marble sculptures of
the Capitoline Venus, the Omphalos Apollo and a row of busts of
famous and infamous ancients like Homer, Socrates, Trajan and Nero.
</P>
<P>
   Stefanori's installation is as spare and modern as any to be
seen in SoHo and is twice as effective as that of the Musee d'Orsay
in Paris, a former train station that has lost most vestiges of its
former life. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On July 1, ``Visions of Ruin: An Exhibition of Architectural
Fantasies and Designs for Garden Follies'' opened at Sir John
Soane's Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   Soane, who lived from 1753 to 1837, was appointed architect for
the Bank of England in 1788. Ten years earlier, like other educated
young Englishmen of the time, he went to Rome to study and draw
ancient sites and buildings. But unlike his friends in the gentry,
Soane went there on a traveling scholarship awarded by King George
III.
</P>
<P>
   When Soane returned to London, he amassed a remarkable private
collection of some 3,000 objects, including Greek, Roman and
Egyptian antiquities, plaster casts, antique vases, marble
fragments and a large cast of the Apollo Belvedere that had once
belonged to Lord Burlington. (The original is in the Vatican
Museum.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Soane bequeathed his house and its contents to the
nation, stipulating in 1833 that the arrangements of his many
objets d'art be kept as they were at the time of his death. And
they have been.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's deputy curator, Helen Dorey, said: ``What Soane saw
in Rome made an unbelievable impression on him. Ruins were always
in his mind. He wanted viewers of his house to think about it in
conjunction with the noble ruins of Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the impact of Rome on the many 18th-century tourists
taking the grand tour is going to be part of the Philadelphia
Museum of Art's exhibition on 18th-century Rome, scheduled for
February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1830 Soane commissioned the English watercolorist Joseph
Gandy to do ``A Bird's-Eye View of the Bank of England'' as it
might look as a ruin. ``He wanted his bank to be compared to
ancient Rome,'' Ms. Dorey said. ``The painting makes it look as
grand as the Baths of Caracalla.''
</P>
<P>
   But Soane's immense rotunda for the bank, which was inspired by
the Pantheon, was dismantled in 1925. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Visions of Ruin,'' which runs through Aug. 20, includes both
the Gandy painting and a sad 1925 photograph from The Times of
London showing men dismantling the rotunda, stone by stone. The
exhibition also includes Piranesi engravings of the ruins of
Hadrian's villa outside Rome; fine Robert Adam watercolors of Roman
temple fragments, and pen and ink gouaches of the Roman Forum by
Charles-Louis Clerisseau, a French artist who gave drawing lessons
to several English architects who went to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be no England if there were no Italy,'' said
Joseph Rishel, the senior curator at the Philadelphia Museum of
Art. ``Rome was the target of all 18th-century artists and
architects.''
</P>
<P>
   Soane bought 20 paintings by Clerisseau, who also influenced
Thomas Jefferson. Next to these in the show are 18th-century
drawings for proposed garden temples for English estates, in
effect, mock ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architects were very interested in presenting their designs as
ruins then,'' said Margaret Richardson, curator of the Soane
Museum. ``William Chambers, Robert Adam and John Soane were
speaking to a sophisticated audience who understood what they were
doing. People were fascinated with the idea of ruins, because ruins
implied that a great building on the site had fallen into decay.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Woodward, the curator of the exhibition, explained
that the English commissioned mock ruins for their country estates
as a ``souvenir of Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are elite buildings to amuse a small circle of friends
who shared a nostalgia for Rome,'' he said. He continued:
``Architects, who try to build for eternity, are brought back to
reality by the sight of ruins. They represent the transitory nature
of life. The architects had their own fears. They knew that every
building, like every person, had an end. For them, a ruin is a
nightmare come true.''
</P>
<P>
   As David Watkin explained in the exhibition catalog, ``The
Romans had a strong sense of being the heirs to ruined empires,
such as Troy and Carthage.'' And 18th-century England, which
dominated the globe, had a passion for Roman ruins. So why
shouldn't America, the world power of today?

STEWART, THE ROOKIE, COMES CLOSE TO A WIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stewart is doing everything it takes to win, but he still hasn't
won
</P>
<P>
   It did not come at the end of May in Charlotte, and it did not
come Sunday in New Hampshire, either, but it will come. Almost
anybody in Winston Cup will tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, they say, is almost certain to win a race, even
though he is a rookie and even though the majority of his
experience is in open-wheel cars.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, leading the Jiffy Lube 300 and driving what eventual
winner Jeff Burton admitted was the best car on the track, Stewart
saw a win within his grasp disappear when his car died from lack of
fuel two laps from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   At the Coca Cola 600 at Charlotte on May 30, a physically
drained Stewart, who had earlier in the day run the Indy 500, did
not have the stamina to keep his car up front late in the race and
fell back to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the 28-year-old Stewart, who jumped to Winston Cup from the
Indy Racing League this season, is doing the things it takes to
win, and if you keep putting yourself in position to win,
eventually, you usually do.
</P>
<P>
   While a frustrated Stewart left the track quickly Sunday after a
10th-place finish in his Joe Gibbs Pontiac, he continues to look at
the big picture and not how he fares in individual races.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is all about consistency,'' said Stewart. At the
New Hampshire International Speedway he recorded his 10th top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously want to win every week, but as far as the way we
look at it for a rookie season, if we can just be consistent, then
you can worry about winning races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means more to me to finish in the top five for three or
four weeks in a row than it does to win one week and finish 30th
the next week and crash the week after that,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   People have high expectations. Not since Jeff Gordon came along
in 1993 has a rookie created such a stir. Even if he doesn't win,
Stewart is virtually certain to top Gordon's performance his first
year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Gordon had 11 top 10s. Stewart needs just two more top
10s to better that.
</P>
<P>
   You have to go back to Dale Earnhardt's first full season in
1979 to find a more impressive performance. Earnhardt won a race
and rang up 17 top 10s as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he is looking forward to the second half of the
season when the circuit returns to tracks that he has already run
on this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you fine-tune to the different part of the season where
the tracks are a lot warmer and conditions change a little bit,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Stewart says he doesn't know whether he'll win
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens, it happens and if it doesn't, it doesn't,'' he
said. ``If I knew what the future was I'd probably be doing
something other than driving race cars because I'd be making a lot
of money if I could predict the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just worried about learning as much as possible and
finishing races and just trying to be consistent,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   His approach has impressed veterans like Earnhardt, who scoffs
at the idea Stewart's car must still carry the yellow stripe
signifying a rookie driver.
</P>
<P>
   While Stewart missed grabbing the checkered flag last Sunday, he
is coming closer every week.

   A Passion For Manuscripts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although illuminated medieval manuscripts are considered an
arcane collecting category, they have attracted considerable
attention recently. At Christie's in London last week, five bidders
competed for a medieval prayer book with 67 full-page miniatures.
</P>
<P>
   It was offered by the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family
and was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $13.3 million,
close to three times its high estimate of $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript was the most expensive work in the $90 million
sale, which included Old Master paintings, 18th-century French
furniture and rare carpets.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner remains a mystery. The auction house would say
only that the buyer was a European and was better known to the
world of Old Master paintings than to the small but passionate
cadre of manuscript experts.
</P>
<P>
   One known unsuccessful bidder was the J. Paul Getty Museum in
Los Angeles. But the prayer book wasn't the only rare medieval
manuscript for sale, and elsewhere the Getty bought an
early-13th-century illuminated manuscript known as the Avranches
Psalter from a Paris dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The 334-page work, which is 12{ inches tall and has nine
illustrations inspired by the Book of Psalms, was something the
Getty had had its eye on for years.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared in the mid-1980s at a tiny auction in Avranches,
France, where it caused a big stir among manuscript experts. The
Getty and other museums would have tried to buy the work then,
manuscripts experts say, but the French government said it would
probably not be allowed to leave France.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer was Guy Ladriere, a Paris-based dealer who was thought
to have paid about $1.5 million for it. It was only two years ago
that Ladriere received an export license. While the Getty did not
disclose the price it paid, experts say the museum spent about $7
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sexy book,'' said Tom Kren, the Getty's curator of
manuscripts. ``Art historically, it represents the very beginning
of the Gothic style.'' While the Getty already has several French
Gothic manuscripts, Kren said, none were this important.
</P>
<P>
   The style of its illuminations is an example of a turning point
in European painting, when artists left behind stylized painting in
favor of a more realistic representation of the visible world. The
anonymous painter, known to specialists as the Master of the
Ingeborg Psalter, is considered one of the greatest painters of the
Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   It will go on view at the Getty in February as the centerpiece
of an exhibition on the psalms and their illustrations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Additions in Houston
</P>
<P>
   While curators at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston await the
completion a new $50 million building, which is scheduled to open
in March, they are strengthening the museum's holdings in
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   The latest acquisitions include a cycle of six paintings by
Gerhard Richter, the first works by the German artist to enter the
Houston collection, and a group of contemporary African photographs
and sculptures known as ``The Clubs of Bamako.'' Both were gifts
from trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The Richter paintings were commissioned by the architect Renzo
Piano for a church near Foggia in southern Italy. They were
inspired by the life of St. Francis of Assisi and were to be
installed in an interior chapel. But local officials later decided
they did not want abstract art in the church.
</P>
<P>
   All six are on diamond-shaped canvases because, the artist said,
the shape reminded him of a cross. They are on view in the museum's
Upper Brown Galleries, which will become the permanent home for the
museum's 20th-century collection when its new building opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clubs of Bamako'' are 16 photographs taken by Malick
Sidibe at dance clubs in Bamako, Mali, in the 1960s and '70s and 11
life-size sculptures by Emile Guebehi, Koffi Kouakou and Coulibaly
Siaka Paul, based on the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   They depict contemporary urban life in Africa. Although not yet
on view, they will complement the museum's collection of African
gold and art of sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alfred Glassel, president of the museum, donated a collection
of African gold,'' said Alison de Lima Greene, curator of
20th-century art at the museum. ``And we have been looking to
expand our collection of African art ever since.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Change at Christie's
</P>
<P>
   Edward Dolman, managing director of Christie's in Europe and a
15-year veteran of the auction house, has been appointed managing
director of Christie's in North and South America. Dolman will be
based in New York and will oversee day-to-day operations and new
business development.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hambrecht, Christie's president for North and South
America, who has been with the auction house for 11 years, will
take a sabbatical beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
   New Gallery &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of working in London and New York for Anthony
d'Offay, the London dealer, James Cohan is opening a
2,300-square-foot space at 41 West 57th Street in September. It
will be called the James Cohan Gallery, but d'Offay will be a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have an affiliation with the d'Offay Gallery, but the
57th Street space will have its own exhibition's program,'' Cohan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to representing the estate of Robert Smithson, Cohan
will show international artists like Bill Viola and Gilbert and
George. He will also exhibit popular young British artists like Ron
Mueck and Richard Patterson, who have been getting attention in
both New York and London.

NASCAR NEEDS TO TAKE BACK THE GARAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CAR-NASCAR-STEWART) 
(DW) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In NASCAR, the garage area is the equivalent of a locker room in
most sports, a restricted area where the teams get ready to race.
It should have limited access, be available only to those who have
a need to be there.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, the NASCAR garage has become more and
more crowded to the point where the teams and others who work there
are finding it increasingly difficult to go about their business.
</P>
<P>
   The influx is primarily made up of fans, who somehow obtain a
pass and then put the teams and drivers under siege for autographs
and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   As a commentary in Winston Cup Scene pointed out, the fans are
not to blame for this.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan and you can get in the garage, you are going to
try and get all the autographs and pictures you can.
</P>
<P>
   The blame falls entirely on NASCAR, which controls the garage
and should recognize that while it is making a few fans happy, it
is causing problems for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It addition to being the place where the teams get ready to
race, the garage is also a primary work area for the media.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, every fan would have access to the garage
and be able to get whatever information he or she wanted first
hand. Obviously, though, that's impossible, in racing or any other
sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is the media's job to represent the fans, to talk to the
participants and tell their stories so everyone can be informed.
</P>
<P>
   But this is becoming more and more difficult in NASCAR, because
the drivers are no longer accessible in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   The working areas of ``name'' drivers are now surrounded by
fans, as are their haulers.
</P>
<P>
   So the drivers have retreated to private motor homes parked
adjacent to the garage. Usually, they spend only as much time in
the garage as it takes to walk from their motor homes to the car or
the hauler.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR drivers and participants are the most obliging athletes
in sports. They never charge for autographs, willingly pose for
pictures and in general do whatever they can to accommodate the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't satisfy everyone, in part because the sport has
grown so much it's impossible to take care of everybody.
</P>
<P>
   They need some privacy, and the media needs to be able to
converse with them without their being mobbed by well-meaning fans
to the point where they simply feel they can't stop to talk with
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, NASCAR is going to have to take back the garage
and restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no order now.

fool you. Although ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is filled with so much nudity
and sexual content that it should've been rated NC-17, it isn't a
very sexy movie _ nor is it intended to be. If anything, this film
_ the last directed by the late Stanley Kubrick _ plays on any
pangs of sexual guilt you might have, with Cruise's character

ON MAINE'S COAST, VISTAS ARE CAST IN STONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the grandeur of the West, the mountainous coast of Maine
was viewed in the 19th century as a vast, untouched wilderness,
even though the lands had been well trodden and shaped by Indian
populations. Leading ultimately to the creation of the national
parks, this perception _ call it the American picturesque _
consisted of an appreciation of natural forms of scenery that
overwhelmed scattered travelers and government expeditions by its
ruggedness and austerity. Artists and chroniclers found these views
particularly uplifting when enhanced by the dramatic rhythms of
rough surf and spectacular sunsets.
 &UR;  &LR;  This summer, weekend visitors to Maine have the unusual prospect
of absorbing the 19th-century experience through a fine exhibition
of landscape paintings in Rockland and of then continuing up the
coast to view the same majestic land formations as preserved in
Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island. Along the way, it is
also possible to see man-made landscapes and gardens that draw on
the traditions of Maine and enrich local community life.
</P>
<P>
   Flying into Rockland over the coastline, one observes the long
fingers of water emptying into inlets along the irregular shoreline
and the isolated villages on the extreme points of the peninsulas,
their white church steeples marking the terrain. Maine is a rural
state, and even the meadows along the airstrip are filled with
weedy wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   This summer into early fall, a special quest for Maine scenery
begins in Rockland at the Farnsworth Art Museum, which specializes
in American art. In an exhibition titled ``Inventing Acadia:
Artists and Tourists at Mount Desert,'' the curator, Pamela
Belanger, shows how the work of pioneer landscape painters from the
1830s on attracted urban dwellers to explore these majestic regions
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, summer colonies later in the century grew to such a
proportion, threatening the idyllic views, that wealthy summer
residents took measures to preserve the landscape by establishing
the 35,000-acre Acadia National Park in 1919. It incorporates most
of the landmark mountainous silhouettes or ``sleeping giants''
recorded by the artists.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog, Ms. Belanger and other essayists treat the works
in their social and cultural as well as esthetic context, reminding
readers that the early ``artist-explorers,'' as professor J. Gray
Sweeney of Arizona State University calls them in his essay,
provided a kind of salon entertainment in cities where the large
canvases were viewed as vicarious travel experiences.
</P>
<P>
   While the artists often manipulated scenes by adding symbolic
traces of human settlement _ deserted houses or abandoned boats _
to place the viewer within the frame, on the whole they accurately
portrayed the lone lighthouses, the islands scattered across the
bay and the steep mountains falling away to the sea under
violet-streaked skies. Then as now, a patient gaze was required to
capture the subtle and transitory atmospheric changes that altered
one's perception of the landscape.
 &UR;  &LR; Thomas Cole and, later, his student Frederic Church were leaders
among the artists who made expeditions to the island, building on
their reputations as Hudson River School painters. The exhibition
offers the opportunity to compare their paintings of the same
scene, as in Cole's 1844 ``Sandy Beach, Mount Desert Island, Me.,''
and Church's circa 1850 ``Coast at Mount Desert Island (Sand
Beach),'' both of which capture the edge between smooth sand and
jutting boulders of pink granite.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's 1845 scenes of waves crashing against rocks in
Frenchman's Bay and Church's 1850s sunset paintings, one including
an imaginary distant view of Mount Katahdin inland, are all
testaments to the extraordinary artistic response to the variety
and inspiration offered by Mount Desert Island.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac Mountain, the highest on the island, figured
prominently among the painters' subjects, and Sanford Robinson
Gifford even places an artist sketching from a rocky perch at the
summit, looking out on the horizon. In 1896 Childe Hassam portrayed
the mountain in an Impressionistic haze from the vantage of
Frenchman's Bay.
</P>
<P>
   While most artists worked from the land, Fitz Hugh Lane painted
and sketched from ship deck, capturing the statuesque masted sails
and the effect of light on water. His 1852 ``Entrance of Somes
Sound From Southwest Harbor'' depicts the deep channel of water
that is the only fjord on the Atlantic Coast and the location in
the 1770s of the first permanent Colonial settlement on the island.
Very little had changed when Richard Estes painted ``A View of
Somes Sound'' in 1995, and that is a major point of the show: The
scenic experience of Maine has been preserved.
</P>
<P>
   This view is substantiated after a morning's visit by walking
into the museum's new gardens. In recent years, when the Farnsworth
converted the white church across the street into a center to
showcase the Maine work of the Wyeth family of artists, the
decision was also made to build an extension to the main building
and reorganize the grounds into a campus that includes the 1850
Farnsworth Homestead and carriage house.
</P>
<P>
   Now enclosed on the street sides by a white wooden fence with
tall posts and plantings of white rugosa roses, the entire property
has been given the domestic scale of a series of village gardens by
the landscape architect Clara Couric Batchelor. Separated by
winding paths, low stone walls, a semicircular hornbeam hedge and
tree plantings of gnarled crab apple and white birch, Ms. Batchelor
has planted mixed borders of home-grown plants like black-eyed
Susans, creeping phlox and Joe Pye weed. She also saved two
specimen lilacs on the grassy slope by the carriage house.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If you're looking for a metaphor _ and in
Hollywood that's a perpetual hunt _ you could find it in the thick,
lung-clenching smog that mixed with the heat and stupidity and
choked this town before the day even began.
</P>
<P>
   What an apt _ albeit strange _ introduction to the first day of
the Television Critic's Association summer press tour, at which a
nebulous group called Synditel (that's a conglomeration of
syndicated television shows) started the day with Richard Simmons
pouring everyone orange juice, then detoured through Louie Anderson
swearing and sweating about the new ``Family Feud'' game show he'll
host, careened around a weird ``National Enquirer'' lunch and then,
well, became increasingly more boring along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated television, if you haven't guessed, is the dregs of
the industry. Sure, there's a handful of talk shows such as
``Oprah'' and ``Rosie'' or an action show such as ``Xena: Warrior
Princess'' to guide the way to respectability, but mostly
syndication is home to shows too cheap, dumb or embarrassing to be
created by the networks, which really ought to tell you something.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what is available in the mornings and afternoons on
television is all syndicated product _ from egregiously bad
talk-show smut to silly game shows. Then, after a break for the
local news, there's a block of time known in the industry as
``early fringe,'' which is from 7 to 8 p.m., an hour reserved
almost exclusively for syndicated fare. So, you can see, these are
space-filler shows that local stations gobble up with their own
money _ not tapping the network till.
</P>
<P>
   And because local stations don't have much to spend after paying
those blow-dried TV anchors, the syndicated fare has to be
affordable. Now, affordable in Hollywood means quick and dirty, and
often disastrous, but sometimes oddly addictive, such as ``Wheel of
Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   So when you're getting pitched the next wave of syndication,
it's not unlike being approached on a street by a man who opens a
trench coat to reveal 60 plastic watches.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, really, is to go with it. Take Simmons, for example,
a man who is without question larger than life, above derision, a
master illusionist in the costume drama of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   How can you make fun of Simmons when he does it himself on David
Letterman?
</P>
<P>
   Plus, and this comes as a frustration to those of us looking for
a quick beat down, Simmons is a really nice man. And he's funnier
than he gets credit for. He's here pitching a show called ``Richard
Simmons' Dream Maker,'' which is like playing T-ball for most
critics _ an easy McGwire-like bash into the upper decks of
sneering sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Dream Maker'' is one of those sad TV shows with echoes of
``Queen for a Day'' and ``This Is Your Life'' that flirts with
cheese and sensationalism but ultimately plays out like a Hallmark
special _ and you're just a big jerk if you make fun of it. Because
Simmons is trying to help people get their wishes _ whether it's a
reunion, make-over, celebrity introduction, new car to get to a
much-needed job or life-saving surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And, considering the field, Simmons seems like one man trying to
do something positive for daytime TV _ and for people _ rather than
bloodying their noses or surprising them with the fact that their
sister is married to a goat, the way Jerry Springer and his ilk
tend to do.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with ``Leeza,'' which is a syndicated show and is
trying to distance itself from the ugly combativeness of Springer
or the freak shows of Ricki Lake and Jenny Jones. But Leeza Gibbons
is no different, really, and possibly worse in that she masks her
exploitation behind a veneer of false caring, perfectly captured by
the cameras as some victims of Littleton, Colo., or other
headline-making event let it all out on national television while
Leeza rubs their backs understandingly.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the world doesn't need another talk show but it's
getting one in ``The Dr. Joy Browne Show,'' on which the popular
psychologist gives you answers to your woes. To her credit, Browne
is infinitely more tolerable than the loathsome Dr. Laura and is
self-deprecating and wise about her role: ``I'm a teacher, I'm a
psychologist, I'm a nudger _ but I don't give therapy. ... I give
people choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, if you need them. But does anyone need ``The Martin Short
Show''? Isn't it enough that Roseanne and Howie Mandel tried this
talk thing, and now we need Ed Grimley chatting with Billy Crystal?
We're getting it, though Short _ cursed with the comic's need to be
perpetually ``on'' _ couldn't really encapsulate what the show will
be about or why we all wouldn't just watch Rosie O'Donnell instead.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Family Feud,'' which doesn't have Richard Dawson,
unfortunately, but does have Louie Anderson, who acted as though he
never wanted the job but liked the money so he signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's TV-friendly comedy has had all the rough edges rubbed
down, but when the camera is not on him he can swear and grouse
hilariously.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most uproarious offerings at Synditel was ``Battle
Dome,'' an obvious rip-off of ``American Gladiators'' even though
the producers say it isn't. Just to make sure all bases are touched
while seeking that young male demographic, the ``warriors'' who
battle contestants look as if they came out of a WWF molding
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Although they had no videotape of the alleged sports battle, one
event _ honest to God _ has contestants holding on to a platform
that spins around at 50 mph until one falls off. If that's not
enough _ and clearly it's not these days _ the warriors will throw
medicine balls at the whirling dervishes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``National Enquirer'' show, which really needs
no introduction other than to say the nation's largest newspaper is
on a mission to brag about its journalistic credibility on one
hand, then proudly continue its tabloid ways on the other. At the
very least, maybe it'll kill ``Inside Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes in the land of syndication. There's another
reincarnation of ``Divorce Court,'' a show called ``Blind Date''
because there aren't enough dating shows and then a strange
paleontologist's dream lineup of such shows as ``Relic Hunter''
with Tia Carrere, ``Peter Benchley's Amazon'' and ``Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle's The Lost World.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll replace syndicated television's last awful trend:
judge shows.

   On an afternoon drive up the coast to Mount Desert, the visitor
can stop in nearby Rockport at Avena's Herb Gardens, where a
remarkable woman, Deb Soule, has created an apothecary garden. Here
the leaves and colorful blossoms are harvested and dried for
tinctures, teas, salves and oils: organic compounds that are known
for their wide-ranging healing effects and that are sold by
catalog.
</P>
<P>
   In a Maine tradition of female herbalists that goes back to the
Indians, Ms. Soule has planted an ornamental garden that also
benefits her rural neighbors. A split-rail fence and a row of
sunflowers barely contain massive beds of Calendula officinalis and
Echinacea purpurea planted around a thyme-covered central circle
with radiating paths, one passing beneath a cedar pergola draped in
hops vines and hardy kiwi. All of the flowers and herbs are
botanically labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Passing next through the coastal town of Camden with its
pristine summer cottages and lawns, and a village green designed by
the Olmsted firm, the visitor should pause at the bend in the road
next to the Camden Library for a view of the horseshoe amphitheater
designed about 1930 by Fletcher Steele.
</P>
<P>
   To get the full impact of this powerful plan, which takes
advantage of local mineral and plant materials, one should leave
the library through the children's area at the lower level and turn
immediately left. With tiers upon tiers of granite steps
interspersed by grass and boulder ledges, clumps of hydrangeas and
the strong vertical lines of white birch trees _ a Steele signature
_ this steep outdoor theater has been beautifully maintained for
community events like concerts, plays and graduations. The
permanent show takes place in the active harbor beyond; and at
night tall classical wrought-iron tripod light fixtures, each with
a slight variation, cast a soft glow over the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   From there the drive is a straight run to Mount Desert Island,
the 12-by-14-mile island connected to the mainland by a causeway.
When the navigator Samuel Champlain charted the coastline in 1604,
he called it l'isle des Monts-deserts (the Island of Barren
Mountains) for its multiple peaks sloping down to prominent
headlands. The name of Acadia National Park itself suggests the
earlier French presence in the area extending to Canada.
 &UR;  &LR; The sweep of the Ocean Drive, a segment of the circular park road
that begins just outside the town of Bar Harbor, offers immediate
access to the landscapes that figured prominently among the
19th-century artists.
</P>
<P>
   The sand beach of Cole and Church is the only one on the island;
and though it is vastly peopled with bathers on a good day, one can
still appreciate the curved outcropping of granite that remains the
same and the nearby chasms in the rocks that invite crashing waves.
The road passes by Otter Creek, where Church painted a lone figure
on a rocky beach, and proceeds along coves and inlets opening out
to the glittering sea before coming under cover of woodland. The
best view of Frenchman's Bay and the Porcupine Islands is from the
Shore Path, the public walkway along the coast back in Bar Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   All of the park roads lead to Mount Cadillac, which still offers
expansive views of the sea and the distant hills as well as the
island's rock formations, which derive from its complex geological
origins.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing more hopeful of future possibilities than a
Maine sunrise seen from its peak when the first gleam of light
pours over a watery horizon and turns the world briefly into a
blush of pink. In that quiet moment under a streaked sky, time
appears to expand into timelessness and with it an understanding of
the paintings that made palpable the wonders of the Maine
landscape.

   LONDON _ Since April fans have been flocking from Eton, from
Essex, from Cornwall, and probably Cornball, too, all seeking a fix
from that most palindromic and hummable of Europop groups, Abba.
</P>
<P>
   The draw is ``Mamma Mia,'' the $4.5 million all-Abba musical
developed by Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, former members of
the group, with a book by Catherine Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Lines for unclaimed tickets form outside the Prince Edward
Theater in the West End hours before curtain time, and the British
press has reported that scalpers get hundreds of pounds (i.e.,
hundreds of dollars) for prime tickets. ``Mamma Mia'' has sold out
its 1,650-seat theater through Sept. 11, with tickets on sale
through March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Craymer, the show's producer, said on Tuesday that a deal
was in place to bring it to the Royal Alexandra Theater in Toronto
in May. Then a tour is very likely, she said, and perhaps a trip to
Broadway. ``I don't think anybody anticipated how well we would be
received,'' she said. ``We're really just taking one step at a
time. But Broadway is obviously a dream that everyone would like to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamma Mia'' is the story of a young woman, Sophie,
incorporating the music of Abba, the Swedish disco quartet, which
has sold about 350 million albums worldwide. Sophie, the only child
of a single mother, is getting married at her mother's taverna on
an unnamed Mediterranean island. Seeking her father's identity,
Sophie invites the three most likely candidates to the wedding,
unbeknownst to her mother. (Mamma mia!) There are men in scuba gear
and women in capri pants and, in the end, much rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   The London press gave the musical mixed to positive reviews,
with many critics tying themselves in knots to explain its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain predilections to which one does not lightly
confess,'' wrote Alastair Macaulay in The Financial Times,
mentioning his soft spot for Shirley Temple. ``Now it is joined _
herewith vanishes my social life _ by the fact I actually enjoyed
`Mamma Mia.'''
</P>
<P>
   One element cited by several critics is the creators' ingenuity
in fitting 21 Abba songs, none written as show tunes, into the
plot. For example, ``Chiquitita,'' that epic ballad of
cross-cultural romance, becomes a rallying song for a middle-aged
woman with man problems. (Don't ask how.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest potential problem for a New York transfer seems to
be that the group was never as big in the United States as it was
in Europe. Ms. Craymer said this was a legitimate concern but added
that she suspected that there were more fans than one might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think almost anyone of a certain age has `Abba Gold,''' she
said, referring to the band's greatest-hits album. ``And what we've
discovered, and I think this is true in America, is that the
younger generation thinks they've just discovered them.''
</P>
<P>
   THE REAL FLAP
</P>
<P>
   Another hot ticket here is ``The Real Thing,'' a revival of Tom
Stoppard's drama about a playwright, the insularity of passion and
an infidelity or two. (No scuba suits are involved.)
</P>
<P>
   The nine-week run at the Donmar Warehouse has been sold out
since critics trumpeted the production, particularly the
performances of Stephen Dillane and Jennifer Ehle in the play's
central roles. Broadway audiences may remember Jeremy Irons and
Glenn Close in those parts from the 1984 production.
</P>
<P>
   The strong notices have led to talk of a New York run. Anita
Waxman, who has a deal to bring work from the Donmar to Broadway,
said an early spring run in New York would ideally include the
entire British company. But Actors Equity must approve any
arrangement for foreign actors to perform on Broadway. Ms. Waxman
said that preliminary talks with the union had begun but that it
was too early to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the union denied Cameron Mackintosh permission
to bring his production of ``Oklahoma!'' to Broadway with the
British cast. The move has been delayed indefinitely. Here, more
than 300 British actors signed a petition last month decrying what
they said was an onslaught of Yankee thespians on their stages.
</P>
<P>
   At least one actor in ``The Real Thing'' might have no problem
performing in the United States: Ms. Ehle, whose mother is the
actress Rosemary Harris, already has a green card.
</P>
<P>
   ROSE'S TURN
</P>
<P>
   One other potential springtime entry for Broadway is ``Rose,'' a
one-woman play by Martin Sherman that follows a Jewish woman from
her girlhood in a tiny village in Ukraine through her bohemian days
in prewar Warsaw to the Holocaust and on to her postwar life in
America. The play, at the Royal National Theater, stars Olympia
Dukakis, making her British stage debut.
</P>
<P>
   The show has already drawn the attention of several major
Broadway producers, including Robert Fox (``Amy's View,'' ``The
Blue Room''), Margo Lion (``Triumph of Love,'' ``Jelly's Last
Jam'') and Stuart Thompson (``Not About Nightingales''). Beyond the
sizable appeal of Ms. Dukakis and the lasting fascination with the
Jewish diaspora, another draw may be the show's compact (read
inexpensive) scale. The set is essentially a wooden bench, and
lighting effects are minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Fox said, ``even one person is not inexpensive on
Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   `NOT TOP SECRET' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An opening of note on Friday night's schedule: the world
premiere of ``Home Body/Kabul,'' by Tony Kushner (``Angels in
America''). The piece, like ``Rose,'' is a woman's monologue,
involving a restless upper-class British housewife who imagines
herself in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The play, written last year, is having a low-key opening at a
90-seat theater in the Chelsea district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not top secret,'' said the director, David Esbjornson.
``It's just a smaller piece.'' He added: ``It's funny though. We
had a lot of Americans here last night.'' Representatives of the
Manhattan Theater Club and the New York Theater Workshop are
already scheduled to see the piece this month.

   UNDATED _ In the past few weeks, Nicole Kidman has appeared nude
on so many magazine covers _ sometimes with also-nude husband Tom
Cruise _ that the couple appear to have renounced their fame and
given their clothing to charity. But don't let Kidman's body-baring
fool you. Although ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is filled with so much nudity
and sexual content that it should've been rated NC-17, it isn't a
very sexy movie _ nor is it intended to be. If anything, this film
_ the last directed by the late Stanley Kubrick _ plays on any
pangs of sexual guilt you might have, with Cruise's character
taking a dark journey through an ever-weirder erotic Wonderland. By

<P>
   There was a time, about 20 years ago, when Bad Company was one
of the biggest rock bands in the world. To this day, Feel Like
Makin' Love is still one of the best make-out songs. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   After making a bunch of money, singer Paul Rodgers left to
pursue other projects, including The Firm with Led Zeppelin
guitarist Jimmy Page. Rest of the band continued, filling Rodgers'
spot with no-namers.
</P>
<P>
   Touting a new best-of-and-then-some collection, The `Original'
Bad Company Anthology, the group has re-formed for a 30-date tour,
which rolls into Dallas' Reunion Arrena on Saturday. All the
original members, too: Rodgers, Mick Ralphs, Simon Kirke and Boz
Burrell. And opening for them ... David Lee Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, 49, spews (via telephone):
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why'd you rejoin the band? I thought you hated everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes I do, and we beat the (deleted) out of each other every
day. No, there have been some frustrations, but most of those were
due to staying on the road too long. For me, it was getting too
unreal, so I tried a lot of different things. We're not really
``back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oh, man, so it's not permanent?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, this is probably that belated farewell tour we should
have done years ago. We're recording a live album but this is as
far as it goes. I just finished mixing my sixth solo CD and I'm
doing a little tour with the British Rock Symphony. I've got other
things going on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's a Bad Company song that you're proud of that doesn't
get a whole lot of airplay?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm proud of all of them in one way or another. Every song
you write, you think this is IT, the ultimate song. But I really
like Crazy Circles. Now which album is that on? Hmmm.... pretty sad
when you forget that kind of stuff. You'll have to check for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why that song?
</P>
<P>
   A: The lyrics, ``To all the world you're living like a king. ...
but you're just a puppet on a broken string,'' create and express a
mood. That's one of the things I learned listening to blues. They
painted a picture of life that one could identify with, and I've
always tried to do that. I'm still trying.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who goes to your concerts now?
</P>
<P>
   A: We get a great deal of fans from the old days, but we also
get young kids, too, and they're bringing their kids. It's a
beautiful thing, like the music is coming of age. I respect that,
but I also want to move forward with new songs. That's why we put
four new tracks on the anthology. We were looking for ways to make
this interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You guys still trash hotel rooms and stuff?
</P>
<P>
   A: I live very clean now. I like to stay fit and go down to the
gym and work out every day. I don't think I could handle the
intensity of this without being fit. That's the buzz for me. We did
mess around, went the usual route, but I found it a little bit
pointless. It's always been about the music. It keeps me young and
alive and vibrant. Cynthia wants to have a word with you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Uh, OK.
</P>
<P>
   A: (Rodgers' manager/girlfriend Cynthia Kereluk gets on the
phone) I just wanted to let you know that Paul works out every day
from 6 to 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So he doesn't get bombed anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we all know that drugs and alcohol are full of empty
promises.

IN NORTHERN IRELAND, CHAOS, FARCE AND A DREAM DEFERRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ What was supposed to have been the
most important day in the evolving Northern Ireland peace agreement
became a scene of chaos, farce and recrimination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a Thursday morning meeting of politicians at the
Stormont parliamentary building that was meant to inaugurate a new
era of government for the conflicted British province, the new
Northern Ireland Assembly had been shut down indefinitely, one of
its principal figures had resigned in disgust and the British
government had announced in London that the peace agreement was on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion began Thursday when David Trimble, head of the
main Protestant party, and his 28 Ulster Unionist colleagues
boycotted the Assembly session, which was scheduled to nominate
Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who is also the first minister of the Assembly, had
dashed hopes of any further progress on the peace accord when he
said Wednesday night that his party could not share power with the
largely Catholic Sinn Fein, the political associates of the Irish
Republican Army, unless the IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon of the moderate Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party reacted with fury, announcing
Thursday that he was resigning and calling on Trimble to do the
same. He accused Trimble of ``dishonoring the spirit and insulting
the principle'' of the peace agreement and said he had ``bled the
process dry'' with his unyielding pressure for concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon concluded with a dismissive motion towards the empty rows
of black benches belonging to the Ulster Unionists. ``I,'' he said,
``do not treat this house with contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   It emerged afterwards that Mallon's resignation may force
Trimble to give up his position as first minister. Under the
procedures of the power-sharing assembly, in six weeks Trimble must
either find another Roman Catholic deputy _ a daunting task in the
current rejectionist atmosphere he has created _ or step down.
</P>
<P>
   The break between the two men sent a dismaying message to those
working for peace in Northern Ireland because their public
partnership had been one of the most promising symbols of an
emerging cooperation between Ulster's warring religious communities
in the 15 months since the signing of the accord. Trimble was
awarded the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with John Hume, who is
the head of Mallon's party and his closest associate.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite of that kind of spirit was symbolized by
Thursday's uproarious session, with the members of the hard-line
Ulster Democrats jeering Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein,
and Adams excoriating their leader, the Rev. Ian Paisley, as
disgraceful. The one thing they agreed on was the use of ``farce''
to describe the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the absence of the Unionists, the Assembly was unable
to name a new Cabinet with the required Catholic-Protestant mix,
and it adjourned with no date for returning. The only parties
willing to nominate ministers were Sinn Fein and the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and the result was a 10-member all
Catholic shadow Cabinet that history will record held office for
less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise descended into farce when the acting speaker, Lord
Alderdice, had to give the missing Trimble five minutes under the
body's standing orders to name his minister. Derisive laughter
filled the hall as the legislators watched the minutes tick off on
the official clock above Trimble's empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists' decision had the effect of blocking the transfer
of power over local affairs from the British Parliament in London
to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast, which had been
scheduled for Sunday. The step would have represented the most
substantive evidence yet that the province had put behind it the
sectarian violence that has taken more than 3,200 lives in favor of
a political path.
</P>
<P>
   In London Mo Mowlam, the secretary for Northern Ireland, said
that the British and Irish governments were reviewing the peace
accord and that Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, would meet next week to decide on the
``nature, agenda and timetable'' of the review.
</P>
<P>
   She told a somber House of Commons that it was the
implementation of the agreement rather than the agreement itself
that would be under study. ``Today is a setback, it would be
foolish to deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would be even more foolish to conclude that the Good
Friday Agreement cannot continue,'' she added, in a reference to
the day in 1998 when the accord was signed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Andrew Mackay, the Conservative Party spokesman for Northern
Ireland and an aggressive advocate for Trimble, asked Ms. Mowlam to
praise the Unionist leader and declare that the blame for the
setback lay entirely with the IRA and other paramilitary groups for
not handing over their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   She responded by saying that she had respect for all the party
leaders and that ``the last thing the people of Northern Ireland
need now is an outbreak of recriminations.''
</P>
<P>
   The April 1998 agreement establishes governmental bodies and
commissions aimed at balancing the demands of Northern Ireland's
two main religious communities and parceling out authority between
them.
</P>
<P>
   It was approved overwhelmingly in referendums in Northern
Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, but politicians have been
quarreling about it for more than a year, with guerrilla
disarmament at the root of disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists say they cannot let a party with a private army
into government. The IRA will not agree to dismantle its arsenal.
But Sinn Fein argues that disarmament was never a precondition to
putting the plan into place. Sinn Fein also says that the IRA
cease-fire, now in its third year, is proof of the organization's
commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
   While the Assembly is indefinitely suspended, other parts of the
agreement, like the commission to examine reforms of the police
force, will move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, the Conservatives pressed Ms. Mowlam to end
the early release of prisoners, but she said she could not do that
by law unless paramilitary groups violated the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   There was no public admission of whatever frustration was felt
by Blair, who seized upon the Northern Ireland problem in his first
week in office in May 1997. Blair has made it a personal crusade,
spending enormous amounts of time with the province's politicians
here and in London.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Blair had come up with compromises and
concessions in an attempt to persuade Trimble not to back out of
entering government with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a conference in London's financial district Thursday
afternoon, Blair said the politicians of Northern Ireland would
never be able to work together unless they developed some
confidence in one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one thing remains outstanding,'' he said. ``It is a
matter of trust: Will Unionists really share power with
non-Unionists, will republicans really give up the gun?''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he believed the answer to both questions was yes, but
that unless people learned from the pain and injustice on the other
side as well as their own, ``then politics, normal politics in
Northern Ireland will never take root and there will therefore
never be peace.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hot and humid air will spread from the Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley into the Northeast as winds from the west increase. Sunshine
will be plentiful throughout these regions, although some puffy
cumulus clouds will form in the afternoon especially over the
Appalachians. Afternoon temperatures will be in the low to middle
90s.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy clouds and scattered showers will persist from the
Carolinas to the southern Appalachians. There will be more sunshine
than in recent days at the coast, but sunshine will be limited near
the mountains. Thunderstorms will erupt during the afternoon in
Florida and near the central Gulf of Mexico coast as sea breezes
help to lift the sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of thunderstorms will precede a weakening cool
front from the western Great Lakes to the central Plains. A jet
stream disturbance will promote some stronger thunderstorms as it
moves across the southern Missouri Valley. In the wake of the
front, less humid air and ample sunshine will prevail in most of
the northern Plains. A second surge of chilly air will produce
clouds and patchy rain near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   The slow-moving afternoon thundershowers that have caused areas
of flash flooding from southern California to Nevada and Arizona
will shift toward southern Colorado and New Mexico. Otherwise, the
Southwest will be sunny with seasonal heat.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure over the interior Northwest will promote low clouds
near the coast and a few potent thunderstorms over the mountains
from the Cascades to the Bitterroots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Southeastern Simmer
</P>
<P>
   The summer has not been as steamy as usual over a large part of
the Southeast. In Birmingham, the 90-degree temperature threshold
has been reached on only 11 days. By mid-July, the Alabama capital
typically has had 23 days with temperatures of 90 degrees or
higher. A permanent weather system known as the Bermuda high has a
strong influence on summer weather in the East. This year the high
pressure zone has been stronger and farther north than usual. As a
result, the hottest air has migrated across the northern states
where heat and drought have been prevalent.

AVERT YOUR EYES: KUBRICK'S FINAL OPUS LESS THAN A WORK OF ART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trailers for Stanley Kubrick's movies are malicious teases,
working audiences into a lather like the work of no other major
director.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the only coming-attractions clip to generate more
excitement than Kubrick's adaptation of ``The Shining'' _ in which
a torrent of blood gushed out of an elevator in lewd slow motion
and slammed into the camera _ is the trailer for the director's
last movie, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' where the biggest star in the
world, Tom Cruise, lunges into a nas-tay clench with his wife,
Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   (The trailer for ``Eyes,'' though, makes the movie look like the
kind of picture that even Showtime has the nerve to run only at 4
a.m., one of those ``erotic thrillers'' starring Shannon Tweed that
barely gets shelf space at the more reputable video stores. And
there are as many bared breasts in ``Eyes'' as you'd see in any of
those Joe Bob Briggs spectaculars.)
</P>
<P>
   But the trailers promise a wave of humidity that Kubrick has
either never been able to, or wanted to, deliver. In his best work,
he casts a cold, glittering spell over the material, be it ``2001;,
A Clockwork Orange;'' or ``Lolita.'' ``(Paths of Glory'' and
``Spartacus'' are puffed out from Kirk Douglas' enjoyably
melodramatic flexing, which gives them a spiritedness not seen
since Kubrick's early thrillers, which Kubrick essentially disowned
as juvenilia.)
</P>
<P>
   The glitter dances across ice _ which is not to say that the
chilliness doesn't have an odd zeal, or affection. In this
adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's ``Traumnovelle,'' Kubrick uses as
his source a story that, with its streak of pettiness and
old-school vanity, has a tweedy mustiness that needs airing out _
an airing out that it doesn't get.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise is Dr. Bill Harford, and Kidman is his wife, Alice. With
his hearty straightforwardness, Cruise is interesting to watch as
another side of him comes to life after the exhaustion of nine
years of marriage. Cruise tends to work from the outside _ he's so
chipper that even his hair doesn't seem to age _ and Kubrick's
frigid eminence gives the actor a remarkable showcase. Bill's not
unhappy, but he's clearly looking for something else to stimulate
him. He circles chances for sex outside marriage with an odd
combination of wholesomeness and diligence, determined to do a lot
of comparison shopping before making a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Even his flirting with a pair of lush models at a party has a
well-scrubbed earnestness. Cruise has learned to use his go-getter
movie-star presence well. Even his tendency to indicate what he's
about to do, so that no one misses what he's up to, works in this
context.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick is far less successful with Kidman, who seems to be
turning into Kelly Preston, tilting her head and coquettishly
gazing at the camera. In a scene that should be ``Eyes''' first big
emotional climax _ when the couple's stoned argument turns into a
series of confessions that sends a huge fault through their
marriage _ Kidman appears to working through an acting exercise,
like she's auditioning for ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a crucial moment _ when we see how their ability to find
each other's soft spots turns into something abominable _ a truth
that all couples could recognize. But we're thrown out of the
moment because of Kidman's actressy gestures. All the potential she
showed early in her career is dwindling fast; who'd have thought
that Cruise would turn out to be more believable than Kidman?
</P>
<P>
   There are potent performances from other actors. Sydney Pollack,
who hovers around Bill's life as the friend who leads the life Bill
might like, is alert and savvy. He's up for anything, slug-souled
and avuncular. Alan Cummings comes through in a brief bit as a
hotel clerk who takes to the shine in Bill's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick must have been attracted to the vein of voyeurism and
self-delusion in Schnitzler's tale of a married couple who toy with
affairs, both in the real world (he) and the dream world (she). It
opens a psychological Pandora's box that the literary set may have
found exciting and new after Freud's theories came into vogue.
Schnitzler exposes his own relationship with Sigmund Freud, since
the women in the story are smudged versions of Schnitzler's wife in
different guises.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick and writer Frederic Raphael's updating of
``Traumnovelle'' seems to have brought it only up to the 1940s,
even though it's set in contemporary Manhattan; the movie is almost
quaint in its squareness. This squareness extends to the underuse
of the women, who are almost objectified like women in pornography;
they seem to be either homemakers or hookers. (The overreliance on
female nudity definitely hints at a double standard at the MPAA
Ratings Board.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie looks astonishing, suffused with a sepia graininess
that functions as a weird photographic pointilism that takes some
getting used to, a unique visual signature that's both fluid and
rough-hewn. But it fails to properly show the kinky undercurrents
that are supposed to pull Bill into pursuing pleasure at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   This movie is so overly worked out that there's no room for
enjoyment _ we don't sense the tension from a man who's aching to
lose control and savor a wild moment. When Cruise strolls through a
secret pleasure palace where powerful men assemble to have
anonymous sex _ everyone wears cloaks and masks that look like
costumes from a high-school staging of ``Phantom of the Opera'' _
it looks like he's wandered into one of those badly dubbed
soft-core pictures that turn up on pay-per-view. Except that
``Eyes'' lacks the seedy lustiness of those films. It's a rarefied
soft-core porn picture, the worst of both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   What's incredible is that Cruise and Kidman sacrificed more than
a year and a half of their careers _ his longtime absence from the
market may account for the recession the movie industry has
proclaimed _ to surrender themselves to Kubrick's vision. (A more
successful version of this movie is Nicolas Roeg's ``Don't Look
Now,'' an erotic thriller that dramatizes the loving warmth of a
married couple _ it still sends a chill.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie can be faulted for its shortage of emotional
voluptuousness, ``Eyes'' shows some daring. Rather, it shows an
interest in being daring. It tries to get at the fissures in a
relationship that are just waiting to split. It strains to bring
some of the lurid, ground-breaking sexiness of movies from the
period when ``Last Tango in Paris,'' ``Midnight Cowboy'' and
Kubrick's own ``Clockwork Orange'' were released. But Kubrick and
Raphael couldn't be more out of touch. In his last picture, Kubrick
will have to get by with a shallow mastery of craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is rated R for adult content, nudity,
profanity and drug use.
</P>

   Trying to make a list of the hottest movies ever made is just
asking for trouble, because sexual heat is in the eye of the
beholder. Here are some movies provocative enough to keep your eyes
wide open:
--The Blue Angel: Although this was released in 1930, it still
holds up as a portrayal of sexual obsession, with Marlene Dietrich
as a sultry singer who leads to Professor Emil Jannings' downfall.
--Gilda: Rita Hayworth is at her sexiest in this 1946 film, as a
woman who comes between casino owner George McCready and his
second-in-command, Glenn Ford. Hayworth makes merely taking off a
glove unbelievably hot. Michelle Pfeiffer could never have done her
Fabulous Baker Boys bit without this. --To Have and Have Not: Not
only does Lauren Bacall ask Humphrey Bogart if he knows how to
whistle in this 1946 entry, she also says _ after they kiss a
second time _ ``It's even better when you help.'' This may be the
sexiest performance in screen history. --From Here to Eternity:
This 1953 movie, with its torrid Burt Lancaster-Deborah Kerr
affair, inspired the editors of Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever
to write, ``Still has the best waves-on-the-beach love scene in
filmdom.'' --Body Heat: A throwback to 1940s noir, but with a 1980s
attitude, as Kathleen Turner brings dopey lawyer William Hurt to a
fever pitch. Line: ``You're not too smart. I like that in a man.''
--The Unbearable Lightness of Being: In which Lena Olin
demonstrates that all you need to be sexy is a good hat _ although
it helps to be Lena Olin. --Mississippi Masala: Masala is a
collection of hot and colorful spices, and spicy is the word for
the relationship between Sarita Choudhury and Denzel Washington in
this 1992 movie about a mixed-race affair. --Desperado: Yeah, so
maybe this 1995 movie is more violent than sexy, but it features a
love scene with Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. You can't get
much hotter than that.

THE LIBRARY DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When GOP presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole
visited Washington state recently, she held a news conference at a
Seattle-area library to demand that federal funding be withheld
from public libraries that lack anti-pornography filters for their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about our values,'' she intoned gravely. She was making a
pitch for mechanically protecting children against sex and violence
on the Internet in an apparent effort to appeal to the female
voters she is trying to attract.
</P>
<P>
   Just one small problem. Librarians were appalled. Dole was doing
politics; they do reading. She didn't know the difference between
the cultural ideal of squeaky clean cyberspace and technical
reality.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Bill Gates says, the software systems designed to
block naughty stuff are not up to assuming the broad responsibility
of substituting for human judgment. Although several kinds of
filters are on the market, ``all filtering software stinks,''
according to the impressive young computer genius in my family.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, did not matter to the irresponsible House when
it recently passed a measure that would do just what Dole favors,
forcing libraries to rely on ineptly programmed, non-thinking
machines to screen out obscene material.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce Committee has approved a similar bill
sponsored by its chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is smart
enough to know better but is caught up in GOP presidential
politics. The Senate bill gives more flexibility to local libraries
than the House version does, although it is still symbolic
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   But, by golly, the politicians went on record against smut _ and
isn't that wonderful! It took no bravery; if there are thundering
herds of voters clamoring to corrupt our innocent kids with dirty
thoughts, nobody has found them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rooting out universally despised pornography in a land that
reveres freedom of expression has never been simple. Conceding an
inability to form a coherent test for obscenity, Supreme Court
Justice Potter Stewart opined sourly in 1964 that he couldn't
define it ``but I know it when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   A filtering system can't define it either, which can result in
the blocking of legitimate literature.
</P>
<P>
   At its clumsiest, the system represents unconstitutional
censorship. It makes librarians tear their hair. At its most
incompetent, it allows so many easy evasions that the filters are
useless against determined viewers of any age.
</P>
<P>
   Some systems cancel out words merely thought too suggestive,
such as ``breast,'' which eliminates medical discussions of breast
cancer and recipes for chicken breast. In an attempt to block
pictorial nudity, some systems filter out images that simply show
too much flesh, which would include bathing scenes and Brandi
Chastain's exuberant shirt-removal at the winning climax of the
Women's World Cup Soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
   The competing filter manufacturers guard as a trade secret the
way they determine what's OK so that libraries have no basis upon
which to examine their decisions. The names of prohibited sites are
hidden from the librarians _ the on-scene guardians of those
youngsters the prohibitions are supposed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   The American Library Association is officially opposed to a
federal mandate compelling public libraries and schools to use
filtering software. The organization does not oppose the idea that
parents might use filters in their home computers, viewing that as
a matter for individual parental discretion.
</P>
<P>
   And it favors leaving the issue to local community standards,
allowing libraries to make their own decisions about filtering. It
also favors privacy screens which allow adults to watch marginal
material without being visible to others who may pass by.
</P>
<P>
   What really upsets the librarians is having mechanical
one-size-fits-all censorship imposed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating that Congress thinks it can come in and do a
better job than we librarians do every day,'' one insulted veteran
told me.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, we once thought conservatives were for local rather than
federal controls, particularly when it came to schoolchildren. But
somehow we must have gotten that wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians are in the business of expanding access to books, not
limiting their content. The right to read is their mantra, and a
glorious one it is. They think illiteracy is a greater threat to
the republic than a few dirty cyberspace words or photos whose
access can be denied a child on the spot by an alert librarian.
</P>
<P>
   But the political anti-smut patrol is in high dungeon, flaunting
moral superiority and arousing purists to do war against civil
libertarians and other corrupt folk who kind of like the idea of
free speech. The library association has taken some lumps as
sounding too permissive and insufficiently on patrol against sinful
contamination of innocent young minds.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, dear. Once again Congress is setting up work for the Supreme
Court to do in defense of the First Amendment. The librarians may
be no match for congressional momentum but thankfully the high
bench is.

IN `EYES,' NICOLE KIDMAN PROVES THAT THERE'S MORE TO SENSUALITY
THAN SKIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Nicole Kidman has appeared nude on so
many magazine covers _ sometimes with also-nude husband Tom Cruise
_ that the couple appear to have renounced their fame and given
their clothing to charity. This isn't the case, of course; it's
merely naked hype for the new ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' in which Kidman
displays her full backside during the very first shot.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let Kidman's body-baring fool you. Although ``Eyes''
is filled with so much nudity and sexual content that it should've
been rated NC-17, it isn't a very sexy movie _ nor is it intended
to be. If anything, this film _ the last directed by the late
Stanley Kubrick _ plays on any pangs of sexual guilt you might
have, with Cruise's character taking a dark journey through an
ever-weirder erotic Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite all the nudity, the hottest moment in the movie
comes when Kidman is fully clothed, doing homework with her
onscreen daughter. She's in the classic movie-librarian get-up _
hair up, glasses on _ and she's giving the camera such a seductive
look it's a wonder that the cinematographer was able to
concentrate. Mona Lisa smile on her face, chin on her playful right
hand, Kidman looks like she's giving someone that
head-to-heel-and-back-again lust scan, and she makes you feel like
that someone is you.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, attitude-generated sexiness like this
slipped away from the movies, and it's a bit of a cosmic joke that
the less puritanical Hollywood has become about movies, the more
anti-erotic they've become. Back when movies were under the
watchful eyes of such censorious groups as the Hays Office, which
kept nudity and explicit sexual content out of U.S. movies for
several decades, they had to rely on chemistry, dialogue and
subtext to bring things to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Motion Picture Association of America put its ratings
system in place in the late '60s, movies began to be more explicit,
although there's a big difference between the explicitness of, say,
``Last Tango in Paris'' and a hard-core porn film such as ``Deep
Throat.'' And practically every year since then, another film has
come along to challenge the ratings board, with the board
compromising more every year, allowing more explicit material to
break through. The first NC-17 movie, 1991's ``Henry and June,''
looks positively tame compared with something like this year's
R-rated ``Summer of Sam'' _ or even the PG-13-rated sniggering and
grossness of the Austin Powers sequel. And as more explicit
material has made its way into films, audiences _ and filmmakers _
have had to use their imaginations less and less.
</P>
<P>
   As imagination has decreased, so, in many ways, has the
attitude. Nobody smolders like Valentino anymore, although Antonio
Banderas came close in last year's ``The Mask of Zorro,'' with
considerable help from Catherine Zeta-Jones (although she couldn't
bring Sean Connery to a simmer in this year's ``Entrapment'').
Nobody crackles like Bogey and Bacall, who had to use words more
than pictures to smoke up ``The Big Sleep'' and ``To Have and Have
Not'' (Bacall's ``You know how to whistle'' speech in the latter
may be the sexiest line of dialogue in any movie). Nobody can make
the ocean roil like Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr did in their
famous beachside love scene in ``From Here to Eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   In these movies, what was left out mattered as much as or more
than what was left in. Now, what is left out amounts to the
director-approved (albeit reluctantly) digital alteration of Eyes'
orgy scene, protecting American audiences from peeks at some
actors' genitals. Although Eyes frequently succeeds as ``art,'' it
doesn't succeed as erotica _ in fact, it's ultimately anti-erotic.
If you're looking for its most sexy element, Kidman's eyes have it.

 &HT;    GORE EMPHASIZES GUN ISSUE, SEEN AS A BUSH WEAKNESS
 &HT;    580&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore, waging a two-city assault on
the gun lobby and George W. Bush, suggested Thursday that the Texas
governor is ``doing the bidding'' of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's attack provided further evidence that Democrats plan to
emphasize gun control, an issue that polling experts say could help
close the double-digit poll lead Bush holds over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took aim at the Republican presidential front-runner and
the NRA in a speech to the national convention of National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Later, he
returned to Washington for a meeting with Colorado high school
students lobbying for stricter gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   The students, some from Littleton, where 16 people died in a
rampage by two students this spring, earlier met with President
Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on the Republican-controlled Congress to pass gun
control measures that were introduced by the administration
immediately after the Littleton tragedy, and echoed the criticism
Gore has leveled at the NRA throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past three months the gun lobby has been calling the
shots on Capitol Hill,'' Clinton said. ``Now it's time for Congress
to listen to the lobbyists who truly matter _ our children.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the NAACP, Gore used similar words in urging
the delegates to support his presidential bid in order to ``create
a family lobby that will be more powerful than the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the president directed his remarks mostly at Congress,
the vice president set his sights largely on Bush's support for
state laws giving Texans the right to carry concealed weapons and
prohibiting localities from suing gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this presidential race, there are some who believe the
urgent matter related to guns is the need to extend new protections
to the gun manufacturers. I believe it is time to have new
protections for our children and our families,'' Gore said. ``Some
want more concealed weapons. But they can't conceal the fact that
they are doing the bidding of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued his habit of avoiding any direct mention of Bush
by name. But officials at the Democratic National Committee were
not as subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hess, the DNC's designated hitter on the topic of Bush,
noted that while the Colorado students were in Washington to push
for stricter gun controls, Bush was at a fund-raising event in
Virginia with NRA President Wayne LaPierre.
</P>
<P>
   Polling experts say the parties' contrasting positions on gun
control could help the vice president draw closer to Bush in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different political world since Littleton,'' said
Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center in Washington, a
source of independent polling data.
</P>
<P>
   While Kohut emphasized that he has no data related specifically
to Bush, he noted that gun control has become ``an area of
Republican vulnerability in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic message is ``you can't trust the Republicans
because they are in the pocket of the NRA,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   A Pew survey in mid-May found that 65 percent of Americans favor
restrictions on gun ownership, an 8-point jump since late 1993.
There were shifts of more than 10 points among women and people
over 65, two groups whose support Gore has been losing to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said his latest polling data, which is currently being
analyzed, indicates support for gun controls ``is holding,''
particularly among women. An overwhelming 75 percent of women now
favor restricting the ownership of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll in mid-June showed even stronger support for gun
control. Nearly eight out of 10 Americans said they favored the
registration of all firearms, a far-reaching step that the
president and vice president have been unwilling to propose.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gallup has not tested public opinion on the anti-crime
proposals Gore unveiled Monday, Gallup researcher Michael Gillespie
said previous polling suggests Americans ``are likely to support''
Gore's call for photo licensing of gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gillespie said Gallup data also suggests that Americans
would not support the kind of class-action lawsuit the NAACP plans
against the gun industry's marketing practices. Gore applauded the
NAACP for considering such action.

(DW) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is unlikely that Tennessee Williams ever thought
of ``Tiger Tail'' as a viable theatrical work, and the production
mounted at the Harold Clurman Theater by Randy Becker and
Middleschmertz Productions suggests it isn't. The text is simply a
stage reduction of the script Williams wrote for the 1956 film
``Baby Doll,'' and that script in turn was cobbled together from
two one-act plays, ``The Unsatisfactory Supper'' and ``27 Wagons
Full of Cotton.'' ``Tiger Tail'' was simply meant to bring in some
extra cash for the playwright after the film became a success.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was so inattentive to his cobbling that the movie has
two plots only occasionally tacked together. But he was lucky. Elia
Kazan's brilliant directing made the film about a moral sinkhole in
rural Mississippi much bigger and deeper than the script. Karl
Malden's redneck was sloppy and evil, but in anguish, and Eli
Wallach as his antagonist embodied an intelligent malice that made
him attractive and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' idea was that Baby Doll would be a fat, ridiculous
woman, but Kazan's casting of Carroll Baker transformed Baby Doll
into a sex bomb who brought the wrath of many censorship groups
down on the film. So, anyone staging ``Tiger Tail'' has formidable
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The two best reasons for seeing the current effort are Shae
D'lyn as Baby Doll and Jane Cecil as Aunt Rose Comfort McCorkle.
Stage and television audiences know well that Ms. D'lyn can look
alluring enough to make it seem downright indecent for any man who
sees her not to try to seduce her, and here she also captures
enough of the somewhat brainless sense of injury of the teen-age
bride of a middle-aged brute to make her escape from him through
sex with his enemy a nice revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cecil has few equals at creating dotty women who can throw a
whole plot into chaos with a word and reduce male control freaks to

<P>
   Joseph Whipp as Archie Lee, Baby Doll's gross husband, is
certainly as violent, mean and coarse as he is meant to be, but
this Archie lacks any vulnerability, and without that the black
humor Williams intended degenerates into a crude snicker. Silas
Weir Mitchell as Vacarro, whose seduction of Baby Doll is part of a
plan to pay back Archie Lee for having torched Vacarro's cotton
gin, makes the character so intent on stripping her and unbuttoning
himself that he betrays little of the cruel will to destroy a man
that made this role so powerful in Eli Wallach's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the fissures in Williams' text are made even more
obvious here than they are on the page. Harry Mastrogeorge, the
director, seems to let the story just trudge along; instead of
building up to an explosive climax of grim, comic comeuppance, it
simply ends with an incoherent, drunk boobie hauled off to the
slammer utterly puzzled by what he has brought down on himself.
That may stir emotions, but it is not dramatic.

CONGRESS SEEKS OVERHAUL OF INS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three congressmen gave the Immigration and
Naturalization Service a failing grade Thursday and called for
abolishing the agency and replacing it with two divisions within
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS is a broken-down wreck that can't be fixed,'' Rep.
Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in announcing a bill that would split
the immigration service into two new bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, chairman of a House Judiciary Committee immigration
panel, was joined by the two co-sponsors of the bill, Rep.
Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, and Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., who also
condemned the agency's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS has simply failed to do its job, and a major reason
for that is that it's trying to do too many things at once,'' said
Reyes, a former Border Patrol sector chief in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the INS has problems, Attorney General
Janet Reno said the House bill goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency should work on being the best it can be, but it's
important to have it under one roof,'' Reno said when asked about
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, a Bureau of Immigration Services would
process applications for visas, citizenship, asylum and refugee
status. A separate Bureau of Immigration Enforcement would oversee
the Border Patrol, inspections at airports and other entry points,
investigations, detentions and deportations.
</P>
<P>
   ``With its record of monumental failures, the agency has proven
that it cannot carry out both missions,'' said Rogers, chairman of
the House Appropriations Committee's Commerce, Justice, State and
Judiciary panel, which has jurisdiction over the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The INS _ which is part of the Justice Department _ has a
backlog of 1.8 million legal immigrants waiting for their
citizenship applications to be processed. The average processing
times is more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that a legal immigrant who has paid the $220
processing fee must wait that long,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   In part to prevent its own demise, the INS has proposed a
reorganization plan that would establish separate structures to
administer benefits and enforcement, but keep them as part of the
INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the issues between enforcement and service are so
intertwined that it will be important to have a single head of the
agency,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reno said she was willing to work with Congress to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration groups also oppose breaking up the INS, which has
more than 31,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Butterfield, executive director of the American
Immigration Lawyers Association, a Washington-based group that
provides legal and social services to immigrants, said that while
the INS was in need of change, the bipartisan bill would do more
harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sharry, director of the National Immigration Forum, a
Washington-based immigration advocacy group, said the bill would
create ``dueling bureaucracies'' that would cripple immigration
services and weaken enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is frustrated with the INS, but this isn't the way
to fix it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the sponsors of the bill said that because of the failure of
past INS restructuring plans, they believe the agency must be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1983, I've been watching the INS say again and again
that it was `changing this' and `restructuring that' and nothing
ever changes,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no comparable Senate bill, Smith said his
legislation already has the support of more than 70 House member
and has a strong chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just such widespread agreement that something is
wrong with this agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill also would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Require the directors of the two new bureaus to report to a
deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   _ Install ``chief financial officers'' in each bureau to ensure
that funds are properly spent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Transfer the INS detention operation to the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons within four years.

WITCH HUNT TURNS UP SOME SCARY HYPE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few pictures sent the kind of excitement through this year's
Sundance Film Festival like the low-tech, no-budget psychological
thriller ``The Blair Witch Project.'' And ``Blair Witch'' now is
jolting the larger landscape with a similar kind of buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Three college students pack video equipment, and enough
cigarettes to satisfy an entire prison population, into the
Maryland woods. Their aim: to make a documentary about the spooky
goings-on in the area. As they begin their journey, they're
patronizing toward the people they interview for their doc _
regular backwoods folks who eagerly, and maybe a little too
intensely, recount stories about the Blair witch legend.
</P>
<P>
   It's here that ``Blair Witch'' is best, in its setup. Heather, a
fast talker who bulldozes her way in the lead, drags her crew along
with her. Her determination sets things in motion. Tramping through
the woods with their spoiled, well-fed obliviousness, they joke and
gripe about how little they manage to turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Heather's All-American contempt for slacker Michael, as
good-natured Joshua jogs along behind them, gives ``Blair Witch'' a
head of steam. Their attempt to find their subject takes a wrong
turn, and the mounting evidence indicates that they're now the game
instead of the hunters. Suddenly, they're trapped in an urban
legend: a story about a group of kids who go into the woods looking
for a monster and find far more than they bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have used a process
they call method filmmaking, in which they plunged their cast of
unknowns into a series of grim improvisations. And as the crew's
sense of entitlement dissipates, and they realize they're lost and
stalked by the danger they came to document, ``Blair Witch'' is
doused with sweat and dread. (This movie will do extremely well in
Europe, as the tiny cast is shorn of its bourgeois arrogance.)
</P>
<P>
   The unease is cranked up by the hand-held cameras _ the movie
was shot on video for roughly $20,000 _ and the unsteady-cam
videography adds to the realism.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the enjoyment you may experience in responding to the
material may be a sense of relief. In ``Blair Witch,'' there's none
of the honeyed nihilism and self-mocking cheap irony found in
``Scream'' and its imitators. Nor is there a river of blood and
dismembered body parts. Instead, ``Blair Witch'' gets its shivers
the subtle, old-fashioned way, by creating a scenario that seems
familiar and pulling the rug from under us.
</P>
<P>
   The bleached-poor quality of the visuals and the crew of unknown
actors are a no-nonsense horror treat. For the first 45 minutes or
so, ``Blair Witch'' is a prickly joy, disorienting and disturbing,
a combination of ``The Real World'' and ``Night of the Living
Dead,'' the granddaddy of low-budget, come-from-nowhere thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   But as the movie grinds on, the limited resources become
tiresome. The actors eventually descend into a series of screaming
matches, tearfully bellowing obscenities at each other: The Actors
Studio of the Living Dead. And the ineptitude of the filmmaking,
which had a ragged charm at the outset, is wearing, too.
</P>
<P>
   In George Romero's ``Living Dead,'' the unwieldy filmmaking and
barely tolerable acting gave the movie the off-putting and
mesmerizing quality of a nightmare _ that's why you're afraid to go
to sleep after you've seen ``Living Dead;'' you feel like you've
dreamt it before. For audiences who haven't seen a lot of movies _
and, apparently, the press members who are calling this one of the
most original movies of all time _ ``Blair Witch'' may have that
kind of effect.
</P>
<P>
   So some will find it easy to overlook the inconsistencies, such
as why over the course of five days the trio never runs out of
battery power, or that the sound is consistently well-recorded
throughout the picture; you might think that people fearing for
their lives have things to do other than check the recording
levels.
</P>
<P>
   But the first half is likable, a breath of fresh air that
explains why the hype is so thick around ``The Blair Witch
Project.'' Other than that, though, the scariest thing about
``Blair Witch'' may be the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' is rated R for language and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Blair Witch Project _ 3 stars (on a scale of 5) Directors:
Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez Stars: Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams, Joshua Leonard Length: 87 min. Rated: R

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PIE,' starring Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Natasha
Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Eugene
Levy. Directed by Paul Weitz (R, 100 minutes). The snickering
teen-age comedy about four boys, all seniors in the same Michigan
high school, who swear a pact to lose their virginity by the end of
the school year, serves up a new gross-out joke every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie obviously wants to outdo ``There's Something About
Mary'' in raunchy guffaws, but it lacks the antic spirit of its
forerunner. More like an upper-middle-class ``Porky's,'' it parades
its dirty jokes as crassly as an old-time burlesque show (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ARLINGTON ROAD,' starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope
Davis, Robert Gossett and Joan Cusack. Directed by Mark Pellington
(R, 117 minutes). In a smart, stylish thriller that recalls the
paranoid classics of the '70s, Bridges plays a history professor
who begins to suspect that his smiling suburban neighbors are not
what they seem.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking down clues to an anti-government terrorist network, he
also engages in a battle of wits with Robbins' cryptic character,
and these fine actors square off to gripping effect. Swift and
pulse-quickening, this thriller has more than its share of
surprising twists, including a whopper at the finale. All in all, a
welcome change of pace from the season's dopey blockbusters (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME,' starring Mike Myers,
Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13,
95 minutes). There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of
the words ``Oh, behave!'' But it isn't here yet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sequel with the fab title is several love beads
short of its predecessor and more than a few scenes play like
outtakes, this is still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy.
Myers' neo-Sellers multiple-personality act is fine even when the
material is less so, and this sequel makes the most of Dr. Evil,
his most inspired creation. A scatological Scotsman, the film's
walking id and bathroom joke, is more of an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   Costumes and pop references are still a hoot, as is the adorably
benighted Austin. Ms. Graham makes terrific eye candy but doesn't
share Ms. Hurley's quick-witted air of being in on the joke
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN TALE,' starring Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere, Didier
Sandre, Alain Libolt and Alexia Portal. Directed by Eric Rohmer
(PG, 110 minutes; in French with English subtitles). The final
chapter of the director's ``Tales of the Four Seasons'' is as
sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines
benevolently on the Rhone Valley vineyard owned by the central
character, Magali (Ms. Romand).
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the adventures of this wiry and vital but
lonely widowed mother of two after she allows two friends to play
matchmaker. The film's plot, like that of other Rohmer movies, is
mathematically schematic as the characters indulge in exquisitely
verbalized soul-searching. As sensuously gratifying as it is
civilized, with a wonderful central performance by Ms. Romand, it
reaches a happy ending that feels entirely earned (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BIG DADDY,' starring Adam Sandler, Cole and Dylan Sprouse and
Joey Lauren Adams. Directed by Dennis Dugan (PG-13, 95 minutes).
It's awfully early in the career of Adam Sandler to find him
sharing the screen with a scene-stealing 6-year-old (actually the
Sprouse twins).
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the cute kid in Sandler's movies is usually the star
himself. But he's in a position to do whatever he likes, even if
it's a flimsy sentimental comedy with more product plugs and fewer
laughs than might have been hoped for. Having greatly expanded his
following with the romantic comedy and '80s kitsch of ``The Wedding
Singer,'' not to mention the inspired rustic lunacy of ``The
Waterboy,'' he falls back on much less inventive material this
time. And the barrage of brand-name junk food is enough to make
skin break out in the audience (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,' starring John Travolta, Madeleine
Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton and James Woods. Directed by
Simon West (R, 118 minutes). Murder on a military base was once
enough of a pretext for a detective thriller, but nowadays it takes
more. The prevailing sleaze quotient calls for kinks, and this
galling adaptation of a Nelson DeMille best seller is happy to
oblige.
</P>
<P>
   So the title character, a pretty young officer who the film
thinks has no place in the military, is the victim of a lurid
crime. Travolta and Ms. Stowe affably investigate whodunit, though
the unraveling of the crime is laughably arbitrary. The real point
of their ponderous investigation is that the victim asked for what
she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AN IDEAL HUSBAND,' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam. Written and
directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best thing about
Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego Lord Arthur
Goring.
</P>
<P>
   In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually wise,
witty and caring) rake, Everett makes him all the more charming.
Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician and his
priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting the right
notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they're almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `NOTTING HILL,' starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Directed
by Roger Michell (PG-13, 105 minutes). The most romantic notion
here may be that a Hollywood star as famous as Ms. Roberts might be
out, unassisted, browsing for a book. But it's enough to bring her
together with Grant's bashful bookseller and let two
extraordinarily charming actors play out an intelligent flirtation.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Richard Curtis with frequent wit and welcome
echoes of his ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' this is a bright,
winsome romantic comedy that's as teasing as the characters
themselves, inviting the audience to ponder the movie star's
burdens of being world famous and desperately attractive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE RED VIOLIN,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   As it makes its way from Vienna to England to China, the
instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly photographed
historical tableaux. If the movie's narrative energy is undermined
by a plodding screenplay and wooden acting, the music, composed by
John Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and the London
Philharmonia Orchestra, is sublime (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT,' with the voices of Trey
Parker, Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman. Directed by Parker (R, 88
minutes). The movie spinoff from the outrageous Comedy Central
cartoon series following the adventures of some potty-mouthed
third-grade boys in the Colorado town of South Park is extremely
funny and jubilantly obscene, with several sewers' worth of
bathroom humor.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy
of a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and
gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect
of children being exposed to dirty language and sexual
explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie
filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents
raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled
affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in
an appearance. Contributing to the madness are 15 clever songs
spoofing everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein to ``Les
Miserables'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SUMMER OF SAM,' starring John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody and Mira
Sorvino. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 145 minutes). This raw,
enthralling evocation of a Bronx neighborhood gone mad in 1977
plunges its audience headlong into a pre-AIDS libidinous frenzy. It
also summons an atmosphere of macho posturing and mounting
prejudice reminiscent of ``Do the Right Thing'' a decade ago,
though the locals this time are white Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The killing spree of David Berkowitz is used as a catalyst,
joining disco, punk, drugs, a heat wave and the Yankees to summon
the crazed spirit of that time. The characters are thin, but a fine
cast brings them to life. Leguizamo (in high ``Saturday Night
Fever'' style) and Brody (with hair in spikes) are outstanding as
the film's two most visible signs of the times (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   While the human stars here are indeed reduced to playing action
figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of
crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in Lucas is
given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier and
scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TARZAN,' with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Rosie
O'Donnell and Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris
Buck (G, 88 minutes). No need to wonder how this animated Tarzan
movie could improve on the 47 others that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Disney animation turns the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk,
lets the apes talk to him and whooshes through lush jungle settings
with exultant agility. This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in
ways that are hard to resist, with lively vocal performances,
excitingly kinetic animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in
the background. Parents will stay awake, and children will be
charmed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WILD WILD WEST,' starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth
Branagh and Salma Hayek. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG, 107
minutes). Another big, lavish movie with no there there. This
post-Civil War James Bondish contraption-happy sci-fi film is hard
to categorize, a quality not to be confused with originality.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Sonnenfeld without the deadpan-alien sensibility
that worked for ``Men in Black,'' this stylistic grab bag is
similarly kinky but a lot more chaotic, however heroically Smith,
as a newly hunky and debonair action hero, tries to save the day.
Good-looking but dopey, with an emphasis on toylike but vaguely
ghoulish special effects. A movie with that much potential kiddie
appeal didn't have to start in a bordello, either (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WINSLOW BOY,' starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon and
Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G, 110
minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial
that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its
essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   Played with unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous
cast, it works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the
family of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the
consequences of that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography
is beautifully lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch
acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist
character a sharp edge (Maslin). &QL;

   Film Series &QL;

</P>
<P>
   `UNIVERSAL SIRK.' After he left Nazi Germany in 1937 and finally
re-established himself as a filmmaker in Hollywood, Douglas Sirk
(1900-1987) became known for lavish and commercially successful
Technicolor melodramas of the 1950s whose cars, costumes and
flowers seemed superficially to fulfill a vision of the American
Dream. But in the decades that followed, film theorists began to
discern in Sirk's mainstream films for Universal Studios a sardonic
social consciousness that commented on America in the Eisenhower
era. In a series at the Film Forum, an opportunity is at hand to
examine some of Sirk's classics.
</P>
<P>
   From Friday through Sunday, the attraction is ``Imitation of
Life'' (1959), Sirk's final Hollywood film. This remake of a 1934
hit based on a Fannie Hurst novel stars Lana Turner as an ambitious
actress, Juanita Moore as her black maid and Susan Kohner as the
maid's daughter who passes for white. The series continues through
July 22 at New York City's Film Forum. Screening schedule and
information: (212) 727-8110 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

WINE PATRIARCH TO PRODUCE PREMIUM LABEL

<P>
   UKIAH, Calif. _ Ending a forced retirement, legendary Mendocino
County winemaker John Parducci at age 81 has purchased the bankrupt
Zellerbach Winery.
</P>
<P>
   Parducci said that while the Zellerbach label will continue, he
plans to introduce his own premium line of ``John Parducci
Signature Wines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zellerbach winery, located south of Ukiah, has an annual
production capacity of 200,000 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, Zellerbach Winery, under the ownership of William
Baccala's Vintage Funding, filed for bankruptcy protection.
Parducci said Wednesday his purchase of the winery, for a price
industry sources put at $2.1 million, was approved last week by a
federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the proposed reorganization of
Vintage Funding.
</P>
<P>
   Parducci said he plans to upgrade the quality of the current
line of Zellerbach wines, while also doing custom crushing and
wine-making for private label operators. ``Making good wines is
what I know best. I'm eager to get back to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parducci has earned a national reputation for producing fine red
wines at reasonable prices. He said he intends to stick to the
winemaking basics that he first learned working at his father's
side in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large number of wine drinkers who appreciate the red
wines made by John Parducci over the years. It's almost like a cult
following,'' said Don Sebastiani, president of Sebastiani Vineyards
of Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   For Parducci, the new winery venture means a new lease on life.
Since late 1994, Parducci has mourned the loss of Parducci Wine
Cellars, a landmark Ukiah Valley winery his father founded.
</P>
<P>
   Parducci was ousted five years ago as that winery's general
manager following a celebrated struggle with Teachers Management
and Investment Corp., a Southern California investment group. In
1973, the Parducci family sold a controlling interest in the winery
to the Teachers group, but John Parducci continued on as winemaker
and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Parducci and TMI enjoyed a bountiful relationship. He
and his family ran the winery as their own, and TMI dished out big
dividends to hundreds of retired California teachers. But by the
late 1980s, TMI's big statewide real estate ventures were
collapsing. In 1994, tensions over management of the Parducci
winery, by then TMI's only profitable business, reached the boiling
point.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Parducci was locked out of a winery where he had
worked all of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Parducci Wine Cellars was purchased in 1996 by Chicago venture
capitalist Carl Thoma, and Napa Valley vintner William Hill. Thoma
has since acquired total ownership of the 350,000-case winery.
</P>
<P>
   Parducci said the new winery operation will be ready for this
fall's grape crush. ``Everything we need is already here. All we
have to do is start making some really good wines,'' he said.

roadster that Danny Panoz describes as ``perfect for bikers''
rolled off the assembly line in 1992. With an outlandish hot
rod-retro body that makes the Plymouth Prowler seem conservative
and a monster V8 from Ford for muscle, the Panoz Roadster was bound
to turn a few heads. And of course, it graced the covers of
car-buff magazines with lots of pages to fill each year. But
curiosity quickly morphed into respect, with the early reviews
ranging from encouraging to ecstatic. Car and Driver has called it

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a contemporary rhythm-and-blues show, where
backup tapes and the faithful replication of studio singles are
usually de rigueur, Whitney Houston's two-hour performance at the
Theater at Madison Square Garden was remarkably unscripted. Nearly
every song was rearranged live, with the band waiting for Ms.
Houston as she isolated a line and made it a wailing crescendo or
paused mid-song to talk with fans. When guest stars like Brandy and
Luther Vandross joined Ms. Houston on ``Exhale (Shoop Shoop),''
they didn't emerge from the wings: they were called from their
seats in the audience and sang with Ms. Houston from the foot of
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   This was the new Ms. Houston, a 35-year-old mother whose sleek,
sophisticated recent album, ``My Love Is Your Love'' _ her first
nonsoundtrack album in eight years _ is as rooted in the trends of
today (staggered hip-hop beats and silky-smooth multitrack harmony
singing) as her 1987 album, ``Whitney,'' was in the aerobic pop of
its time. She is also a woman who in public appearances often seems
unnaturally placid and disconnected, as if surrounded by walls of
glass. As she performed on Wednesday, in the first of two
performances at the theater as part of her first tour in four years
(the other show was Thursday night), the glass became ice and
slowly melted.
</P>
<P>
   Though she canceled several concerts this month because of vocal
problems, Ms. Houston's voice was impeccable throughout Wednesday's
show. She is easily one of the best pop singers of her time, yet
none of her hit-heavy albums have weathered well enough to rank
among the era's best. As if aware that her voice often outclasses
her material, she tended to slow down and stretch out her hits so
she could pull surprises _ melismas, crescendos, groans,
octave-jumping wails, funny voices _ from her bottomless bag of
diva vocal tricks.
</P>
<P>
   She had more eccentric mannerisms than a talk-show host. Often
she seemed to be deliberately lingering vocally as the band tried
to push her forward through the set. Perhaps as a result of time
constraints, the hits at the end of the show, particularly ``I Will
Always Love You'' and her latest break-up hit, ``It's Not Right but
It's Okay,'' were curt and abridged.
</P>
<P>
   Perspiring profusely from the first song, Ms. Houston often
walked to a table filled with towels, sprays, glasses and other
containers to freshen up. Over the course of the night, she
descended three times from a stage-set balcony (a true diva must
always descend), each time wearing a different shiny or glittering
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana outfit.
</P>
<P>
   She introduced the audience to her mother, the gospel singer
Cissy Houston; her brother and backup singer, Gary Houston (who
sang Stevie Wonder's ``Higher Ground''), and her daughter,
6-year-old Bobbi Kristina, who helped with ``My Love Is Your
Love,'' the latest Wyclef Jean song reminiscent of Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   Before performing ``In My Business,'' a plea for privacy that's
equal parts Michael Jackson's ``Scream'' and Bessie Smith singing
``Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do,'' Ms. Houston brought out her
husband, Bobby Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a tradition at Ms. Houston's and Brown's
shows, not unlike the way parents might demonstrate affection for
their children in a formal setting, she let the audience watch as
he planted one on her (a kiss, that is).
</P>
<P>
   The show also featured disco-enhanced versions of older hits
like ``How Will I Know'' and ``I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who
Loves Me)'' and a riveting gospel medley from the movie ``The
Preacher's Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Houston was at her best when taking songs from her new
record and turning them into workouts to exercise a voice that
continues to raise the standard for female rhythm-and-blues vocals
in the '80s and '90s.

KUBRICK, EDITED; MASTROIANNI ON HIMSELF; A TWO-WAY BRIDGE

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Stanley Kubrick's last film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
will be shown in the United States with several sex scenes altered
so it can carry an R rating instead of the far more restrictive
NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   An NC-17 version _ no one under 17 admitted _ will be shown
across Europe. The R version _ anyone under 17 must be accompanied
by an adult _ was made because a portion of one scene, an orgy
among masked couples in a mansion on Long Island, depicted various
sexual couplings.
</P>
<P>
   In the R version, the masked couples are visible but are partly
shielded by computer-generated figures who represent orgygoers
watching them. There are no shielded figures in the NC-17 version.
In both versions, the scenes in question last 65 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Warner Brothers has finally shown the film,
perhaps the most anticipated, or hyped, of the year , to critics
and journalists. The screenings were of the NC-17 version, although
at the end Warner showed the scenes that were altered to give the
movie its R rating.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kingsley, the publicity agent who represents Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman, the stars of the film, said both versions were shown
``because everyone wanted to see the difference.'' Ms. Kingsley
added: ``Not a frame was cut. This was Stanley's intention in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was written by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael and
inspired by ``Traumnovelle'' (``Dream Story'') by Arthur
Schnitzler. It deals with an upper-class Manhattan doctor and his
wife whose sexual fantasies and dreams lead them on a strange and
protracted odyssey. During the 18-minute orgy sequence, the Cruise
character sees masked couples engaged in sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley said Kubrick, who died in March, had expected his
film to be released with an R rating. But after showing the movie
to top Warner Brothers executives and discussing it, he realized
that an NC-17 rating was inevitable. Studios avoid releasing movies
rated NC-17 because some theater and video chains shy away from
them.
</P>
<P>
   So Kubrick decided to place the computer-generated figures _
mostly caped and hooded individuals _ in front of the couples at
three different points. The editing was completed after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he could get away with an `R,''' Ms. Kingsley said.
``Then he realized he couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Harlan, executive producer of the film and Kubrick's
brother-in-law, said no portion of the scenes was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America, which oversees
ratings for films, has consistently maintained that it views
violence in movies as seriously as sex. But film critics, taking
note of the Kubrick film, seem to think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Todd McCarthy, the film critic for Variety, wrote the other day
that watching the two versions back to back provided a vivid
insight into the workings of the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing what the MPAA considers NC-17 worthy makes the org's
nit-picking seem absurd, especially given the gruesomely graphic
violence to which it routinely applies R ratings,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the changes made to
the film ``a joke,'' and said, ``The meaning and effect of the acts
witnessed remain the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastroianni on Himself
</P>
<P>
   Anna Maria Tato was Marcello Mastroianni's companion for the
last 22 years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so different _ the differences made for the appeal,''
said Ms. Tato, who had written books about film when she first met
and interviewed the Italian star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 34,'' she said. ``He was 49. I was from the south of
Italy, very passionate. Like a bull. He was a humanist. Very
cultivated. Very kind. Always respectful. He respected women. I was
beautiful and young. And he was so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his death in 1996 at the age of 72, of pancreatic cancer,
Mastroianni reluctantly at first and then enthusiastically began to
cooperate with Ms. Tato, discussing his life while being filmed.
The result is the documentary ``Marcello Mastroianni, I Remember,''
which has opened in Italy, France, Spain and London to strong
reviews. The film will open in Manhattan on Aug. 17 at Lincoln
Plaza Cinemas and in other large cities in the week after that.
</P>
<P>
   In the documentary, Mastroianni, who was arguably the most
popular Italian male film star for three decades, gently and
affectionately describes his background (his father was a
carpenter); his working years in the theater; his recollections of
Garbo, Fellini and Visconti, and the stereotyping of him as an
irresistible Latin lover. What emerges from the film is a portrait
of a star who is both surprisingly modest and deeply intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was aware of being a star but he always tried to live a
normal life,'' Ms. Tato said. ``He always said you can never really
hide what you really are when you are on the screen. Everything of
your inside comes out on the screen. The screen reveals it. The
audience knows.''
</P>
<P>
   He made 170 films, a remarkable number for any actor. Ms. Tato
said that before she met Mastroianni, she thought he was just
another ``bourgeois'' actor. ``I felt so stupid afterwards, so
narrow-minded,'' she said. ``I criticized myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved his intelligence, the fact that he had such a sense of
irony; he was a great storyteller too,'' she said. ``He had great
qualities.'' She laughed. ``The defects I will not tell you.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Two-Way Bridge
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, directors of television shows have used the
medium as a springboard to feature films. Upon embarking on a movie
career, the television directors rarely look back.
</P>
<P>
   Not Steve Miner.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly unusual trajectory, Miner, 50, veers easily between
television and movies, focusing on both almost simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go where the work is,'' said Miner , whose newest film,
``Lake Placid,'' an offbeat comedy-thriller about a threatening
crocodile in Maine, starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda and Oliver
Platt, opens on Friday .
</P>
<P>
   The movie was written by David E. Kelley, the television
writer-producer and a longtime friend of Miner's, who has directed
episodes of Kelley's series ``Chicago Hope'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Miner's features include ``Soul Man,'' ``Forever Young,'' ``My
Father, the Hero,'' ``House,'' ``Friday the 13th, Part 2'' and
``Halloween: H20.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Television used to be a serious stigma for film actors'' Miner
said. ``You couldn't be on a television show on a weekly basis and
still be a movie star. That's completely changed now. But for
directors, it's still very difficult to go back and forth. Why? I
don't know. You either do one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``One of the problems in features now is, of course,
there's a finite number of jobs and there are thousands of
qualified directors. You have to work somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Miner unusual is that in television, he has focused
on making the pilot of a series and then not directed later
episodes. Pilots he has made include those for ``The Wonder
Years,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' and an upcoming ABC series,
``Wasteland,'' written by Kevin Williamson, who also wrote
``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a good script for a pilot, you get to set the tone
of the show, you set the look, you cast it,'' Miner said. ``You
have an impact on that show.'' There was one other advantage to
television, he said: ``A pilot takes a month and a half, it's over.
A movie takes more than a year and a big chunk out of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Miner grew up in Westport, Conn., dropped out of college to work
at a ski resort in Colorado and after seeing the 1969 comedy
``Putney Swope'' decided that he wanted to try to make movies. He
returned home to Westport and began working as an assistant on
various industrial films in New York and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Westport neighbor, Sean Cunningham, became the
producer of a horror film, ``Last House on the Left,'' which was
made in his family's backyard; Miner worked as a $15-a-week
assistant on the movie. The film, made in 1973, was the directing
debut of Wes Craven, now one of Hollywood's foremost horror
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Miner and Cunningham began producing low budget horror
films. The unexpected success of ``Friday the 13th,'' which was
financed by some Boston theater exhibitors, led them to ask Miner
to produce the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'll produce it if you let me direct it,''' Miner
said. ``I don't think they understood the difference between a
producer and director. They said, `OK'''
</P>
<P>
   Miner moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s but couldn't get a
job in films. He met the writing team Carol Black and Neal Marlens;
they asked him to direct the pilot episode of ``The Wonder Years.''
The success of that show led to Miner's Hollywood film career.
</P>
<P>
   He is now completing a film in Calgary, Alberta. Called ``Texas
Ranger,'' it is an action movie starring, among others, Dylan
McDermott (``The Practice'') and James Van Der Beek (``Dawson's
Creek''). Miner has worked with both on their television shows.
</P>
<P>
   The director said that upon completing that film, he hopes to
return to television and take on another pilot episode. Does he
know which one?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a clue,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the many unsettling images to be seen in the New
York Video Festival, a weeklong series that begins Friday at the
Walter Reade Theater, none is more provocative than the actress
Kate Valk as the title character in the Wooster Group's production
of Eugene O'Neill's play ``The Emperor Jones.'' Wearing blackface
and a Kabuki costume, rolling her eyes and writhing before the
camera like a voodoo apparition in Asian theatrical drag, the
Caucasian actress adopts a cartoonishly oratorical drawl to intone
the character's ravingly paranoid dialogue. Layer upon layer of
calculated artifice combine to create a clashing theatrical
dissonance that is further complicated by the raw emotional power
erupting behind these multiple facades.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-minute work will be shown Friday evening at 9 at the
Video Festival, part of Lincoln Center Festival '99. It will be
followed by a panel discussion with Ms. Valk, the Wooster Group
director Elizabeth LeCompte, the video maker Chris Kondek and the
film critic David Sterritt. The piece is the company's video
adaptation of its acclaimed 1998 stage production of the 1921
O'Neill play. Its central character, Brutus Jones (Ms. Valk), is an
exiled black railroad porter who proclaims himself emperor of a
West Indian island. When the inhabitants rise up in revolt, he
flees into the jungle with his evil Cockney sidekick Smithers
(Willem Dafoe).
</P>
<P>
   The group's production of ``The Emperor Jones'' last year at the
Performing Garage treated the drama as a bold extension of the
playwright's fascination with masks, using blackface and Kabuki
costume and even language itself (the exaggerated black dialect) as
theatrical masks. What is being shown this evening is not a
videotaped version of the stage production but a video
re-conception of the play with digital sets, overlapping images,
Kabuki-influenced dances and sound effects that compress the action
into something that resembles a long-form music video. The finished
work is an explosive, beat-driven, in-your-face confrontation with
the characters whose faces sometimes appear videographically gouged
out (another form of mask) to suggest horror-movie zombies. Like it
or loathe it, ``The Emperor Jones,'' once seen, is unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   With its experimental video technology and bold collisions of
theatrical style, ``The Emperor Jones'' fits right into a festival
that is unabashedly avant-garde in spirit. Many of the shorter
films are intriguing if often impenetrable collages that explore
the outer limits of video technology and quirky personal
expression.
</P>
<P>
   The closing night performance on July 22 is the elliptical
``Love Diamond,'' an extended performance piece by Miranda July and
Zac Love that mixes dialogues between characters (all performed by
Ms. July) with exchanges between technologies (video and film) to
evoke a kind of communications circuitry between humans and
machines. The work even involves some audience participation.
Although Ms. July lacks the wit and showmanship of Laurie Anderson,
who explores many of the same themes, ``Love Diamond'' belongs
squarely to the tradition of the experimental one-person
Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) that Ms. Anderson and other
technologically adventurous performance artists developed in the
1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from two other special programs, one a videographic
journey by the Russian filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, the other an
analysis of contemporary music videos chosen by the critic Armond
White, the rest of the festival is divided into nine thematic
programs exploring everything from the family (``Family Matters''),
to the relationship between people and animals (``Only Human''), to
the relationship between humans and technology (``Ghosts in the
Machine'').
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of the work this year is problematic. Although video
art is a young form, the genre has already developed its own
cliches. One of the most glaring is digital repetition, a technique
that became a musical cliche in the early years of hip-hop music.
When applied to video, it allows the artist to deconstruct a scene
by replaying it frame by frame, then painstakingly moving it
forward to illuminate its presumed (usually ominous) psychological
subtext.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the artists represented in the festival also wrongly
assume that the portability of video and its ability to visit
places larger cameras cannot go will automatically insure a certain
intimacy. In Don Bernier's video ``Zoo: A Melancholy Bestiary,''
for instance, shots of animals in captivity are introduced by
ominous alphabetically sequential one-word titles. The images of
various zoo animals meant to illustrate these negative concepts are
too bland to have any resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the festival is showcasing the work of 40
videomakers from the United States and abroad. The following are
some of the better, more substantial works.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Duncan's animated video ``The History of Glamour'' is a
gentle, very funny pseudo-documentary of the fashion world that
tells the story of Charlie Valentine, a girl from Antler, Ohio, who
moves to New York City, becomes a supermodel and eventually a
Madonna-like pop star. The film imagines a chic little society
where Chanel No. 5 is served as a cocktail in restaurants with
names like De Rigueur. One of the narrators (played by Mary Louise
Wilson doing her best Diana Vreeland impersonation) is a fashion
maven named Grace Greenberg, who runs the definitive fashion rag
Ooh La La Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kobland's ``Transit Riders of the Earth Arise! Walk Dog Eat
Donut'' is a melancholy, semi-abstract video poem made up largely
of blurred images shot from moving subway and elevated cars in New
York City and Berlin. Woven into the film are fragments of a diary
(despairing epigrams like ``all meaning evaporates'') and a Russian
ballad. Repetitive without becoming monotonous, the video evokes an
urban sadness that is so insistent it becomes a whole philosophy of
loss and resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Petit's ``Negative Space'' is a portrait of the retired
film critic and painter Manny Farber, who guides us through some of
his favorite moments in Hollywood movies. He loves pointing out
background details that would have gone unnoticed without his
observation. The one movie most alluded to is Rossellini's 1953
film ``Voyage to Italy,'' from which there are several clips.
Farber has profound things to say about the relation of American
films and the behavior of Americans in relation to the landscape,
especially to the highways and the open spaces of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Wilcha's ``Target Shoots First'' is his on-location
record of his experience working for the Columbia House record club
in New York City. Hired for an entry-level marketing job just at
the moment when Nirvana was leading an onslaught of alternative
rock, Wilcha, an avid fan and collector of the music, helped
develop a hip alternative-rock magazine for the company to send to
its subscribers. The video delicately explores corporate politics,
the concept of selling out and ageism, among other topics.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Reichardt's ``Ode'' is yet another update of the legend of
Billie Joe McAllister made famous by Bobbie Gentry's 1967 hit song
about the mystery suicide of a boy in the Mississippi Delta. This
version, filmed in Super 8 and transferred to video, roughly
follows the same course as the 1976 movie version starring Robby
Benson. But it is far more intimate and realistic. Starring Kevin
Poole and Heather Gottlieb as gropingly inarticulate working-class
teen-age sweethearts, the movie is steeped in an almost suffocating
Southern languor.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the works in the series, it could be said few if any
constitute what we think of as television. They belong to an
alternative tradition, obstinate (sometimes maddeningly so) in its
insistence on the value of the quirky, the personal and the
indirect.

COMMENTARY: THE LUMPS SHE TAKES WILL BE HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, July 22.) 
(jt) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ    
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c. 1999 The New York Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   She has wider first name identification than Cher. She's always
somewhere on the lists of most admired American women. She's been
on the cover of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   She's also been scorned, mocked, betrayed, pitied, burned in
effigy and abused by late night boy comedians.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing, then, that so many everyday women relate to
Hillary, but we do. And so, on the matter of her running for the
U.S. Senate from New York, we may be saying ``go, girl'' for
reasons only slightly connected to what she might do to improve the
life of those in Syracuse and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Were she not the first lady, her situation wouldn't be that much
different from other wives who get to a point in their lives when
it's time to figure out the second half. The babies are raised. The
husband's career is either going to fly or die, no matter whom she
invites to dinner. Now it's her turn to see what else she can do.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Hillary Rodham Clinton is typical of many women of her
generation who struggled with combining family and career, trying
to be both dutiful, according to the old ways, and independent,
according to the new, and who at middle age have this wild desire
to run for office, go to grad school or start an herb farm.
</P>
<P>
   As we embark on the millennium, Hillary's attempts to do
something very bold or very rash, depending on your point of view,
will be watched by women and more than a few men. We don't know her
motives for wanting to switch careers and enter a field that means
a giant pay cut and which will pit her against an opponent with
large canine teeth and before a press busily making mud pies. But
there are reasons to admire her for marching into the arena.
</P>
<P>
   She's uncomfortable in the role of poor wronged wife. By putting
herself out there she's saying, ``Don't pity me. Vote for me.''
That the woman has aspirations is no surprise. Nor that she seeks
power and influence. Many do. When you have power, maybe they don't
worry so much about how you wear your hair.
</P>
<P>
   She's like so many uppity women who are resented for their
confidence, exuberance and intelligence. And for challenging the
uppity men's club. Many want her to run for the Senate just because
others think she shouldn't. They think she should do something a
little more behind the scenes and gracious. We think she's been
gracious long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a picture of her in a victory photo would finally make
up for that bathing suit shot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course many of us do not live in New York and are not moved
to debate the carpetbagger issue or worry about gridlock in
Westchester County. Those are New York's problems and New Yorkers
will be the ones who ultimately decide if it's a good idea for her
to run. I talked to a Westchester Democrat who said her objection
to Hillary is that she's become disillusioned with both Hillary and
her husband and she wishes her state could have come up with a
local candidate. But, she said, ``I think it's neat that she's the
first first lady to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why, given the choice of New York or
Arkansas to go home to on Fridays, there'd be no choice for
Hillary. New York has better museums and restaurants, and they were
never very nice to her in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   If she becomes a senator, she won't be able to make any outside
money, no astronomical lecture fees. He'll have to work to pay off
the legal bills, which seems only fair since she had to dip into
her money to pay on his Paula Jones account.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people are still pretty mad at her husband. We'd like
her to run just to say, ``It's not my fault he was a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were us, we might rather run to a beach far away and sit
on the sand and think about it for a year. But if it were us, we
would have thrown his bags and his stupid copy of ``Leaves of
Grass'' into the driveway and moved to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to see what Hillary the politician can
do when she's not in her husband's shadow or under his black cloud.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a welcome opportunity to ask for her thoughts
on issues like welfare and dealing with crime and improving the
schools. Could we get back to the subject of universal health care?
</P>
<P>
   People complain, ``Why does she want to bring all that muck up
again?'' But it's not her muck and it's not her choice to bring it
up again.
</P>
<P>
   It's her choice and her right to run for public office. She's
already proven she cares about her country. If she didn't, the bags
would have been in the driveway, the president would be trying to
find a saxophone gig and the stock market would not be a happy
place.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed. Now she can run.
</P>
<P>
   And if she does and she loses, then she can consider her other
options. Become an ambassador. A university lecturer. A foundation
head. Or the herb farm.

INVESTORS BUY UP $1.6 BILLION OF CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Municipal bond investors stole center stage in bond
trading Thursday as they quickly bought up $1.6 billion of
tax-exempt bonds backed by toll revenue from a Southern California
highway.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest tax-free bond offering this year, underwriters
led by Salomon Smith Barney handled the sale by Foothill/Eastern
Transportation Agency and had good demand from institutional
buyers, including mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The sale included $831.3 million of straight interest-bearing
bonds as well as the more scarce zero coupon bonds, which provide
no income in the interim but pay out all of the tax-exempt interest
in a lump sum at maturity. Some bonds are rated triple-A because
the interest and principal are insured, while uninsured portions
are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by Standard &AMP;
Poor's Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Market participants said the straight bonds were tentatively
priced to yield 4.55 percent for an issue due in 2004 and to yield
5.25 percent for one due in 2016. A bond due in 2019 was priced to
yield 5.35 percent and the longest, due in 2040, was priced to
yield 5.80 percent. The zero coupon bonds were priced to yield from
5.85 percent to 6.125 percent, with maturities ranging from 2020 to
2038.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue priced Thursday was the $138 million offering of
general obligations bonds by Nassau County, N.Y. The county,
recently stung by several cuts in its bond rating by both Moody's
and S&AMP;P, bought insurance that gave the bonds a triple-A rating.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber won the issue in competitive bidding and resold the
bonds at prices to yield 4.30 percent for an issue due 2003, and
5.35 percent in 2019.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury securities were little changed after a report that the
Consumer Price Index was unchanged in June for the second
consecutive month, indicating tame inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The yield of the benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged at 5.91
percent while its price, which moves in the opposite direction,
fell 1/32, to 90 25/32.

`THE VELOCITY OF GARY: HUNKY EROTICS IN A STEAMY (MANHATTAN)
NEVER-NEVER LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the handsome, blond title character of ``The Velocity of
Gary (Not His Real Name)'' is first glimpsed in the film, he is
sashaying bare-chested through the streets of Greenwich Village
flirting shamelessly with everyone who catches his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Before long this smirking midnight cowboy (Thomas Jane) winds up
in the vicinity of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, where he
rescues a drag queen fresh off the bus who has just been beaten up
by some gay-bashing teen-agers. He literally picks her up out of
the gutter, slings her over his shoulder and strides off into the
sunset.
</P>
<P>
   These opening scenes set the panting, febrile tone of a movie
that romanticizes Gary and his world of all-night doughnut shops
and phone-sex office work to the nth degree. The bulk of the movie,
which opens Friday, focuses on Gary's relationships with Valentino
(Vincent D'Onofrio), a shaggy-haired bisexual porn star who falls
in love with him, and Mary Carmen (Salma Hayek), Valentino's
clinging, hysterical sex fiend of a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie, directed by Dan Ireland from a screenplay by
James Still, is set in New York City, its real location is an
erotically overheated never-never land where everyone stands around
drooling enviously at the two hunks who have found each other. The
camera can't resist zooming in for extended, extreme close-ups of
their entwining tongues.
</P>
<P>
   The story takes a dark turn when Valentino collapses on the
street and AIDS is diagnosed (although the word AIDS is never
actually mentioned). There are many interminable scenes of Gary,
Valentino and Mary Carmen squabbling in hospital rooms and in the
seedy apartment they share. But Still's dialogue is so hopelessly
ham-handed and stagy that nothing they shout at each other sounds
especially real.
</P>
<P>
   At least ``The Velocity of Gary'' isn't afraid to be
pretentious. As Valentino slowly expires, what book should his
friends be reading out loud to him? Why, of course, the same book
we would all wish to have read to us on our deathbeds: Bram
Stoker's ``Dracula''! It's a metaphor, you see, for these
demimondaines' insatiable appetites. &QL;

`AFTER THE FAIR': MUSICAL ROMANCE WITH A DIRGE IN ITS HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(yn) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the strange doings of Stephen Sondheim and
James Lapine's ``Passion,'' no romance could be too eccentric for
the musical theater, and certainly not that in ``After the Fair,''
a chamber musical adapted from a Thomas Hardy short story about a
frustrated Englishwoman who plays Cyrano de Bergerac to an
illiterate serving girl and the educated man they both love.
</P>
<P>
   This joyless little tale, with book and lyrics by Stephen Cole
and music by Matthew Ward, might have provided a few piquant
moments. But the authors and the director, Travis L. Stockley, are
in no mood for levity. The stunted emotional scale of ``After the
Fair'' starts at mournful and rises in solemn increments to
something like clinical sobriety. Even from a writer as morose as
Hardy, this is a show that might be well advised to start a regimen
of antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Though the musical, which opened Thursday night at the Theater
at St. Peter's Church, is new to New York, it can't actually be
called new, having been staged many times in workshops and regional
theaters since 1988. The professional sheen is unmistakable. But
perhaps its creators have fretted too much over the project,
because ``After the Fair'' has had all the life squeezed out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The chief attraction of the production, presented by the York
Theater Company, is Michele Pawk, whose Fraulein Kost, a prostitute
in Fraulein Schneider's rooming house, was one of the glories of
Sam Mendes' Tony-winning revival of ``Cabaret.'' If one were to
pick Fraulein Kost's polar opposite, it would be the character she
plays, Edith Harnham, the prim and corseted lady of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Edith is a repressed country gentlewoman of late Victorian
England, unhappily married to a mumbling bore named Arthur (David
Staller). Her housemaid Anna (Jennifer Piech), ambitious if
unschooled, sets her sights on Charles (James Ludwig), a young
barrister she meets at the local fair. Smitten, Charles asks Anna
to write to him in London. Anna enlists the lonely Edith to be her
epistolary proxy, and an ill-starred love triangle is forged.
</P>
<P>
   One could imagine a score of some charm to leaven the deception;
Cole and Ward have a more prosaic plan. Their songs, a series of
breathlessly earnest ballads, can be pretty but linger in the
memory about as long as a spritz of room deodorizer. The
sensibility lies somewhere on the spectrum between ``The
Fantasticks'' and ``I Do! I Do!'' The two best numbers, ``Between
the Lines'' and ``There's a Woman/What is Real,'' have some oomph,
although one has to tiptoe through a lot of buttercups to get to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Stockley offers his actors little help. Ms. Pawk maintains
unassailable diction and a constant look of contained panic. If she
were any more bottled up, she would require the Heimlich maneuver.
Ms. Piech, who played one of the trio of Kates in the musical
``Titanic,'' garners sympathy chiefly because the story is stacked
so heavily against Anna. The men are just sort of drippy. One
consolation: the lavish period costumes by Michael Bottari and
Ronald Case.

<P>
   ISLAMSHAHR, Iran _ For the young men on the streets of this
dusty, crowded, unexceptional town south of Tehran, the nationwide
unrest of the past week is little more than a remote spectacle on
the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the students at Tehran University whose demonstrations a
week ago set off violent riots, these young men seem ill-informed
about the closure of a newspaper and a harsh new press law passed
by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the pro-government marchers who took to the streets
to praise the purity of the Islamic system and rail against the
United States at rallies throughout Iran on Wednesday, these young
men stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   In their own way, these men are just as disaffected from the
conservative Islamic religious government that runs their country
as the students in Tehran. They share the same desires for personal
freedoms. It is just that, here, priorities are different. The men
of Islamshahr want jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At an open area with a long line of public telephones, dozens of
young men compete to sell telephone cards for tiny profits as they
complain about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all of us,'' said one young man in his 20s, pointing
to his friends. ``We're all jobless. We have nothing to do. We try
to do a little bit of business here and there, and they arrest us
as hooligans. That's why there are so many drug addicts here. It's
the despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked his opinion of the events of the last week, he paused.
``Don't say anything! Don't say anything!'' one of his friends
warned. ``It's too dangerous,'' said another. ``There are
informants in our midst.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be another reason for the reluctance to discuss the
demonstrations and the crackdown of the past week. The residents of
Islamshahr have seen it all before: in 1995, they had their own
violent confrontation with authority.
</P>
<P>
   Once a small village that was a center for nearby cattle, sheep
and crop farmers, Islamshahr's population soared to 250,000 as
peasants fled the countryside in search of work in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, gasoline prices soared and bus fares doubled.
Early one morning, workers from a nearby shantytown revolted. They
marched to the bigger town of Islamshahr, picking up jobless
supporters, smashing storefront windows and setting fire to banks,
gas stations and government buildings along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the latest riots, in which security forces and their
vigilante surrogates used tear gas and riot sticks to quell the
crowds, the 1995 violence turned deadly when policemen in
Islamshahr opened fire on the swelling crowds. Several people were
killed. By nightfall, the riots were over.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, thousands of demonstrators were bused into town to
march in praise of the government. The families of the dead had to
compensate the police for the spent bullets. Public mourning was
prohibited. An official death toll was never released.
</P>
<P>
   The revolt of Islamshahr was over. In some ways, it was a
small-scale dress rehearsal for the recent unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning a lot of people were happy with the
demonstrations in Tehran,'' said one 23-year-old unemployed driver
and father of three. ``But they went nowhere. They couldn't. The
same thing already happened here. There was a riot. There was a
crackdown. People got killed. Now people keep quiet. Life is
miserable. The only freedom I have is to come to the park with my
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Islamshahr is a town in transition. After the 1995 revolt, the
central government in Tehran poured millions of dollars into the
town in large part to staunch dissent. Concrete shacks were
replaced by apartment blocks featuring electricity and running
water. Murals of flowers and landscapes were painted on walls.
</P>
<P>
   Building codes that were abandoned after the revolution to
provide cheap housing for the poor were strictly enforced. Acres of
cattle farms were razed to make way for flower-filled parks and to
eliminate the powerful smell of cattle dung so close to town. The
vast migration of villagers that had swelled the town's population
for two decades was abruptly ended.
</P>
<P>
   Islamshahr now boasts new roads, new monuments, a conference
hall, a cultural center, an amusement park, a university for 500
students and an air-conditioned movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   At the glittery Fajr movie theater, dedicated by President
Mohammad Khatami last year, schoolchildren and teen-agers on their
summer vacations sipped soft drinks as they watched Iran's hottest
film, ``Two Women,'' by the feminist filmmaker Tahmineh Milani.
There is a discount for everyone, the theater manager says, because
Islamshahr is ``a deprived area.''
</P>
<P>
   The film contrasts the life of a successful career woman with
her troubled college friend, who must deal with a cruel father, a
deranged stalker who is in love with her and a loveless marriage.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the film, the stalker stabs the husband to death.
Suddenly, the wife can make her own decisions. Even though she
feels like ``a free bird with no wings to fly,'' she talks about
starting over. ``I have to go to computer class,'' she says. ``I
have to learn to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience claps and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   But the construction of a movie theater and other developments
haven't solved the town's unemployment problem. The construction
companies in town prefer to hire Afghan refugees, who work long
hours, receive no benefits, earn little pay and make no complaints.
At a makeshift bus station leading to Tehran, hundreds of young
workers sit and wait for day jobs that often do not come.

</P>
<P>
   At the municipality headquarters, which is undergoing extensive
renovation, Buike Moussavi, Islamshahr's governor, insists that
unemployment is not a problem. ``We have so many factories and
workshops in Islamshahr,'' he said. ``We have workers, bakers,
university professors. The land is fertile here. We are growing
everything: barley, wheat, corn, vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Moussavi said he is distressed that the town has not shaken its
reputation for unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say Islamshahr, people always think that our protests
are very high,'' he said. ``But we have the highest participation
of any municipality in Friday prayers every week. People shouldn't
be judged by their history. The crisis of four years ago was
sparked by something superficial. It's not that the people are
carrying a grudge in their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Moussavi said that the municipality did not organize its own
march in support of the government on Wednesday and that those who
wanted to march made the one-hour drive to Tehran. ``If we had had
a rally yesterday, it would have been the biggest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moussavi does not say much about the town's youth.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that 65 percent of Iran's population is under
the age of 25 and Iran's clerical leaders fear that they are losing
_ or have already lost _ the generation that has come of age since
the the revolution. Many of them have no particular love or hatred
for the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi or even for Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the cleric who led the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Universities are so crowded that only one in 10 applicants get
in. With jobs scarce, young people must defer marriage because they
cannot afford a proper wedding and a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Despite episodic easing of some restrictions, socializing with
members of the opposite sex, holding hands in public, listening to
certain kinds of music, watching foreign television and of course,
drinking alcohol, are forbidden. The official number of drug
addicts in Iran is almost 2 million, although unofficial figures
are much higher, particularly among the young.
</P>
<P>
   On one street corner in Islamshahr, a soldier in civilian
clothes, a musician in jeans and a slicked-back puffy hairdo, and a
paramilitary Islamic volunteer turned drug addict offered a chorus
of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just exist. I make enough to get food and shelter,'' said
the musician. ``I can't play my music except secretly. How could I
ever get enough money to get married? You'll always find me here,
on this corner. I wouldn't dare go to the park over there because
everyone is addicted. They're all shooting heroin. As for politics,
I'm like a turtle who keeps my head inside my shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the soldier, ``They were students in Tehran, university
students who started these things. They know more than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the turn of the Islamic volunteer with the sallow
complexion and yellow in his eyes. ``Can I talk?'' he asked. ``I
fought forty months in the war against Iraq. When I came back the
regime abandoned me. Let me tell you who goes to the rallies like
the one yesterday. I know because I used to be in them. They are a
group who gets paid for going. The youth are becoming drug addicts.
We have no freedom, no jobs, nowhere to go and have fun. So we are

LIKE IT OR LOATHE IT, `EYES WIDE SHUT' IS CLASSIC KUBRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each of the six films the late Stanley Kubrick made during the
last 30 years of his life has gone through a similar metamorphosis:
</P>
<P>
   1. Each was conceived and shot over a great length of time under
conditions of fetish-like secrecy, giving rise to impossibly high
expectations and scores of false rumors about its nature and
content.
</P>
<P>
   2. When each was finally released, it went against genre
expectation, defied logic, and was greeted with mixed reviews _
including some which strongly argued that it was, in fact, a
spectacularly bad movie.
</P>
<P>
   3. Over time, each displayed remarkable ``legs,'' both
critically and at the box office, inspiring repeated viewings and
critical reappraisals, until it was finally accepted as a
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the master's 13th and final film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' is
right on schedule with the fulfillment of steps one and two. After
years of rumors and retakes, its opening on Friday is likely to be
considered a major disappointment by most of the movie world.
</P>
<P>
   As a sexual thriller, it's so stylized and tame that it almost
seems silly. As a relationship drama, it seems empty, drawn-out and
often sophomoric. As a star vehicle for Hollywood's power couple _
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman _ it's surprisingly lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I refuse to rule out the possibility the film will _
like its six immediate predecessors _ eventually move on to step
three. Because, whatever it is, it's totally Kubrickian: Its scenes
have both an edge and an extraordinary visual perfection that could
come from no other filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Based (rather closely) on a segment of a
turn-of-the-last-century novel by Arthur Schnitzler and
transplanted to a backlot version of New York City, it's about a
crisis in the marriage of a handsome young Park Avenue doctor
(Cruise) and his trophy wife (Kidman).
</P>
<P>
   One night, after attending a classy party at the home of a
friend (Sydney Pollack), they have a spat in which she confesses
that she was once, while in his company, wildly attracted to
another man _ an attraction that, though unconsummated, was one of
the most intense experiences of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Profoundly shocked at the notion that the mother of his child
could actually be attracted to another man, the young doctor heads
out into the night and has a series of bizarre experiences that
eventually lead him to crashing a masked orgy at a Long Island
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   But before anything sexually happens to him, his uninvited
presence is discovered, and he barely gets out alive. The rest of
the movie has him targeted by the vengeful libertines, in doubt
about what exactly happened and why, and struggling with guilt,
disillusionment and aberrant sexual impulses.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like the prescription for a ``hot'' movie, forget
about it. There's some nudity and teasing here and there, but
nothing close to a real sex scene. Indeed, always the most
controlled, emotionless and clinical of directors, Kubrick probably
couldn't manage a truly erotic scene if his life depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the dramatic premise _ a man surprised that his wife
has sexual fantasies, a couple coming unglued by the notion that
they could feel attractions for other people _ seems so impossibly
dated that it's hard to believe Kubrick wants us to take it
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   As a star vehicle, it scores a few points, but Kubrick has a way
of constraining _ even depersonalizing _ his stars (while,
ironically, encouraging broad performances from his supporting
players). Thus, Cruise and Kidman mostly seem flat, stereotypical,
as characterless at Hal, the computer of ``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   (In his recently published memoir about the filming of ``Eyes
Wide Shut,'' the film's co-screenwriter, Frederic Raphael, notes
Kubrick has an ``almost solipsistic interest in character.'' His
films ``are `about' situations, never about people.'')
</P>
<P>
   Though he tries to be a bit more straightforward than usual with
a climax scene that clears up some of the mystery, the film is also
incorrigibly enigmatic, with deliberate story holes left open to
confuse us and leave us hanging in the end.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ... and yet, while some scenes seem to go on forever and
other scenes seem meaningless, they're never boring. Kubrick's
mastery of light, depth and composition _ plus his legendary
perfectionism _ give his work here a visual elegance as distinctive
as a Vermeer painting, and every bit as thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or hate it, there's not a single moment in this
two-hour, 32-minute film in which we don't feel we're in the hands
of one of the cinema's great virtuoso directors, indeed, completely
in his world. Frustrated and puzzled, maybe, but also privileged.
</P>
<P>
   As Kubrick's last film, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' also deserves a
special respect as the capper of one of the most remarkable careers
in the annals of film. No American director ever manipulated the
Hollywood system so effectively to make such daring, personal,
important films. Probably no one ever will again.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes Wide Shut. Directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick.
Screenplay by Kubrick and Frederic Raphael. Cast: Tom Cruise,
Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack. Warner Bros. 152 minutes. Rated R
for nudity and sexual references.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

SUM TOTAL OF `BLAIR WITCH PROJECT' IS RATHER SCARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's such a low-low-budget endeavor that ``The Blair Witch
Project'' is bound to disappoint some of the expectations aroused
by its tremendous pre-release buzz. But it's still a clever little
ghost story that generates some authentic chills.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a ``mockumentary'' about a trio of young filmmakers
who have disappeared off the face of the Earth while on an
expedition in the Maryland woods to make a documentary about a
local witch legend. One year later, an opening title card tells us,
their cameras were found.
</P>
<P>
   So what we supposedly see is their film _ their personal account
of the ill-fated quest _ starting with a lengthy sequence in which
they set out on the journey (with an ample supply of liquor and
attitude) and interview some of the locals.
</P>
<P>
   As they trek deeper into the woods where several mysterious
disappearances and murders have taken place over the years, they
gradually get lost, then someone or something seems to be following
them, then one of their number disappears, and then ... well, you
know how it ends.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned that this is not an easy movie to follow. In fact,
it's not a movie at all _ it's a video (with a few sequences of
16mm thrown in), and a significant portion of it is about as much
fun and as dramatically compelling as your neighbors' trip to
Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   For what seems about half the movie, the video camera is pointed
at the ground, and we have to stare at a shaky blur of images that
mean nothing. I found this so dizzying and headache-inducing that I
finally had to shut my eyes for long passages of time.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the characters are not a bit appealing, the actors
who play them are lackluster at best, and the performances are
thoroughly pretentious _ like what you tend to find in the
least-accomplished student films. (And, technically, ``Blair
Witch'' is very much a student film).
</P>
<P>
   Still, as amateurish and fumbling as it is in every department,
the sum total of the movie is pretty darn scary. We leave it
feeling strangely unsettled in a way we almost never do after one
of Hollywood's $100 million, special-effects-heavy fright fests.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing they couldn't come up with anything visual that hadn't
been done a thousand times before, the young filmmakers opted to
not show any explicit horror.
</P>
<P>
   The film merely suggests some eerie possibilities, and then lets
the audience scare itself with its own imagination. It's an old and
simple idea, but in this era of effects-overkill and total visual
saturation, it seems original, even brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   The Blair Witch Project. Directed, written and edited by Daniel
Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams
and Joshua Leonard. Artisan Entertainment. 87 minutes. Rated R for
language and horror-movie situations.

`LAKE PLACID' NOT TERRIBLE, JUST TERRIBLY MEDIOCRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most Hollywood movies these days, ``Lake Placid'' tries to
be more than just one thing. It's a comedy, a romantic star
vehicle, a thriller, a horror movie and a quasi-environmental
parable that's calculated to appeal to all demographic groups.

   Also, like most Hollywood movies these days, it's not enough of
any one of these things to be particularly engaging. It's not
terrible, just terribly mediocre. You leave the theater not so much
irritated or offended as feeling you've wasted your time.
</P>
<P>
   The action is set on a remote Maine lake that's being victimized
by some giant water creature that, in the opening teaser, bites a
police scuba diver in half. (Yes, the title is ironic.)
</P>
<P>
   In no time, an investigating task force is formed and includes a
high-strung New York museum paleontologist (Bridget Fonda), a smug
fish and game warden (Bill Pullman) and an eccentric mythology
professor (Oliver Platt) who is fascinated by crocodiles.
</P>
<P>
   The team quickly determines that the culprit is, indeed, a
crocodile _ a gigantic, 30-foot, Guinness Book of World Records
crocodile that somehow ended up in a place where his species does
not exist.
</P>
<P>
   As this unlikely group does battle with the leviathan and the
movie turns into a goofy version of ``Jaws,'' both Platt and
Brendan Gleeson (as a small-town sheriff) have their moments, and
effects whiz Stan Winston's animatronic crocodile is quite
convincing.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, the film is acted and directed (by Steve
Miner) with no special flair or inspired B-movie campiness, and it
produces what must be the worst star chemistry of any movie so far
in 1999. Individually and as a couple, Fonda and Pullman could not
be less ingratiating.
</P>
<P>
   As a comedy, the movie also is agonizingly flat. A few nervous
laughs are generated here and there, but most of the character
shtick consistently misses, especially several offensive scenes
with Betty White as a foul-mouth senior citizen who lives as a
hermit on the edge of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   As a horror-thriller, it also has its moments, but it's all
formula _ overworked visual cliches that have no impact anymore.
(``Placid'' also has the misfortune of being released on the same
day as ``The Blair Witch Project,'' which for all its fumbling
amateurishness, is original and scary.)
</P>
<P>
   The script was written by David E. Kelley (who also
co-produced), which is surprising and disappointing, given his
status as the reigning genius of network television (he's the
creator of ``Chicago Hope,'' ``Picket Fences,'' ``The Practice''
and ``Ally McBeal'').
</P>
<P>
   Like his first, dreadful movie script for ``Mystery, Alaska''
(which was screened for critics months ago and keeps getting kicked
down Disney's release schedule), this one is poorly conceived and
thought out and derivative of a dozen better movies.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid. Directed by Steve Miner. Written by David E.
Kelley. Cast: Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Betty
White. 82 minutes. Rated R for horror violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C

 `THE WOOD' IS A COMIC, AFFECTIONATE GLIMPSE OF THE '80s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' refers to Inglewood, Calif., a smoggy middle-class
suburb of Los Angeles. It's here 14-year-old Mike (Sean Nelson)
moves from North Carolina with his family in 1986, and where he
meets the two boys who will become his friends for life.
</P>
<P>
   Slim (Duane Finley) and Roland (Trent Cameron) welcome Mike into
their tight team because, if anything, he's more innocently
wide-eyed and clumsy than they are.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years pass, all three grow closer and ruminate
together over everything from girls and the mysteries of sex to
their futures. They ward off gangs and guns and concentrate on
school and what to do with life after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is relayed through humorous flashback some 13 years
later. It's a big day for Roland (Taye Diggs), who is about to be
married to his sweetheart, Lisa (Lisaraye). The boys are finally
men and soon will be breaking apart and moving in different
directions with their lives, though Mike (Omar Epps) and Slim
(Richard T. Jones) are having second thoughts about Roland's
maturity level.
</P>
<P>
   It's three hours to the wedding and Roland's gone AWOL. Lisa is
upset and wants to call off the wedding. It's up to Mike and Slim
to find their best friend, reel him in and get him to the ceremony
on time.
</P>
<P>
   They share what ostensibly will be their last big adventure
together as they carom through the day, with Mike acting as
narrator and guide through episodes from their youth.
</P>
<P>
   Director and writer Rick Famuyiwa wanted to depict some of his
rites of passage and also has pushed hard to change the way young
black men are portrayed in movies. ```The Wood' represents a shift
in the marketplace toward new representation of African American
life,'' he says in the film's press notes.
</P>
<P>
   He's done exactly what he set out to do. His film is a comic,
loving, affectionate glimpse of the '80s, its music and fashions,
and most of all at that hard-to-find thing called true friendship.
These guys are absolutely devoted to each other and a way of life
that is fading into memory. But while big-name actors Diggs, Epps
and Jones receive top billing, the film really belongs to their
boyhood incarnations _ Nelson, Finley and Cameron _ who, in their
awkwardness and naivete take a rose-colored, sentimental premise
that we've seen many times before and make it seem much fresher and
funnier than it is.
</P>
<P>
   The Wood. Directed and written by Rick Famuyiwa. Cast: Taye
Diggs, Omar Epps, Richard T. Jones, Sean Nelson. Paramount. 106
minutes. Rated R for language, sex, nudity.

CHRISTIAN PILGRIMS, IN HOLY LAND, ATONE FOR CRUSADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Holy Land has not always been the most forgiving
place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that didn't stop some 500 Christians from America and
Europe from making a pilgrimage here Thursday to seek forgiveness
for the Christian crusades of the Middle Ages, which 900 years ago
led to the slaughter of thousands of innocent Jewish and Muslim
people.
</P>
<P>
   It is a kind of package-tour penance. And even though the
pilgrims were met with genuine warmth and appreciation by Jewish
and Muslim leaders, the endeavor also stirred some profound
questions about the nature _ and the limits _ of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You arrive better late than never, as we say,'' said Israel's
Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau, calling the crusades ``one of the
dark periods in the history of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau welcomed the pilgrims at Jerusalem's Great Synagogue and
accepted a framed apology, as he added, ``We want to live together
in peace and friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate meeting in East Jerusalem, the grand mufti, or
chief Muslim cleric, said, ``We don't have any hard feelings toward
Christians. In fact, many of you may not realize, but we _
Palestinian Christians and Palestinian Muslims _ are one nation
living in Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   The largely Christian evangelical group undertook a
``Reconciliation Walk'' to retrace the steps of the crusader army
that descended on Jerusalem 900 years ago Thursday. It was July 15,
1099 when the Christian knights, 20,000 strong, invaded the city in
a bid to conquer the Holy Land and put the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre back under Christian dominion. They killed and tortured
tens of thousands of Jerusalem's mainly Jewish and Muslim
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The crusaders took three years to get from Europe to Jerusalem,
and the ``Reconciliation Walk'' took the same amount of time to
retrace their path, with some 2,500 people participating in various
legs of the walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever endeavored to apologize for the crusades,''
said Lynn Green, the director of the group that organizers describe
as a non-denominational, grass-roots movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian group has letters of support from the hierarchies
of the more established denominations of Lutherans, Catholics, and
Episcopalians, but they made clear that they were coming as
individuals, not church representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The good intentions of the Christian group, all clad in matching
gray and black T-shirts, were met with some reservations _ and some
stern warnings on the limits of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This evil century which we are leaving started with those evil
events of 900 years ago,'' said Lau. ``We want that those events
never happen again. Never again.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a packed crowd of pilgrims and TV cameras in the polished
marble conference room of the Great Synagogue, Rabbi Lau, said,
``Now, after the Holocaust, which is unforgettable, we have no
authorization to forgive. On behalf of six million people? How can
we?''
</P>
<P>
   Lau added that many members of his own family went ``hand in
hand to the gas chambers of Treblinka.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian clerics used the offer of reconciliation as a
time to describe the suffering they have endured during 50 years of
conflict with Israel and an occupation that, they said, has left
hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their land.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Mohammed Ismail el Jamal, of the Palestinian-controlled
town of Jericho, said, ``We thank you for this effort of
reconciliation. But we hope we don't have to wait for another 900
years for apologies for the suffering that is happening to us now.
We urge you, as followers of Jesus' message, to recognize that and
do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion underscored the ways in which forgiveness, a core
of Christian faith, is understood very differently by Judaism and
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference, many theologians say, is that Judaism and
Islam embrace a far more exacting and measurable set of terms for
repentance before offering forgiveness. Jewish and Muslim
theologians often say the reflexive forgiveness that is part of
Jesus' message in the New Testament can be dangerous, even
countenance evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is directly from the words of Jesus Christ that we must
seek forgiveness, and that is what we are doing,'' said Matthew
Hand, the originator and organizer of the walk who is involved with
Lutheran charities in Turkey. ``When you ask a Muslim or a Jew from
the Middle East about Christianity, a touchstone for them is often
the crusades. That is the lens through which they view Christian
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our effort at reconciliation is not going to save the world,
it's just a small step, really, but it is a step worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was many steps, said Melissa Kane, 20, a sophomore
at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass., who over the last three years
took part in several stages of the walk from Turkey to Jerusalem,
using her savings to make the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to me,'' she said. ``There has to be a
commitment to tearing down walls and divisions between our faiths.
I think this helps do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Norma Balusek, 66, a retired bank teller from San Marcos, Texas,
walked the same path as Jesus Christ Thursday, praying and then
hurrying to catch up with the group as they made their way to yet
another meeting, to offer a formal apology to the Greek Orthodox
Christian church.
</P>
<P>
   The winding pathways that the group traversed through the Old
City were the same streets where historical accounts say crusaders
left bodies piled high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe seeking forgiveness for what happened here is a
good, positive thing to do,'' she said, stopping to catch her
breath in the pounding heat of midday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just people,'' she said. ``Everyday folks who wanted to
let our brothers and sisters here now just how sorry we are for all
that.''

DELAY IN F-22 PRODUCTION WOULD RAISE COSTS BY BILLIONS, AIR FORCE
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ |A key House subcommittee's move to halt initial
production plans for the Lockheed Martin F-22 would delay the
program at least two years, cost taxpayers $6.5 billion and
increase the risk American pilots will face in the years ahead, Air
Force officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned that without the F-22, we will mortgage
the future of our air dominance capability while we fund the
systems that we currently have and that we think will not be as
capable as they need to be in the future,'' said Lt. Gen. Greg
Martin, principal deputy assistant secretary for Air Force
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   A House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees military
spending recommended earlier this week that the Air Force
reevaluate its plans for the $70 billion F-22 program and that $1.8
billion in the Pentagon's 2000 budget intended to produce the first
six Raptors be slashed. The committee left in $1.2 billion for
continued development.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on the subcommittee, who voted unanimously in favor of
the move, said readiness, personnel issues, and other problems
within the Air Force are not being addressed properly because the
service is putting a huge portion of its budget into production
plans for the Raptor.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he met on Thursday with several subcommittee
members, including its chairman, Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we will be able to convince people we need it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's suggestion that the program, which has
already cost taxpayers $20 billion, be delayed was a shock to many
at the Pentagon, since three other congressional panels had
approved production spending for the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishingly short-sighted and it just goes to show that
it is all about pork,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an industry analyst
with the Teal Group, a Fairfax, Va. based company that follows
aerospace programs.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's budget improved Clinton administration
proposals to order current generations aircraft, such as the Fort
Worth-made F-16 and St. Louis-made F-15, a plane that, without much
international interest, has teetered on the edge of extinction for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The full House Appropriations Committee will meet today to vote
on the subcommittee's proposed budget, including its plans for the
F-22. Members are expected to pass the measure setting up a fight
on the House floor next week.
</P>
<P>
   If approved on the House floor, the issue would be tested later
this year when members from the House and Senate meet to iron out
differences in their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Some on Capitol Hill expect the issue to die in conference,
others say it will be hard for joint panels to ignore a House floor
vote in favor of the move.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that if the delay goes through the Air Force would
have to spend $6.5 billion more on the program. About $1.2 billion
would go to upgrade two test aircraft so they could be used in more
stringent operational tests. The remainder would go to bring
contractors and suppliers back to the program once initial
production plans are rescheduled. The Air Force hopes to ultimately
buy 339 F-22s, down from earlier plans for more than 700.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Air Force also would have to consider upgrading
current aircraft to fight against more advanced aircraft expected
to be flown by enemy air forces in the early part of the next
century, including French and Russian fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 is being developed to counter lethal threats posed by
advanced surface-to-air missile systems and next-generation
fighters equipped with sophisticated missiles.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,900 of the 11,500 workers at Lockheed Martin Tactical
Aircraft Systems in Fort Worth, are assigned to the F-22 program.
That number is projected to grow to 4,000 by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth operation produces the middle part of fuselage of
the fighter. The remaining portions are to be produced at a
Lockheed plant in Marietta, Ga. and a Boeing facility in Seattle,
Wash.

A NEW APPROACH TO SEAT BELTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

346-9867.) 
(mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Early next year, some new cars will come with seat
belts that act somewhat like bungee cords, which could lower the
cost of safety-belt assemblies and improve passenger protection in
crashes that include multiple impacts.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea behind seat belts was to hold occupants
firmly, so that if the front of a car moving at 35 mph hit a brick
wall and instantly stopped, the driver or passenger would not
continue moving forward at 35 mph until striking the dashboard or
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   But if the belt is completely firm, a person can die of injuries
caused by the belt as it suddenly stops the body. Automakers used
to use a device that locked up the belt completely when the car
suddenly and forcefully decelerated, but they now incorporate a
``constant force retractor,'' a mechanical device that spreads out
the strain of deceleration by locking up the belt but then playing
out a little bit of it at the moment of peak strain. The retractor
acts like a fisherman who plays out his line to keep a hooked fish
from breaking it.
</P>
<P>
   The car, though, is faster than the fisherman; the whole crash
can take as little as 120 milliseconds, with the peak load coming
about halfway through that, at 60 milliseconds, or six-hundredths
of a second. The constant-force retractor can cut the peak load
from 50 G's _ or 50 times the force of gravity _to as little as 20
G's.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal Corp., which makes various car parts, will begin
shipping a material in August that takes a new approach. The
company will market fibers that are slightly stretchier than the
polyester now used in belts. The new material is only a bit more
elastic; the belt cannot play out too much or a person in the front
seat will be too close to a deploying air bag.
</P>
<P>
   The standard belt is about 9 feet long, counting the part that
goes over the lap and across the torso, and then up into a reel in
the car's center pillar or in the seat. The new material, which the
company calls Securus, will allow the torso to move forward about
9.2 inches in a severe crash, compared with 7.2 inches for a
standard system with a constant-force retractor.
</P>
<P>
   Such a retractor kicks in at 1,000 to 1,200 pounds of pressure
on the belt, said Gregory Rogowski, marketing manager for the new
product, which begins to stretch at about 400 pounds, he said.
Standard belts made of polyester can withstand 6,000 pounds _ a
level of force far beyond what the human torso can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Rogowski said that seat-belt assemblies using the stretchy fiber
would cost $10 to $15 less than those with constant-force
retractors, but that the belts would have a safety benefit as well.
The constant force retractor works only once, but in a
multiple-impact crash the stretchy belt would repeatedly help to
protect its wearer.
</P>
<P>
   Rogowski predicted that automakers would use Securus first in
back seats, because the regulations governing those belts are less
strict and government approval would be likely to come faster. And
because of consumer interest, he said, automakers are paying more
attention to rear-seat safety, especially in minivans.
</P>
<P>
   The new belts will show up around the middle of the 2000 model
year, he said, meaning in March or April.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous Conversations
</P>
<P>
   Accident data gathered by police still do not make clear the
risk posed by cellular telephones, according to a new study by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but some factors
are clear: More than 85 percent of cellular phone customers say
they sometimes use the phones while driving, and 27 percent use
them on more than half of their trips. By next year there will be
80 million users, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   So many cellular users call police when they see highway crashes
that seven states are beefing up ``911'' systems to handle the
increased call volume, even though the number of crashes has not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Limited data from crashes in several states suggest that it is
conversation, not dialing, that causes crashes. Dialing requires
drivers to take their eyes off the road, but they tend to
compensate, often by driving slower, the report said. ``Contrary to
expectations, the majority of drivers were talking on their
telephones rather than dialing at the time of the crash,'' it said.
``A few drivers also were startled when their cellular telephones
rang and, as they reached for their phones, they ran off the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of cellular telephone users were in
the striking vehicle, and struck cars or other large objects that
were in clear view,'' the agency found.
</P>
<P>
   Explorer vs. Sable. Explorer Wins.
</P>
<P>
   The bumpers of some sport utility vehicles have fared badly in
low-speed insurance industry tests using poles or immovable
barriers, but the bumper of a 1997 Ford Explorer did very nicely in
a real-world exercise recently in Rockville, Md., when matched
against the back end of a 1992 Mercury Sable station wagon. It
wasn't bumper-to-bumper, but bumper-to-tail-light, as the Explorer
spared the wagon's bumper almost entirely by striking above it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the mismatch, the left rear corner of the car
ended up moving one foot toward the hood. It would probably have
gone forward farther, but the Sable's spare tire, stored upright in
a compartment on the left side, served as a sort of bumper,
transferring some of the impact force to the sheet metal in front
of it. The tailpipe and muffler, undamaged, were clearly visible
from above, where the liftgate used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Sable was mine, and my insurance company said repairs would
cost a bit more than $5,000, which was the approximate value of the
car, which had 80,000 miles on the odometer. I was not present at
the time of the accident, on a quiet residential street with a 25
mph speed limit, but witnesses said the Ford had only modest
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome would have been considerably worse if anyone had
been sitting in the wagon's rear-facing third seat.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that injuries and deaths are more frequent in
car-truck accidents _ the truck category includes sport utility
vehicles like the Explorer _ than in collisions between cars. But
the insurance industry does not keep separate statistics on damage
costs in such collisions. Last year, though, the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety did measure collision damage against
liability damage (which will apply in my crash if I can collect
from the other driver's insurance company). It shows that 1995-97
models of midsize cars like the Sable had average collision damage
of $250 a vehicle a year, and average liability costs of $73.
Midsize sport utilities like the Explorer had collision damage of
$212, or 15 percent less, but liability costs of $94, or 29 percent
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the collision damage, they do pretty well
compared to cars,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the
insurance institute. ``But they're inflicting harm on the vehicles
they're hitting.''

`AFTER LIFE' WEARS OUT ITS WELCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   British director Nicolas Roeg once told me that in order to make
a good film one must ``cut one's little darlings'' in editing if
the ``darling'' doesn't move the story along. If only Japanese
director Hirokazu Koreeda (and several other filmmakers as well)
would learn that lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Life,'' Koreeda's initially loving, lovely and oddly
honorable homage to life, death, documentary and memory certainly
starts with promise. A group of the recently deceased arrive at a
way station.
</P>
<P>
   Each is assigned a caseworker and given a task. They have a mere
three days to muster up their single favorite memory from life. It
will be re-enacted and filmed and then taken to the next level of
the journey where the person will live it through eternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Life,'' like so many movies these days, has several
endings and it wears out its welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Had ``After Life'' been cut by 20 minutes, its graceful
metaphysical message would have hit just the right key. But Koreeda
drones on with his script, introducing a love story late in the
film that is supposed to be a climactic note. Instead, it's
anticlimactic. A more succinct ending has already preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Koreeda has an eye for the sensual and visual and
creates an illusory world. This is a place where theater,
choreography, image and the act of making a favorite remembrance
from life is important. ``After Life'' gives these notions both
humorous and gentle treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the film ends, we feel like we've endured a
thousand or more lives by watching an endless meditation on regret
and rebirth and wonder why an accomplished director like Koreeda _
he also directed ``Maborosi'' _ would be so overly expositional
with such ethereal, risky material.
</P>
<P>
   After Life. Directed and written by Hirokazu Koreeda. Cast:
Arata, Erika Oda, Susumu Terajima. Artistic License Films. 118
minutes. Unrated. In Japanese with English subtitles.

   Grade: B-

ONLY TWO LARGE CITIES NOW READY FOR Y2K, REPORTS GAO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: El Paso, San Antonio) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only two of the nation's 21 largest cities _ Dallas
and Boston _ are fully prepared to deal with anticipated year 2000
computer glitches, according to the General Accounting Office, the
audit arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is among nine cities scheduled to be validated as
Y2K-compliant by the end of September, a margin of three months
before critical systems could begin failing with the dawn of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ten other cities _ including El Paso, San Antonio and Washington
_ reported to the GAO that all their computer systems would be
ready for the historic date change by the end of December, timing
that raised concerns among lawmakers and GAO staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completing Y2K activities in the last months of the year
increases the risk that key services will not be Y2K-ready in time
for 2000 because there will not be enough time to deal with
unanticipated complications,'' warned Joel Williamssen, head of the
GAO team that monitors information systems.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are concerned that some computers will crash or render
data unusable by misreading 2000 as 1900, a programming
characteristic originally intended to save space by reducing the
year-date to two digits.
</P>
<P>
   For local governments, the loss of computers could mean
disruptions in emergency services _ such as police, fire and
ambulance _ transportation, and water and wastewater treatment
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, city officials earlier this month declared their
various computer systems ready for the arrival of 2000. Mayor Lee
Brown had set June 30 as date for the city's systems to be ready
``and that deadline has been met,'' said his press secretary Lauri
Fickman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city is awaiting the arrival of new computer
hardware and software that will make the Aviation, Public Works and
Engineering, Fire, Housing and Community Development, Parks &AMP;
Recreation departments and the Library fully Y2K compliant. Also, a
private consultant currently is verifying that all the city
computer systems are free of the so-called millenium bug, and the
tests are expected to be finished by Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate's Special Committee on Y2K
issues, Williamssen reported that telephone surveys of the nation's
largest cities early this month found that 45 percent of their
various computer-reliant systems have been prepared and tested for
the date-switch.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas and Boston, all municipal computer systems have been
converted and validated. The nine cities whose systems are expected
to be verified as ready by Sept. 30 are Houston, Indianapolis,
Jacksonville, Fla., Memphis, Tenn., Milwaukee, New York,
Philadelphia, San Diego and San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Williamssen said, nine states _ Alabama,
California, Colorado, Hawaii, Louisiana, New Mexico, New Hampshire,
Ohio and Wyoming _ were found to have addressed the problem in less
than 70 percent of their most important computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how much work remains to be done, Williamssen said,
``contingency plans are critical to ensure that cities will
continue to provide key services through the year 2000 date
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican who heads the special Y2K
committee, said he feared that many state and local governments
were ``leaving little room for testing, contingency planning and
unexpected problems.''

`VIOLENT COP': THE SADISTIC AND RUTHLESS, THROUGH A RUTHLESS LENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As police officers go, the Japanese lawman who goes
by the name Azuma Ryosuke makes Dirty Harry look like a poster boy
for liberalism and forbearance.
</P>
<P>
   So if there were an award for truth in titling, ``Violent Cop,''
the sharp, shocking, cynical account of his conflict with
corruption, would surely be a contender _ if it were not a
10-year-old film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent Cop,'' opening Friday at Cinema Village is being
released here now because it was the first film by Takeshi (Beat)
Kitano, the Japanese Renaissance man who is an actor, stand-up
comic, director, film editor, painter, poet, essayist, journalist,
author, television personality and tough guy who has won
international renown in recent years for films like ``Hana-Bi''
(``Fireworks'') and ``Sonatine.''
</P>
<P>
   Provocative and outspoken, he has told interviewers that he
regards young people as fools, and he is a ruthless critic of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As if in illustration, ``Violent Cop,'' written by Hisashi
Nozawa, begins with a casual, brutal nighttime assault by a group
of adolescents on a homeless man. But it isn't long before Azuma
appears on the doorstep of the fine home of one of these punks,
talks his way past the boy's mother and goes upstairs and into the
youngster's room. There he proceeds to punch, slap, kick and
head-butt before leaving the bloodied boy with four words of
advice: ``Give yourself up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Azuma may not be a paragon of virtue. Among his lesser vices, he
smokes, he drinks, he gambles, he borrows money, he's tight with a
yen and he looks the other way when it suits him. But he is
effective, and even his new chief is willing to tolerate his
methods, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   As star of his own film, Kitano is a riveting figure, a slight,
lithe, laconic character who commands the screen with his bleak
vision of a corrupt world, his potential for explosive violence,
his courage, his tolerance for pain and the understanding and love
he shows for his mentally disturbed sister.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Violent Cop,'' Azuma, partnered with an eager rookie,
becomes part of an investigation of a drug-related murder. The
trail will pit Azuma against a sadistic killer and his smooth
overlord, bare the corruption of a friend and reduce Azuma's
unstable sister to a victim of kidnapping, gang rape and narcotics
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent Cop'' is not for the squeamish. But for fans of
unsentimental police action rooted in commentary on a society,
``Violent Cop'' packs a punch.
</P>
<P>

BUSH SAYS HE WON'T NEED FEDERAL CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Having already raised far more money than each of
his Republican competitors, presidential candidate George W. Bush
Thursday sought to solidify his financial lead by foregoing
matching federal campaign dollars, enabling him to spend unlimited
funds during the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which has been rumored for weeks, is likely to
have a dramatic impact on the campaign. For starters, it sets up an
all-out spending war between Bush and Steve Forbes, who has said he
will spend whatever it takes from his personal fortune to run a
competitive race.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it deals a potentially devastating blow to the rest of
the GOP candidates, several of whom Thursday accused Bush of trying
to buy the election before a single vote is cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is becoming offensive to voters,'' said GOP presidential
candidate Lamar Alexander, who has raised only $2.1 million
compared with Bush's $37 million in the first six months of this
year. ``There is such a thing as overkill. One of the privileges we
have in this country is to pick our nominees.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's decision directly affects primary spending, it also
could have a huge impact on the general election. If Bush wraps up
the nomination after a few weeks of early primaries, he might have
tens of millions of dollars on hand to influence the general
election. If that happens, he would avoid the problem encountered
in the 1996 campaign by Bob Dole, who was nearly broke after a
bruising GOP primary battle with the free-spending Forbes and other
candidates, leaving him with little money to offset President
Clinton's ad campaign during the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins the nomination, Bush could still choose to receive
full federal funding for the general election, which was $61.8
million for each major party candidate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm competing in the primary against somebody who can write
one check,'' Bush said Thursday in Iowa, referring to Forbes. ``I'm
mindful of what happened in 1996, and I'm not going to let it
happen to me. I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore, who announced Thursday that
he has collected nearly $19 million, said through a spokesman that
he will take federal matching funds and abide by the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, a candidate who accepts matching funds is
limited to spending $33 million in the primaries, not including
another $15 million or so for fund-raising and legal costs. By
foregoing the matching funds, Bush is giving up a maximum of $17
million in taxpayer funds that he could use during the primaries.
Bush apparently calculated that he could not only raise that $17
million privately, but also far exceed that amount.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is separate from money spent in the general
election, which is provided from taxpayer dollars and is expected
to be about $67 million for each of the two major party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, said in an
interview that Bush's decision does not abide by the ``spirit'' of
the campaign law and will add to voter cynicism about politics.
McCain, however, said he doesn't think Bush's fund-raising prowess
has bought him the election yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still look at the candidate and make decisions based on
things other than money, even if some media people declare
otherwise,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, McCain acknowledged that even if his own
legislation to overhaul the campaign finance system is passed by
Congress, Bush would still be allowed to opt out of the spending
limit as he did Thursday. McCain's bill focuses mostly on
eliminating unlimited ``soft money'' contributions to political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's announcement Thursday affects only the spending limits,
not contribution limits. Donations to Bush for the primaries will
still be limited to a maximum of $1,000 per person and $5,000 per
political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, plans to match Bush dollar-for-dollar, taking
advantage of a provision in federal law that allows a candidate to
spend unlimited personal funds if no matching taxpayer dollars are
accepted. In 1996, Forbes spent $37 million of his own money, much
of it on commercials that attacked Dole and weakened the Kansan in
advance of the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by Bush and Forbes have prompted outrage among
advocates of campaign finance changes, particularly the self-styled
citizen's lobby, Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's decision signals that the 2000 presidential
election may be the most expensive ever,'' said Common Cause acting
president Donald J. Simon. ``The fundraising _ and potential
corruption _ will be out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen S. Miller, executive director of Public Campaign, which
advocates an overhaul of the campaign finance system, said Bush is
``now free to blow other candidates out of the political water well
before the voters of this country even get their fair say. This may
signal the end of the notion that money can't buy an election.''

OF GRIEF AND TIANANMEN SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the most interesting aspects of the
Asia-Pacific Contemporary Dance Festival at Kaye Playhouse here has
been the stories of how each of the four modern-dance troupes was
founded. The Taipei Crossover Dance Company of Taiwan, which
performed on Wednesday night, was founded in 1994 by a leading
Taiwanese lighting designer, Lin Keh-hua, and four veteran members
of the Cloud Gate Dance Theater. Cloud Gate, one of the oldest
modern-dance companies in Asia, was created by Lin Hwai-min, a
writer who became enamored with American modern dance as a student
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Graham was his inspiration. Graham's appetite for large
themes was an evident influence in Lin's ``Requiem,'' performed to
a score by Franz Liszt, whose emphatic simplicity gave it the sound
of an early modern-dance score by Louis Horst. Dedicated to the
victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre, the solo places a woman
at the center of the stage. The dance never lets her stray far from
that spot as she dips and rises, her columnar body and fluting dark
dress a leashed centripetal force. Only her arms and hands pry
loose to claw and ascend in supplication.
</P>
<P>
   A tour de force of performing, ``Requiem'' was danced with a
majestic grandeur by Lo Man-fei. The handsome costume was designed
by Lin Ching-Ju.
</P>
<P>
   The program opened with ``A Wanderer's Autumn Grief,'' a savvy
but long-winded piece by Helen Lai to an old Chinese song.
According to program notes, Ms. Lai used the many fans in the piece
to capture the song's nostalgic mood. The quartet seems,
intriguingly, to be a modernist's comment on cultural tradition and
its ramifications, as two men and two women respond to a fan in
ways that ranged from intense longing to rage. That sense of past
and present was embodied in the skittering, agonized performing of
Wu Su-chun in the central role. Taurus Wah designed the subtly
colored, flowing costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lo's 1998 ``Dark Side of the Moon,'' which completed the
program, is set to music by Lin Huei-ling that mixes the old and
new to vivid effect. The choreography does, too, in this adaptation
of ``Rashomon.'' Each of the four versions of the story about a
rape and a murder takes too long to unfold, however, making it hard
to connect them. But the stylized look of the work was handsome, as
were the costumes, designed by Yip Kam Tim. Zhang Xiao Xiong stood
out as the tireless punk provocateur of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   The three works were greeted with cheers by the audience. One
man rose to his feet in homage to ``Requiem,'' crying ``Stand up!
Stand up!'' to his fellow audience members as he applauded. But all
three dances had a puzzling emotional cool or distance that could
not be attributed to the physically and dramatically expressive
dancers. They also included the sweet-faced Chen Shu-gi and the
elegant Yeh Tai-chu, founders of the troupe with Ms. Lo and Ms. Wu.
The evening's lighting was by Lin Keh-hua and Chang Tsan-tao.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, produced by Kaye Playhouse and Arts Promotion
Asia, ends with performances Saturday night and Sunday afternoon by
the Son Mu Ga-zen Dance Company from Korea at Kaye Playhouse.

LUCENT EXTENDS MASSACHUSETTS HOLDINGS, ACQUIRES SPECTRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's biggest telecommunications
manufacturer, continued its Massachusetts shopping spree Thursday,
announcing plans to grab a specialty cable maker for $99 million.
</P>
<P>
   SpecTran Corp., which makes custom fiber-optic products for
telephone and cable television and special applications such as
surgery, oil exploration and fighter-jet gyroscopes, would join a
half-dozen other Bay State high-tech companies that have become
part of Lucent in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lucent may face trouble persuading SpecTran owners to
sell because its proposed purchase price of $9 a share is 22
percent below SpecTran's Wednesday closing price. SpecTran shares
tumbled 2 5/8 Thursday to 8 7/8 on heavy Nasdaq volume of 576,500
shares.
</P>
<P>
   SpecTran chief executive Charles B. Harrison said it was the
most favorable purchase offer the 18-year-old Sturbridge company
had received. Given SpecTran's large debt load, small customer base
and fierce competition, he said he doubted a better deal would come
along and noted that SpecTran's average stock price over the last
six months has been $6.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But one major shareholder, Martin Whitman, the co-manager of the
Third Avenue Small Cap Value Fund in New York, told Bloomberg
Business News the deal ``doesn't make any sense'' and he will not
sell his fund's 7 percent stake in SpecTran.
</P>
<P>
   Adding SpecTran's 500 employees would bring Lucent's
Massachusetts employment roster to well over 7,000 workers,
including more than 5,500 who work at its Andover, Mass. cable
manufacturing plant, the state's biggest factory.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said it will open a 20-day tender offer for Spectran's
outstanding stock at $9 a share starting July 21, and if it fails
to get 90 percent of the shares, will reconsider the deal. It would
also assume $35 million in SpecTran debt.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a soaring stock price, Lucent has been bulking up in
recent months _ including a $900 million stock purchase of Nexabit
Networks Inc. of Marlborough, Mass. announced last month _ in hopes
of better challenging industry giant Cisco Systems Inc. for the
fast-data transmission market.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent was interested in SpecTran because it ``broadens our
portfolio and moves us into new niches'' where it now has no
product offerings, said company spokesman Bill Price.
</P>
<P>
   Besides selling to telecommunications and cable television
businesses, SpecTran markets speciality products such as cables
that link manufacturing equipment and devices that aid deep-well
oil and gas exploration, laser surgery and gyroscopes on military
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Nexabit, which has developed a switch that can
move 1 trillion bits of data a second, in the last 2 1/2 years
Lucent has bought or announced plans to buy in Massaachusetts:
Agile Networks of Boxborough, Cambridge software developer Kenan

AGENCIES FAULTED IN PROBE OF CHINA'S ROLE IN U.S. ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An internal Justice Department report has found
that the FBI and federal prosecutors mishandled highly classified
intelligence on allegations that China improperly attempted to
influence American elections.
</P>
<P>
   An unclassified summary of the inspector general's 569-page
report, which was released Wednesday, found that FBI officials were
at first reluctant to share raw intelligence with campaign finance
prosecutors, senior Justice Department officials and lawmakers who
demanded the information as part their own investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the report said, Justice Department officials provided
too much unverified intelligence to lawmakers, fearing that
Attorney General Janet Reno and her subordinates could be
criticized by Republicans if they failed to turn over information
that might be considered relevant to a congressional inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report found that none of the missteps
amounted to an intentional effort to mislead or interfere with any
investigation. Instead, it said, the failures stemmed from
institutional inertia, poor communication and a reluctance to share
classified information with criminal prosecutors for fear of
compromising intelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Thursday that she was reading the report, but added
that she had found no evidence that the Justice Department campaign
finance investigation had been damaged by the problems uncovered by
the inspector general's review. ``Anytime something is delayed, you
can call that bungling,'' she said. ``But the investigation itself
was not impaired in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bromwich, the inspector general, concluded that the
actions of the FBI and the Justice Department reflected an absence
of clear-cut standards about how much information to supply to
outsiders. In the case of the Justice Department, the distribution
of sensitive information ``of dubious quality'' potentially
endangered criminal investigations and could have violated the
constitutional rights of people under scrutiny, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report drew no conclusions about whether the problems in
handling classified information had any impact on investigations
conducted by the Justice Department or Congress. The inquiries
examined allegations that Beijing had a plan to influence American
elections in 1996, when Asian-American fund-raisers engaged in
intensive efforts to find contributors for the Clinton-Gore
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent investigations have found that some contributions
were secretly made by Chinese officials associated with military
and intelligence agencies. But so far little evidence has emerged
to show definitively that Beijing conducted a coordinated attempt
to buy influence in the United States.

GARCIA'S FIRST ROUND LANDS IN THE ROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ It wasn't the aggregate score for Team
Sergio, though it could have been mistaken as such.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia shot 89 in the first round of the British Open
Thursday all by himself, without a shred of help from his council
of seven advisers/employees. If they truly had his best interests
at heart, his handlers would have removed the clubs from his hands
and all sharp objects from his reach.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old wunderkind _ a pro for two months, a phenom for
five years, and a sensation for two weeks _ played like a child
trapped in an alley. And Carnoustie Golf Club played the role of
neighborhood bully.
</P>
<P>
   As a heralded amateur, Garcia finished 29th in last year's
British Open. As a hapless professional, he won't finish this
year's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   He came here off a victory in the Irish Open two weeks ago and a
second place in the Loch Lomond Open last week, and there was talk
around the clubhouse, even among his veteran colleagues, that he
might duplicate Tiger Woods's feat in the 1997 Masters by winning
his first major championship in which a paycheck was at stake. But
Thursday Evelyn Woods could have outplayed him.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after firing a bogey-free 2-under-par 69 in a practice
round, Garcia opened with a 7. That will win you a bundle in Las
Vegas, but it's not too impressive on a par 4.
</P>
<P>
   Sages had cautioned that the key to survival on this 7,361-yard
goliath was not to dwell on a double bogey. Garcia didn't. He
didn't have time. He just kept piling them up _ five doubles or
worse, including three in a four-hole stretch from the ninth to the
12th. When he registered his lone birdie, on the par-5, 515-yard
14th, he probably didn't recognize what it was.
</P>
<P>
   After the round, the player who the day before had requested
that the media refer to him only by his first name preferred to be
anonymous. He initially refused interview requests, though three
hours later, he relented and assessed the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things started going badly with that 7,'' he said, showing
wisdom beyond his years. ``I was suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation, he was hardly alone. The 89 didn't even
win the day's ghoul medal. That honor went to Prayad Marksaeng with
a nifty 20-over-par 91. And Tom Gillis also nosed out Garcia in
ineptitude with a 90. In all, 56 of the 156 golfers who teed off
shot 80 or above. The victims included defending champion Mark
O'Meara, who won't have to worry about packing the claret jug in
his luggage after his 83.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the regard for Garcia's precociousness that his
misery was considered a watershed. Advised of the 89, Colin
Montgomerie, who was thrilled to escape with a 74, said, ``There
you go. It proves it is very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia insisted that great expectations were not his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't put too much pressure on myself,'' he said. ``What I
don't understand is that people complain about the US Open, and
they put the rough so high and the greens so hard (here). I
couldn't do anything. I couldn't swing the club, and on the 12th, I
almost popped it up. I don't think it was a case of coming down
from the clouds. I didn't need to _ I haven't been on any cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But his score was sky-high.

CARNOUSTIE SHOWS WHY IT'S A CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ The winds blew across the links of the
Carnoustie Golf Club in Thursday's opening round of the 128th
British Open, and the glowering skies early in the day were a
telling sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Par doesn't matter,'' said native son Colin Montgomerie.
``Forget par. It doesn't matter this week as long as you're one
less than the rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the game at its gruelling best. You merely tried to
survive. How else to explain defender Mark O'Meara shooting 83, or
youthful Spanish prodigy Sergio Garcia turning in an 89?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hardest championship course in the world,'' said
Sir Michael Bonallack of the championship committee. ``There was a
strong wind today, but even without wind or rough, it would still
be a tough test.''
</P>
<P>
   No player bettered par, and the leader as the final players
straggled in around 9:30 p.m. in the lingering Scottish twilight
was a relatively unknown Australian named Rodney Pampling out of
Queensland, who is playing in this competition for the first time
at age 29. He played in one European PGA Tour event this year and
missed the cut. He checked in before noon with an even-par 71.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that score stood the test of the long day was
remarkable, but in the cold winds out here in Antrum by the North
Sea, this was seemingly predictable. Germany's Bernard Langer and
Nike Tour graduate Scott Dunlap out of Pittsburgh and the
University of Florida trailed by one at 72, and the seven-player
grouping at 73 included 1996 British champion Justin Leonard and
final Pleasant Valley champion Steve Pate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to have shot even par,'' said Tiger Woods, ``but
I knew realistically that even par today would probably have been
around 75 or 76.'' So he shot 74 to trail by three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to go out there and hit a lot of good shots, stay
away from the high number, and just basically keep the ball in play
at all costs'' Woods said. ``I hit some weird clubs off the tees,
but kept it in play beautifully and just wasn't able to make the
birdie putts I'd like to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The course, where Ben Hogan won his only British Open claret jug
in 1953 and Tom Watson won the last one in 1975, was the winner
with its narrow fairways, blustery and chilling winds, and its
7,361 yards of tantalizing terror. ``It's the longest course we've
ever played,'' said Langer, ``and yet there are so many holes you
can't hit driver because it's just too narrow. It's not percentage
golf at all.''
</P>
<P>
   So into this atmosphere walked Pampling, who grew up in the
village of Caboolture. Since his wife, Angela, is a clinical
psychologist, the former greenskeeper turns to her for support.
``You're likely to be (too excited) playing in the British Open,''
he said. ``So I try to slow things down and stop myself from
reacting too much. She watches how I am handling myself on the
course. If I have a problem, we talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pampling, who has played just twice competitivly since March on
the Nike Tour, had 11 staight pars before a bogey on the 12th hole
when he hit a sand wedge to the back edge of the green and failed
to save par. He regrouped with a birdie on the par-3 13th when he
rolled in a 10-foot putt, and went to 2 under when he holed a
25-foot eagle putt on the par-5 14th. Bogeys on 15 and 17 brought
him in at 71.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely pleased,'' he said. ``It's getting very tough
out there. What can you say? It's tough. If you don't hit the
fairways you're loking at bogeys straight away. We went out there
with a plan to finish top 10. We played well at home in Australia
in the wind, so that wasn't a real problem. I don't mind the wind.
It's a challenge. It makes you think a lot harder on the golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Langer, who has won 37 times on the European Tour and has been a
prominent member of the European team in Ryder Cup competition in
nine appearances, had a round that included four birdies derailed
temporarily by a double bogey on the par-5 sixth when he found
himself immersed in the heavy rough. ``I think the sixth hole is
the one hole which in unfair,'' he said. ``The layup area is just
11 yards wide.''
</P>
<P>
   So nobody broke par at storied Carnoustie, where Watson turned
in an 82 and David Duval had to settle for a 79. That was just
above the average score of 78.312. There were just seven eagles and
219 birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything in the mid 70s had to be a good score,'' said Greg
Norman after a 76. ``Realistic par today I think is 74.''

   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Pete Sampras spoke noble words of being true

probably wouldn't like to be in (Gullikson's) shoes if we win,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows all across the tennis world were raised moments after
noon Thursday when umpire Stefan Fransson stood in front of the
ancient and majestic clubhouse of the Longwood Cricket Club and
announced the names of the competitors for Friday's opening singles
matches and those Sunday. Pete Sampras's name was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras will play only doubles, a rare diversion for him (his
world doubles ranking is 774th). Pedro Martinez volunteering for
middle relief in the World Series or Michael Jordan offering to be
sixth man in the NBA Finals or John Elway choosing to play just the
third quarter in the Super Bowl _ these scenarios only hint at the
magnitude of Sampras's decision.
</P>
<P>
   It was his decision, wasn't it? ``That's correct,'' said
Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete and I privately talked about it,'' said Gullikson, ``and
we had a team meeting (at which) we had a lot of feedback from
everyone and everyone told me how they felt. It was a consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras's status had been lobbed back and forth the last five
weeks like a frayed practice ball. Would America's best play
singles? No, said Sampras time and again, doubles only because he
had watched from the comfort of home while Jim Courier and Todd
Martin were battling in England in the last round. Despite his
denials, however, the sentiment was that Sampras would end up
playing singles anyway. Sampras has to play singles, many figured,
as Sampras playing singles would be best for the US team. Time will
tell, was all Gullikson would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel comfortable jumping on the bandwagon and
carrying the flag here,'' Sampras said Thursday when time finally
arrived to reveal to the tennis world his final decision. ``It's
Todd's show and Jim's show. They won an unbelievable tie (match) in
England; I don't think it was right for me to come here and play
singles.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sampras will be watching as Martin opens competition at noon
against rookie Lleyton Hewitt. Patrick Rafter, Australia's best,
then will meet Courier, who revels in Davis Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Martin is scheduled to meet Rafter and Courier to
take on Hewitt. Skeptical Aussies, though, openly suggest that it
might be Sampras, not Martin, meeting Rafter if the US is down
after Saturday's doubles. In that match, Sampras will pair with
Alex O'Brien against Sandon Stolle and Mark Woodforde.
</P>
<P>
   Though the first game of the first set is not until noon, the
gamesmanship is well under way. Newcombe and Rafter, for instance,
said they had believed until Wednesday that Sampras would be
playing singles but changed their minds at a Davis Cup dinner that
night, said Newcombe, ``when we got a feeling that he wasn't going
to.''
</P>
<P>
   How so?
</P>
<P>
   Because Sampras looked so relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the attitude they had,'' said Newcombe. ``You can
sort of tell if someone's going to play _ they have a nervous air
about them. But Pete looked very relaxed. And then I had some
inside information, but you'll have to kill me before you get it
out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   More gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing about playing doubles is that
I don't think Pete (Sampras) is as comfortable with playing
doubles,'' said Stolle. ``Obviously, he's a great player, but going
in, I mean, I much prefer to see him across the net in doubles than
in singles. I just can't see how he can walk out there and believe
he can play good doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Woodforde: ``The fact that Pete is not a regular doubles
player could go against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is 3-1 in Davis Cup doubles.
</P>
<P>
   And even more gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Both captains claimed to be pleased with the draw, which
determined that anxious rookie Hewitt (``I think I am too nervous
at the moment'') would be the Aussie representative in the first
match.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said the Hewitt-Martin matchup gives the US an ideal
chance for a quick jump, and added that the prospect of having
Courier go against the rookie in the fifth _ and possibly deciding
_ match is a pleasant one for the home side.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, countered Newcombe. The Americans know they have to
win the first match, he said, ``and that puts a tremendous amound
of pressure on Todd (Martin). And knowing that he is playing and
Pete is not playing, and knowing that he is playing Lleyton _ on
paper he's supposed to beat him. So there will be some very anxious
moments for them in that first match. If we lose the first match
(with Rafter still to play), we are not going to be as worried as
they will be if they lose the first match.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martin: ``I have played Lleyton once this year (in Sydney)
and it was a close match (a 6-3, 6-7, 6-4 Martin victory). In
Hewitt's opinion, the key to the match ``is that I am going to have
to be returning very well against Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight, of course, will be on the Courier-Rafter match.
Rafter said his kick serve ``is working pretty well'' on the hard
court at Longwood. ``I had been trying it on the grass and
sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't,'' he said. ``But I
know every time I do it on the hard court you get a good reaction,
and this court really takes it nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Kick serve on or not, ``the one thing about Jim Courier is he
puts in 100 percent every single match he plays,'' said Rafter.
``Some guys deal with the pressure of Davis Cup play very well, and
Jim is one of those guys. He loves the whole thing of the Davis
Cup, and he is someone who is able to handle it better than anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier is No. 41 and Rafter No. 2 in the latest world rankings.
But Courier said, ``Pat and I haven't played for a while, but I've
had good success against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, Courier wants Davis Cup play _ his pride
and joy _ to begin and distracting questions about Pete Sampras
playing singles to end.

HOUSE LAWMAKERS SEEK TO REORGANIZE INS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan group of House members has revived
legislation designed to break up the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and assign its two major responsibilities to two new
bureaus within the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by reports that the Border Patrol apprehended and
released suspected killer Angel Maturino Resendez eight times in
the past 18 months, the lawmakers are recruiting co-sponsors for
the bill overhauling the 31,000-employee agency.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Maturino ``is just the latest outrage that's a
direct result of an agency at war with itself,'' said Rep.
Sylvestre Reyes, an El Paso Democrat and former Border Patrol
division chief who is among the legislation's co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino, one of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted, is a Mexican national
who went by the alias Rafael Resendez-Ramirez. He surrendered
Tuesday and is being held in the Harris County Jail in Houston in
connection with nine slayings beginning in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The INS-reorganization bill would create a Bureau of Immigration
Services within the Justice Department to process applications for
citizenship, visas, asylum and refugee status. A separate Bureau of
Immigration Enforcement would coordinate the Border Patrol,
port-of-entry inspections, detentions and deportations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is about ensuring that our immigration system has
the infrastructure and record system in place to avoid another
Resendez-Ramirez case,'' Reyes said. ``Mismanagement has got us
into this situation, and we need to ensure that this never happens
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation sponsored last year by Reyes and Rep. Harold
Rogers, R-Ky., got shoved aside by a Republican Congress bent on
impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the INS, which is a part of the Justice Department,
has proposed its own reorganization, including separate offices to
administer immigration services and law enforcement. However, the
plan would keep the agency intact.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno agreed that the INS has problems,
but agency officials are dealing with them. The reorganization bill
goes too far, she said. ``It's important to have it under one
roof,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, a San Antonio Republican and frequent critic
of the immigration agency, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current INS resembles a car stranded by the side of the
road,'' said Smith, who chairs the House immigration subcommittee.
``Money intended for necessary repairs was spent to make it (the
INS) look shiny and new, but new paint can't hide the fact it is a
broken-down wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress earmarked about $437 million for the agency this year
to catch up on a backlog of citizenship applications. A little over
a year ago, more than 2 million applications were awaiting INS
action. In the six months ending March 31, the agency has processed
461,543 naturalization applications, up 91 percent from the same
period a year earlier. The backlog currently is about 1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials predict that by the end of September, the wait for
citizenship processing _ from the day an application is submitted
until the swearing-in ceremony _ will be cut from 23 months to
about 12. The goal is six months by September 2000. The number of
citizenship applications increased from 543,000 in 1994 to a record
1.57 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has scheduled a hearing on the bill, which has no
comparable measure in the Senate, for June 29. He said more than 70
House members are co-sponsoring the INS reorganization bill.
</P>
<P>
   Another INS critic _ the American Immigration Lawyers
Association _ said the reorganization bill fails to address major
problems at the agency and would hinder enforcement and
adjudication of pending cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that under this scheme enforcement (functions
such as the Border Patrol) would receive funds allocated by
Congress, but adjudication would be forced to rely solely on user
fees,'' said Jeanne Butterfield, the organization's executive
director. ``That's how the INS wound up with its current
naturalization backlog of 1.8 million people and its nearly
three-year backlog in processing green-card applications.''

BUSH RAKES IN CLOSE TO $1 MILLION IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Governor George W. Bush is sucking
Massachusetts dry of Republican campaign funds, leaving his rivals
far behind in the race for money in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has swept all sectors of the Republican fund-raising
community on his way to raising close to $1 million in
Massachusetts, according to campaign finance records filed Thursday
with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   From high tech magnates to downtown bankers to venture
capitalists and leading Republican lobbyists and political
officials, the Texas governor has _ for the moment _ locked up GOP
money in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters were exultant as the campaign filed the details
of its more than 79,000 contributors and $37 million in donations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts was the ninth-ranking state in the nation in its
financial support for Bush, with donors contributing $816,000 in
the last quarter, and more than $900,000 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there might be four or five (GOP contributors) that we
didn't get,'' said Ron Kaufman, a GOP national committeeman from
Massachusetts and Bush supporter. ``The party has decided he's the
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's feat is all the more impressive because, like all
presidential candidates, contributions by law are limited to a
maximum of $1,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Though not all the Republican campaign reports were available
Thursday, the breadth of Bush's success in the state could be
gauged by comparing his report to the one filed by rival Elizabeth
Dole. Bush had some 900 donors who gave $500 or more to his
campaign in Massachusetts in the last quarter: Dole had fewer than
two dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bush's rivals, only publisher Steve Forbes is in the Texas
governor's league. Forbes spent $37 million of his own money in the
1996 campaign and may be counted on to do the same or better next
year. He has spent $8.2 million so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the national fund-raising scene, Senator John McCain of
Arizona raised $4.2 million in the first six months of 1999. Dole
raised $3.5 million. Former Vice President Dan Quayle and Gary
Bauer raised about $3.4 million each and Lamar Alexander raised $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush bandwagon in Massachusetts was flush with famous names,
many of whom are connected through previous or current service with
Governor Paul Cellucci's administration and campaigns. Former
Governor William F. Weld, Massachusetts Highway Commissioner Matt
Amorello, Massport Executive Director Peter Blute and state board
of higher education chairman Stephen Tocco led the political
figures on the list of $1,000 contributors. GOP political
operatives Alexander Tennant, Raymond Howell and Peter Berlandi
were also included, as were former state senators David Locke and
John Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   The officers and employees of several local firms bundled their
contributions into significantly bulky donations. Employees of the
EMC Corp., the Hopkinton, Mass. data storage giant whose chairman
Richard Egan hosted one of two successful fund-raisers for Bush
last spring, gave more than $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with the Boston firm of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris,
Glovsky and Popeo contributed $10,000 to Bush. Executives
associated with the investment firm of Bain Capital Inc. gave
$8,000, as did members of The Parthenon Group, another business
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Boston Capital officials and their family members,
led by Herbert Collins, contributed $10,000 to Bush. John Childs
led a group affiliated with his JW Childs Associates that gave
$6,000. John, Jeffrey and Virgina Kaneb, from the Catamount
Companies, gave $3,000. Thomas Stemberg, the CEO of Staples, Inc.
led a group of that firm's officers and managers that gave $5,000
to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Other heads of commerce and industry on the $1,000 list included
Patrick Lyons of the Lyons Group; Ned Johnson of Fidelity
Investments; Edmund Kelly of Liberty Mutual Insurance; Ronald
Skates of Data General; David Mugar of Mugar Enterprises; James
Vincent of Biogen; Thomas May of Boston Edison; Robert Beal of The
Beal Company; Jay Cashman of Cashman Construction; John Connors of
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulous; James and Anne Davis of New
Balance; John Davis of American Saw; William van Faasen of Blue
Cross; Paul Fireman of Reebok; Paul Gudonis of GTE; Roger Marino of
Golf Technologies and Thomas Kershaw of the Hampshire House Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the $1,000 contributors were restaurateurs Aaron
Spencer and Charles Sarkis, and Harvard University's Richard Hunt,
William Sahlman and Michael Porter.

RUSSIANS LOOK BACK WITH NOSTALGIA FOR THE BLEAK DAYS GONE BY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russians may be divided sharply on whether the Soviet
era was the ``good old days.'' But it is the time when most of them
were young.
</P>
<P>
   So, like it or not, a patina of nostalgia, or at least kitsch,
has spread over that gray world of communal apartments, chronic
shortages, propaganda slogans, controlled newspapers and political
taboos.
</P>
<P>
   The door to Petrovich, a popular club in the basement of a
nondescript building off Mesnitskaya Street, has five clumsy
doorbells, just as the old communal apartments had. The membership
card is a Communist Party ticket. Inside, window sills and walls
are packed with junky memorabilia from the Soviet Union, which
collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the toilets hangs a glossy black-and-white photograph of
a large group of men in ill-fitting suits and women with beehive
hairdos under a statue of Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader who
died in 1982. The caption identifies them as an ``all-Union
conference of psychiatrists'' held in 1977 in Brezhnev's native
city, Dneprodzerzhinsk.
</P>
<P>
   On the menu, a pancake with caviar is called ``No to Racism!'' _
after a typical slogan of a May Day parade. And tongue with
horseradish is labeled Gensec, the Soviet contraction for the
general secretary of the Communist Party and the title by which all
the leaders, from Stalin to Mikhail Gorbachev, were formally known.
</P>
<P>
   This is stuff any Russian who remembers the world before 1991
would appreciate, as they would the patched accordion their
grandfather kept on a shelf, the washed-out postcards perched in
the glass bookcase, the old taxi meter that never worked, the
cheery girl on the cover of Soviet Peasant or the volume titled
``Book of Useful Advice,'' much of it contributed by clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to re-create the forgotten years; the communal
apartment, the Soviet `middle class,' the herring, the pickles, the
postcards,'' said Yekaterina Razgovora, a manager of Petrovich.
``People feel at ease here. They feel at home. This is an era they
all remember, a youth they can appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Soviet memorabilia is hardly new, at least among
tourists. Many of the trappings of the old Bolshevik empire _
military caps, Red Army belt buckles, old medals, Kremlin phones
and anything with Lenin on it _ went on sale as soon as the Soviet
Union went under.
</P>
<P>
   The tourist trade marches on unabated today in places like the
pedestrian mall of the Old Arbat, where Soviet coins, flags and
other trinkets are displayed alongside the mandatory T-shirts of
``McLenin,'' with the founder of the Soviet state chomping into a
Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a considerable minority of Russians who openly and
actively bemoan that December day in 1991 when the red flag went
down over the Kremlin. In an irony that probably eludes them, many
have taken their fervor to the Internet, where they vent their
frustrations on sites ranging from Pravda to one dedicated to
preserving Lenin's mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
   On the site, Lenin's niece, Olga Ulianova, argues that ``it is
absolutely clear that reburying him might provoke the most
unpredictable consequences for our fatherland.'' She offers no hint
what they may be.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Ulianova may not feel comfortable in Petrovich. But those
Russians who couldn't dump their Soviet junk fast enough when the
old order collapsed are those who now find themselves attracted to
echoes from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the glittering shopping mall under the Manezh Square,
whose three underground floors of shops are unabashedly aimed at
Moscow's nouveaux riches, one of the stands in the food court is
called Dining Room No. 14, as it might have been in the Soviet
days, when most shops and eateries were identified only by a naked
number.
</P>
<P>
   You find it on television, too. A commercial for a brand of
Indian tea that used to be in great demand, and was in great
shortage, in the Soviet Union starts with black-and-white images of
a man proudly bringing the familiar package with an elephant on it
home to an admiring family. The package acquires color and a voice
intones, ``The tea you remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies have not failed to recognize the draw of the
past. Dannon, the yogurt maker, markets a ``classic kefir,'' made
to taste like the yogurt-like dairy product Russians grew up on.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular shows on television, ``Old Apartment,''
draws huge audiences on Sundays focusing on something from the past
and finding people who remember to discuss it. Grigory Gurvich, the
host, says the discussions often get emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, those who remember the past seriously remember a
hell, a nightmare, especially the communal apartments,'' Gurvich
said. ``But as Yevgeny Yevtushenko said when he was on recently, it
was a horror, but that's how we grew up. We were young.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Gurvich noted, few Russians today still remember the
horror of the Gulag and the repression. For most, their memories of
the Soviet Union are of the ``Period of Stagnation'' under Brezhnev
and his aging successors, when repression gave way to enforced
mediocrity, boredom and shortages of virtually everything but
propaganda. It was a time when the focus of life shifted to steamy
kitchens, the search for goods, and treasured glimpses of the
glittering West in movies, television shows and books.
</P>
<P>
   It is this world that Petrovich tries to re-create _ in a
mushroom julienne named ``Petrovich's dream of Paris, where he has
not yet been,'' or in the black-and-white movies about the triumphs
of a young Bolshevik in agriculture that play constantly over the
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wonder if my kids will ever believe what it was
like,'' said a businessman in his 30s, whose wife works for a
Western car company. ``I try to tell them about the lines, about
living in a two-room apartment with their grandparents, about how
nervous we were if we met a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just look at me as if I'm describing an alien land. I
am.''

ANDERSON LOOKING GOOD AS DIERCKXSENS TAKES 11TH STAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-ETIENNE, France _ Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass.,
looks every bit like a casualty of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   A bandage and bruise under his right eye is a reminder of the
crash he and three dozen other racers were in last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He has fishnet bandages on his left knee and elbow from a spill
he and teammate Kevin Livingston took three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton insists that all is well, despite his
``souvenirs.''
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't it be? He's been riding strongly, and his US
Postal Service teammate Lance Armstrong has a firm lead and will
likely wear the winner's yellow jersey on the podium in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I feel really good,'' said Hamilton, acknowledging that
the crash in the Tour's second stage, where he lost six minutes in
the standings after just two stages, hit him hard. He's now 19th,
more than 19 minutes behind Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it mattered, it was pretty hard,'' said Hamilton, 28.
``But to be honest with you, we're focused on one rider. I could be
second right now and it wouldn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has been saying all week that the winning spot isn't
locked up, and Hamilton agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we've got a long way to go,'' he said. ``Things look good,
for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Things continued to look good for Armstrong in the 11th stage
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian rider Ludo Dierckxsens won the 124-mile race in 4 hours
34 minutes 3 seconds, and Armstrong and the rest of his teammates,
as well as the rest of the leaders, rolled in more than 22 minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't make any difference in the standings. The Texan
held on to his lead of 7 minutes 47 seconds and for the fourth
stage in a row donned a fresh yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The riders said goodbye to the mountains _ temporarily _ as they
started from the foot of Alpe d'Huez in the village of Le Bourg
d'Oisans to Saint-Etienne, once considered the French capital of
the bicycle industry.
</P>
<P>
   More hilly days are in store until the day off Monday, but it
will be nothing compared with what the riders face next week in the
Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   So the riders weren't inclined to exert themselves very much in
the final climb of the race 15 miles from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Several riders set off at a fast speed of 32 miles per hour to
win a sprint for points 20 miles into the race, with the green
sprinter's jersey at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Stuart O'Grady and German rider Erik Zabel are first
and second in the sprint standings, but it was Belgian Tom Steels
who surged ahead to capture the winner's six points.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the race was left to the riders who are lower in the
standings to battle it out, while the bulk of the competitors were
content to stay back and stay together. Still, Armstrong and his
teammates rode near the front of the pack, to be ready to attack if
anyone initiated a break.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Seven riders built a lead of 2 minutes, then
14 minutes, then 17 minutes. But to show why Armstrong was so
blase, consider that the highest-placed rider of the group,
Kazakhstan's Alexandre Vinokourov, was 43 minutes behind Armstrong
in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Dierckxsens escaped the small group on the final descent into
town and cruised over the finish line almost a minute and a half
ahead of Russian Dmitri Konyshev.

BARAK SEEKS `NEW MOMENTUM' IN MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying it was time to ``inject new momentum'' into
the Middle East peace process, Ehud Barak Thursday made his
much-anticipated debut in America as Israel's new prime minister,
telling President Clinton he was ready to move ``on all tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, appearing in the White House Rose Garden with Clinton,
also said he wanted to move to a comprehensive settlement with the
Palestinians while signalling a tough line on the future of
existing Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
   In their private talk, Barak told Clinton, ``We are approaching
the moment of truth,'' according to a senior Israeli official.
Barak also was quoted as saying he was prepared for a ``painful
compromise'' with Syria over the Golan Heights, which Syria lost to
Israel in the 1967 war. ``Serious efforts'' to restart talks with
Syria would made in coming weeks, the Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, according to a senior American official, called the
talks ``very, very positive'' and said he found Barak ``serious and
also reflective . . . a leader who will be scrupulous in living up
to his obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rose Garden, Clinton vowed to Barak that ``America will
walk with you, ready to help in any way we can'' in future peace
talks. But Barak said the Americans could take more of a back seat
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the United States can contribute to the process
more as facilitator than as kind of policemen, judge and arbitrator
at the same time,'' Barak said. ``This was the tradition when
Yitzhak Rabin was leading the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was perhaps natural for the United States to
take a less active role. In a pointed remark directed toward
Barak's predecessor, Clinton said that tenure of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu ``the bonds of trust and the lines of
communication had become so frayed that we were in danger of losing
the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton said, direct contacts can begin again. Reflecting
the administration's strong optimism toward prospects for Middle
East peace, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have seen before here at this house, as Israelis,
Palestinians, Egyptians and Jordanians have come together, what at
first seems unlikely, even impossible, can actually become reality
when the will for peace is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's opening of private talks with Clinton, which continued
with a dinner Thursday night at Camp David, was seen by the
administration as a way of going back to the past when Rabin struck
historic deals with the Palestinans and Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   In their opening statements, Clinton and Barak both invoked the
name of the late Israeli leader, who was gunned down in November
1995 by a Jewish religious extremist, an assassination that led to
the crippling of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin was Barak's mentor and Clinton's friend, a warrior who
turned peacemaker, a gruff sort who came to the White House in
September 1993 and signed the historic Oslo accords with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. At that signing also came the
defining symbol of new hope when Arafat outstretched his hand, and
Rabin, with Clinton holding his elbow, shook it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, were here today,'' Clinton said
to Barak, ``I believe he would be very gratified seeing the
leadership of his cherished nation in your most capable hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his seasoned Middle East team know Barak well as an
aide to Rabin. But Barak as leader is something else entirely, and
there is apprehension he will balk at fulfilling Israel's
commitments in a deal made last fall at the Wye Plantation in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also know little of the handful of advisers who
surround Barak, with the notable exception of ex-Mossad spymaster
Danny Yatom, who met with Clinton's aides while the two leaders
talked.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye peace deal involves a series of land-for-security
arrangements with the Palestinians. The Palestinians want the deal
upheld, which would end with them in control of 40 percent of the
West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Barak Thursday indicated he would move ahead on the Wye deal,
but slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the need to combine the implementation of Wye with
the moving forward of the permanent status agreement,'' Barak said.
``It could be this way: first Wye, then final status. It could be
this way, but only through an agreement with Arafat after mutual,
open, frank, and direct discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who in his first week in office met with Arafat, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah and Turkey's
president, Suleyman Demirel, said he was open to the idea of
meeting Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, a
deal that would require Syrian, and perhaps Iranian, agreement to
rein in Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On meeting Assad, Barak said, ``I hope we will be able to meet.
It takes two to tango. I am ready, the arena is ready, maybe the
dancing instructor is ready. We have to find opportunity and
begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also addressed the contentious issue of Jewish
settlements, fortified communities in the midst of Palestinian
society in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   He said the issue of the settlements will be wrapped into the
final status talks with the Palestinians, but he said that most
settlers would remain in their homes in any deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to build new ones,'' the Israeli leader said.
``I'm not going to dismantle any one of them. Israeli citizens are
living in them. They came to these places, almost all of them,
through an approval of the Israeli government; we are responsible
for them.''

STATE COURTS OVERTURNING LAWS CURTAILING JURY AWARDS AND INJURY
LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(jt) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a decade after states began enacting laws to cut back
big jury awards and curtail injury lawsuits, state courts across
the country are overturning one measure after another, concluding
that Americans have a powerful right to settle their disputes in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Top courts in such states as Illinois, New Hampshire, Kentucky
and, most recently, Indiana on July 8 and Oregon on Thursday, have
relied on provisions of state constitutions like guarantees of fair
access to the courts to strike down all or part of the new laws
that were passed under the banner of ``tort reform.'' The new
liability laws make it more difficult to bring some suits and seek
to limit how much people can collect in accident, malpractice and
other injury cases.
</P>
<P>
   The highest courts of at least seven states have struck down all
or part of new liability laws in the last three years. Dozens of
new challenges to such laws are working their way toward state
supreme courts across the country, including in Wisconsin, Alaska
and Colorado, and a major decision is expected soon from the
Supreme Court in Ohio, which enacted a sweeping new liability law
two years ago. The cases focus on such state constitutional
guarantees of ``open courts'' or the right to a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   In this rancorous second phase of the battle over the liability
system, at least 87 decisions by state courts at all levels have
found flaws with laws that have been enacted since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state courts are invalidating huge parts of the tort
reform legislation to the consternation of supporters of tort
reform,'' said Professor Mark Geistfeld of the New York University
Law School. ``There is much more judicial hostility to this kind of
legislation than anyone was expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws have also been upheld by lower courts across the
country, with judges taking sides in one of the country's fiercest
but least noted legal wars. In a decision this January, the
Virginia Supreme Court, one of the few top state courts to affirm
the new laws recently, said a law limiting damages in malpractice
cases passed muster under that state's constitution. But legal
experts on both sides of the issue say the momentum is clearly on
the side of the critics of the new laws.  &QL;

`GVSE' STARS BATTLE BAD GUYS, BAD SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in the premiere episode of ``GvsE,'' Richard Brooks'
character says, ``There's a fine line between cool and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   How very true. Strangely ironic, then, that ``GvsE'' should
cross the line without even slowing for the speed bump. It ends up
so far inside the stupid zone that it'll take all the king's horses
and all the king's Mensas to bring it back.
</P>
<P>
   The betting here is that co-creators Jonas and Josh Pate pulled
a few muscles, or at the very least suffered severe cramping,
trying so hard to be cool. Better if they had spent less time
mimicking the dark humor of ``Pulp Fiction'' and more time focusing
on story development. We all might feel less cool, but the show,
premiering Sunday on USA Network, would probably make more sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``GvsE'' means good vs. evil. Brooks, who played Brian Robinette
in the first season of ``Law &AMP; Order,'' plays Henry McNeil, a dead
guy who has been given his life back as long as he agrees to work
for the Almighty Corps in its battle against the devil and his
disciples.
</P>
<P>
   If he's rotten to the Corps or breaks any of its rules _ no
contact with family members, no sex, no Faustian deals _ the game
is over. Further complicating matters is the overwhelming mortality
of the Corps' recruits: They have no superpowers, so if any of them
were to go one on one with, say, a crosstown bus, the bus would
win.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guys, who have made deals with the devil, seem to be
better equipped. They have little horns and are called morlocks,
which strikes the ear as ``more lox,'' suggesting the devil is in
the details of a Jewish deli. Alas, morlocks cannot be subdued by
cream cheese alone. It takes a sharp knife specifically designed
for dispatching demons, but which also looks ideal for slicing
bagels.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil's partner in this morlock-hunting expedition is Chandler
Smythe (Clayton Rohner), a recently dead reporter who learns that
working for the Corps is the only way he'll ever make it
``upstairs.'' Who knew the penance of purgatory involved bounty
hunting?
</P>
<P>
   Smythe and McNeil, of course, are oddball partners from the
get-go, but the story moves so quickly _ as if edited by MTV _ that
the viewer never gets to develop an attachment. Quick cuts and
humorous asides dominate, rendering the enthusiastic performances
of Brooks and Rohner a disjointed chain of recitations.
Intermittent narration by football great Deacon Jones is supposed
to add a sarcastic touch, but it's more helpful as a primer on the
rules of this bizarre game.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no one explains the scene in which Smythe and
McNeil allow an old woman to choke to death for no apparent reason.
What's up with that? If these are the good guys, this Corps may
have a devil of a time keeping its recruits semper fi.
</P>

agents working for good against the forces of evil. Starring

TAYLOR CASHES IN WITH RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- During his time here, Tim Taylor gave an honest effort
during every shift, every period, and every game. Thursday, he gave
an honest assessment of why he's no longer a Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who agreed to terms on a four-year, $5.8 million deal
with the New York Rangers, said his reason for leaving Boston was
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players will lie and say it's not about money but it is
about money,'' said the 30-year-old center who played two seasons
here. ``I understand I can't play forever. I played a few years in
the minors, where I felt I missed out on an opportunity to make
some money, so obviously I came where the money was being
offered.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, an unrestricted free agent, said there were other teams
that were interested but wasn't one of them. He said he never
received an offer from the Bruins, who paid the center a base
salary of $675,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came down to it, I think the Rangers were the ones,''
he said during a conference call. ``There were a lot of things that
come into it but obviously money was the biggest one. I wanted an
Original Six team and I wanted to stay in the Eastern Conference. I
saw the team was building and they're going to have a big future,
and I'm hoping to be a big part of it. It comes down to money, and
I owed it to myself and my family to take the best offer. My
decision was made for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first year with Boston, after being plucked off waivers
from the Detroit Red Wings, with whom he won a Stanley Cup, Taylor
was a strong presence on the Bruins' top checking line with right
wing Rob DiMaio and then-rookie P.J. Axelsson. He scored 20 goals
and 31 points in 79 games and was effective at shutting down
opposing teams' top lines.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Taylor was hindered by injuries, especially a balky
ankle, and was limited to 49 games. He said his time with DiMaio
and Axelsson and the significant role given to him by coach Pat
Burns helped him reach the financial status he has attained with
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge steppingstone for me,'' he said. ``Those guys
meant a great deal to me. They're two great players and obviously
the system we played benefited me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he felt as early as the end of the year that he
wouldn't be in Boston anymore. Despite the Bruins not offering him
a new deal, he doesn't harbor any ill will. He said it's just a
business decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't disappointed in the organization,'' Taylor said. ``I
was happy with them. I don't feel they owe me anything. I felt this
was a good situation for me. I wanted to maybe come to a team
that's going to really contend for the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins assistant general manager Mike O'Connell seemed resigned
that Taylor was going to be offered more money and that Boston, as
was true with Dave Reid and Dave Poulin before Taylor, just wasn't
prepared to go that far. In addition, management believes another
player _ such as Joe Thornton or a prospect from Providence _ could
step into the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that just for the fact that we never received one
offer,'' said Taylor. ``I think maybe they thought it was going to
be out of their range and they thought they could move someone else
into that role for a cheaper price.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio spoke with Taylor and wished him the best, but couldn't
help being upset at losing his friend and linemate. When DiMaio
gave up his chance at unrestricted free agency to sign a new
three-year deal with the Bruins last summer, he was assured the
club would do its level best to keep the core of young talent
together. DiMaio said he finds the Taylor signing a tough pill to
swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timmy is a good friend and I felt, a real big part of this
hockey team,'' said DiMaio. ``They might think it's very easy to
replace him but it's not. You can put another body there, but the
grit and determination he brings and playing in pain like he did in
the playoffs, you don't replace that kind of thing. I'm very
disappointed he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they have their own idea of where they want to go
in the organization and I don't know if Timmy was part of that. I
thought he was going to be a big part of it.''

NAVY DEFENDS PRACTICE BOMBING OF ISLAND OFF PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy and Marine Corps launched a campaign
Thursday to persuade President Clinton to permit resumption of
live-fire training on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, three
months after a bombing accident killed a civilian employed by the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The accident has inflamed pro-independence sentiment across the
U.S. commonwealth and prompted several dozen protesters to occupy
the bombing range, located 8 miles east of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig released an inch-thick report
justifying the need for continued training on Vieques, where the
Navy and Marines have prepared for every major U.S. military
operation since World War II, including the Persian Gulf War and
the bombing campaign against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my standpoint, the main message of today is from a
national security standpoint this is an important and not a
replaceable site,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig released the report on the eve of a meeting by a
four-member Pentagon review panel appointed at the request of the
president to review the need for continued live-fire training on
the 22-mile-long island and to explore possible alternative sites.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is due to report to the president by Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Romero-Barcelo, Puerto Rico's non-voting representative
to Congress, and Rep. Jose E. Serrano, D-N.Y., the most senior
member of Congress born in Puerto Rico, plan to urge the
four-member panel on Friday to permanently end Navy operations on
the island and turn it over to the Puerto Rican government.
</P>
<P>
   The island has 9,300 residents living at least 10 miles from the
bomb and artillery ``impact site'' at the eastern end of the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling you what we genuinely think without regard to
politics,'' Danzig told a Pentagon news conference in releasing the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said the Navy study examined 18 other sites for
comparable training and concluded that training must continue at
the 24,000-acre range on Vieques. The study was compiled by Navy
Vice Adm. William Fallon, commander of the Atlantic fleet, and
Marine Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commander of 92,000 Marines assigned to
Atlantic operations.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig suspended live-fire training on April 19 after a Marine
Corps' FA-18 pilot mistakenly dropped two 500-pound bombs about a
mile off-target during night training, killing security guard David
Sanes Rodriguez, 35, a civilian employee of the Navy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The military officers told the news conference that Vieques
offered the lone site on the East Coast to enable combined arms
training involving naval gunfire, aerial bombardment, artillery
fire and maneuvers by Marine troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to our nation and to our people to train
them to be most effective if they are called upon to go into
combat,'' Fallon said. ``If we don't do this, we put our people at
personal risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace declared: ``My responsibility to their mothers and fathers
is to ensure that when we send them overseas, I have given them the
best training I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials signaled some flexibility as the Navy and Marines
try to allay the political firestorm in Puerto Rico and the
political pressure being brought to bear on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico, with a population of 3.8 million, came under U.S.
jurisdiction during the Spanish-American War in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   The president is due to make a decision after receiving the
report from the four-member Pentagon review panel that includes
only one non-defense official _ retired Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
a former chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said the Navy is holding out the prospect of a ``stronger
partnership'' with Puerto Rico to bolster the economic fortunes of
Vieques by helping to lower ferry costs, improving the island
airstrip and pier and freeing government property for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said carrier-based combat air wings that ordinarily drop
about 350 bombs on Vieques to prepare for overseas deployment could
shift a greater share of the bombing to a range at Fallon, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Pace said the combat-ready Marine Expeditionary Unit of about
2,500 Marines that accompanies an 12-ship combat battle group
assembled around an aircraft carrier usually fires 600 rounds of
artillery and 500 mortar rounds to prepare for overseas operations.
Pace said the Marines would see if the number of rounds could be
reduced.

TIMES CO. BUYS ABUZZ'S BEEHIVE PRODUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody's an expert in something. Now The New York Times Co.
is hoping to tap this vast store of knowledge, by purchasing a
Cambridge, Mass. firm whose software creates on-line communities of
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The Times will pay an undisclosed sum to acquire Abuzz
Technologies Inc., makers of a knowledge management system called
Beehive. The product is used by businesses to create profiles of
workers that reveal each person's areas of expertise. It then
fields e-mail queries, forwarding each message to the worker most
likely to know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are hoping to do is to bring this to the Internet,''
said Times spokeswoman Lisa Carparelli.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, The Times Co., which owns The Boston Globe, merged all
its on-line properties, including the Boston.com Web site, into a
new business entity called Times Company Digital. The company plans
to use the Beehive technology on its various sites to turn readers
into a community of experts, freely sharing their knowledge with
all comers.
</P>
<P>
   Such free exchange of information is routine on the Internet,
where chat rooms and message boards are crammed with visitors
seeking advice. But finding someone who really knows the answers
can be a frustrating, hit-or-miss exercise. The Beehive technology
aims to improve results by targeting queries directly to the right
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal of Abuzz is it's very user-friendly,'' said
Marianne Hedin, a research manager at International Data Corp. in
Framingham. ``You can use it through e-mail, which everybody uses.
You don't have to learn an additional tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times plans to take advantage of its large base of
knowledgeable, upscale readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Times has such an incredible community,'' said
Patty Purcell, vice president of strategic marketing and customer
operations for Abuzz. ``They've described it to us as the best of
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how many visitors to the various Times Web sites
will want to take part in the system as experts. They'd have to
provide a good deal of information about themselves to the Beehive
system. This will enable it to identify likely experts, but it will
also mean experts give up a measure of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Times can persuade enough of its Web readers to
take part in the system, the Abuzz technology could provide users
with an on-line source of instant expertise.

CLINTON'S REMARK ABOUT BARAK STARTS A SQUABBLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An offhand remark by President Clinton at a
fund-raising dinner in Miami on Tuesday blossomed into a minor
diplomatic incident in Washington Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told contributors on Tuesday night that he was ``eager
as a kid with a new toy'' to meet with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Israel took offense at the remark, considering it flip,
disrespectful and, as Shimon Shifer of the daily newspaper Yediot
Aharonot put it, ``patronizing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of game do you want to play with Mr. Barak?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was somewhat taken aback, uncertain what prompted the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think it's patronizing at all; it's just the
reverse,'' Clinton said, describing what he felt was the proper
role of the United States in Middle East diplomacy, without
addressing the reporter's query.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Blitzer of Cable News Network explained what Shifer meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I see,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak interjected, ``I believe we are all under urgent need to
deal very seriously, not with a tricky interpretation of innocent
favorable statements, but by looking into the real problems and
focus on solving them.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Clinton tried to set Shifer straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In English, what that means is that you are very excited,''
the president said. ``It has no reference to the prime minister. I
would never do that. For example, if I were taking a trip to
Hawaii, I might say `I am excited as a kid with a new toy.' It
doesn't mean I think Hawaii is a toy, if you see what I mean. It
means that, it's a slogan, you know, in the way, in American
English it means, `I am very excited about the prospect of the
rejuvenation of the peace process,' and that's all it means.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I would never say such a patronizing thing ever. So
I thank you. Thank you, Wolf.''

 &HT;    Lively Covent Garden pillar of community
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ You could make a case that the longest-running show in
London _ 340 years and counting _ is going on in front of the
portico of St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden. Though it has been
interrupted quite a few times by rain.
</P>
<P>
   It's street theater. On a recent afternoon, a man juggled three
flaming batons on the cobblestones while cracking jokes, cheered by
crowds on the overhanging deck of a nearby beer garden. Behind him,
on the wall of the 1798 edifice (which anchors the west side of the
Covent Garden marketplace), a plaque marks the point where the
puppet Punch was first observed in England by diarist Samuel Pepys
in 1662, thwacking everyone who tried to share his open-air stage.
Today the Garden's annual Maye Faire is awash with puppet shows.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that St. Paul's massive Tuscan columns, now smudged
by soot and graffiti, will look familiar if you've ever seen ``My
Fair Lady'' on stage or screen. The opening scene of the musical
and its source play, Shaw's ``Pygmalion'' (1913), is set here. As
flower girl Eliza Doolittle bawls her sales pitch, Professor Henry
Higgins peers around a column, jotting her Cockney elocutions
before he teaches her to speak ``like an English lady.''
</P>
<P>
   A farmers market in the 19th century, Covent Garden is now a
great cobblestoned hive of boutiques _ one specializing in
beautiful Victorian toys _ craft stalls and cafes. The squawks of
poultry and vendors have been replaced by the sounds of music (on a
recent afternoon, an elegant Peruvian band) and various buskers.
Though American chain stores have squeezed in a few tentacles
(inflatable batting cages are the rage!), the square, or piazza, is
surrounded by such handsome old buildings that its character is not
in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw developed his socialist sympathies from encounters with
struggling workers here. He'd be dumbfounded by the gentrification
(a store called Accessorize), but would still approve of the
ever-roisterous spirit. Backpacking college students sprawl against
Eliza's old pillar at St. Paul's, soaking up the scene.

 &HT;    Theater and hotel were ground zero for theatrical adventure
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Great performances, illicit rendezvous, theatrical
deals struck over caviar _ it's all there under the stainless
steel, art deco marquee that forms the entrance to the Savoy
Theatre and Savoy Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The original theater (the first to use electric lights) was
built in 1881, and the hotel in 1903, by producer Richard D'Oyly
Carte with profits from the operettas of W.S. Gilbert and Arthur
Sullivan. A bronze bust of the latter stands in the Embankment
Gardens between the hotel and the Thames. Actor Edward Petherbridge
(``Lord Peter Wimsey'' on PBS' ``Mystery!''), who leads occasional
theater tours for London Walks, informs, ``The topless woman at
Sullivan's feet is his muse. The Victorians would never have
allowed a pose of such abandon if she were a mere mortal.''
</P>
<P>
   If you look up at the hotel from the bust (Sullivan's, that is),
you can see the windows of Noel Coward's old suite, second floor
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan run continued until 1907. A struggling
actor named Laurence Olivier turned down a 1929 ``Journey's End''
role that instead made a star of Colin Clive, better known now as
the mad doc (``It's a ... liiiiiiiive!'') in the movie
``Frankenstein.'' The theater got the deco makeover in 1930 and
thrives today.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the hotel's predecessor, the Savoy Palace, that editor
Frank Harris gathered some of Oscar Wilde's friends for an 1895
dinner that would today be called an intervention. Their mission:
to persuade Wilde to be discreet in his relationships, and back off
the libel suit that further exposed his homosexuality and brought
his downfall. Harris writes in his Wilde biography that the
playwright was unmoved, so merry that he coined the epigram, ``Work
is the curse of the drinking classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping down from the hotel's outer lobby of red-and-beige
veined marble, into the luxuriously sprawling lounge of moss green
and dusty rose (sofas set back into discreet nooks), you feel as if
you're making an entrance in a Coward play. You sense the need for
a martini as hand prop, and no wonder: The cocktail was reportedly
invented in the American Bar that you just passed on the left.

 &HT;    Long home to theatrical life, the West End boasts an array of
active playhouses easily accessible to walkers
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Put on your best walking shoes. Following are routes
that take you to the heart of British theater history:
</P>
<P>
   East of Covent Garden,
</P>
<P>
   The Strand
</P>
<P>
   This portion of the West End, huddled close to the north bank of
the Thames, was the hub of theatrical life from Dryden to Shaw.
Most of its theaters are still active.
</P>
<P>
   From Covent Garden tube station, go east on the north side of
Floral Street. Just before you reach Bow Street, in the shadow of
the Royal Opera House (site of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden,
18th century playground of Sheridan and Goldsmith), you'll see a
plaque indicating the workshop where a young Picasso designed sets
for a 1919 ballet. Turning south on Bow Street, you'll take in the
magnificent, newly revamped facade of the 1858 opera house, Roman
Renaissance with a Corinthian portico.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeding south on Bow and east on Russell Street, you'll see
the 1812 Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, fourth structure of that title.
It's so named because after the Puritan ban on plays was lifted in
1660, the Drury and Covent Garden were the only theaters with royal
permission to charge admission for performances. (Charles II showed
further approval by making Drury star Nell Gwynn his mistress.) A
rotunda in the inner lobby, open all day to the public, is a sort
of mini Hall of Fame, with statues of Shakespeare, Noel Coward,
actors David Garrick (in a toga, circa 1750) and Edmund Kean
(holding Yorick's skull, circa 1830). Coleridge described watching
Kean as ``reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   On the north side of the Drury is a charming curiosity: a tiny
theater, the Fortune, and a church in the same 1930 building, with
a statue of a naked woman over the doors. Actor Edward
Petherbridge, a tour guide for London Walks, reports that although
a wall separates the theater from the Church of Scotland, an
unusually wide aisle against that wall is the church's expression
of discomfort with Terpsichore, the unclothed muse.
</P>
<P>
   Double back on Russell Street to the Covent Garden Theatre
Museum, a small but well-stocked repository of costumes, set
models, documents, tapes and videos. You can hear a
gooseflesh-raising recording of Gielgud's ``Hamlet'' and see Kean's
death mask. The museum loves kids, with lively exhibits of puppets
and a hilarious video of ``The Wind in the Willows'' (actors copy
ferrets' body language).
</P>
<P>
   Stroll south to the Strand and the Coal Hole, where a pub of
this name has stood since the early 1800s. Coal was carted up the
adjoining Carting Lane from Thames barges. Kean practically lived
in this dim, grandly high-ceilinged bar, leading a ``club'' of
cronies who heckled his rivals onstage. Peter O'Toole writes in
``Loitering With Intent'' that Kean was his idol, so the Hole was
his office. O'Toole no longer puts in an appearance, but a barman
says he often draws Richard Harris a 4X Lager with lime.
</P>
<P>
   West on the Strand, past the Savoy, is the 1930 art deco
Adelphi, site of playhouses since 1809, where ``Chicago'' currently
sizzles. A plaque at the stage door marks where star William
Terriss was stabbed by a crazed bit player in 1897; 50,000 people
lined his funeral route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Irving (a legendary thespian) predicted no one would
hang for murdering an actor,'' says Michael Billington, theater
critic of The Guardian, ``and of course he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaftesbury Avenue,
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Lane
</P>
<P>
   The city's most theater-packed avenue is Shaftesbury, sometimes
called the Broadway of London _ somewhat misleadingly. Where
Broadway is a colossal tribute to advertising, with most theaters
on side streets, Shaftesbury is a more human-scaled, gently sloping
boulevard with the frontages of vintage playhouses. With the
rounded black taxis (like derbies on wheels) and red double-deckers
still cruising the lanes, Shaftesbury looks much as it did in
Gielgud's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   The Palace (1891) anchors the north end of the row like a
magnificent chateau. It's traditionally hosted splashy musicals;
``Les Miserables'' has held court since 1986. When Andrew Lloyd
Webber bought the theater in 1982, he revamped the terra-cotta
facade and stripped the godawful plum paint inside to reveal
beautiful veined marble and Mexican onyx.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, north on Charing Cross Road, is the Phoenix,
where ``Blood Brothers'' is in its 11th year. With its shimmering,
mirrored, art deco foyer and swanky Noel Coward Bar, it looks like
the perfect setting for a Coward play, and it was. The Phoenix
opened in 1930 with the Master playing opposite Gertrude Lawrence
in his ``Private Lives.'' Coward convinced an obscure Laurence
Olivier to play the dull stuffed shirt, saying, ``Young man, you'd
better be in a success for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Double back down Charing Cross to Cambridge Circus and ask
directions through the marvelously skewed side streets to Upper St.
Martin's Lane. Go south, then left on Garrick and left again into
an alley blocked off by the Lamb &AMP; Flag, a true London pub. Dryden
lunched here before 1700, when it was called the Bucket of Blood
(prize fights were staged in the alley) and Dickens was a regular.
Nothing beats the weekend lunch fare of sliced-to-order roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding. There's a charming little framed caricature
of Sir Ralph Richardson in the back room.
</P>
<P>
   Stroll to the foot of St. Martin's to a square where two great
actor-managers, David Garrick (1717-79) and Henry Irving
(1838-1905), are commemorated. There's a fine statue of Irving,
first actor to be knighted. He long held court with Ellen Terry in
his imposing Lyceum, over on Wellington Street, where ``The Lion
King'' now roars.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Irving is the beautifully restored Garrick Theatre
(1889), gold leaf shining. Former manager Arthur Bouchier is
reputed to be the resident ghost, sometimes heard applauding or
felt warmly slapping actors' backs in the private stairway to his
attic quarters. If you see the thrilling ``An Inspector Calls''
here, look at the stalls (orchestra) entrance for the copy of a
lost Gainsborough portrait of Garrick. Then contemplate the fact
that this theater also hosted four of the 15 years in the run ``No
Sex Please, We're British.''
</P>
<P>
   There in a nutshell is the mad, mad world of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hither and Yon
</P>
<P>
   Here are some scattered theatrical destinations that don't tie
in easily to a walking circuit:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Poets Corner of Westminster Abbey has stone memorials to
Shakespeare, Garrick, Sheridan, et al. But why does Goldsmith
(``She Stoops to Conquer'') rate a bust over the chapel door and
Oscar Wilde rate, apparently, nothing? Politics. On the stained
glass high overhead you'll see that the scandal-plagued playwright
was finally given a pane with his name a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shakespeare's Globe Theatre is a stunning Thames-side
restoration of the bard's 1599 playhouse, only a few hundred yards
from the Globe's original site near the south end of Southwark
Bridge. There are performances May-September, daytime tours and
exhibits year-round.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Old Vic, a rental theater no longer home to great
classical troupes, is also south of the river. Its charmingly
modest 19th century facade signals that it originally catered to
the working-class neighborhood with music hall and ``blood bucket''
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Royal Court Theatre on fashionable Sloane Square has for
100 years been the traditional home for the most distinguished
progressive plays, from Shaw to Osborne to Caryl Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Tower of London has held characters from ``Anne of a
Thousand Days'' to ``A Man for All Seasons.'' Recently, skeletons
of the ``boy princes,'' murdered in ``Richard III,'' were uncovered
here, but it's debatable whether the real-life king really
dispatched them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Royal National Theatre, over Waterloo Bridge from the
Strand, lacks charm (a concrete fortress, 1970s-style) but its
productions are often London's best. Shuler Hensley of the recent
``Oklahoma!'' says RNT's cafes and river-view verandas are tops for
people-watching: ``Look! Ian McKellen!,'' cries the Marietta-bred
thespian, re-enacting a recent sighting. ``I am not worthy!''

 &HT;    Satire on soft drink giant seems like the real thing
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Halfway through his satirical novel about a cola marketing
campaign, Australian Max Barry added an X to his name. Now he's
Maxx. It's just the sort of thing a sharp marketing executive would
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke,'' says Barry, 26, whose fictional ``Syrup''
(Viking, $23.95) is set in the offices of the Coca-Cola Co. in Los
Angeles. ``Creative types live in mortal fear of someone forgetting
who they are, so they change their names to make them stand out
more. I had fun with this idea in `Syrup' with characters like
Scat, 6 and Sneaky Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, Scat (formerly George Michael Holloway) and a
female Coke marketing executive named 6 pitch the concept of a new
cola product. The soft drink would be sold in a black can with a
four-letter name that's unprintable in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After their idea is stolen by his friend, Sneaky Pete, Scat and
6 finagle their way into Pete's dream project: a $140 million
feature film about Coca-Cola starring Tom Cruise and Gwyneth
Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Barry says, he never set foot in a Coca-Cola office.
In fact, the Melbourne resident visited America only once _ and
that was for three days. Everything he knows about the United
States he learned through television, movies, sports, music,
advertising and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book isn't set in any kind of American reality,'' Barry
says. ``It's a Madison Avenue type of culture. In Australia, we get
so many American TV shows and American music, it was easy to use
those. Even in (Australian) business, the American corporate
culture dominates.''
</P>
<P>
   Book done on lunch break
</P>
<P>
   Barry used Coca-Cola in the book simply as an example of a big
marketing company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never intended to be a satire of that particular
company,'' Barry says. ``When my publisher bought the book, there
was some concern about whether it was libelous _ there were some
things in there about exploding Coke cans _ but the legal
department said they thought as long as I wasn't basing it on
anything Coke had done, we were all right. So far, I haven't heard
a thing from Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry absorbed the politics of corporate culture while working
in the marketing department of Hewlett-Packard in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was baptism by fire as to how a big company works. That's
how I got the idea for the setting. Ever since I studied marketing
in college, I've been fascinated by the concept of selling stuff to
people where the quality of the product is not nearly as important
as the way it's presented. ''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the book during lunch, sitting in his car and tapping
away on his laptop computer for 40 minutes. He attributes the
short, punchy chapters to his abbreviated lunch breaks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he sprinkles excerpts from marketing case studies
throughout the book. For example, when marketing cola, ``Never
never discuss taste. Taste is 90 percent psychological, and it
doesn't sell cola; it's roughly a tenth as important as image.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some good early reviews (Spin magazine called the novel
``a deft satirical indictment of an industry that makes its living
pushing satire''), ``Syrup'' has not attracted a lot of Hollywood
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a few inquiries,'' Barry said, ``but I think the
problem is, the book is about a movie, and Hollywood doesn't like
to make movies about movies. That may change after I send Gwyneth
Paltrow a copy of the novel.''

 &HT;    The slide rules during dog days
 &HT;    EDS: Embargoed for Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dog days got you sniffing around for a way to cool your heels
this summer? Then consider the stylishness and simplicity of the
hottest and coolest trend in footwear: the mule.
</P>
<P>
   The toe can be open or closed, the heel high or low, the look
sporty or comfy. This backless shoe that slides on your foot is
turning up in every style, color and fabric imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Women have worn mules for decades. But the shoe came back on the
scene in the 1970s when Candies slides were popular and re-emerged
again in the 1990s. Now men have joined the mule team by sporting
versions that are masculine enough for a guy and sexy enough to
merit a double take.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question it's a hot summer look,'' said Susan
Forehand, fashion and public relations director at Saks Fifth
Avenue in Phipps Plaza. ``A person who buys that shoe has a high
awareness of what's happening in fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   To look good in mules, obey a few crucial rules:
</P>
<P>
   Never wear them with hose or socks, and don't put them on crusty
feet that are begging for a pedicure. (At the very least, buff your
heels and trim your toenails.)
</P>
<P>
   Women can slide them on with capri pants or cropped slacks,
ankle-length skirts and dresses, or laid-back beachwear.
</P>
<P>
   Men's mules go well with cargo pants, walking shorts or
pleatless slacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the shoe look new this season is the pant you put
with it,'' Forehand says. ``That makes the statement.''
</P>
<P>
   But fashion experts say there's one place the versatile mule
doesn't belong _ in the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a dress down Friday situation it's certainly appropriate.
But for more traditional businesses, there are other
alternatives,'' advises Jill Hinson, fashion director for Nordstrom
stores.

<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: For departures through Sept. 4, a sale fare of
$796 round trip to London has been extended by several airlines
through Aug. 4. British Air flies nonstop, and connecting service
is offered by Northwest/KLM, USAir and American airlines. Delta,
which also offers nonstops, had not joined the extended sale at
press time. Requirements include a seven-day advance purchase, a
Saturday night stay and a 30-day-maximum visit.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accommodations: Good rooms for less than $150 a night are
scarce, but sharing a bath with one or two other rooms brings the
price down, as seen in double-occupancy rates for the Jenkins Hotel
and Cartref House. The cozy, 14-room Jenkins (171-387-2067), a
converted Bloomsbury town house at 45 Cartwright Gardens, is a
value at $109, including breakfast. It's hard to believe such a
quiet backwater is so walkable from West End playhouses. The
11-room Cartref (171-730-6176), too, is a snug ex-townhouse, though
its pleasant Belgravia address, 129 Ebury St., is closer to Sloane
Square and Buckingham Palace than it is to most theaters. The
Cartref's a bargain at 55 pounds ($93.50, shared phone in foyer),
including a breakfast jovially served by host Derek James.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tours, attractions, theaters: London Walks (171-624-3978)
offers tours for all kinds of interests, including theaterphiles,
for about $8.50. The Theatre Museum at Covent Garden (entrance on
Russell Street) is open 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays,
$7.65 (children 16 and under free). For London stage listings and
reservations, call TheaterTheatre at 1-800-661-8587 or on the Web:

 &HT;    Rub elbows with past and present in the city rich with
theatrical secrets, characters and scenes around every corner
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 18.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When the theater lover makes a pilgrimage to this most
stage-struck metropolis, it's a two-for-one deal. Enjoy an exciting
present _ bask in a glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than painting is to Paris, or music to Vienna, theater
is the steady flame of London's spirit, burning as bright today as
it did 100 or 400 years ago. With just a few breaks in the action,
the torch has passed proudly from Shakespeare to Congreve to
Garrick to Kean to Shaw to Olivier to the current galaxy of Michael
Gambon, Judi Dench, Anthony Sher, Trevor Nunn, Fiona Shaw. ... The
only problem is trying to decide how much time you should spend in
a theater seat and how much on your feet, taking in the great
open-air show of venerable playhouses, smoke-cured pubs, benevolent
theater ghosts (don't laugh _ there are still sightings) and mossy
monuments to artists of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, so many centuries, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   You can always, though, experience past and present in a single
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you're at the 1903 Albery Theatre watching ``Plenty,''
David Hare's still-scathing 1978 play about an England spiritually
numbed by affluence, starring the stunning Cate Blanchett, who
shone onscreen as young queen ``Elizabeth.'' Your eye wanders up
past the chandelier to the carving of a lyre held by angels over
the stage, and you recall that Sir John Gielgud called it one of
the most ``poetic'' bits of decor in London. It was in this house,
then called the New Theatre, that Gielgud in 1935 famously
alternated the roles of Romeo and Mercutio with Laurence Olivier,
and Gielgud grew quite jealous of the more dashing actor.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of friendly rivalries, let's say you step across the
alley to Salisbury's pub. In the mellow ambience of red plush and
frosted glass, you're debating the provocative ``Plenty'' with your
companion when you notice an empty corner booth. Two ghosts come
slowly into focus: Olivier and Ralph Richardson, deep in
conversation. The old pals, who called each other Larry and Cocky,
lunched here often during their stewardship of the Old Vic troupe,
which had a legendary residence at the New when the Vic playhouse
suffered bomb damage during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier recalled one of those Salisbury lunches as tense but
funny. He had signed up to play Lear for the same reason Richardson
claimed dibs on Cyrano: as a pre-emptive strike. Each grabbed the
role that he knew the other man craved, and would surely play
triumphantly. Larry kept needling, Cocky refused to ``swap.''
Reviews suggest that Richardson got the better end of the gambit.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the scenes that, with a little imagination, play out
among the streets, lobbies and courtyards of London's theater
land.Dan Hulbert writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Bounty of gifts helps you walk away from pain
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We had a family emergency. My daughter, who should have been
hoeing the garden or washing the dog, was busy having a stroke _
the kind of something or other that goes whindering off to your
brain, scaring you to death.
</P>
<P>
   We packed up nightgowns and books and television tapes and
hurried to the hospital. She had no business being in precarious
health, I told her. It was my time. So we decided to go in tandem,
me in one room, her just down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't move parts of her body, paralysis, they said. I
could move everything, and when I got home, I found I had been
endowed with a splendid collection of treasures. My kitchen table
held a See Rock City birdhouse, a spirit lifter if there ever was
one. My hands lifted it, my heart soared.
</P>
<P>
   But best of all, there was this marvelous walking stick. No, I
don't want a walking stick. I pride myself on using my own two feet
and such legs as they are. But they have acted funny lately,
catching on carpet, stumbling on small, innocuous blades of grass,
kicking my dog in his sleeping side.
</P>
<P>
   So my friend, former Gov. Ernest Vandiver, decided to take
matters in hand. I saw Ernie and Betty at the Capitol party for
Pete Wheeler of Veterans Services fame. Ernie was carrying a
splendid wood walking stick with an artfully shaped marble handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send you one,'' he said. And he did.
</P>
<P>
   It's as fine a walking stick as I ever saw, built in the
mountains in 1850, I think, and shaped and very comfortable to hold
on to. I had acquired a couple of other sticks recently. One had a
lithesome body curved around it _ just like a snake, though my
friend Nan said it was a vine, not a snake. (I saw a head and a
mouth and didn't believe her.)
</P>
<P>
   The other is a copper metal number, which my grandson said he
picked up at a yard sale, knowing I would value it more than
something store-bought. It happened that he did get a store-bought
one and charged it to me. But it can't hold a candle to the
beautiful mountain marble one, and I fully expect to outwalk
everybody going and coming with this one.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about a sudden onset of unexpected illness, as
most Southerners know, is the bounty that seems to grow on your
kitchen table in your absence. Birdhouse, walking stick, ham,
beans, cake, a beautiful spill of the prettiest tomatoes of the
season, even muffins and breakfast bread. Even bottles of the
finest beer to drink.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit like all-day-sing-with-dinner-on-the-ground, although
we miss the singing and the preaching. I suppose the habit of
gift-giving is one of the imperishable graces of our society.
</P>
<P>
   I hope it is, because with illness striking families
unexpectedly, it's lovely to have ease and surprise strike too. I
think my daughter's health is going to be all right; I certainly
plan not to be talked into anything worse than slow walking. How
could I, with such a splendid marble-topped helper?

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of the ninth year of one of the longest economic
booms in U.S. history, the rate of inflation is precisely zero.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Labor Department reported Thursday, the closely
watched Consumer Price Index _ which measures changes in the price
of everything that American households buy, from candy bars to
health care _ failed to register even the tiniest change.
</P>
<P>
   Marking the second month in a row of no change in the index, it
is a moment as rare as it is sweet. Back-to-back zeroes (or
outright declines) have shown up just twice in the post-World War
II era: once in the spring of 1986, amid a stunning collapse in
world oil prices, and the other time in the winter of 1962, long
before Americans learned to regard inflation as one of life's
fixtures, like death and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, we're back to the '50s,'' said Jeffrey Frankel,
an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying trend in prices is still up slightly. Prices are
2 percent higher now than they were a year ago. But that is
actually a slower inflation pace than earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some important items, notably oil, have become more costly.
After falling for four consecutive years, energy prices jumped more
than 24 percent in the first six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the ``core'' inflation rate _ which excludes
volatile food and energy prices _ has risen more slowly in the
first half of this year than it did in 1998, at an annual rate of
1.6 percent versus 2.4 percent. The core rate edged up just a tenth
of a percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to search back and find a time when things were this
good,'' said Patrick Jackman, a Labor Department official in charge
of the government's monthly price survey of retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's inflation news cheered stock and bond investors, who
have lately been worried that the Federal Reserve was about to turn
down the party music _ as it did in 1994 and 1995 when it
engineered an increase of 3 percentage points in short-term
interest rates to take the edge off the country's exuberance.
Although the Fed did nudge a key rate up a bit last month,
investors are now more hopeful that the central bank will leave it
at that.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the government reported Thursday that jobless claims
increased 11,000, to 310,000, for the week that ended on July 10.
That was the highest number in a month, but still at a level
indicating a healthy job market.
</P>
<P>
   The good news on inflation has inspired a fascinating conundrum:
not so much why inflation drifted down in the 1990s as why it has
not crept up recently as unemployment has remained at its lowest
level in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the last six months, prices were behaving the way that
the conventional wisdom said they should,'' said Alan Blinder, an
economist at Princeton University who was vice chairman of the Fed
in the mid-1990s. ``But now we really have some explaining to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To see why, consider a bit of history. In the early 1980s,
inflation fell to 4 percent from 10 percent the old-fashioned way,
squeezed out of the economy by tight money and a deep recession
engineered by the Fed, whose chairman was then Paul Volcker. By the
end of the 1980s boom, it had moved back up to a 6 percent rate.
That is when Alan Greenspan, who became Fed chairman in 1987,
administered a smaller dose of castor oil, pushing rates higher and
helping send the economy into a brief, relatively shallow recession
that ended in early 1991. Inflation fell to 3 percent. Tighter
money in 1994 and 1995 knocked another point off the rate.
</P>
<P>
   No mystery there.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, most experts expected inflation to pick up as
unemployment kept dropping. But then came a shower of good luck.
The dollar strengthened, making imports cheaper. Energy prices
fell. The relentless rise in health care costs was interrupted as
many employers shifted to health maintenance organizations.
Computer prices, which had long between dropping 10 to 15 percent a
year, suddenly began declining at twice that rate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government made changes in the way it
measured consumer prices. In particular, it began to do a much
better job of picking up improvements in product quality. That
alone knocked more than half a percentage point off the official
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, still no mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, most of the factors that held inflation down _
falling energy prices, for example _ are no longer in force. Yet
inflation continues to shrink. Most remarkably, pay increases _
typically the most important ingredient in any lasting upturn in
inflation _ have moderated in recent months in the midst of the
tightest labor market in memory.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the apparent absence of inflation is a
surprising burst of productivity growth at a point in the business
cycle when bottlenecks typically start to appear and companies get
sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure if the situation will last. Allan Meltzer,
a monetarist at Carnegie Mellon University, is not alone in arguing
that inflation will turn up as soon as the rest of the world's
economies are back on track.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another possibility _ perhaps Americans have
finally stopped believing that inflation is inevitable. In the
1970s, Robert Lucas, a Nobel laureate, made the radical suggestion
that if the Fed could quell expectations of inflation by announcing
a credible game plan, inflation might disappear painlessly, without
high unemployment. His conservative theory did not fare well in the
initially painful unwinding of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But now it looks as if, at long last, Greenspan's credibility
and America's trust in him may be turning into a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

BARAK VOWS TO `INJECT NEW MOMENTUM' INTO MIDEAST TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak pledged Thursday
to ``inject new momentum'' into stalled Middle East talks and
declared the region at a decisive ``moment of truth'' in its quest
for a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   In his first official meeting with President Clinton, Barak also
declared that he was ready to meet with the Syrians to open another
peace track and stated that while he would not dismantle any
Israeli settlements in occupied lands, neither would he open new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made no secret of wanting the Middle East
conflict resolved on his watch, reiterated his promise that the
United States will help in any way possible to bring lasting peace
to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our intention to inject new momentum into the peace
process and to put it back on all tracks,'' Barak said as he and
Clinton appeared before reporters in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak retired to a nearly three hour meeting in the
more relaxed confines of the Yellow Oval Room in the White House's
residential quarters. The two, accompanied by their wives, later
flew for dinner to Camp David, site of the historic 1978 peace
agreement between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official reported Barak told Clinton that the Middle
East had reached a ``moment of truth,'' and he was ready for
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Middle East has suffered long enough,'' the Israeli
official said, describing Barak's talks with Clinton. ``We are
ready. This is the moment of truth. It's a fateful moment. There
are dangers, but we are ready to try to reduce them.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak will spend six days in the United States. He will return
to Washington on Sunday for a more official dinner at the White
House and will hold a second round of meetings with Clinton on
Monday. The amount of time spent with the president greatly exceeds
that of most world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Israel again walks bravely down the path of peace, America
will walk with you, ready to help in any way we can,'' Clinton told
Barak in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said his Washington trip follows several meeting with Arab
leaders where he ``assured them that we would work as partners,
with mutual trust, in order to overcome all challenges and
complications that are still awaiting us down the street. We agreed
that we needed to abide by the previous agreements signed by all
parties, including the Wye accords.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters if a meeting with Syrian President Hafez
Assad was possible, Barak said, ``We still wait to see when the
time comes, but I hope we'll be able to meet. It takes two to
tango. I am ready, the arena is ready, maybe the dancing instructor
is ready. We have to find opportunity and begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak reportedly told Clinton during their private session that
he was prepared for a ``painful compromise'' that would return the
captured Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also addressed the delicate issue of Jewish settlements in
occupied territories. ``I'm not going to build new ones, I'm not
going to dismantle any one of them. Israeli citizens are living in
them.'' Barak told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But he also told Clinton in private that the settlements would
remain under Israeli sovereignty and he had no intention of
returning Israel to its borders as they existed before the 1967
war. Israel expanded its territory to the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
the Golan Heights after that conflict with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's openness toward peace negotiations received a hearty
welcome at the White House where the administration wrangled for
years with Barak's hard-line predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak defeated Netanyahu in a landslide election in May,
following the collapse of the conservative government. Netanyahu
lost support from key coalition allies after he signed the Wye
River Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River accord called on Israeli to return to the the
Palestinian Authority an additional 13 percent of the occupied West
Bank in return for security pledges. The pact was brokered by
Clinton after around-the-clock sessions at the secluded Maryland
estate between Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also expanded on previous comments in which he suggested
that instead of exhausting his domestic political capital trying to
implement the Wye River pact, the Israelis and Palestinians should
move go directly to final status talks and try to resolve the most
sensitive remaining issues _ the question of Palestinian statehood
and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said his government would abide by the Wye requirements to
withdraw, but suggested it be done in combination with the opening
of final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said any changes would be implemented ``only through
an agreement with Arafat after mutual, open, frank and direct
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also reiterated statements he made to U.S. newspapers
earlier this week that the United States should play a lesser role
in the peace process than it has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the United States can contribute to the process
more as facilitator than as a kind of policeman, judge and
arbitrator at the same time,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he agreed, saying the United States only took a
greater role when it appeared the peace process was on the verge of
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what was necessary to keep it going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also restated the administration's position that
the issue of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel should be left to
the final status talks. Last week, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, pondering a race for the Senate from New York, sent a
letter to Jewish leaders there declaring Jerusalem the eternal
capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be doing nothing to prejudge the final status
issues,'' Clinton said, when asked about moving the U.S. Embassy
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Clinton last month signed a wavier
delaying moving of the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every individual member of Congress can express a personal
opinion, but because of the waiver, the United States does not have
to prejudge the final status issue. That's good,'' he said,
referring to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also found himself explaining a comment he made earlier
this week when he described feeling like ``a kid with a new toy''
at the prospect of Barak's visit. The remarked prompted a
controversy in Israel where the media viewed it as a patronizing
remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``In American English it means, `I'm very excited about the
prospect of the rejuvenation of the peace process,' and that's all
it means,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier, said the flap made him
feel like ``someone who got the mission of defusing a time bomb.''
He chastised the Israeli press for its ``tricky interpretation of
innocent favorable statements.''

HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A PHOENICIAN IN THE SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I saw that something was wrong when my cousin Anthony
and his wife, Linda, arrived at my sister's house just as we were
turning on the grill for our 4th of July barbecue. I gasped when I
saw him. Even though he and Linda had moved from New York earlier
this year to open a chiropractic office, his ``new resident''
status could not excuse what I saw. He had a tan. Not just any tan
but a deep, bronze, tan like he was the sun child of George
Hamilton and Jackie Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you crazy?'' I yelled to him. ``I told you not to go
outside! You don't live in Moscow, you know! You moved to Cancer
Land!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I played a little golf,'' he said with a wry smile. ``Oh
yes, laugh now,'' I said pointing at him. ``You keep playing Sunny
Bunny, and in three months' time your head will be nothing but a
talking football.''
</P>
<P>
   He still didn't believe me, and I know he's one of thousands of
new Phoenix residents lined like corpses around pools, basting
themselves with enough Bain de Soleil to turn themselves into honey
baked hams.
</P>
<P>
   I'm serious. I really do believe that summertime in Phoenix
needs to be declared as a State of Emergency, I really do. When you
can't drink out of the hose in your front yard without boiling your
innards, something is very wrong. That's called a hostile
environment in my book. Nature is not your friend if it's equipped
with the potential to transform your brain into eight pounds of
walnut fudge within two hours if you're not wearing a hat.
</P>
<P>
   My family moved here in 1972, when what is now the Squaw Peak
Parkway was nothing but two, unlit mountain roads _ one going in,
and one going out; Metrocenter was being built, and everyone bought
their clothes at JCPenney or Woolco because that's all there was. I
know I'm scaring some of you, but my point is that this will be my
27th summer here, and every time I survive another, I swear it will
be my last.
</P>
<P>
   This April, faced with the prospect of living through the
equivalent of Hell with a couple of spigots for the next 180 days,
I was hoping that I could eat enough sugar in one sitting to slip
into a self-induced coma until the weather was fit for human
beings. When I woke up six hours later with a migraine headache and
an extra butt cheek, I knew all too well I was about to face
another summer driving around with mitts on my hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the full swing of summer, I've realized that I cannot
wage war against that which I cannot see. I can only try to protect
myself and my family. You see, I consider the heat to be an entity
like something in a Stephen King novel; it is OUT THERE, it WILL
CONSUME THE WHOLE TOWN, and not even Sean McLaughlin _ wearing a
yellow rain slicker, carrying an ax and wielding telekinetic
weather powers _ can save us.
</P>
<P>
   Look outside. My block is full of families with kids, but in the
daylight, there's more activity in a catacomb than there is on my
street. Last week, I forgot to water my yard for one day, and
within 24 hours, it looked like the official landscape of Phoenix _
a dirt lot. I'm playing with a Ouija board every day in hopes that
I can summon a spirit just so I can walk through a cold spot. At
night, I put on my pajamas, jump in the shower and climb, dripping
like a sore, into bed. I have transformed the cups of my bra into
twin ice buckets. I bought an oscillating fan capable of tropical
storm-strength winds, though we have the problem of waking up 4
feet from where we went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what an $800 electric bill looks like? I do. It
comes equipped with special tools so that you can remove your
kidney or lung and remit that as payment if you're a little short
on cash. After I opened that bill, I understood all too well why
the words ``SHUT THAT DAMN DOOR!'' were the most commonly spoken
words when I was a child and why we ate nothing but Carl Buddig
meats and Top Ramen during summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really better than being cold? Don't fool yourself into
thinking that just because our houses aren't buried in snow during
the winter that we don't get snowbound. I have friends who refuse
to leave their homes in the daylight until the beginning of
October. We may not be able to shovel our misery, but we can sure
soak it up with an absorbent paper towel as it leaks from our
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now to address those inquiring minds who are, at this very
moment, scrambling to their AOL accounts to ask why I just don't
move, the answer is NO WAY, JOSE. If I moved to someplace that I
liked, my life would be complete, and if you flaunt that kind of
happiness in front of God, he/she will find cause to simply strike
you dead.
</P>
<P>
   If it's slightly inconvenient to become a creature of the night,
I do have several tips for the newer members of the Phoenix sauna.
A parking space with shade is worth more than your car. NEVER fall
asleep in the sun, since you will not fully understand the meaning
of ``mercy killing'' until you've experienced a full-body Phoenix
sunburn. If you forget or misplace your driving mitts, socks or a
pair of maxi pads will act as nice substitutes. Be kind to others;
if you have the slightest inkling that spandex is not the best
fabric for you, refrain, keeping in mind that spandex is a
privilege, never a right. Never, ever touch the handle of a
shopping cart unless you have proof it's been in the store for at
least an hour and has completely returned to its former state as a
solid. Look before you sit. Remember that a coin exposed to
sunlight on a car seat for more that 40 seconds ceases being pocket
change and becomes a branding iron once it makes contact with skin.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, if you decide to take a fun day trip or hike into
the desert with a group of friends, just expect someone to wander
off and die.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, this will all be over. And then it will start again.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, are you listening? &QL;

years old and lives in Houston nowadays, is the most traveled man
in space; he was the ninth man to walk on the moon.

<P>
   Brown expressed to Winans his enthusiasm for some kind of
homage, noting that the California Academy of Sciences is
considering a proper tribute.  &UR; Meagan Levitin &LR;  at the academy says
discussions are under way, spurred by the mayor and Supervisors

<P>
   VRANJE, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslavian generals, touring the country
to stanch protests and dismantle roadblocks set up by angry army
reservists owed money for duty in Kosovo, are dousing one
rebellious fire after another.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, the generals have apparently succeeded in
redirecting some of the popular rage from President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia toward the latest enemy of Serbia: Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Army reservists in Vranje, as in other cities in southern
Serbia, took down street barricades after Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic,
the commander in southern Serbia, promised that back salaries would
be paid in two weeks. But the general also perpetuated for his
former soldiers the newest myth taking root in Serbia. The country
was not defeated by NATO bombs, he said, but was betrayed and sold
out by Russia, a country now as perfidious as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to reach a peaceful settlement,'' the general told
some 100 reservists in Vranje, ``but this was not accepted. We
approached the Russians, who were our friends, and made a plan. The
Russians accepted the plan. We would leave the Pristina corps and
our special Ministry of Interior police in Kosovo and the U.N.
forces would be allowed to enter. Everything would be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Russians then came back and said we had to accept the
Western plan, that we had to take it or leave it,'' he said. ``We
were told that if we refused the plan, every city in Serbia would
be razed to the ground. The bridges in Belgrade would be destroyed.
The crops would all be burned. Everyone would die. Look at the
Russians. They have not helped us.''
</P>
<P>
   So, once again, begins the flight from reality that has plagued
the Serbs during the wars in the former Yugoslavia, one that pins
the defeat not on the leadership of Milosevic and Serbian
nationalism, but on nefarious outside forces arrayed to crush the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   While many soldiers and reservists remain critical of the
Yugoslav president, many also seem ready to accept this version of
events. There is little atonement for Kosovo, or for Serbian
attacks in Bosnia or Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were betrayed in Kosovo,'' said Ivica Mladenovic, 23, who
served in Kosovo and took part in the road blockages. ``Our fight
has been useless. I wait for the day when we are ordered to take
Kosovo back. I will be the first to volunteer. Now the Kosovo
Liberation Army holds Kosovo. The Serbs are being driven out. The
grandfather of my friend had his eyes gouged out four days ago and
his body mutilated.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and some of this region's 20,000 newly discharged
reservists, all with closely cropped hair, linger in Vranje's
street cafes and freely acknowledge that Kosovo Albanians died in
droves during the campaign, yet seem unable to ascribe blame for
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ministry of Interior police had the job to punish those
who were connected with the Kosovo Liberation Army,'' Mladenovic
said. ``The Albanians were not afraid of the army. They were afraid
of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   The atrocities committed by Serbian forces are viewed by many as
an inevitable consequence of war, somehow beyond human
responsibility. Special police and members of Serbian paramilitary
units stationed in Kosovo show photos of Kosovo Albanians, their
hands tied behind their backs, kneeling in rows awaiting execution,
several army soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   War stories by men decked out in gold chains and expensive
watches, part of the loot from the province, are told with a moral
numbness, these soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Serbs know what happened in Kosovo before NATO came,''
said Vuk Obradovic, the editor of Vranjske Novine, a weekly
independent paper. ``They know what crimes were committed, because
the people who come here from Kosovo, the soldiers and the
refugees, tell us what happened. My Serb friend from Kosovo said,
`I must escape. Evil has been done here and I can't stay.' He's not
the only one saying this. People know what the Serbs have done.''
</P>
<P>
   But this acknowledgment is not made in public. The paper, after
this week interviewing a Serbian refugee who said he understood why
the Kosovo Albanians wanted to exact revenge, was asked by the
refugee not to print the statement because he feared reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last 10 years, the regime has created a situation
where Albanians are no longer seen as equals,'' Obradovic said.
``Because of this, no one feels guilty for what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The combustible mixture of defeat, anger and denial is one that
Milosevic has played to his advantage in the past, and may use
again, despite rising rage at his policies and Yugoslavia's
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Besides redirecting reservists' rage toward the Russians, Gen.
Pavkovic also tried to spook the malcontents, warning that once the
last pockets of Serbs were driven from Kosovo, NATO forces would
move to occupy Vranje and Leskovac, another southern Serbian town
where there have been daily protests against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Any respite from the protests may, however, prove temporary. The
general admitted that the promised back pay _ totaling $100 million
_ may have to come in the form of coupons for utilities and food
rather than currency. A government official in Belgrade, worried
that the army would not be able to pay by its self-imposed deadline
of July 28, said the reservists' barricades may go back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows what will happen then,'' he said, asking not to be
named. ``It may just be anarchic violence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trees, walls and lamp posts in Vranje are covered with paper
death notices, most with the grainy black and white photos of
soldiers and police killed during the war. The clusters of young
men who walk past the notices often comment quietly on those they
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to have died for something,'' said Zoran Stankovic,
24. ``We just don't yet know what it was.''

ULSTER ASSEMBLY DISINTEGRATES AMID RECRIMINATION, FARCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND JOHN O'FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ A year after it was inaugurated as the future for a
place held back by the past, the 108-member Northern Ireland
Assembly collapsed Thursday amid a sea of recrimination,
resignation and farce.
</P>
<P>
   While the British and Irish governments insisted that the
failure to form a local power-sharing government was only a
temporary setback, and that they had ordered a review of the
inability of the parties in Northern Ireland to implement the Good
Friday Agreement of 1998, the scenes on the assembly floor did not
bode well for its future or the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, are scheduled to meet Tuesday to chart a course out
of the dead end the peace process has run into. But privately,
British and Irish diplomats were admitting that the assembly would
not sit for at least six weeks, and that the peace process had been
set back even further.
</P>
<P>
   As has been expected for several weeks, efforts to revive the
stalled peace process collapsed because of a dispute between the
Ulster Unionists, who represent middle-class Protestants in
Northern Ireland, and Sinn Fein, which is allied with the Irish
Republican Army. The unionists refuse to form a local government
with Sinn Fein until the IRA begins disarming, while Sinn Fein
accuses the unionists of trying to rewrite the Good Friday
Agreement, which made no linkage between the formation of a local
government and IRA disarming.
</P>
<P>
   It is seldom, if ever, that Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams and
the fundamentalist Protestant preacher-politician Rev. Ian Paisley
agree on anything, but both described the events on the assembly
floor at Stormont as farce. But despite seeing eye to eye on that
matter, Paisley's members heckled Adams mercilessly as Adams
appealed for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists, the largest party in Northern Ireland, and
its leader David Trimble boycotted the session. Fifteen minutes
before the assembly sat, Trimble and his party leaders held a press
conference outside their headquarters in downtown Belfast to
announce they would not nominate the three candidates they were due
on a 10-member cabinet that would oversee the assembly's work.
</P>
<P>
   After Paisley's party refused to put forward candidates, and the
Alliance Party, which draws members from both the Catholic
nationalist and Protestant unionist communities, also refused,
Catholic nationalist members of the assembly from Sinn Fein and the
Social Democratic and Labor Party eventually accounted for all 10
seats.
</P>
<P>
   But because the cabinet can by law only be formed with
cross-community representation, the nominations were invalidated
and British Secretary of State Mo Mowlam ordered the assembly
adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   In the most farcical scene of the day, the assembly speaker,
John Alderdice, turned to Trimble's empty chair and asked the
absent assembly leader to nominate his party's ministers for the
cabinet. Alderdice dutifully waited the five alloted minutes before
moving onto the next party.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's most dramatic scene, Seamus Mallon, the deputy
leader of the assembly, resigned, saying he was disgusted that Sinn
Fein's efforts to compromise on the arms dispute had been dismissed
by the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, and I say this more in sorrow than in anger,
those efforts have not just been spurned, they have been scorned,''
said Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party
who accused the unionists of using ``this crisis to bleed more
concessions out of the governments.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinary verbal attack by Mallon, the
gentlemanly, stoic politician from South Armagh who seldom uses the
melodramatic rhetoric so common here. But as Mallon sat down and
fought to control his emotions, it was obvious that even he was
overwhelmed by the sense that things were slipping away just 15
months after the euphoria of signing the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon called on Trimble to resign also, and unionist sources
said Trimble may do so Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who resisted an all-out press by Blair to accept a
compromise that would have seen formation of the government first
and IRA disarming second, said his party would not sit in
government with a party ``inextricably linked'' to the IRA, saying
to do so would make a mockery out of the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   There was little respite for the democratic process. When Adams
nominated Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator and a
former IRA chief of staff, as the minister for agriculture,
hecklers from Paisley's party shouted ``fertilizer, fertilizer,'' a
reference to the IRA's use of fertilizer bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Washington, President Clinton seemed to capture the
bewilderment of the outside world, which sees the stalemate as one
easily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said unionists and republicans ``are having a fight over
who goes first and acting today as if the whole thing could be
abandoned over that. That cannot be allowed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in London, Blair agreed, saying, ``a summer break for
dialogue and time to consider the deal will help.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, the former US Senate majority leader who
chaired the negotiations that led to last year's Good Friday
Agreement, agreed that a break until September would do the peace
process good. Mitchell was in London to receive an award from Queen
Elizabeth for his work in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Dublin, Ahern asked that the parties refrain from
recrimination, and said only the building of trust between the
parties would allow the process to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the House of Commons, a downcast Mowlam insisted the
setback was only temporary and refused to apportion blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to indulge in blame and recrimination,'' she
said. ``Today is not the day. The last thing the people of Northern
Ireland need is a breakout of recrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Paisley dared to call Thursday a ``good day for Northern
Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy has triumphed,'' the fiery orator thundered, ``and
there are no IRA men in the government of Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adams warned unionists that their intransigence came with a
price. While the institutions created by the Good Friday Agreement
have been put on hold, Adams noted, other aspects that unionists
abhor have not, including the release of paramilitary prisoners and
the creation of equality measures to address systematic
discrimination against Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Adams called on Blair to stand up to the unionists and move the
process forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the Good Friday Agreement prevails, or
the unionist veto prevails,'' Adams said.

HEALTH OFFICIALS SUSPEND USE OF VACCINE TO PREVENT INFANT
DIARRHEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif., Minn.)  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal health officials called Thursday for the immediate
suspension of a vaccine recently recommended for all infants to
protect against rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea
in infants and young children.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it took the
extraordinary action because a program to monitor side effects
suggested a link between the vaccine, licensed last year, and 20
nonfatal cases of a painful blockage of the bowel called
intussusception.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no conclusive evidence that the vaccine causes
the bowel condition, CDC officials said the data are strongly
suggestive. They said they considered it prudent to halt rotavirus
vaccinations until at least November. The bowel condition seems to
develop about one to three weeks after rotavirus vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should now be giving rotavirus vaccine to anyone,''
said Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for CDC.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was developed at the National Institutes of Health
and is licensed to Wyeth-Ayerst of St. Davids, Pa., a division of
American Home Products Corp., which sells it as RotaShield. One
million infants have received the vaccine, a spokesman for
Wyeth-Ayerst said, and the company is cooperating with federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has been approved for use in 13 European countries,
but has not been marketed there because Wyeth-Ayerst lacked a
sufficient supply, a spokesman for the drug company said. He said
the company will not market the vaccine in Europe until the bowel
condition problem is clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of bowel obstruction were noted in experimental trials
that were required before the vaccine was approved for licensing,
but not in unusual numbers. The FDA required studies to monitor the
incidence of the condition among infants who received the vaccine.
Information collected in those studies led the CDC to recommend a
halt to rotavirus vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   By November, the CDC expects to clarify what role, if any, the
vaccine plays in the development of bowel obstruction. The federal
agency, based in Atlanta, has undertaken a study of the vaccine
with health officials in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vaccine is still licensed by the Food and Drug
Administration,'' Dr. Melinda Wharton, a CDC epidemiologist and
expert on childhood vaccines, said Thursday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a highly effective vaccine, and we don't want to take
this disease prevention tool away from practitioners in the United
States unless there is a real good reason to do that,'' Dr. Wharton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rotavirus vaccine is injected three times _ at 2, 4 and 6 months
of age. Infants who have already received one or two shots should
not receive another, CDC officials said in their weekly report.
</P>
<P>
   Intussusception is rare and of unknown cause, although some
studies have hinted at a link to other viruses. The condition
occurred long before Aug. 31, 1998, when the FDA licensed the first
vaccine against rotavirus, which is the biggest killer from
diarrheal illness among children around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The condition results when one part of the bowel slides inward,
like a telescope, into another part of the bowel. In severe cases,
a previously healthy infant suddenly screams in paroxysms of pain.
The screaming can last for several minutes, then abate, only to
recur and become cyclical.
</P>
<P>
   Other symptoms include persistent vomiting and a bowel movement
that contains blood or appears black. In examining the abdomen, a
doctor often can feel a knot from the telescoped bowel and make a
tentative diagnosis. A barium enema and X-rays are used to confirm
the condition.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the enema can straighten out the telescoped bowel.
But in others, surgery is required. Of the first 15 cases
investigated, eight infants underwent surgery to repair the bowel
and one had a piece of bowel removed.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and caretakers should immediately call a doctor if a
child develops such symptoms, the CDC said. The agency also alerted
doctors to consider the possibility of bowel obstruction in an
infant that had recently received rotavirus vaccination.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Concern about the vaccine arose about four weeks ago when an
epidemiologist noticed an unusual number of intussusception cases
in seven states involved in the monitoring system that the CDC and
the FDA use, Dr. Wharton said.
</P>
<P>
   The reports came from doctors, Wyeth-Ayerst and parents. After
sorting out duplicate reports and confirming that the cases were
intussusception, the CDC team began to see a consistent pattern in
the timing of the bowel condition following vaccination, Dr.
Wharton said.
</P>
<P>
   Two additional reports strongly influenced the decision, Dr.
Wharton said.
</P>
<P>
   One report came from officials of the Minnesota Health
Department. The other came from doctors at Northern California
Kaiser Permanente who are conducting a post-licensing safety study
for Wyeth-Ayerst. But both studies suggested an increased risk,
although they involved small numbers of infants.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC then joined with health officials in 15 states to
conduct a study involving more than 2,000 infants. That study is
expected to be completed by October when a committee on
immunizations holds its next regular meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the consistency of the findings that raised concerns to
the point that we felt a postponement was the prudent thing to
do,'' Dr. Wharton said.
</P>
<P>
   The November suspension date is a reflection of the seasonal
nature of rotavirus infection, which usually occurs in the winter
and spring. Each year, rotavirus infection causes diarrhea in about
3.5 million American children, sends 50,000 to the hospital and
kills 20.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of the RotaShield vaccine is the latest in a
string of misfortunes for Wyeth-Ayerst and its parent, American
Home Products. Aside from its two failed merger attempts last year,
the company recently withdrew several of its drugs from the market
over health concerns and announced last month that its
second-quarter earnings would not meet analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The possible demise of the RotaShield vaccine should not dent
American Home Products' overall performance. The drug was projected
by analysts to be a small seller _ just $100 million in sales this
year and $200 million in 2000. Some analysts said Thursday that
they did not expect RotaShield to ever return to the market, and if
it did, nervous doctors would be likely to shun it.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how investors would react, given that American
Home Products made an announcement about the vaccine after the New
York Stock Exchange had closed Thursday. Shares of American Home
Products, which is based in Madison, N.J., closed Thursday at
$54.875, down 12.5 cents.

ADMINISTRATION TRIES TO PLAY DOWN TIMING OF CHINA'S ANNOUNCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., N.J., N.Y.) (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to contain a budding crisis in Asia, the
Clinton administration tried Thursday to play down the timing and
significance of China's declaration that it was capable of making
neutron bombs and miniaturized nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional Republicans said Beijing's assertion validated
a congressional inquiry that accused China of stealing U.S. nuclear
secrets, and was timed precisely to intimidate Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows the Cox report was hard-hitting and has caused the
Chinese some angst,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who heads the
House Intelligence Committee and who served on the special House
panel headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Chinese are saying to Taiwan, `Pay attention, we've
got this,''' Goss said. ``It's a very dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Taiwan and China rose after Taiwan's president,
Lee Teng-hui, said over the weekend that his government would no
longer adhere to the principle that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan
were two parts of the same country. The announcement stunned and
angered China, which has always reserved the right to use military
force, if necessary, to fulfill its goal of reunification with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has staked out a muted position since the war
of words erupted, not wanting to inflame the debate. At the White
House and State Department Thursday, administration spokesmen
refused to draw the conclusion that China's announcement of its
nuclear-bomb building ability was intended to intimidate Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the connection,'' said State Department spokesman
James Rubin. ``I don't think it's any secret to the people of the
world that China has a very small nuclear capability.''
</P>
<P>
   But under repeated questioning from reporters, Rubin
acknowledged that the administration was troubled by the heated
dispute. ``We are concerned,'' he said. ``We regard the statements
and the reaction to the statements both as unhelpful to the people
concerned and to the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that under the Taiwan Relations Act, ``any effort to
determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means would
be a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area
and of grave concern to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same, Rubin said the saber-rattling was, so far, just
that. ``We haven't seen any change in posture that would indicate
an escalation of this situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republicans and some Democrats expressed little
doubt that China's announcement was carefully calculated to
frighten Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was meant as a threat to the democratic island of Taiwan,''
said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
International Relations Committee. ``I do not think we can dismiss
the possibility that China could use the neutron bomb _ a weapon
that has never been used _ against Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who just returned from a trip to
China and North Korea, said, ``There's no doubt that the choosing
of this moment to announce they have the neutron bomb is not
coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many lawmakers said China's assertions, while
worrisome, were unlikely by themselves to alter the congressional
debate later this summer on extending China's trade status with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ham-fisted and clumsy, but unless it lasts for more than
a few days, it will ultimately be ignored,'' Cox said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox Committee accused China of having stolen information on
the designs of the neutron bomb, which kills people with enhanced
radiation while leaving buildings intact, and the W-88, the most
advanced miniaturized nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a debate within U.S. intelligence officials as to
how much the U.S. information contributed to China developing its
own nuclear weapons, there is no disagreement that Beijing obtained
classified data that accelerated its own programs. China has denied
committing espionage.

BUSH REFUSES FEDERAL CAMPAIGN FUNDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERLOO, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush, sitting on the fattest
presidential primary war chest in history, said Thursday he would
forgo federal campaign funds and the spending limits attached to
them as he seeks the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got too many people counting on me to put myself in a box
_ to get boxed in by the rules that affected our nominee in 1996,
and I intend to win,'' said Bush, reflecting on the funding
problems faced three years ago by losing Republican nominee Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as Bush formally reported $37 million in
contributions through June 30, with $30 million still on hand _ a
huge lead over all of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the massive bankroll could get him past unforeseen
campaign problems: ``I think with $30 million in the bank, I've got
pretty good staying power.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would skip the federal payments in the primary
because he wanted to maintain ``strategic flexibility'' as he
battles through early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire against the
largely self-financed campaign of multimillionaire publisher Steve
Forbes. Bush also said that if he becomes the presumptive GOP
nominee he wants to be able to mount a vigorous campaign from the
spring of 2000 until the Republican National Convention that
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the matching fund system, the federal government matches
up to $250 of each individual contribution. But accepting the funds
means Bush or any other candidate must abide by state-by-state
spending limits and an overall primary-season expenditure of $33.3
million. Bush's decision to skip federal funds in the primary would
not affect his ability later, if he is the Republican nominee, to
claim an estimated $66 million in general-election campaign funds
from the federal Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalled that Dole was damaged by Forbes' early lavish
spending _ especially on attack ads _ and by the inability to
answer Democratic slams in the months between the primaries and the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in a position to respond,'' Bush told reporters
after a rally here with about 250 people. ``I want to be in a
position to plan. I want to be in a position to budget according to
need.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Bush and his advisers see a threat in Forbes,
who spent $36 million of his own money in the 1996 campaign and who
has already contributed $6.6 million of his own to his 2000
campaign account _ if only because of his seemingly unlimited
willingness to bankroll his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm competing in the primary against somebody who can write
one check, and I'm mindful of what happened in 1996,'' Bush said.
``And I'm not going to let it happen to me''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of spending limits could be important not only in Iowa
and New Hampshire but also in the newly important and always
expensive New York and California primaries, which have been moved
up in the calendar and could be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team is also concerned that the campaign could be
hamstrung in the run-up to the convention. Three years ago,
President Clinton established general-election campaign themes and
Democrats painted an uncomplimentary portrait of Dole that he could
not fully answer because he was out of funds and had hit the
federal spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to a similar pre-convention shootout with Vice
President Al Gore, Bush said:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a chance I'll be running against somebody who'll be
able to jump on a government airplane and travel all over the
country making promises, and I want to be able to respond. The best
thing for me to do is not accept taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides setting a fund-raising record, Bush's $30 million cash
on hand is particularly stunning when compared to the 1996
Republican field.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is Bush's nearest competitor at $9.5 million, but $6.6
million of that is his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole reported raising $3.5 million so far, with $1.8
million cash on hand. Dole noted that 43 percent of her
contributions of $200 or more came from women, who she said usually
make up only 25 percent of high-dollar donations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona has raised $4.3 million since the
first of the year and transferred $1.9 million from his Senate
committee. He closed the period with $2.6 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats, Vice President Al Gore has about $18.5
million, while former Sen. Bill Bradley has raised about $11.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign bragged that he had 74,000 contributors and that
98 percent of his contributions came from individuals. The average
contribution was $466.69, the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's report said he had raised $36.2 million from individuals
and $804,941 from political action committees
</P>
<P>
   Only two major-party contenders, both Republicans, have refused
to accept federal matching funds in the primaries since the program
was instituted as one of the post-Watergate campaign financing
reforms. They were former Texas Gov. John B. Connally in 1980 and
Forbes in 1996. The ultimate failures of their campaigns have left
politicians and their handlers wary of not following the more
trodden financing path.
</P>
<P>
   By skipping the federal funds, Bush runs the risk of drawing
attention to his financial prowess and charges, such as Forbes has
already made, that the Texas governor is all political technique
and no heartfelt beliefs _ an allegation Bush heartily rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought to picture his move as a boon for the candidates who
will dip into matching funds: ``I guess I'm doing the system a
favor,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's announcement came as he started his second campaign swing
through Iowa, which not only holds the first major test of
candidate support next year but plans a Republicans presidential
straw poll next month.
</P>
<P>
   With both events in mind, Bush launched what a local political
analyst called ``an agri-pander'' aimed at the state's important
farming interests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, touring farm country on a bus, faulted the Clinton
administration for not striking a deal with China on admitting the
giant communist nation to the World Trade Organization _ a move
that would make agricultural commerce easier.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also promised in a speech in Waterloo never, if elected, to
``use food as a sanction'' in diplomatic disputes. Later, speaking
to reporters, he said that pledge was good for ``any country in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the latest agricultural crisis has been caused by
marketing disruption _ primarily a product of the Asian economic
crisis _ as opposed to natural disasters, Bush said farmers merited
a federal bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe disaster is disaster,'' Bush said.

COMMENTARY: WHITEWASH AT JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most dramatic clash between the FBI and the
heavily politicized Reno Department of Justice took place in
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulated by press reports of ``the Asian connection'' to the
Clinton-Gore campaign, the bureau teletyped all field offices for
reports on foreign attempts to influence U.S. political campaigns.
On Washington's Birthday the FBI's counterintelligence chief, John
Lewis, delivered a packet of those top-secret reports to Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general gave the packet of teletypes to then
Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick,'' reports Michael Bromwich,
the in-house inspector general. At the same time, White House
counsel Charles Ruff made two calls to Justice seeking to find out
what embarrassment was in store.
</P>
<P>
   Never told by Reno of FBI restrictions on the documents, Ms.
Gorelick bucked them to the Office of Intelligence Policy and
Review. They then blithely passed them on to Laura Ingersoll's
Justice ``task force,'' selected for its ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing doing, said the FBI, which ``retrieved the packet
shortly after the task force received it,'' according to Bromwich.
When I asked the FBI director, Louis Freeh, on Thursday if he had
been aware of the confrontation _ an unprecedented dispatch of
agents to snatch back evidence from Main Justice _ he replied, ``I
knew about it and certainly approved of it.''
</P>
<P>
   What was going on? The FBI, though slow off the mark and unaware
of all the leads it had in its computers, was getting evidence of
China's efforts to penetrate our political system. Ruff's calls
show that the Clinton White House hungered for it. Justice was
passing the surveillance of messages to Ted Sieong and Maria Hsia _
both in direct contact with Al Gore in his fund raising _ all over
the building.
</P>
<P>
   And so the FBI acted to prevent contacts with the White House
officials under investigation, to avoid the sort of improper
``heads up'' given them in Whitewater. The FBI meekly genuflected
when Reno's lapdog IG chastised it for cooperating too much with
Congress rather than Main Justice, but Freeh says grimly: ``None of
that changes my resolve to limit dissemination that would undermine
the integrity of a criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The name-no-names whitewash by Reno's IG admits that Congress
was not given two pieces of espionage information it should have
had until September 1997 _ after the Senate investigators had all
but closed shop and Democrats happily declared the Asian
penetration unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich's 569-page report dumping on the FBI and claiming
innocent ineptitude on high is stamped ``top secret'' because it
might jeopardize an ongoing failure at Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Two of its deep, dark secrets are mentioned above. They are
covered in Elizabeth Drew's new book that has a chapter about the
successful obstruction of the Thompson committee investigation,
``The Corruption of American Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   One is the Hong Kong source of the $400,000 contribution of
Indonesia's Sieong, most of it routed to the Democratic National
Committee through his resident alien daughter. He was seated next
to Al Gore during Maria Hsia's Buddhist fund-raiser, and his money
was never returned by the Democrats; because money is fungible,
China's contribution will buy spots in Campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Another secret was sent the committee only after its hearings
were over. It alleged that Ms. Hsia had recruited someone in
California's state government to be ``an agent'' for China. In the
Bromwich sandwich, eight more bits of intelligence information
concealed from congressional oversight are deliciously embedded,
but not for the public to see until after the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me,'' says Fred Thompson, ``that people at high
levels of Justice and the bureau had access to significant
information very early on. We need to find out what was held back
and why. Was it rank incompetence, as in the Department of Energy,
or was it a deliberate holding back at Justice for political
purposes?''
</P>
<P>
   Here was a dangerous triple failure. First our
counterintelligence failed to take seriously the
fund-raising-espionage connections. Then our Justice prosecutors
failed, letting middle-level perpetrators walk lest they lead to
higher-ups. Finally, our congressional oversight failed, obstructed
by partisans who put party ahead of country.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE UMPIRES DEFY LABOR'S RULE BOOK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In baseball's medieval times, when umpires projected
nobility instead of defiance, it was raining steadily when the
Pittsburgh Pirates' manager, Frank Frisch, confronted Jocko Conlan,
one of history's feistiest umpires. After arguing, loudly, that the
weather was too soggy to play baseball, Frisch questioned Conlan's
intestinal fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't got the guts to call it,'' Frisch growled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't got the guts to play it,'' Conlan barked. ``Why
don't you stop crying and try to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's umpires ought to heed Jocko Conlan's advice.
</P>
<P>
   By announcing their resignation, effective Sept. 2, in order to
threaten the remainder of the season as well as the league playoffs
and the World Series, at least 57 of the 66 major league umpires
have shown they don't have the intestinal fortitude to play through
their union contract with Major League Baseball, which expires Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Conlan, who once traded kicks to the shin with Leo
Durocher, the umpires should stop crying, work through the World
Series and then try to negotiate a new labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   With an agreement that includes a no-strike clause, the umpires'
intention to ``resign'' is merely semantics. For all practical
purposes, they've called a wildcat strike for Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   If that wildcat strike happens, the games will go on; the
National and American leagues will hire ``replacement'' umpires as
they did during other labor disputes. The replacements won't be as
good. Bad calls will occur that could affect the identity of the
World Series winner.
</P>
<P>
   But bad calls have always occurred. Remember all those wide
strike-zone calls in last year's post-season games? Maybe the
replacements would have more consistent strike zones.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that the umpires, of all the people in baseball,
would be more ethical in their labor dealings. Umpires uphold
baseball's ethics, its rule book. When the now-retired Doug Harvey,
known as God, was a young umpire, his mentor, Hall of Famer Al
Barlick, told him:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to preach the game, you better know the
bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlick meant the umpires' bible, the rule book. If a manager or
a player tried to defy that rule book, an umpire would eject him.
And an umpire, theoretically, would never call a pitch a strike if
it wasn't a strike. But now the umpires are calling what amounts to
an illegal strike.
</P>
<P>
   In their devious decision to resign on Sept. 2, the umpires are
defying their own rule book, the labor agreement negotiated by
Richie Phillips, their union leader. Then again, Phillips' judgment
is open to question. He pretends that all umpires resemble a batch
of cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pool of 64 marvelous umpires,'' Phillips said during
last year's post-season problems. ``Very little distinguishes them
from one another in ability.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think that the best umpires would resent being lumped
with the worst umpires. But to Phillips, all umpires are the same
in order to justify the annual post-season rotation of umpires,
good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the most efficient umpires should be assigned to call
the most important games.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the umpires' resignations, Phillips cited such
grievances as umpires' accountability and threats by the league
offices of dismissal, as if umpires were somehow exempt from
situations that exist in any other profession.
</P>
<P>
   More and more in recent years, baseball umpires have developed a
more aggressive, if not arrogant, attitude in on-the-field disputes
that has negated any sympathy for their problems.
</P>
<P>
   By resigning, the 57 umpires will be eligible for a total of
more than $15 million in termination pay, the first shot in
Phillips' approaching battle for a new labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   But with the umpires forming Umpires Inc., a new organization,
Major League Baseball might go to court over that termination pay.
Whatever develops, umpires have lost their sense of the rule book,
if not their sense of humor that even the legendary Bill Klem had
when an irate lady spectator disagreed with one of his calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Klem,'' she shouted, ``if you were my husband, I'd put poison
in your coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady,'' yelled Klem, staring at her, ``if I was your husband,
I'd drink it.''

STATE COURTS STRIKING DOWN LAWS THAT LIMIT LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.H., Ky., Ind., Ore., Wis., Alaska, Colo., Ohio)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a decade after states began enacting laws to cut back
big jury awards and curtail injury lawsuits, state courts across
the country are overturning one measure after another, concluding
that Americans have a powerful right to settle their disputes in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Top courts in states like Illinois, New Hampshire, Kentucky and,
most recently, Indiana on July 8 and Oregon on Thursday, have
relied on provisions of state constitutions like guarantees of fair
access to the courts to strike down all or part of the new laws
that were passed under the banner of ``tort reform.'' The new
liability laws make it more difficult to bring some suits and seek
to limit how much people can collect in accident, malpractice and
other injury cases.
</P>
<P>
   The highest courts of at least seven states have struck down all
or part of new liability laws in the last three years. Dozens of
new challenges to such laws are working their way toward state
supreme courts across the country, including in Wisconsin, Alaska
and Colorado, and a major decision is expected soon from the
Supreme Court in Ohio, which enacted a sweeping new liability law
two years ago. The cases focus on such state constitutional
guarantees of ``open courts'' or the right to a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   In this rancorous second phase of the battle over the liability
system, at least 87 decisions by state courts at all levels have
found flaws with laws that have been enacted since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state courts are invalidating huge parts of the tort
reform legislation to the consternation of supporters of tort
reform,'' said professor Mark Geistfeld of New York University Law
School. ``There is much more judicial hostility to this kind of
legislation than anyone was expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws have also been upheld by lower courts across the
country, with judges taking sides in one of the country's fiercest
but least noted legal wars. In a decision this January, the
Virginia Supreme Court, one of the few top state courts to affirm
the new laws recently, said a law limiting damages in malpractice
cases passed muster under that state's constitution. But legal
experts on both sides of the issue say the momentum is clearly on
the side of the critics of the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision Thursday striking down a law limiting to
$500,000 the amount of damages injured people can recover for pain
and suffering, the Oregon Supreme Court said that state's
constitution ``prohibits the legislature from interfering with the
full effect of a jury's assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case involving a man who was brain
damaged and partly paralyzed when a pneumatic nail gun
malfunctioned, sending a 3-inch nail into his skull. A jury had
awarded the man and his wife more than $2.8 million in damages for
pain and suffering on top of more than $7 million in other
compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The new liability laws, enacted in waves across the country
after intense lobbying by business groups, have tried various
approaches to limit what critics call frivolous suits that
unnecessarily tie up the courts and lead to outlandish awards.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups typically say limits are justified because of
what they call irrational verdicts, like the 1994 case of the
McDonald's customer who won a verdict of $2.9 million, later
reduced to $600,000, after she spilled scalding coffee on herself,
or the $4.9 billion verdict against General Motors last week in the
case of a fuel tank explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Business, professional, medical and other groups that have been
remarkably successful in pressing for liability law changes in the
legislatures of most states are incensed at the reversal of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only recently that the state courts have begun
second-guessing state legislatures,'' said Richard Willard, a
Washington lawyer who represented Union Pacific Railroad in the
Illinois case that struck down that state's broad law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really no basis for it,'' Willard continued, ``other
than an assertion of raw power by the courts to overturn the will
of the popularly elected legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and trial lawyers say the business lawyers
are simply being forced to contend with the reality that the laws
stripped consumers of fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peck, legal director of the Association of Trial Lawyers
of America, who is coordinating several of the attacks on the laws,
said business groups had used political contributions to
effectively buy laws that immunized them from damage suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem they are having now,'' Peck said, ``is that these
laws frequently violate fundamental state constitutional principles
and the courts are saying so.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the legislatures in the New York region have been far
less aggressive in enacting new liability laws than most other
states, the significant court battles are not now in the courts in
New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Business lawyers said the national trend of decisions
invalidating the laws simply represents judges' coming to the aid
of the trial lawyers, who often use campaign contributions and
political clout to press their cause. Victor Schwartz, a Washington
lawyer who is one of the chief legal strategists for business
groups on liability issues, said the reversals in state courts were
the biggest threat in decades to what he calls liability reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial lawyers' strategy,'' Schwartz said, ``is to find
obscure provisions of state constitutions or provisions of state
constitutions that have more rubber than Goodyear has in a tire to
allow a court to do whatever it wants to nullify the intent of the
legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The state courts are relying on provisions of state
constitutions like those giving citizens the ``right to a remedy''
in more than 35 state constitutions. Legal experts say many of the
provisions have received little judicial interpretation before.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the provisions have no parallel in the U.S.
Constitution. But even where there is similar language, like the
guarantee that citizens have a right to equal protection of the
laws, many of the decisions have been made on the state
constitutional grounds alone. As a result, state supreme court
decisions cannot be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   When striking down the liability laws, some courts use language
suggesting that they are offended by the legislation. In the 1997
Illinois decision, one of the most influential, the court said the
Legislature disregarded a century-long tradition concerning the
role of juries and the courts when it enacted a 1995 law, which,
among other provisions, limited damages to $500,000 to compensate
injured people for pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In a case brought by the family of a 20-year-old truck driver
who had been killed when a train smashed into his truck at a
railroad crossing, the court said the $500,000 limit violated the
Illinois constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Justice Mary Ann McMorrow said the law
``arbitrarily and automatically reduces the jury's award for a
lifetime of pain and disability, without regard to whether the
verdict, before reduction, was reasonable and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Some judges have expressed equally strong sentiments in
upholding the laws. In its decision in January, the Virginia
Supreme Court rejected the argument that a law limiting damages in
medical malpractice cases to $1 million violated the state
constitution's guarantee of a right to trial by jury.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the husband of a woman who died after she was
treated in an emergency room sued, claiming her condition had been
misdiagnosed. The jury agreed and set damages at $2.04 million. The
judge reduced the award to $1 million and the husband appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision written by the state's chief justice, Harry
Carrico, the court upheld the law, saying the husband had had a
jury trial. ``It is not the role of the jury but of the legislature
to determine the legal consequences of the jury's factual
findings,'' Carrico said, concluding that there was no violation of
the right to a jury trial merely because a plaintiff did not
receive the full amount the jury had awarded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Schwartz, who is the general counsel of the American
Tort Reform Association, a group pressing for liability limits,
wrote a scholarly article that was one of the first to identify the
trend of ``judicial nullification'' of the new liability laws.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, a former law school dean, said in an interview this
week that he had counted 87 decisions by state courts at all levels
that had declared all or part of new liability laws invalid in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   His article, published by the conservative Washington Legal
Foundation, has received wide circulation among business lawyers as
a harbinger of what some of them see as a kind of stealth attack on
the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   The article also identified more than 100 decisions upholding
the laws since the era of so-called tort reform began in 1983. But
Schwartz and other lawyers for business say the momentum is toward
declaring the new limits on lawsuits unconstitutional, with more
high-level state courts striking down more significant liability
laws recently.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision on July 8, the Indiana Supreme Court was presented
with a doctor's claim that a malpractice suit filed by a woman
suffering from breast cancer should be dismissed because it was not
filed within a new time limit of two years after the alleged
malpractice had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But as the court pointed out, in an opinion by Justice Myra
Selby, the heart of the suit was that the woman claimed the doctor
had misdiagnosed her condition. As a result, she said, she had not
discovered she had breast cancer until three years after she saw
the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   To enforce the law, the court said, would have meant the woman
would have been barred from court because she did not file her
malpractice suit at a time when she thought she was healthy. The
court said it would be unconstitutional to apply the law in that
case. Any other decision, Selby said, ``would be boarding the bus
to topsy-turvy land.''

FOREIGN INVESORS EYEING FLEET-BANKBOSTON BRANCH SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- While the country's biggest banks have so far shied
away from the largest bank divestiture in US history, community
institutions and even foreign financial companies are gaining
momentum to try to use Fleet-BankBoston's mammoth branch sale to
expand in New England.
</P>
<P>
   None of the nation's household-name banks has jumped at the
chance to buy the nearly $15 billion in assets that Fleet Financial
Group Inc. is selling as part of its historic merger with
BankBoston Corp., according to sources close to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are any of the top 10 banks pursuing the opportunity to buy
these assets? The answer is `no,' '' a source involved in the sale
said Thursday. Bidding for the assets closed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of a lack of interest from leading players like Bank of
America, Chase Manhattan, and First Union come as Fleet is
earmarking around 15 percent of the branches and deposits for sale
to community banks.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Masssachusetts congressmen and Governor Paul
Cellucci have lobbied fiercely for smaller banks to be allowed a
shot at some of the assets. The Department of Justice, which must
approve the $16-billion merger, bowed to political pressure last
month to include smaller banks in the divestiture process.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said Thursday that Fleet's chief executive, Terrence
Murray, told him in a telephone call that Fleet would invite a
dozen community banks in next week to discuss which Massachusetts
branches they want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will need some bigger bidders as competitors, but the
community banks are good competitors too,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and Federal Reserve Board, which must
also approve the merger, are said to want a large competitor to
acquire most of the assets to provide a strong competitor to the
new Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators have a loose definition of large, banking
analysts and consultants said, and have historically approved
divestiture sales in which mid-sized banks emerge as the main
winners.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of giant bidders is likely to please Fleet, which is
keen to avoid having to compete against a strong retail bank based
outside the region. ``Fleet doesn't want a First Union or a Bank of
America coming in,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at
Tucker Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers see several reasons for the lack of interest
from big banks.
</P>
<P>
   In a rapidly consolidating industry that has created a handful
of giant institutions with hundreds of billions of dollars in
assets, big banks are too busy digesting recent acquisitions to
make plays for more.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those deals have stumbled. First Union Corp, the
Charlotte, N.C.-based bank that has gobbled up other banks, is
struggling to regain investor confidence after months of declining
profits. The acquisitive bank, the nation's sixth largest, has
become a cautionary tale for other banks seeking to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Another barrier is the size of Fleet-BankBoston's divested
assets. The lot is only a fraction of the size of the new company,
which will be the nation's eighth-largest bank, with over $160
billion in assets. Major banks, some with global operations, may
see little point in trying to gain a minor foothold in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in banking has really expected the truly big,
out-of-state banks to be interested,'' said Arnold Danielson, a
banking consultant in Rockville, Md. ``If you're a $250 billion
bank, buying the assets and getting a third position in the Boston
area without any ready-made infrastructure could hurt your earnings
for the next three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the assets being sold are in Massachusetts, where Fleet
is selling nearly its entire franchise, or 197 branches with $8.7
billion in deposits and $1 billion in loans. BankBoston is selling
assets in Connecticut and Rhode Island. The two banks expect to
announce winning bidders in coming weeks and to close their merger
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks, which must sell the branches and deposits to meet
antitrust requirements, have received more than 50 bids, with over
40 coming from community banks, according to banking sources.
</P>
<P>
   An industry source said Fleet had winnowed the bidders to eight
to 10 banks, not including the community banks. Fleet declined
Thursday to confirm or deny a Boston Herald report saying that the
list included Citizens Financial Group of Providence; Charter One
Financial Inc. of Cleveland; Sovereign Bancorp of Wyomissing,
Penn., and one global banking giant, London-based HSBC Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly no final list, because this is a fluid
process,'' said Fleet spokesman James Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   The banks all have assets in the $25 billion to $40 billion
range, save for HSBC, a financial services behemoth with $483
billion in assets. ``Each of those names is acquisitive and has an
interest in the Northeast,'' said analyst Thomas Theurkauf of
Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said he thought that two Canadian banks _ Scotia Bank
and Canadian Imperial _ were also on the list. Scotia acquired some
of the failed Bank of New England's assets earlier this decade,
while Canadian Imperial owns New York-based stock brokerage CIBC
Oppenheimer.

ANALYSIS: A BOMB IS FLOURISHED CASUALLY. AT TAIWAN?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Buried in a tiresome-looking 40-page government report
lay what appeared to be a minor scientific detail, almost invisible
because it was mentioned so casually, in a passing reference three
sentences long.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not minor at all. China has designed a neutron bomb,
the report said, as well as miniaturized nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It was the timing, not the content, of the disclosure that made
it so significant. Scientists have known for years that China had
the ability to make a neutron bomb, having detected multiple tests
over the last 11 years. But Thursday was the first time that China
has publicly asserted owning such technology.
</P>
<P>
   Why now?
</P>
<P>
   The target of this news was apparently Taiwan. Coming just days
after Taiwan had said that it was dropping its adherence to its
longstanding principle that it and the Chinese mainland are
separately governed parts of the same country, the announcement was
timed to send a careful message across the Taiwan Strait _ we've
got the stuff, so watch out.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has never renounced its right to use military force to
recover the island, where Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops took
refuge after the Communists defeated them in 1949. Thursday,
state-run media reiterated the government's threat to block Taiwan
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The news on the neutron bomb was obscured in a report intended
to rebut the findings of the Cox Committee report, a study that a
Congressional committee released in May and that accused China of
having stolen from the U.S. information on the designs for the
neutron bomb, as well as for the W-88, the most advanced
miniaturized warhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese rebuttal denies that China stole any secret nuclear
technology from the United States and accuses the Cox report of
being politically motivated, full of distortions and painted with a
layer of racism directed at the Chinese people and at
Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The principal suspect in the espionage allegation is Wen Ho Lee,
a Taiwan-born American who was discharged from his job at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico over security breaches,
but has yet to be charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   China's assertions Thursday, similar to earlier denials of
charges in the Cox report, were most curious for their timing,
inexplicably being made a full two months after the Cox report was
released.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the week here is how Beijing will ultimately
respond to Taiwan's shifting stance toward the mainland. The senior
official who delivered rebuttal Thursday, Zhao Qizheng, said when
asked afterward that he could not say whether China would take
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, however, the announcement may signal China's
decision to keep to a relatively restrained response to
developments in Taiwan. Although any mention of a neutron bomb
sounds intimidating, because it is designed to kill people with
intense doses of radiation that leave buildings undisturbed, the
way the news was delivered was notably lacking in the kind of
rancor and fist-on-the-table banging that Beijing is capable of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beijing learned from the last time, in 1996,'' said a former
Clinton Administration official who is visiting here. ``They know
it's counterproductive to launch missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The former official was referring to China's aggressive stance
toward Taiwan three years ago, when Beijing was infuriated by
political maneuvering by President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan that had
led to his 1995 visit to the United States, the first by a Taiwan
President since Washington dropped diplomatic recognition two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee maintained his Nationalist Party's formal position
that it sought eventual reunification with the mainland, Beijing
interpreted his actions as attempts to raise the island's
international profile and nudge it toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, China launched missiles into the ocean near
Taiwan to try to intimidate voters just before the presidential
election there. Instead, Lee scored a decisive victory.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Lee made another move that risked angering Beijing,
dropping the ``one China'' formulation that has helped avert war
with China for decades by sidestepping the sensitive issue of
sovereignty and saying the relationship between Taiwan and the
mainland would more accurately be described as ``state to state.''
</P>
<P>
   China's media responded with tough-sounding warnings and a
typical dose of vitriol in the Communist Party publication People's
Daily. But no senior leader has emerged to speak publicly on the
issue. The evening news on state television calmly reported on a
trip to Mongolia by President Jiang Zemin and on a meeting held by
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji on the economy, without highlighting the
neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   China first tested a neutron bomb on Sept. 29, 1988, and
continued to do so on numerous occasions. But until Thursday China
has never publicly discussed that technology.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal, ``Facts Speak Louder Than Words and Lies Will
Collapse on Themselves,'' asserts that China began work on a
neutron bomb in the 1970s, when the United States and the Soviet
Union intensified their arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``China had no choice but to continue to carry out research and
development of nuclear weapons technology and improve its nuclear
weapons systems, mastering in succession the neutron bomb design
technology and the nuclear weapon miniaturization technology,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   It denied that China stole the technology involved in those two
designs and argued that many design details of the nuclear weapons
cited in the Cox report were available in unclassified documents
and on the Internet. It also rejects allegations in the Cox report
that China had stolen American technology on launching satellites
from sites in China where satellites were launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more ridiculous part in the Cox report than
Chapter Seven, on Launch Site Security in the PRC,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese leaders act offended and exasperated by the
espionage allegations, they are involved in many separate struggles
with the United States, all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   This week, American officials are here negotiating the sensitive
issue of how to compensate China for the damage that it suffered in
the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May. Chinese
leaders still say they find it hard to believe Washington's
insistence that the bombing was accidental. Washington insists that
a combination of unlikely errors and outdated maps caused the
bombing. .
</P>
<P>
   Only after the compensation issue is settled will China and the
United States be able to proceed on resuming negotiations on
obtaining membership for China in the World Trade Organization, a
goal that China's leaders still seem determined to achieve. Yet the
timing is tricky, as well as the substance of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating both sets of negotiations are suspicions
some Chinese leaders have toward the U.S. role in Taiwan's latest
shift from the ``one China'' policy. Several Chinese scholars have
argued that the United States, eager to contain a fast-emerging
China, is encouraging Taiwan toward independence, ruining China's
goal of reunification.

 &HT;    Bush bounty draws criticism
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's high-speed political cash
machine has bought him front-runner status, freedom from campaign
spending limits and blistering rebuke from critics who say he is
single-handedly undoing reforms aimed at separating money from
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who on Thursday filed a federal report showing he has
collected more than $37 million for his presidential campaign,
announced in Iowa that he has enough money in the bank to skip
federal matching funds for the primaries and the spending limits
they bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in a position to respond,'' said Bush, who will
be free to go dollar-for-dollar with the deep pockets of GOP foe
Steve Forbes, who will not take the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also wants to avoid the fate of 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole,
who ran out of money after the primaries and had to moth-ball his
campaign until federal funds flowed after the Republican National
Convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mindful of what happened in 1996 and I'm not going to let
it happen to me,'' said Bush. ``I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a chance I'll be running against somebody who will be
able to jump in a government airplane and travel the country making
promises,'' Bush said of Vice President Al Gore. ``I want to be
able to respond. The best way to do that is to not take taxpayer
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But nonpartisan groups that monitor campaign finance said a
candidate who doesn't need the federal cash is too heavy on the
root of all political evil. Common Cause's top man said Bush's
unprecedented four-month cash harvest will turn the clock back on
campaign-finance reforms of the 1970s. ``I think the decision means
that he's turning his back on the principal post-Watergate reform
that was intended to take the White House off the auction block,''
said Don Simon, Common Cause's acting president. ``His decision
signals the 2000 presidential election may well be the most
expensive ever, and that the fund raising and potential corruption
is going to be out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his money will allow him to maintain ``strategic
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon called it something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flexibility he claims he's seeking is being purchased at
the expense of laws designed to preserve the integrity of the
elections process,'' said Simon. ``That's a poor bargain for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Krumholz of the Washington-based Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks political money, said the
volume of money moving Bush's way makes it more important to see
where it's coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a watershed event. This is not unlike Watergate and
the reforms that it spawned,'' she said. ``This is a real blow to
the partial public funding system, a system that's already
beleaguered by not having enough funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Krumholz said Bush should release the list of ``pioneers,''
friends and allies who have agreed to raise $100,000 each for the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who bring in dozens of donors are far more important
than a person who makes one donation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has declined to release the list or say how many pioneers
he has. Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said pioneers are merely
``people talking to their friends and family about Governor Bush's
message of compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said Bush's massive fund raising is a result of ``the
democratic process of people being able to express their opinion
about a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has called for instant disclosure of campaign
contributions, still will have to play by federal rules that cap
individual contributions at $1,000 and political action committee
donations at $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's desire to skip the federal funds was driven by Steve
Forbes, the wealthy publisher who did not take the federal money
and spent $37.5 million of his own money in 1996 in a failed bid
for the GOP nomination. Though it did not help him win the
nomination, not having to follow spending rules helped Forbes,
previously a political unknown, buy near-instant credibility in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government matches the first $250 of each
individual's contributions to a candidate. Federal Election
Commission preliminary numbers show that candidates who take the
federal money for the primaries would be limited to spending $39.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, all major-party candidates accept
federal money and agree not to raise additional money. However,
that money is supplemented by so-called ``soft money'' raised by
the political parties. Federal Election Commission preliminary
estimates show that each major-party candidate will get $66.1
million for their post-convention campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Primary candidates who took the federal money in 1996 were
limited to spending about $1 million in Iowa and $600,000 in New
Hampshire. Forbes, unfettered by limits, spent almost $10 million
in Iowa and $5 million in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has not said how deep he will be willing to dip into his
pockets this time around. His report filed Thursday indicates he
plans on being generous to himself. Of the $9.5 million he raised
this year, $6.6 million came from himself.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said her candidate is
pleased that Bush is skipping the federal matching money. But she
questioned his motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve made his decision not to accept federal funds because he
believes it is wrong,'' she said. ``Bush made the decision not to
accept it because he wants to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, a GOP presidential contender, said
Bush may be ``unintentionally adding to the already widespread
cynicism of the American people regarding the influence of special
interest money in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kennedy, spokesman for GOP contender Lamar Alexander,
said, ``What's clearly is going on here is that Governor Bush is
trying to buy the nomination. He doesn't want to compete on a level
playing field. He wants to buy his way there.''

STARTLING DEPARTURE AT THE TOP OF WARNER BROTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB and GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that stunned the entertainment business, Robert Daly
and Terry Semel, the co-chairmen of Warner Brothers, announced
their resignations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel, whose nearly 20-year partnership was one of the
most stable and successful in Hollywood history, have endured a
string of box-office flops in recent years as well as a luckluster
music record. But they said their decision was unrelated to that.
</P>
<P>
   They had been considering leaving for several months, they said,
and had discussed the idea informally with Gerald Levin, chairman
of the studio's parent company, Time Warner. They told Levin of
their decision late Wednesday in New York, on the eve of Time
Warner's board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations came after Time Warner reported
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings Thursday, on the eve
of Warner Brothers' highly anticipated release of ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the last movie made
by Stanley Kubrick, who died in March.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, 62, and Semel, 55, said they told Levin they wanted to
join forces as entertainment entrepreneurs. ``If I was ever to
pursue another challenge in my life, I felt the time was now,''
Semel said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision immediately cast the normally stable Warner
Brothers studios in turmoil. As to possible replacements,
speculation centered on, among others, Barry Meyer, executive vice
president and chief operating officer, who is popular on Wall
Street; Jeff Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of Home Box
Office, who is close to Ted Turner, vice chairman and 11 percent
owner of Time Warner; Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios;
Jeffrey Katzenberg, a partner at Dreamworks SKG; Peter Chernin,
president and chief operating officer of News Corp., which owns
20th Century Fox, and Leslie Moonves, a former head of Warner
Brothers television and now president and chief executive of CBS
television.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Time Warner, Levin said he was saddened by the
decision. ``There is never a good time to lose this kind of
talent,'' he said, ``but our film, TV and music businesses, and our
company as a whole, are in excellent shape, and there is tremendous
depth of management throughout our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deeply personal decision,'' he added. ``What they
decided to do was something very human.'' He said the two had come
to a point in their lives ``where they can think about
themselves.'' Levin said Daly and Semel would play a central role
in creating a new team, but made it clear he would make the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the CEO,'' he said. ``I will think this through.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, top Hollywood agents said that even though Daly and
Semel in recent months had made known their interest in leaving,
they had been wavering. One agent said preliminary talks with Time
Warner indicated that the company wanted to wrest the troubled
music division away from the pair. It was, the agent said, a factor
in the final decision. The music division, run by Daly and Semel,
has fared poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Once the most successful music company in the industry, Warner
music has been mired in management turmoil. After the controversial
departure of its longtime management team several years ago, Levin
turned first to Michael Fuchs, the former chairman of HBO, and then
to Daly and Semel. By all accounts, the team was relatively
inexperienced in the music business, and the division was only
lately starting to recover.
</P>
<P>
   According to Soundscan, which tracks industry performance,
Warner Music was fourth in album sales after Universal, BMG and
Sony. In total domestic share, including catalog sales, Warner has
remained second after Universal, but its market share has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel _ as well as Levin _ insisted that no contract
talks had begun, and that the decision was simply based on their
yearning to create and own their own ventures. But there was
speculation by several top Hollywood executives that the two _ who
were unaccustomed to criticism in the media _ had simply grown
thin-skinned and weary over attacks on their film record.
</P>
<P>
   Their most recent big-budget film, ``Wild, Wild West,'' while
No. 1 at the box office last week, was poorly received by critics
and may barely earn a profit, if at all. The film cost an estimated
$180 million, rivals and agents say, but Warner Brothers said it
was much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Daly and Semel to leave at the end of the year
marked the end of an enduring partnership, involving two stolid,
tough and unflashy businessmen. Their films included the lucrative
``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon'' franchises. Even more important,
Warner Brothers was just about the only studio in town to develop a
reputation for stability _ even during bleak periods it avoided
bloodletting and nurtured a loyalty among its well-paid employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even by Hollywood standards, the two executives are enormously
wealthy. Their yearly compensation is believed to be as high as $25
million each. Semel's accumulated wealth is estimated as high as
$500 million, largely because of soaring Time Warner stock. Daly's
is said to be less, perhaps $300 million, because of a divorce
settlement. The two men declined to discuss their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood moguls said they were amazed at the departures. Roth,
of Disney, was awakened by a phone call from a reporter this
morning with the news. ``I'm as shocked as you are,'' he said, and
denied having any discussions about a top job there. Katzenberg
heard about it in the restaurant of the Four Seasons Hotel in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breathtaker,'' he said, adding: ``These two guys are
the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of the movie business.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As to his moving to Warner Brothers, Katzenberg said, ``There's
no chance. It's not in the world of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel made it plain that in some ways they were seeking
to kick off their new careers by emulating Barry Diller, now
chairman and chief executive of USA Networks and its largest
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the two have held private discussions with
Diller to discuss the pitfalls of striking out on one's own. ``I
always envied what Barry Diller did,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Diller said he had been speaking privately for more than a year
with Daly and Semel. ``They want a third act,'' Diller said. ``The
difference for them, as opposed to most people, is that they're
sitting on a big empire. And, as I told them, choosing independence
over empire is very scary to do, the longer you let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller said he was convinced that Time Warner wanted to renew
the contracts of Semel and Daly. ``There's no question of that,''
Diller said. ``Bob and Terry just wanted to choose independence.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Plunging deeply into a microscopic world
that promises ultrafast, low-power computers, a research team has
for the first time fashioned simple computing components no bigger
than a single molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement, being reported Friday in Science magazine,
opens a new window onto a once speculative but now increasingly
probable vista of molecular-scale sensors, computers and machines.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from Hewlett-Packard Co. and the University of
California at Los Angeles, say their work could be a step toward
computers 100 billion times faster than today's most powerful
personal computers. And they envision a world in which
supercomputing power is so pervasive and inexpensive that it
literally becomes an integral part of every manmade object.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, integrated circuits _ the on-off switches that are
the basis for all computing _ have been made by etching silicon
wafers with beams of light, a process known as photolithography.
The ability to make those circuits smaller is ultimately limited by
the wavelength of light.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers have found a way to build circuits using
chemical processes rather than light, making the switches as small
as a molecule. As a result, the researchers believe that they can
make components for future computers several orders of magnitude
tinier than today's smallest transistors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, such technology ``holds the promise of
vast data storage capability,'' said Phil Kuekes, a physicist and
computer designer at Hewlett-Packard, which is based in Palo Alto.
And ultimately, he said, it could create a new class of ``Fantastic
Voyage''-style machines, like sensors traveling within a person's
bloodstream, issuing alerts if health problems are encountered.
</P>
<P>
   As individual transistors get smaller, they require less
electrical power to operate and, in general, can switch on and off
more quickly. And more of them can be produced without increasing
the cost of production.
</P>
<P>
   One of the next challenges for the researchers will be to come
up with a chemical process to create the ultra-thin wires _ no more
than several atoms across _ needed to connect the molecular
switches into a complete computer circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In current circuitry these wires are as thin as one-quarter of a
micron _ a human hair is about 400 times as thick _ but even so,
they are far too thick to connect individually to the new molecular
switches.
</P>
<P>
   The molecules themselves, called rotazanes, are synthetic
compounds created by chemists at UCLA, and the switches built from
them deliver ``the equivalent capability to a silicon circuit I
could have bought in 1970'' that was the size of a fingernail,
Kuekes said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer researchers said they believe the advance heralds the
rapid acceleration of a new field known as moletronics, or
molecular electronics. The Pentagon, which was a major underwriter
of the work at Hewlett-Packard and UCLA, is interested in such
research because of its broad potential military applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field is still in its infancy,'' said Mark Reed, a
chemist at Yale University who is doing experimental research in
molecular-scale computing. ``But the results are starting to come
in faster. Over the last five years we've come from an incredible
idea to the point where we might be able to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers cautioned that what they have created is only
the first step toward building molecular computers and that
significant barriers remain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the device designed by the researchers can only
change from one state to another _ essentially, from 1 to 0 _ not
switch repeatedly, as it must do to be practical as a transistor
rather than a storage device. And the molecular switches have so
far not exhibited switching speeds faster than today's fastest
silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   But several researchers in the field said they now believe they
see ways to surmount these obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important stepping stone, but we still have a long
way to go,'' said James Tour, a Rice University chemistry professor
who is conducting similar molecular-scale research. ``I don't want
people to think that in three to five years we'll have molecular
electronics, but the interesting thing about this work is that we
can now see ways to scale past the limits of silicon.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Molecular computing is rapidly becoming a Holy Grail for many
computer scientists because it promises immensely more powerful
computers.
</P>
<P>
   James Heath, a UCLA chemistry professor who is leading the
research with Hewlett-Packard, described the possibility of
computers 100 billion times faster than a Pentium III
microprocessor. He also suggested that it may some day be possible
to replicate the power of 100 computer work stations in a space the
size of a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Speculating about whether a new technology like molecular
electronics might displace an existing one like silicon is very
risky, the researchers said. If the technology proves workable,
however, its first application might be in a specialized form,
complementing rather than replacing silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   Similar examples today include gallium-arsenide semiconductors,
which are used for very high speed applications, even though they
cost much more than conventional silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new era of moletronics is beckoning just as
silicon-era technologists are reaching their own stunning levels of
transistor density. For example, computer memory makers are now
beginning to produce chips that can store one billion bits of data
on a single chip, 16 times the capacity now common in personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   But such feats pale in comparison to the promise of
molecular-scale computing.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the density possible at the molecular level, Tour
said that a mouthful of water contains so many molecules that, if
they were each represented by a sheet of paper, they would form a
stack that would reach from the earth to the sun 400 million times.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single molecular computer could conceivably have more
transistors than all of the transistors in all of the computers in
the world today,'' he said.

HOUSE APPROVES MEASURE ON RELIGIOUS RIGHTS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Divided mainly along party lines, the House of
Representatives debated at length Thursday whether religious
liberty or civil rights should take precedence when the two
principles come into conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Religion, which the Republicans favored, came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was an innocuous-sounding bill called the Religious
Liberty Protection Act that would prohibit state and local
governments from placing a ``substantial burden'' on a person's
exercise of religion unless officials could demonstrate a
compelling reason for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors said the measure was necessary to prevent, for
instance, zoning ordinances that prohibit construction of churches
in some neighborhoods and rules that bar students from wearing
yarmulkes in schoolrooms or sports fields.
</P>
<P>
   They offered anecdotal evidence that such abuses are widespread.
They held that without the legislation, Catholic priests
theoretically risked arrest for serving communion wine to minors,
and Orthodox Jews could be forced to allow autopsies, forbidden by
their religion, after a family member died.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations representing all major religions support the
measure. But opponents worried that the law could be used as a
defense by people accused of violating state or local
anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying question, which was skirted by both sides in the
debate, was whether landlords and employers in states and cities
with laws forbidding discrimination against homosexuals could cite
religious beliefs and be free to refuse to rent to or hire gays and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial test came on an amendment that would have specified
that the protections of religious expression could not be used to
justify violations of anti-discrimination laws. It was rejected,
234-190, with 204 Republicans and 30 Democrats voting against the
amendment, and 15 Republicans, 174 Democrats and an Independent
voting for it.
</P>
<P>
   The overall measure was then approved, 306-118.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should be free to practice their religion without
interference from the heavy hand of government,'' said Rep. Charles
T. Canady, R-Fla., the floor manager of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who sponsored the amendment
exempting civil rights laws from its coverage, said he agreed with
Canady's precept. But Nadler added, ``The bill should be used as a
shield protecting religious liberty but not as a sword against
civil rights laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Nadler exemption, Canady responded, was
that ``it would establish as a matter of congressional policy that
religious liberty would have second-class status.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure now goes to the Senate, where its prospects are
unclear. The White House issued a statement saying President
Clinton strongly supports the bill and hopes to work with Congress
on ``clarification of civil rights protections.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, age and
disability, so the real, though mostly unstated, dispute was over
whether the protection of religion could be used to sanction
discrimination against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides seemed reluctant to debate the matter directly. But
at one point, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., avoiding the words
gay or homosexual, said that people with untraditional values
``feel they can force their way into a Catholic parade'' and keep
the Boy Scouts from maintaining ``their moral standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones with traditional values are under attack all the
time,'' Rohrabacher said, ``and we need to protect their rights as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., responded to Rohrabacher, by saying,
``They're trying to work. They're trying to rent an apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-R.I., addressed the matter more
squarely. ``Let's make no mistake about it,'' he said, ``the right
wing of the Republican Party wants to discriminate against
homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Canady replied, ``The gentleman has misunderstood the purpose of
this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a federal law protecting expression of religion
arose from a 1990 Supreme Court ruling that religious beliefs did
not excuse people who violated a legitimate state law. The case
involved Indians arrested for smoking the outlawed drug peyote in a
religious ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Religious groups pressed Congress for legislation to reverse the
court's decision. In 1993, a measure was enacted similar to the
bill adopted Thursday, but in 1997 the Supreme Court declared it
unconstitutional on the ground that its restrictions were too
broad.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, was based
on the 14th Amendment's guarantee that all citizens' rights are
equally protected. The bill passed Thursday was rewritten so that
the constitutional basis is the authority of Congress to regulate
interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal authorities think the changes may not be sufficient
to satisfy the Supreme Court, especially in light of the court's
decisions this year expanding state sovereignty and limiting the
ability of Congress to make federal law binding on the states.

 &HT;    Bush won't take federal matching funds
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Thursday that his
eye-popping $37 million in campaign contributions for the first
half of 1999 will allow him to forgo federal matching funds for the
2000 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's report with the Federal Election Commission, filed
Thursday, shows that he has more than $30 million in available
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Iowa, the candidate said he would not accept
federal money and the state-by-state spending limits that go with
it to preserve ``strategic flexibility'' in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be in a position to respond and plan according to
needs, especially in key early states such as Iowa and New
Hampshire,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the only Republican whose campaign cash would
even approach that of Bush would be magazine publisher Steve
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   He reported contributing $6.6 million from his personal fortune
so far in 1999 and raising an additional $2.9 million from others.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has indicated he, too, will not take federal money. His
1996 presidential campaign was virtually self-financed.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' main contribution three years ago was that his
aggressive advertising forced Bob Dole, the Republican front-runner
and eventual nominee, to spend heavily to counteract Forbes' ads.
</P>
<P>
   While Dole won the battle, he exhausted his money supply months
before the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, meanwhile, faced no opposition for the
Democratic nomination and waged an expensive advertising campaign
through the spring and early summer that both Democrats and
Republicans believe seriously damaged Dole's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mindful of what happened in 1996, and I'm not going to let
it happen to me,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wants to have money available to compete with
Vice President Al Gore in the months before the party conventions,
at which nominees are formally chosen and become eligible for
millions of dollars in federal funds for the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be facing a Democratic candidate who may attempt to
travel around the country handing out expensive promises at
government expense,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIANS AIM TO RAISE BIG BUCKS FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   So how does a candidate like Bush raise that kind of cash? One
way is to find a lot of wealthy supporters who agree to lean on
their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Georgians have agreed to raise $100,000 each for Bush,
and 90 more are on board for at least $10,000 each, according to
Eric Tanenblatt, Bush's campaign manager in Georgia. The commitment
from this group of 103 is a minimum of $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 13 in the $100,000 club is Krishna Srinivasa of
Dallas, Ga. He has been a significant source of Republican campaign
funds in Georgia since he first wowed the Bush team when he was the
leading ticket-seller for President George Bush at a campaign event
in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Other experienced and generous hands include Virgil Williams,
the Gwinnett County business tycoon who helped Democrat Zell Miller
raise millions for his run for governor in 1990; Julian LeCraw, an
Atlanta real estate executive; Amos McMullian, chairman and chief
executive of the baking concern Flowers Industries; and Joe Rogers,
Waffle House chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the 13 are: Charles Ackerman, an Atlanta developer;
John Carswell, a Savannah insurance and financial services
executive; James Franklin, a lawyer in Statesboro; Winnie LeClercq,
whose family owns Cub Foods and an interest in Food Lion; James B.
Miller, president of the Fidelity National banking company; Parker
H. ``Pete'' Petit, a Cobb County health care executive; Stephen
Wakefield, general counsel for the Southern Co.; and Joel Williams,
a lawyer with Powell, Goldstein, Frazier &AMP; Murphy in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates to visit Atlanta today
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Cross President and Cabinet Secretary Elizabeth Dole
and conservative activist Gary Bauer are both expected in Atlanta
today.
</P>
<P>
   Dole will hold a news conference outside the main Fulton County
library downtown to talk about shielding library users from
pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to lunch at the Varsity, then talk to Chick-Fil-A
employees. Dole and Chick-Fil-A founder Truett Cathy believe they
are distant relations.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is scheduled to hold a news conference outside Ft.
McPherson to talk about defense spending.

FOR TOUR LEADER ARMSTRONG, THE BATTLE NOW IS WITH RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Texas)  (jw) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPE D'HUEZ, France _ Lance Armstrong has heard the rumors and
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innuendo,'' the 27-year-old American calls speculation that he
is leading the Tour de France because he is using illegal drugs.
How else, some of the European press is asking, can somebody who
went underwent chemotherapy for testicular cancer 2{ years ago be
so dominating now in the world's toughest race?
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion toward him is all the stronger because of a
sportwide drug scandal that came to light at last year's Tour de
France and almost scuttled the race. Asked flatly whether he is or
has been doping, Armstrong said, ``Emphatically and absolutely
not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not stupid,'' he said Wednesday night as he had dinner at
his team's hotel in the mountain resort of Alpe d'Huez. ``I've been
on my deathbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he was found to be suffering from testicular
cancer. It was later determined during the surgery that the cancer
had spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the coverage about his results have been adulatory
_ especially in the United States _ the Belgian newspaper Het
Niewsblad ran the headline ``Armstrong Puts a Bomb Under the
Tour,'' with the word bomb understood to refer to drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The French sports newspaper L'Equipe has also used suggestive
headlines and a commentary this week comparing Armstrong not to the
Spaniard Miguel Indurain or Greg LeMond, the only previous American
to have won the Tour, but to Bjarne Riis, a Dane who won in 1996
and has since been accused in his home country of having had an
extraordinary hematocrit level then, implying the use of the
artificial hormone EPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``My story is a success story in the world of cancer,'' said
Armstrong, whose victory is by no means guaranteed. ``A lot of
people relate to my story. In America, in France, in Europe, they
relate to this story.'' The French fans, who know his story,
respond with hearty cheers each time he is introduced at the
starting sign-in and when, at the end of each stage, he dons
another yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``And look,'' he continued, ``I'm not going to get mad about the
questions because I understand them after the events of last year.
I expected this.''
</P>
<P>
   Few predicted before the event that Armstrong would lead the
race by nearly eight minutes after winning three of the 11 daily
stages so far: the short prologue, a long time trial, or race
against the clock, and then the first of two climbing stages in the
Alps on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he finished a strong fifth in the
demanding ascent to Alpe d'Huez.
</P>
<P>
   He is climbing so powerfully now, a teammate, Kevin Livingston,
said Thursday that he could have won the stage to Alpe d'Huez but
did not because he and the team did not want to appear greedy and
make enemies among teams that circumstances might cast later as
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the reasons for his performance mounted after
the victory Tuesday in Sestriere, Italy, with veiled references in
newspapers and television to the power of a man who has never been
known as a dominating climber and who did not return full time to
racing until May 1998, more than a year and a half after his cancer
was diagnosed and treated in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line for me is the same as for Miguel Indurain:
Sweat is the secret of my success,'' he said, referring to the
Spaniard who won the Tour de France five consecutive times in this
decade and then retired late in 1996, a man he described as `'a
good friend and one of my heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no answer other than hard work,'' Armstrong said as he
ate his way through two bowls of risotto topped with grated
parmesan cheese, several slices of buttered bread and many glasses
of mineral water. He finished with a slice of apple pie, which he
decided was not all that good and switched to a slab of blueberry
pie. ``Much better,'' he judged.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was willing, even eager, to discuss the rumors. Asked
if he was taking any medication, he replied: ``Vitamin C,
multivitamins, those. This is the Tour de France, you need certain
recovery products, but certainly nothing illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Einhorn, the oncologist who treated Armstrong at
the Indiana University Medical Center, told the Associated Press
that Armstrong is ``98 percent home free,'' from the cancer. He
said Armstrong's treatment was completely finished, and that the
rider was taking no medication for the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's drug scandal at the Tour de France resulted in the
expulsion of the nine-man Festina team on charges of systematic use
of illegal performance-enhancing drugs, mainly EPO. That case led
to police searches of riders' hotels and protests and slowdowns by
the teams. Investigations continue in France and Italy, and riders
and officials are still being questioned, but this 86th Tour de
France has not been hampered since it started July 3. It ends July
25 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   As the race leader, Armstrong undergoes a urinalysis every day
that looks for such drugs as steroids. Like everybody else in the
Tour, he had a hematocrit blood test at the start, which he and all
other riders passed. These tests will be given occasionally, more
or less at random but by teams.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The innuendo does bother him, Armstrong said, ``for the sake of
the sport. It's bad for the sport, so I can get worked up. It's
disturbing for the sport. I think it's unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was the world road race champion in 1993, when nobody had
heard of EPO?'' he asked rhetorically. ``Who? The second-youngest
world champion of all time?'' The answer, of course, was Armstrong,
not quite 22, in the race in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a new rider,'' he said. ``I showed my class from the
very beginning, I've never focused on the Tour de France, and when
I decided to, I was in France the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his five previous Tours, he has finished one and was twice
withdrawn by his former Motorola team before or early in the
mountains because of his age and inexperience. He explained his
climbing strength by saying that his focus in the first years of
his career had always been on the spring and fall one-day classics
``and I was a fair climber then.''
</P>
<P>
   He also credited his climbing skills to a loss of weight, about
15 pounds to his present 158 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he and his U.S. Postal Service teammates spent weeks
in May riding over Tour stages here in the Alps and in the
forthcoming Pyrenees, he said, `'This team has done more work that
anybody else'' in the race's pack of 20 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong did not repeat his denials, knowing that other riders
have made them too and then confessed to drug use under police
questioning, but continued to build his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in cycling knows that France is a dangerous place to
be,'' continued, ``especially considering that they have extremely
aggressive police and the scandal du jour. There are a lot of
riders that never, ever come to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I live in France,'' the former Texan said, ``I race the
whole year in France, my Tour de France preparation was done in
France. If I want to dope, that would be ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said that he and his wife, Kristin, would possibly be
moving from their home in Nice to another country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful home, I like Nice, I like France a lot,'' he
noted. ``But we have people looking through our trash, just bad
stuff. The possibility of somebody sabotaging me or pulling some
funny business, it's not worth it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As Miguel said before the Tour started,'' he continued,
referring to Indurain, ``you spend 10 years building a career and a
reputation and they can tear it down in 15 seconds. It's scary.''

U.S. ANXIETY IMPERILS NATO FIGHTER-PILOT TRAINING IN CANADA
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA with RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Mounting concern in the United States over the export
of military technology without adequate controls is threatening an
ambitious new program to train fighter pilots from several NATO
countries in the vast skies over Western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. regulators are refusing to issue an export license for 24
high-powered American-made training planes until they get iron-clad
guarantees from the Canadian government that the aircraft, and the
technology that went into its development, will not fall into the
hands of unfriendly nations.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are worried because the planes are being purchased
not by the Canadian government, but by a private company in Canada
that in 1997 was awarded a $2.8 billion contract to run the NATO
training program. At the time, no one expected problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though, the unauthorized transfer of classified
military technology to China and examples of restricted military
hardware finding its way to third countries from Canada have
heightened concerns about this program.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could try to hold up the $82 million sale to Canada
until it gets assurances that the planes will not be resold to
countries that otherwise would not be allowed to have them.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons smugglers have used Canada to circumvent American export
restrictions so often that the Clinton administration recently
imposed tough new controls on sales of weapons and military
technology to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The sale to Bombardier of Montreal of 24 T-6A-1 Raytheon
Aircraft turboprop trainers, the basic training plane for the U.S.
Navy and Air Force, would be the first transfer of American
military technology to the private sector, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a drive to balance its budget, the Canadian government gave
the contract to Bombardier, and also leased it a base _ Moose Jaw
in Saskatchewan _ thereby saving the base from what would have been
an unpopular closure.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington are concerned that selling planes to
Bombardier could set a precedent that powerful foreign corporations
would cite in other purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell airplanes to governments, not to private companies,''
said a senior American official opposed to the sale. ``If the
contract goes bust, where do the assets go?''
</P>
<P>
   Delivery of the planes is scheduled to begin in October but the
United States' demands could force delays. ``We have advised our
customer _ the Ministry of National Defense _ that there may be a
schedule impact,'' said Zev Rosenzweig, vice president of aviation
training in the defense division of Bombardier Aerospace. ``But
this situation is so different from what happened with China that I
have faith that even Congress people will appreciate the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Richardson, manager of the NATO Flying Training in
Canada program for Canada's Department of National Defense, said
maintenance and operating schedules for the sophisticated trainers
were not ready because the State Department had not allowed
Raytheon to provide Canada with the necessary specifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Raytheon got to the point of providing that information,
things slowed down in a hurry,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon officials are uneasy. James Gregory, a Raytheon
spokesman, said that if the sale was not approved expeditiously,
the multimillion-dollar order ``could go to an international
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., where Raytheon Aircraft is situated,
has written to the State Department to object to the way regulators
have jeopardized the sale. Brownback's staff refused to discuss his
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Canada had planned to buy the trainers from the
Embraer company of Brazil, but switched to Raytheon when Embraer
could not guarantee delivery in time.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials say they are not unduly suspicious of
Canada or Bombardier _ a diversified corporation best known for
manufacturing snowmobiles but now a major aerospace producer. But
they are concerned about Canada's ability to control the re-export
of American military technology.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Canada enjoyed special exemption from most military
export controls, reflecting its decision after World War II to
forgo its own defense industry and instead supply components to
American weapons contractors from whom it has made most purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, severe restrictions were put on Canada after what
senior American officials involved in defense trade described as
recent incidents in which Canada was intended to be a conduit for
supplying helicopters, missile parts and other military items to
countries forbidden to buy them.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, military exports to Canada will become much
more cumbersome. What is at risk, said Daniel Verreault, vice
president of the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada, is $5
billion a year in military goods and services that has developed
out of the special relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier officials say that they need to recruit pilots from
several NATO and non-NATO countries to recoup their costs over the
projected 20-year life of its $2.8 billion contract for pilot
training programs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Denmark has signed a $250 million contract to train six
of its pilots every year for the next 20 years in Canada.
Negotiations are close to being complete with Britain, company
officials said. Bombardier also is talking to Italy, and to one
non-NATO country.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenzweig of Bombardier said that additional aircraft would
have to be purchased as the other nations signed up their pilots
but he said that the bonds sold to purchase the Raytheon planes are
backed completely by the tuition for training Canadian pilots, and
therefore there is ``zero chance of default.''.
</P>
<P>
   The initial purchase of 24 aircraft is being undertaken by a
paper company called Milit-Air Inc., which was set up by Bombardier
and will then lease the planes for 20 years to Bombardier
Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardier is also spending $400 million to buy 18 British
Aerospace Mark 115 Hawks, modified to simulate the flight of F-18
fighter jets. Rosenzweig said the first student pilots were
supposed to begin training in February, starting on the T-6A
trainer, then on the Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual private sector arrangement is raising concerns in
Canada, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Art Hanger, a member of Parliament from Alberta and military
affairs critic for the opposition, said he did not know what
guarantees Bombardier or the government had offered about the
eventual use of the Raytheon planes. Hanger said he was still
trying to get information from Ottawa about the sale of more than
30 American-made Vietnam-era helicopters disposed of at a
government surplus sale conducted by a private company in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The private purchaser of the helicopters then attempted to sell
a number of them to the government of Iraq. In 1997, the plan was
uncovered by American officials and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   American regulators say they want the Bombardier project to be a
success. But they say it is better to insist on tight controls now
_ such as preventing Canadians who hold dual citizenship with
countries like Iraq or Iran from working at the training base _ in
order to prevent problems in future.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that stunned the entertainment business, Robert Daly
and Terry Semel, the co-chairmen of Warner Brothers, announced
their resignations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel, whose nearly 20-year partnership was one of the
most stable and successful in Hollywood history, have endured a
string of box-office flops in recent years as well as a luckluster
music record. But they said their decision was unrelated to that.
</P>
<P>
   They had been considering leaving for several months, they said,
and had discussed the idea informally with Gerald Levin, chairman
of the studio's parent company, Time Warner. They told Levin of
their decision late Wednesday in New York, on the eve of Time
Warner's board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations came after Time Warner reported
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings Thursday, on the eve
of Warner Brothers' highly anticipated release of ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, the last movie made
by Stanley Kubrick, who died in March.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, 62, and Semel, 55, said they told Levin they wanted to
join forces as entertainment entrepreneurs. ``If I was ever to
pursue another challenge in my life, I felt the time was now,''
Semel said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision immediately cast the normally stable Warner
Brothers studios in turmoil. As to possible replacements,
speculation centered on, among others, Barry Meyer, executive vice
president and chief operating officer, who is popular on Wall
Street; Jeff Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of Home Box
Office, who is close to Ted Turner, vice chairman and 11 percent
owner of Time Warner; Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios;
Jeffrey Katzenberg, a partner at Dreamworks SKG; Peter Chernin,
president and chief operating officer of News Corp., which owns
20th Century Fox, and Leslie Moonves, a former head of Warner
Brothers television and now president and chief executive of CBS
television.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Time Warner, Levin said he was saddened by the
decision. ``There is never a good time to lose this kind of
talent,'' he said, ``but our film, TV and music businesses, and our
company as a whole, are in excellent shape, and there is tremendous
depth of management throughout our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deeply personal decision,'' he added. ``What they
decided to do was something very human.'' He said the two had come
to a point in their lives ``where they can think about
themselves.'' Levin said Daly and Semel would play a central role
in creating a new team, but made it clear he would make the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the CEO,'' he said. ``I will think this through.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, top Hollywood agents said that even though Daly and
Semel in recent months had made known their interest in leaving,
they had been wavering. One agent said preliminary talks with Time
Warner indicated that the company wanted to wrest the troubled
music division away from the pair. It was, the agent said, a factor
in the final decision. The music division, run by Daly and Semel,
has fared poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Once the most successful music company in the industry, Warner
music has been mired in management turmoil. After the controversial
departure of its longtime management team several years ago, Levin
turned first to Michael Fuchs, the former chairman of HBO, and then
to Daly and Semel. By all accounts, the team was relatively
inexperienced in the music business, and the division was only
lately starting to recover.
</P>
<P>
   According to Soundscan, which tracks industry performance,
Warner Music was fourth in album sales after Universal, BMG and
Sony. In total domestic share, including catalog sales, Warner has
remained second after Universal, but its market share has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel _ as well as Levin _ insisted that no contract
talks had begun, and that the decision was simply based on their
yearning to create and own their own ventures. But there was
speculation by several top Hollywood executives that the two _ who
were unaccustomed to criticism in the media _ had simply grown
thin-skinned and weary over attacks on their film record.
</P>
<P>
   Their most recent big-budget film, ``Wild, Wild West,'' while
No. 1 at the box office last week, was poorly received by critics
and may barely earn a profit, if at all. The film cost an estimated
$180 million, rivals and agents say, but Warner Brothers said it
was much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Daly and Semel to leave at the end of the year
marked the end of an enduring partnership, involving two stolid,
tough and unflashy businessmen. Their films included the lucrative
``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon'' franchises. Even more important,
Warner Brothers was just about the only studio in town to develop a
reputation for stability _ even during bleak periods it avoided
bloodletting and nurtured a loyalty among its well-paid employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even by Hollywood standards, the two executives are enormously
wealthy. Their yearly compensation is believed to be as high as $25
million each. Semel's accumulated wealth is estimated as high as
$500 million, largely because of soaring Time Warner stock. Daly's
is said to be less, perhaps $300 million, because of a divorce
settlement. The two men declined to discuss their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood moguls said they were amazed at the departures. Roth,
of Disney, was awakened by a phone call from a reporter this
morning with the news. ``I'm as shocked as you are,'' he said, and
denied having any discussions about a top job there. Katzenberg
heard about it in the restaurant of the Four Seasons Hotel in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breathtaker,'' he said, adding: ``These two guys are
the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of the movie business.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As to his moving to Warner Brothers, Katzenberg said, ``There's
no chance. It's not in the world of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel made it plain that in some ways they were seeking
to kick off their new careers by emulating Barry Diller, now
chairman and chief executive of USA Networks and its largest
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the two have held private discussions with
Diller to discuss the pitfalls of striking out on one's own. ``I
always envied what Barry Diller did,'' Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   Diller said he had been speaking privately for more than a year
with Daly and Semel. ``They want a third act,'' Diller said. ``The
difference for them, as opposed to most people, is that they're
sitting on a big empire. And, as I told them, choosing independence
over empire is very scary to do, the longer you let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller said he was convinced that Time Warner wanted to renew
the contracts of Semel and Daly. ``There's no question of that,''
Diller said. ``Bob and Terry just wanted to choose independence.''

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, July 12,
about an arrangement by the National Association of Broadcasters to
televise the wives of Congressmen in public service advertisements
referred incorrectly to the main legislation sought by the
broadcasters. It would let satellite companies carry over-the-air
broadcasts from local television stations but prohibit them from
carrying distant signals if an adequate local broadcast was
available. It would not prohibit them altogether from carrying
over-the-air signals.

COCA-COLA'S 2D QUARTER PROFITS FALL 21 PERCENT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In part because it had to pull millions of soft drinks off the
market in Europe last month, the Coca-Cola Co.'s second-quarter
profit fell 21 percent, the company said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter ended June 30, net income dropped to $942
million, or 38 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.19 billion,
or 48 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide sales volume, measured in cases of finished drinks,
fell 2 percent, compared with a 10 percent increase in the period a
year earlier. The company appears to be spending heavily on
marketing even as volume declines. It reported that revenue rose 4
percent, to $5.38 billion from $5.15 billion, but that sales,
administrative and general expenses increased 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The volume and earnings were about what Wall Street had
expected, and Coke shares rose $2.125, closing at $64.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth consecutive quarter in which Coke reported a
decline in earnings, but analysts seemed to take the results in
stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is, there's no incremental bad news,'' said
Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Coca-Cola's top management, including its chairman
and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, has scheduled an unusual
meeting with analysts and investors in New York for next Thursday.
Topics on the agenda include the recall in Europe, global business
conditions and Coke's growth outlook.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Thursday, the company said the recall, which
began in Belgium on June 14 with hundreds of people saying they
became ill after drinking Coke products and spread to France,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands, was a factor in its performance.
About 17 million cases of Coke products had to be recalled and
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two plants in Belgium and a third in France were
shut down while Coca-Cola sought to determine what had made people
ill. The company concluded that a flawed batch of carbon dioxide,
used to carbonate its soft drinks, from a Belgian plant may have
caused a bad smell in one set of products and that a phenol
compound used to protect shipping crates in the French plant may
have done the same thing. But in both cases, Coca-Cola maintained
that the substances it detected were present in amounts too tiny to
have made anyone ill.
</P>
<P>
   The recall's effect on Coca-Cola's earnings was 2 to 3 cents a
share, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   While volume fell 6 percent in European markets, it declined in
many other places, as well. In China, volume dropped 9 percent, a
decline the company attributed to severe flooding in the eastern
part of the country last month and to the fallout from the bombing
by the United States of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In India, volume rose 2 percent, far less than in the second
quarter of 1998, when it grew 33 percent. Again, the weather was at
fault, Coca-Cola said, noting that the early monsoons decreased
sales near the end of the quarter. Over all, volume fell 2 percent
in the Middle East and East Asian division.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was flat in Latin America, compared with a 12 percent
increase in the second quarter last year, and sales in countries
like Venezuela and Colombia continued to slide. In Africa, volume
fell 1 percent, mostly in the southern part of the continent, where
the company said unrest in Zimbabwe and economic weakness in South
Africa drove down demand.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, volume fell 1 percent, compared with an 8
percent increase in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, one of Coke's largest markets, volume grew 6 percent,
a turnaround from a 3 percent decline in the second quarter last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Equity income, from bottlers in which Coca-Cola holds a stake,
has fallen 83 percent so far this year, the company said. That pace
is ahead of last year's, when equity income decreased 79 percent, a
reflection of the sales slowdowns that bottlers are encountering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equity-income line was supposed to be a nice contributor
to earnings growth,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer
products analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``It's backward now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the quarter as a whole, he added: ``It's like Zeus was
hurling thunderbolts at them, and Zeus worked for Pepsi.''

YOU'VE GOT MAIL. YOU'RE BEING WATCHED. 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Wis.)   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was tragic,'' recalled Mary Beth Heying, a principal at
Edward Jones &AMP; Co., the brokerage firm in St. Louis. In April, an
employee had complained to the human resources department after
receiving an e-mail containing inappropriate material, meaning
off-color jokes, pornography and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We investigated and found that a large number of associates
were involved'' in distributing such messages, Ms. Heying said.
Depending on ``the egregiousness of their involvement,'' she said,
the company dismissed 19, warned 41 and allowed 1 to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a ``very clear'' written policy on e-mail, Ms.
Heying said. Some 2,700 of the company's 17,000 employees have
e-mail or Internet access at work (none of the brokers do, because
written communication is heavily regulated in the brokerage
industry), and each of the 2,700 was given a copy of the policy
when receiving e-mail access, Ms. Heying said.
</P>
<P>
   An American Management Association survey this year found that
27 percent of companies do what Edward Jones does _ monitor
internal e-mail _ up from 20.2 percent in 1998. In the vast
majority of cases, employees are informed of the surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   There is little dispute that companies have both the power and
the legal right to monitor e-mail sent on the company network on
company time. But there are conflicting ethical imperatives at work
when managers consider a monitoring policy: on the one hand, to
avoid unwarranted intrusions into employees' privacy; on the other,
to keep unchecked circulation of off-color jokes and other
inappropriate material from creating a hostile atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Allan A. Kennedy, a management consultant and co-author of ``The
New Corporate Cultures'' (Perseus, 1999), starts from the premise
that ``companies that monitor e-mail traffic or use the power of
modern technology to act as Big Brother to the employees are
dehumanizing the work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sees a need for policing e-mail, given how it can
expose a company to litigation. He says the best approach is to let
workers frame the policy. ``An employee-based e-mail monitoring
system would not be as disrespectful,'' he said. ``It would be from
one employee to another, saying `We don't want to work in an
environment where this kind of thing goes on.' It'd be equivalent
to the kind of natural monitoring that would have gone on around
the water cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, though, monitoring is rarely continuous; far more
often it is used only when a company has someone or something to
investigate _ when an employee complains, for example, about a
particular message. Indeed, Laura P. Hartman, a professor of
business ethics at the University of Wisconsin, thinks the
(italics)threat(end italics) of monitoring may be seen as a
strong-enough deterrent that companies can spare themselves from
much actual monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are naturally uneasy about unmasking inappropriate
e-mail and dismissing offenders. But invasion of privacy isn't the
root of the unease; the distress of firing is. Most managers dread
having to do something so painful to the person across the desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a zero tolerance policy with regard to inappropriate
e-mail, and people know that,'' Ms. Heying said. ``Does that mean
we didn't feel badly about 20 associates? Oh, by all means, we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail takes companies into new ethical territory, as they
struggle with controlling a technology so utterly different from
other communications tools. Unlike a phone call or hallway
conversation, e-mail leaves an audit trail that can pinpoint the
abuser. But unlike a paper memo, e-mail moves at lightning speed,
both in delivery and in composition, often with little reflection
or second thoughts. It will probably be awhile before there is
corporate consensus on the fairest balance between privacy and
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the responsibility to do the right thing falls upon
employees, who can use common sense as a guide. If an employee's
passion for e-mail privacy is born of a desire not to have the boss
find out he's been placing bids all day for vintage comic books in
an on-line auction, chances are he already knows he shouldn't be
doing that at work.
</P>
<P>
   In this new high-technology world, a remarkably old-fashioned
rule of thumb applies: Don't do what you wouldn't want to be caught
doing. &QL;

Center for the Study of Values in Public Life. His column on
business ethics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail may

THIS BROKER REALLY TAKES A LONG VIEW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., S.C.)   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can't see what all the fuss is about,'' said Frank W.
Fletcher, 95, a stockbroker. ``My father was pushing a hand mower
well into his 90s.''
</P>
<P>
   And the way things are going in the workplace, there may soon be
no fuss whatsoever about people toiling into their 90s _ or even
their 100s. Not only are Americans living and working longer, but
in some fields, older workers are even being sought out.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the investment business, where a stampeding bull market
has produced legions of silver-haired millionaires-next-door. Many
older investors prefer to work with a broker of their own
generation, said David W. Wiley III, 44, who is Fletcher's boss at
Wiley Bros./Aintree Capital, a brokerage firm in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting the elderly is not just a brokerage-business
phenomenon. Seventy-something models are hired to appear in glossy
ads for makeup for the great-grandmother on the go, and 60-year-old
engineers are being hauled out of retirement by the
cruise-ship-full to work on Year 2000 problems. (After all, they
installed the stuff.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher was born on Oct. 3, 1903, four months after an engineer
named Henry formed the Ford Motor Co. and 10 weeks before Orville
Wright made that famous flight. And when folks muttered about ``the
Depression'' back then, they meant the four years after the Panic
of 1893.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, when Fletcher was a teen-ager, the market crashed
again, leaving four million people out of work. ``A dress rehearsal
for the big one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The big crash, in 1929, came just four weeks after he married _
and the very week that he and his bride, Mary, visited the New York
Stock Exchange. ``The government did all the wrong things back then
_ we needed Alan Greenspan,'' said Fletcher, an unabashed admirer
of the current Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Vanderbilt University in 1925, Fletcher
joined his family's wholesale food business, soon becoming
president and staying until the company was sold in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   That year, at 51, Fletcher embarked on his second career,
joining the Eisenhower administration as deputy director of the
Agency for International Development. His first overseas posting,
in Amman, Jordan, coincided with the Suez crisis. ``It wasn't
exactly the time or place to be wearing an `I like Ike' button,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, he returned to Nashville, to work on the presidential
campaign of Richard M. Nixon. But after John F. Kennedy's
inauguration in 1961, he again had to decide what to do with the
rest of his life. Some friends were ready to pull out the golf
clubs, but retirement at 58 held no appeal for him.
</P>
<P>
   He became an insurance salesman. ``I gave it a year,'' he
recalled, ``but selling insurance just didn't fit my personality.''
A friend suggested the investment business and invited him to join
Aintree Capital.
</P>
<P>
   There, in 1962, he began his fourth career. ``I loved this
business from the start,'' he said. ``And the good thing about it
is that you can be a broker while you play golf. In fact, people
here expect it of you.''
</P>
<P>
   He not only dispenses investment advice _ his current favorites
are Lincoln National Life, Lucent Technologies and BellSouth _ but
also career advice. To the young (anyone under 90), he says, ``Do
something you enjoy and you'll probably be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is his own best example. ``Every day something new is
happening with the markets,'' he said, ``so it's always exciting to
me, never boring.''
</P>
<P>
   His son, Frank Jr., 56, a stockbroker in Greenville, S.C.,
offers another perspective. ``When you're married to a Nashville
social queen, as he's been for decades, you'd better find a job to
go to every day,'' he said. Whatever the reason, he has clearly had
a successful marriage. He and Mrs. Fletcher, now 91, will celebrate
their 70th anniversary this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there's work to be done. And it's not always a
cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher said that, as a broker, there are disadvantages to
getting old. ``Customers have died or turned their affairs over to
banks and investment companies,'' he said. ``And the young people
coming up want to deal with people in their own social circle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wiley, Fletcher's boss, sees many pluses. ``Frank has a
great sense of humor,'' he said, ``and he's as mentally effective
as any 40-year-old, and sometimes more so.'' Wiley said older
workers add continuity and a much-needed long-term perspective
about the markets.
</P>
<P>
   A co-worker, J. Anthony Curcio, said: ``He's a voracious
consumer of financial commentary. Every morning he reads the
business papers with a four-inch magnifying glass, and if he sees
an article that would be of interest to another broker he takes it
right to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher has no plans to retire, but he acknowledges that there
are some things outside the office that he can no longer manage.
``I can't play golf anymore, I can't drink as much as I'd like and
there's one other thing I can't do but I can't remember what it is
so I guess it doesn't matter.''

DR. ERNST LUDWIG WYNDER, 77, HELPED LINK TOBACCO TO CANCERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Ernst Ludwig Wynder, who was the founding
president of the American Health Foundation and who posted early
warnings of cancers lurking in the environment, particularly for
smokers, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in Manhattan. He was 77 and had lived in Manhattan and in
Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer of the thyroid, said the foundation, a
nonprofit research organization that Wynder formed in 1969 and
guided at his death.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Wynder (pronounced WIN-der), the
foundation became one of the country's foremost private research
centers for preventive medicine and health maintenance, supported
largely by grants and contracts from the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has a staff of about 200 researchers, whose
specialties include epidemiology, synthetic chemistry,
biochemistry, nutrition sciences, experimental oncology, molecular
biology and the behavioral sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work is carried out in laboratories that Wynder
built on the grounds of the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla,
N.Y. Additional research is done in Manhattan and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Wynder himself was credited with furnishing biological proof
that tobacco smoke contained a cancer-producing substance. As a
researcher associated with Sloan-Kettering, he subsequently linked
excessive tobacco use with cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus,
larynx, pancreas and bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Working alone and in collaboration with others, he provided
chemical proof of the carcinogenic potential of tobacco smoke and
tobacco itself. The work effectively closed the circle of evidence
and tied cigarette smoking to an array of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Wynder was born in Herford, Germany, in 1922 and came to
the United States in 1938. He graduated from New York University in
1943, the year he received his citizenship, and was a U.S. Army
intelligence officer in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he earned both a B.S. in medical science and his M.D.
at Washington University in St. Louis. While still a student there,
he began cancer research with his professor and mentor, Evarts A.
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   In one particular study of 605 men who had developed lung
cancer, the two men determined that smoking was a common factor. Of
those patients, 97 percent were heavy smokers while only 2 percent
were nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   Their work was generally regarded as the first major study to
make that link, and the American Medical Association hailed it in
1985 as landmark research.
</P>
<P>
   Wynder followed with a paper at Sloan-Kettering in 1953 in which
he presented evidence that condensate made from cigarette smoke,
painted onto the backs of mice, caused malignant tumors. Four years
later, the Surgeon General's office posted its first official
warning that excessive smoking may cause lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate continued. As recently as 1994, the heads of the
major tobacco companies in the United States swore before a
Congressional subcommittee that nicotine was not addictive and
might not be a cause of cancer after all.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to research on tobacco-related cancers, Wynder led
studies comparing the incidence of various types of cancer with
demographic and clinical data in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the role of poor nutrition in cancers of the upper
alimentary tract were highlighted in research that Wynder conducted
in collaboration with Swedish colleagues. They identified iron
deficiency as a key factor in Plummer-Vinson syndrome, a painful
disorder afflicting some middle-aged women. As a result, an iron
supplement was added to flour, ending the sickness in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Wynder wrote or contributed to more than 700 papers and received
many honors in this country and in Europe. He was a principal
author of ``Environmental Aspects of Cancer: The Role of Macro and
Minor Components of Food'' (1988, Food and Nutrition Press).
</P>
<P>
   He started his work at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer
Research in 1952 as an assistant researcher and rose to chief of
epidemiology. After he created the American Health Foundation, he
continued his association with Sloan-Kettering as an associate
scientist into the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Wynder is survived by his wife, Sandra Miller Wynder, and a
sister, Lore Levinson of Springfield, N.J.

CLOCK TICKING FOR CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From his office in Ogden, Utah, Big Sky Conference
commissioner Doug Fullerton sadly watches the events unfold around
the Cal State Northridge football team and knows time is running
out.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge remains a member of the Big Sky for now, but who
knows for how much longer?
</P>
<P>
   Northridge's inability to build the larger football stadium
required by the Big Sky continues to frustrate Fullerton. He sees
Sacramento State's intent to comply and would like to see
Northridge follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to `You need to do something now,' '' Fullerton
said. ``We would love to have them have an on-campus stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also talk of Northridge one day joining the Big West
Conference, which is in a state of flux. The nonfootball members
such as Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State would like to
reconfigure into an all-California conference without football.
Football members such as Boise State, Idaho and Utah State are
being courted by several conferences, including the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State athletic director Bill Shumard said Northridge
would be considered for Big West membership should an
all-California conference become reality. A source also said
Northridge interim president Louanne Kennedy has informally
mentioned to her colleagues she would be interested in the Big
West.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is all just talk. Northridge athletic director
Dick Dull said neither he nor anyone else within the department has
contacted anyone about the Big West. Besides, first must come the
resolution of the ongoing investigation into possible violations
within the football program. Offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie has
already resigned, and findings could be released today.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has been granted an extension to build the stadium.
Dull said he expects to receive guidelines next week when the Big
Sky ADs meet in Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Dull also agreed this is a time of conference reconfiguration
and any institution, including Northridge, should keep its options
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not initiated anything,'' Dull said. ``We are members
in the Big Sky Conference. We value our membership in the Big
Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, commissioner Fullerton wonders about Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Snakebit' is a good word,'' Fullerton said. ``I feel bad
they haven't gotten everything under control. It seems it's one
thing after another.''

BUSH'S DECISION TO FORGO FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS DRAWS CRITICISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's victory in the checkbook
primary of the Republican presidential contest and his decision
Thursday to forgo federal matching funds may have cost him some
moral high ground in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents are claiming that his massive fund-raising
operation, which has raised $37 million, has essentially corrupted
the democratic process by marginalizing lesser-funded candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in our party don't want the voters to have a say in
picking our nominee,'' Republican candidate Lamar Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to hold an auction on the White House lawn and sell
the presidency to the highest bidder,'' said Alexander, the former
Tennessee governor and U.S. education secretary. ``These moneyed
interests contend the so-called money primary matters more than the
Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who has made campaign finance
reform a cornerstone of his Senate terms and his campaign, said
Bush's decision to pass on matching funds and required spending
limits sends the wrong signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``By refusing to abide by the accepted guidelines, Governor Bush
may be unintentionally adding to the already widespread cynicism of
the American people regarding the influence of special interest
money in politics,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised almost twice as much money as all of his
Republican opponents combined.
</P>
<P>
   Such a daunting prospect led in part to the decision by Sen. Bob
Smith, R-N.H., to drop out of the race and leave the Republican
Party earlier this week. And Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, dropped out
of the race and endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates have been complaining about Bush's
record-setting fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle last week said, ``Message, not
money, is what counts in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes called Bush the ``virtual reality'' candidate
fabricated by the ``money bosses and the media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the dollars he gets is a shackle tying him to the
interests of the monied establishment of this country that has
shown a willingness to sell out our conscience,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not been criticized on the money issue by Steve Forbes,
who spent $36 million of his own money on an unsuccessful
presidential bid in 1996. Bush cited Forbes' candidacy this time as
the main reason he is rejecting the federal matching funds, which
contain spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has already contributed $6.6 million of his own money to
the $2.7 million he raised from potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, whose husband Bob set the previous campaign
fund-raising record of about $31.3 million in the first half of
1995, also has not specifically criticized Bush's fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But Dole has noted that ``there are a number of other Texans who
raised huge amounts of money but did not carry the ball across the
finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Gov. John Connally spent $13 million in 1980 in an
unsuccessful presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Miller, executive director of Public Campaign, a campaign
finance reform group, said Bush ``has thumbed his nose at the
voters' sense of fair play'' by rejecting the federal matching
funds spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is now free to blow other candidates out of the
political water well before the voters of this country even get
their say,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his campaign fund-raising does not violate the spirit
of democracy because he has raised money from more than 70,000
people across the country and lived within the $1,000-per-person
contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has proposed campaign finance reform, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning soft money to political parties from unions and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instant disclosure of contributions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raising individual contributions limits to more than the
current $1,000 to allow greater financing of all candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has said she would support raising the individual limit to
$5,000 a person. She noted that the current limit was set in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't even reflect the rate of inflation,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander wants to remove the limit altogether, but require
instant disclosure as Bush wants.
</P>
<P>
   However, removing the limits might not help other candidates.
Several people who could only give Bush $1,000 for his presidential
race could give him contributions akin to the $100,000 they each
gave him for his gubernatorial races in Texas where there are no
contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander also has called on a moratorium on public opinion
polls by news organizations because he feels they influence who
receives contributions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made a ban on all soft money to political parties his
campaign mantra. He has described the contributions as a back-door
way to influence presidents and Congress. However, McCain also
could support raising the individual contribution limits to
presidential candidates if certain other reforms also passed, he
says.

 &HT;    Racial issues part of mixed legacy of Birmingham mayor
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Finance and health care have replaced steel
and coal as the economic muscle of this town. But other aspects are
harder to change. Political vision, for instance, remains tinted in
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with the legacy of Richard Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   The son of sharecroppers, the first black man elected mayor of
Alabama's largest city, Arrington retires today after a 20-year
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   How he will be remembered, his oldest critics say, is a matter
of race. Ardent supporters, several of them white business leaders,
contend history will look favorably on Arrington's two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Social changes abound. The city council has a black majority
thanks to Arrington's political machine. City contracts with black
firms over the years total in the millions, after amounting to less
than $1,000 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Rights Institute, supported by city tax money, stands
as a memorial and tourist attraction erected on Birmingham's
confrontational past. Arrington worked to eliminate police
brutality from the white-dominated police force he inherited, a
group then only 16 years removed from the head-cracking days of
police commissioner Eugene ``Bull'' Connor, who used dogs to attack
civil rights demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably had exaggerated black expectations and
exaggerated white anxiety, neither of which was justified,'' said
Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor, who was midway
through his second term when Arrington was elected in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you had to manage that politically,'' Jackson said. ``He
had to do it; I had to do it. Eventually, you get past that. You
have to manage change and manage these expectations. ... He's been
an outstanding transition mayor from the old Birmingham to the new
Birmingham.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally dressed in tailored suits, Arrington spent Thursday
cleaning out his office in agolf shirt, blue jeans and sandals. His
staff helped him take down 20 years' worth of memorabilia _ a
football from the World League, soccer balls from the Olympic
tournament the city hosted.
</P>
<P>
   During one of Arrington's final interviews, the dark
cherry-colored walls of his office already were almost bare, except
for a large portrait of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former
president and civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a death,'' said receptionist Willease Burts, who has
known Arrington since she was a child.
</P>
<P>
   Among those mourning are many of the city's business leaders.
The mayor pushed for several annexations to encourage commercial
development that increased the city's tax base. The University of
Alabama at Birmingham medical college cranks out doctors and
nurses. An hour west of town, Mercedes builds upscale sport utility
vehicles. An hour to the east, Honda will crank up an assembly line
in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, a 64-year-old biologist with a doctorate in
invertebrate zoology from the University of Oklahoma, is leaving
office, he says, because it's time. A special election will be held
Oct. 12. City Council President William Bell, who is black and an
Arrington loyalist, will preside as interim mayor, giving him an
edge, critics say, in the race to succeed Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 20 years,'' said Arrington, who dreamed about
becoming a college president. ``The city needs an injection of new
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But saying unequivocally that Birmingham is better off because
of Arrington perturbs critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a matter of color,'' said Nina Miglionico, who is white
and served on the city council with Arrington before he was elected
mayor. She started on the council in 1963, the year a bomb blast at
the 16th Street Baptist Church killed four girls during Sunday
school class. A civil rights activist, Miglionico did not seek
re-election in 1985 in the face of Arrington's powerful Jefferson
County Citizens Coalition, which still controls the city's
majority-black voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're black, it's worked out beautifully because he calls
all the shots,'' Miglionico said, ``but the whites felt left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Birmingham faces the same troubles as many urban hubs:
crime and poor education, which drive affluent residents of all
races to the suburbs. Birmingham has lost nearly 11 percent of its
population since 1980. Nearly seven of every 10 city residents are
black. Most of the suburbs have a white majority.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps feeling especially left out are low- and middle-income
whites who in decades past worked for U.S. Steel and voted for
George Wallace. More recently, they've voted for Fob James for
governor. In last year's GOP gubernatorial runoff, Arrington
endorsed moderate white challenger Winton Blount. The threat of
black crossover votes in the GOP nomination turned out thousands of
conservative whites and led to Blount's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Arrington does not get high marks for building bridges
with average white voters,'' said Natalie Davis, an Arrington
supporter and political scientist at Birmingham Southern College.
``In Birmingham they feel a sense of powerlessness, so he's been a
target in that sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before he took office, Arrington aligned himself with
corporate Birmingham. He built consensus, and that helped him push
his agenda of affirmative-action hiring in the city and reform in
the police department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made that a priority,'' said Alabama Power CEO Elmer
Harris, a major force in Arrington's small inner circle. ``The
mayor has been a very positive force for the city of Birmingham and
taken this city to new heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, Harris and the Rev. John T. Porter developed a
partnership that began revitalizing part of downtown. A modern
early learning center and a facility for senior citizens have been
constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said future generations will ``be able to see the
achievements of his administration without race connotations. If it
were a white man, it would be the same thing. I don't think his
race has anything to do with how people will look back upon him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a very successful mayor. He has worked with
whites, he has worked with blacks. He's moved this city forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Arrington's biggest steps backward was the two-year
federal investigation of city hall corruption. Though he wasn't
charged, Arrington calls it the low point of his administration. In
1992, he spent a day in jail after refusing to give his personal
appointment records to a federal judge, complaining the U.S.
attorney singled him out because he was a black officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington protested by symbolically chaining himself to
protesters, awakening images Birmingham long had tried to put
behind it. An old chasm opened between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the few times the corporate community got its
back up,'' said Davis, the political analyst. ``They complained it
reinforced a stereotype. People were very upset at him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Harris, the power company executive, ``Anybody that is
faced with an aggressive prosecutor has to attack that in any
manner that he sees as successful. I supported the mayor in the
past, I supported him at that time, and I support him today.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, during Arrington's final City Council meeting, most
members gave him a standing ovation. Councilman Jimmy Blake, one of
Arrington's most outspoken critics, sat unmoved. He blames
Arrington for the city's dwindling population but gives the mayor
an A-plus for politicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older blacks saw him as a messiah figure,'' said Blake,
who is white and running to replace Arrington. ``He was very
popular among the white establishment _ and always has been
_because they made a lot of money off him. He has played both sides
of the race fence beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Parsons, the white lawyer Arrington defeated in a runoff
in 1979, shares some of those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parsons credits Arrington with bringing private
enterprise and federal assistance to Birmingham at a level Parsons
might not have achieved. White business leaders cultivated
relationships with Arrington because, Parsons said, they wanted to
be counted as progressives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made some inroads,'' Parsons said. ``And, let's face it,
that's what politics are all about.

</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK-FILMS (Undated) _ In ``The Killing'' (1956), one of
Stanley Kubrick's earliest feature films, a man talking about his
cronies in a racetrack heist remarks: ``None of these men are
criminals in the usual sense. They've all got jobs and they all
live seemingly normal, decent lives, but they've got their problems
and they've all got a little larceny in them.'' Change ``a little
larceny'' to varying degrees of ``a lot'' and you've got a pretty
good description of Kubrick's entire body of work. Kubrick's new
movie, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a lugubrious, strangely static work that
he completed shortly before his death in March, is no exception.
The movie stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a wealthy New York
couple who imperil their cushy, bourgeois lives by yielding to the
dark side of their natures. By Michiko Kakutani. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CUNNINGHAM-DANCE (Undated) _ Talking about Merce Cunningham's
choreography can lead to an attack of the nonlinear. Words like
possibility, multiplicity and flexibility burst out like the
unexpected movements in his dances. As Lincoln Center Festival '99
prepares to honor Cunningham with an 80th-birthday celebration this
week, he is, as always, exploring new ways of moving in new
contexts. Theories that explain the premises behind his work
abound. Yet the cerebral and the fantastic have never been at odds
in his half-century of experiments. Once heckled as the high priest
of the dance avant-garde and now acclaimed for the same reason, he
has never failed to show that even the most fully plotted cosmos
can reveal surprising secrets. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BELGIAN-FILMS (Undated) _ This year marked the triumph of the
realist strain in Belgian film, as ``Rosetta,'' directed by Luc and
Jean-Pierre Dardenne (brothers whose previous films include ``La
Promesse'') captured top honors, including the Palme d'Or, at the
Cannes International Film Festival. (While across town ``The
Carriers are Waiting,'' a comedy about a working-class family by a
firsttime Belgian director, Benoit Mariage, played to packed houses
at the Director's Fortnight, a sidebar to the main festival.)
``Rosetta,'' which will open here in the fall, uses a hand-held
camera and a cinema verite style to tell an intense moral fable
about an impoverished young girl's struggle to hold down a menial
job while maintaining shreds of dignity. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   CABARET-BALKAN-FILM (Paris) _ It is not an easy time for a
Serbian filmmaker to be releasing a new movie in the United States,
even for a veteran director like Goran Paskaljevic, who has long
opposed Slobodan Milosevic's regime, who has expressed his shame
over the atrocities committed by Serbian forces in Bosnia and
Kosovo, who has been denounced as a traitor by the official press
in Belgrade. For all that, he remains a Serb, and, as such, he is
expected to throw light on the collective madness that has gripped
a good many of his fellow Serbs of late. As it happens, this was
his objective when he began shooting ``Cabaret Balkan,'' his 11th
feature film, in Belgrade in the early spring of 1998. It was still
a year before NATO launched its aerial war against Yugoslavia in
the name of saving Kosovo, but Paskaljevic was already convinced
that Milosevic was leading his nation to disaster. His movie is
about people, not politics, but nonetheless about people driven to
violence and despair by politics. By Alan Riding. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOLITUDE-THEATER (London) _ ``Fair enough then. So we're
alone.'' When Dame Judi Dench, playing a grieving veteran theater
actress, speaks the final line of ``Amy's View'' Sunday on Broadway
during the last performance at the Ethel Barrymore Theater of David
Hare's play, the remark may make theatergoers sit up with a start.
Part of the frisson comes from the elegant visualization of those
closing moments, in which cascading sheets of silk prompt a far
more real emotive response than any musical's mechanized scenery
ever could. For that, credit Richard Eyre, the director, and Bob
Crowley, the designer, alongside that rare performer, Dame Judi,
who is never more moving than when she is being most
matter-of-fact. But beyond the simplicity of a scene that works
simultaneously as baptism and requiem, is the stark, declarative
nature of the concluding remarks of Dame Judi's character, Esme
Allen. In just those six unsentimental words, Esme gives voice to a
condition that has been dramatized of late with varying degrees of
urgency and pathos on New York and London stages. By Matt Wolf.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE-BENJAMIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Some artists bloom young;
others do not find themselves until they are a decade or two into
adult life. George Benjamin, 3, the English composer who is in
residence at the Tanglewood Music Center Festival of Contemporary
Music, beginning on Thursday in Lenox, Mass., where his music will
be featured, has followed both patterns. In his late teens and
early 20s Benjamin produced a quick succession of bold and
beautiful works, full of energy and color, and remarkable also for
their technical finish. Then the flow almost stopped until, as he
entered his 30s in 1990, he emerged again as an even stronger
creative presence, with the same keen ear but a weightier mind. The
Tanglewood programs include pieces from both the youthful
flourishing and later. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL-PARK-OPERAS (Undated) _ A new operatic project could
hardly receive a more auspicious introduction than that to be
accorded over the next five months to ``Central Park,'' a trilogy
of one-act operas by three American composer-librettist teams.
That's why the flak that the project has stirred up among many
people concerned about the future of American opera, especially
American composers, has been so noteworthy. The short operas that
make up the trilogy are linked thematically only in that each story
is set in New York's most famous park. ``Central Park'' will have
its premiere on Saturday evening at the Glimmerglass Opera in
Cooperstown, N.Y. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BAROQUE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Celine Dion singing ``My Heart Will Go
On'' and a Locatelli violin concerto send me to the radio's ``off''
button with equal velocity. A decision about Ms. Dion took about 45
seconds, Locatelli more like 30 years. But the two are annoying for
similar reasons. Ms. Dion makes it easy. The disposable charms of a
momentarily famous pop singer are brief by nature. Yet how has a
love affair with the Italian Baroque _ born of the postwar
long-playing record boom _ gone so wrong? Those of us raised on the
big pieces of the 19th century, a lot of Mozart and a little Haydn
raced to the record stores to hear the latest Torelli and Corelli
from chamber orchestras like I Musici or I Virtuosi di Roma. We
were charmed by the elegance and the certitude. We liked the
absence of bigness for its own sake and the clarity of small string
ensembles in synchrony. With exceptions (Vivaldi is one), I find
this music increasingly difficult to listen to. Saturation?
Perhaps. Near-symmetry, often repeated, numbs the spirit; the
frictionless paradoxically becomes an irritant. This civilizing of
human passions runs like a current beneath the great musical events
of the 18th century, although the best composers, refusing to be so
easily tamed, fought against the tide. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CONDUCTORS-MUSIC (Undated) _ At a time when so many orchestras
and conductors are changing partners, it is good to be reminded of
the artistic benefits of retaining a long-term maestro. One such
reminder comes in the form of a Sony Classical reissue of two
classic recordings by the Cleveland Orchestra under the direction
of George Szell: Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, recorded in 1959, and
Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, recorded in 1965. These
performances may not induce discophiles to part with their version
of the Prokofiev by Herbert von Karajan or of the Bartok by Fritz
Reiner, but both offer orchestral playing of breathtaking
refinement while challenging the notion that Szell was a dour
taskmaster and an interpretive literalist. By David Schiff.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Most of the recent controversy about
on-line music has been over how it is going to change the
experience of selling and purchasing music, but much more
interesting is the question of how it is changing our experience of
listening to and handling the music. Listening to music on the
Internet is not simply a novel alternative to CD players or a way
to use the computer as a separate but equal stereo system. Nor is
it an opportunity to level the playing field _ as utopians like to
dream _ and allow all musicians, great and small, access to all
listeners mainstream and marginal. It is a key to unlocking the
restrictions that all audio storage media before them have posed to
musicians and fans. The CD was a medium similar enough to a record
that one could still call it an album without being corrected. But
with the Internet, the idea of the album is dead. By Neil Strauss.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE-ARTISTS (Annandale-On-Hudson, N.Y.) _ Since the late
1980s, a number of younger Japanese artists have emerged on the
international scene to challenge the old notion that all modern art
from Japan is merely a pale imitation of modern art from the West.
Among them are Yasumasa Morimura, Tatsuo Miyajima, Mariko Mori and
Takashi Murakami, whose goofy, glossy work has found an avid
audience outside Japan. Rooted in Japanese popular culture,
Murakami's art communicates across borders in a media-driven era of
global pop to which fashion, animation, music and electronic
gadgetry from Japan have all contributed. It is now the focus of
``The Meaning of the Nonsense of the Meaning,'' a
mini-retrospective on view here at the Center for Curatorial
Studies Museum at Bard College through Sept. 12. By Edward M.
Gomez. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-BONANNO (Undated) _ Joseph Bonanno, the long-retired Mafia
boss (he prefers ``father'') widely known as Joe Bananas, who is
now, at 94, is truly the Really Absolutely Very Last Don.
``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story,'' a two-part film being shown next
Sunday and Monday on Showtime, may well be the highest-level mob
memoir and tutorial (``Mafia is a process, not a thing'') to find
its way to the screen. It is quite certainly the only one ever to
list another acknowledged Mafioso _ Bonanno's son Salvatore, known
as Bill _ as an executive producer. By Ralph Blumenthal. (Moved).

THE NEW YORK TIMES CO. REPORTS 9.5% INCREASE IN PROFITS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Co. said Thursday that its
second-quarter profit from operations rose 9.5 percent, lifted by
strong growth in advertising revenue at the company's flagship
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement, the company said that it was buying
Abuzz Technologies Inc., its first acquisition since it
consolidated its numerous Internet properties into one division,
Times Co. Digital, eight weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, the Times Co. had an operating profit of
$158.9 million, or 48 cents a diluted share, compared with $145.1
million, or 40 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue increased 4 percent, to $779.4 million from $749.2
million, while costs rose 3.4 percent, to $624.5 million from
$604.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 45 cents a share,
according to the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. did not disclose the terms of the acquisition of
Abuzz, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. It is a three-year-old
company that has developed a product called Beehive, which culls
information from various sources and connects people who have
questions with people or places that have answers. This tool, which
effectively creates individual card indexes fine-tuned to a user's
information needs, is intended to enhance what Martin A.
Nisenholtz, the chief executive of Times Co. Digital, described as
a strategy ``to capture the premium audience on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Palmer, an analyst with the Digital Group, a research
firm in Boston, said: ``Today on the Internet you can find someone
who claims knowledge in a particular area. But is there a trusted
peer review of that individual?'' Abuzz's technology, he said,
permits a higher level of reliability and refines the concept of
electronic communities.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the favorable earnings report and the acquisition,
shares of the Times Co. fell 25 cents on Thursday, to $39.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were very strong _ clearly above expectations,''
said Steven N. Barlow, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
Douglas M. Arthur, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
agreed, saying that the Gannett Co. experienced a similar stock
price dip when it reported strong second-quarter earnings, only to
see the price rebound days later.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barlow and Arthur said that the strong earnings numbers at
the Times Co., like those recently reported by Dow Jones and
Gannett, were related to the depressed price of newsprint, which is
one of the biggest costs for newspaper companies. The low newsprint
prices are expected to continue for at least another quarter, the
two said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Times Co.'s other large newspaper, The Boston Globe,
advertising revenue rose 1.4 percent after two consecutive quarters
of declining revenue. Operating profit for the company's newspaper
group as a whole increased 14.2 percent, to $147.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing was that the ad revenue trend in the
newspaper group was better than expected and accelerating as the
quarter ended,'' Arthur said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new acquisition, Arthur said: ``It certainly
represents a more aggressive stance in terms of really building
this Internet business beyond the news site and registered users.
They want to build something greater. This is going in new
directions for The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It could also suggest that the company's future use
of excess cash flow is going to be potentially less focused on
traditional media and more focused on building new media.'' &QL;

   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The recent Portland Rose Festival began with
events like the Starlight Parade through downtown _ make that the
``Portland General Electric/Solv Starlight Parade Presented by
Southwest Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the festival, which ran for 25 days in June, came
an auto race: ``Texaco/Havoline Presents the Budweiser/GI Joe's
200, a FedEx Championship Series Event.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Phoenix, the ``Microage Fiesta Bowl Parade''
precedes the annual ``Tostito Fiesta Bowl Football Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsorship of special events is not a new phenomenon.
But often, these days, you can barely find the event for the
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Unadorned titles _ like the Indianapolis 500 and the Rose Parade
_ have truly become an endangered species, as one event after
another goes the way of the ``Kodak Albuquerque International
Balloon Fiesta,'' ``Sunoco Welcome America!'' in Philadelphia and
the ``Hooters Hula Bowl'' in Hawaii. Even that New Year's Day
football game in Pasadena, Calif., has become ``the AT&AMP;T Rose
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, the single-sponsor event is rapidly giving way to
the likes of the ``U S West Rose Festival Airshow Presented by
Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, fewer than 25 percent of festivals and
events had some corporate involvement; today it's up to 85
percent,'' said Lesa Ukman, president of Chicago-based IEG Inc.,
which tracks sponsorship of events, sports, arts and entertainment
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days, festivals and events organizers would go
hat in hand asking for support,'' she said. ``Now they can show
companies they're offering them a cost-effective way to increase
sales and marketing objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything, it seems, is fair game. ``Almost every category of
event you can think of now has sponsors,'' said Dennis Boese,
corporate manager of fair and festival marketing for Miller Brewing
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a unit of the Philip Morris Co., sponsors almost 90
events, from the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville to the Sant
'Yago Night Parade in Tampa, Fla., to the Official Shrimporee of
Texas in Aransas Pass, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's target audience, Boese said, is men aged 21 to 35, so
it backs many sporting events _ but not the Portland Rose Festival,
where Budweiser sponsors the auto race and a local company, Rogue
Ales, is the official microbrewery.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsorship money is necessary, festival organizers say, to
offset the increasing cost of entertainment, to hold ticket prices
down and to finance the expansion of acts and events needed to
appeal to a wide audience. The 91-year-old Rose Festival, for
example, has expanded from a two-day carnival in 1907 to a 25-day
gala with 74 events and more than 2 million spectators.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is pleased with what some specialists in
tourism, including Dennis R. Judd, describe as ``the
McDonaldization of local events,'' of ``making them look more and
more like a Disney production.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd _ a professor of political science at the University of
Missouri-St. Louis and co-author of ``The Tourist City'' (Yale
University Press) _ said that as festivals and events increasingly
rely on corporate sponsorship, they lose their local identity.
``Before long they resemble events everywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsorship accounts for 35 percent of the Rose
Festival's $8 million budget; the remainder comes from concession
sales and admission to events.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dean Runyan Associates, a travel-industry research
firm, the festival's overall economic impact in the Portland area
reached $79 million in 1996 _ the last year for which figures are
available _ up from $44 million in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This year, corporations will spend an estimated $685 million on
festivals, fairs and annual events, according to IEG. That may be
only 9 percent of the estimated $7.6 billion that will be spent on
sponsorships in 1999 _ two-thirds of the total will go to auto
racing, golf and other sporting events. Still, it is triple the
amount spent on fairs and festivals a decade ago, and $107 million
more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the events that corporations are willing to sponsor
has become more varied. Thus, the Rose Festival has attracted more
than 200 sponsors: 150 paid at least $5,000 each and seven provided
contributions worth six figures.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Rose Festival sponsors included Southwest Airlines;
General Motors' Pontiac division; the Pepsi-Cola unit of Pepsico;
Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group's Thrifty Rent-a-Car division, and
Deloitte &AMP; Touche. The ``U S West Rose Festival Presented by
Intel'' also had 20 other sponsors, including Coors Light, Pepsi,
Candlewood Hotel's Candlewood Suites unit and GM.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the festival boasted an official iced tea
(Unilever's Lipton's brand), sportswear company (Columbia
Sportswear), coffee (Millstone), wine (Willamette Valley Vineyards)
and messenger service (Pronto). The latter three are local or
regional companies, as is the plumbing supply company that
sponsored a Festival of Bands competition, the pancake and steak
house that sponsored a jazz band competition and the dairy that
sponsored milk-carton boat races for kids.
</P>
<P>
   In the sponsorship pecking order, the most valuable, and
expensive, position is ``title sponsor.'' That's the corporation's
whose name comes before the name of the event _ like Portland
General Electric for the Starlight Parade, U S West for the
airshow, and Southwest Airlines for the floral parade.
</P>
<P>
   When an event is ``presented by,'' the presenting sponsor's name
follows the event _ and costs less than that of the title sponsor.
The Rose Festival does not disclose how much its sponsors pay, but
sponsorship of a breakfast for several hundred could cost more than
$25,000 at a major festival, elaborate parade floats easily cost
$40,000, while title sponsorship of an airshow ranges from $200,000
to as much as $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines' sponsorship strategy is somewhat unusual, in
view of its relatively limited route system. Its 30 or more
sponsorships include designation as the official airline of both
the Super Bowl and National Football League, even though it does
not fly to every NFL city.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, months before it began service here in 1994,
Southwest sent a team of almost a dozen people to see what events
it could sponsor that were important to the community. It quickly
settled on the Rose Festival. When Delta Air Lines dropped its
six-year sponsorship of the Grand Floral Parade after the 1994
festival, Southwest moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to be a major sponsor of events that connect
with customers,'' said Linda Rutherford, a Southwest spokeswoman.
``So before we agree to sponsor anything, we spend a lot of time in
a community talking with movers and shakers and travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, participates in everything
from the California Strawberry Festival in Oxnard to Gold Rush Days
in Wickenburg, Ariz., to the San Francisco Ballet and the
Southwestern Exposition &AMP; Livestock Show in Fort Worth. In
Portland, it is the sole sponsor of the Italian Festival and summer
concerts at the zoo two nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to sponsor things that will draw the largest number of
families,'' said George J. Passadore, president of the 121 Wells
Fargo banks in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   After it or its precedent banks had participated in the Rose
Festival for 51 years, First Interstate Bank was bought by Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co. in 1996 and dropped its sponsorships. But after Wells
Fargo was taken over by the Norwest Corp. in November, decisions
were decentralized; Passadore, who spent 37 years with First
Interstate, wasted little time reconnecting with the Rose Festival
_ now under the Wells Fargo banner.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Wells Fargo float won the Governor's Trophy for best
craftsmanship and workmanship, and 275 Wells employees were
prominent among the festival's 5,000 volunteers. While volunteers
have long been mainstays of local events, Judd said, they are being
squeezed out of local and regional events by professional
consultants whose mandate is to make them bigger, if not
necessarily better.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, few companies realized the potential of
corporate sponsorship, other than for sporting events, until the
1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. ``That was the key,'' said Bruce
Skinner, president of the International Festivals and Events
Association. ``Before that, corporate involvement was typically in
the form of donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to realize that broader potential, Ms. Ukman
said, was George Wein, the one-time Boston nightclub owner who
founded the Newport Jazz Festival in 1954. In 1972 he created the
Schlitz Salute to Jazz, eventually bringing Kool cigarettes,
American Express, Toyota and JVC into the corporate fold.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the opportunity to get their name in the title, on
floats, on signs, billboards and ticket stubs, corporations
increasingly participate in events big and small.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows better than festival officials that corporate
sponsors can be fickle. ``Sometimes they pull out because of a
change in their marketing strategy, or a downturn in their industry
or in the economy,'' Clark of the Rose Festival said. ``Then there
are mergers, or a company moves away.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Eastman Kodak Co. said it would soon end its 62-year
sponsorship of the Kodak Hula Show in Honolulu. The free event,
started by Kodak in 1937 and shown twice a week, costs the company
more than $500,000 a year. A Kodak spokesman said that the show
draws older visitors while the company hopes to attract younger
people interested in photography.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines has also changed its mind. After sponsoring
the Texas State Fair parade for many years, it pulled out in 1996.
``We had enough recognition among Texans,'' Ms. Rutherford said,
``so we decided to put that sponsorship money into other things.''

SBC, DIRECTV TO FORM AN ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Calif., Conn., Kan., Mo., Nev., N.Y., Okla., Texas)  (Exclusive)

 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding television to its portfolio of digital communications
services, SBC Communications Inc., one of the nation's biggest
local phone companies, has agreed to a wide-ranging marketing and
distribution partnership with DirecTV Inc., the big satellite
broadcaster, executives close to the deal said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to announce the deal on Monday at the
Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association's convention
in Las Vegas, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with DirecTV fills a big hole in SBC's product line and
gives SBC a much-needed weapon _ television _ as it gets ready to
go head-to-head against AT&AMP;T Corp. in a battle to offer consumers
integrated packages of long-distance and local telephone, video and
high-speed Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has agreed to spend more than $90 billion to become the
nation's No. 1 cable television company by acquiring
Tele-Communications Inc. and Mediaone Group Inc. While cable
systems already deliver television channels and sometimes Internet
service, AT&AMP;T wants to retool cable networks to also offer local
phone service, breaking open the Baby Bells' de facto monopoly in
residential markets.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that threat, the Bells are scrambling to put together
communications packages of their own. SBC, which does business as
Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell, has already said
it wants to offer high-speed Internet service using normal phone
lines to 8.1 million of its 18 million residential customers by the
end of the year. Some analysts also expect SBC to win regulatory
approval to sell long-distance phone service to its customers in
Texas in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   SBC declined to comment. A spokesman for DirecTV could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, DirecTV, which is part of the Hughes Electronics
unit of the General Motors Corp., has grown to become the nation's
largest direct-broadcast satellite provider_ and by far the biggest
competitor to cable services _ with more than 7 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, SBC has conducted negotiations with
both DirecTV and its main rival, the Echostar Communications Corp.,
which has about 2.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But under its deal with DirecTV, SBC will not be allowed to
pursue a second satellite partner for at least a few years. SBC
will begin marketing DirecTV service to its customers in Arkansas,
California, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Texas this
fall, executives close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   SBC owns the Southern New England Telecommunications Corp., the
dominant local phone company in Connecticut, and has a pending deal
to acquire the Ameritech Corp., the leading local carrier in the
Midwest. But SBC has no firm plans to expand its DirecTV
partnership into those regions because both Ameritech and SNET own
cable television operations that compete against DirecTV, according
to executives close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In its core markets, however, SBC plans to offer the DirecTV
service, traditional phone service, high-speed Internet access and
perhaps wireless phone service on a single bill, the executives
added.
</P>
<P>
   For communications companies, the power of such integrated
packages comes in the opportunities to create promotions that span
different products. SBC, for instance, could potentially offer free
voice mail, call waiting and caller ID to local phone customers who
sign up for DirecTV. The satellite television service would carry
the brand of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also offers a satellite Internet service known as
DirecPC, but that service did not appear to be part of the SBC
deal. America Online Inc., the No. 1 Internet provider, has
recently struck marketing deals of its own with both Hughes, for
satellite delivery of the online service and with SBC for
high-speed delivery over digital subscriber lines, or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, SBC's main local phone rival, also has a
marketing deal with DirecTV, but that agreement does not appear
quite as wide-ranging as SBC's. Since striking its deal last year,
Bell Atlantic has followed a relatively conservative timetable for
introducing Bell Atlantic-DirecTV service; it is not yet available
in New York City, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic phone customers who sign up for the satellite
television service receive separate bills for the two services, and
Bell Atlantic and DirecTV do not yet offer significant
cross-promotions. (A Bell Atlantic spokesman said Thursday that
such promotions were on their way.)
</P>
<P>
   In a piquant twist of corporate politics, the recent deal is
actually SBC's second go-round with DirecTV. In the fall of 1995,
SBC conducted tests with DirecTV but that initiative fell apart
after AT&AMP;T acquired 2.5 percent of DirecTV the following January
for $137.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Hughes Electronics, DirecTV's parent, at that
time was C. Michael Armstrong. Shortly after Armstrong became
chairman of AT&AMP;T in November 1997, AT&AMP;T sold its interest in
DirecTV, facilitating DirecTV's partnerships with the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T sold its interest in DirecTV, AT&AMP;T said that consumers
appeared to prefer to buy the satellite dish and converter needed
for the DirecTV's service from consumer electronics retailers,
rather than from a phone company.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the deal, SBC is considering a
fairly radical promotion to deal with that concern: giving away
DirecTV dishes free.

BARAK SAYS ISRAEL WILL PURSUE AN AGREEMENT WITH SYRIA

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak told President Clinton on
Thursday that Israel would embark on a ``serious effort'' in the
next several weeks to restart negotiations with Syria, which is
still formally at war with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a private meeting with the president at the White House that
lasted two and a half hours, Barak laid down several conditions
that he would demand as the price of peace with Syria, according to
a senior Israeli official who spoke with Barak after the session.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister told Clinton that Israel was prepared for
``painful compromises and difficult decisions'' to reach agreement
with Syria, if it offers concessions in turn, the official said.
Israel is willing to partly pull its troops back from the Golan
Heights on the Israel-Syria border if the two countries can reach
agreement on the status of Lebanon, terrorism, borders, water
rights and normalization of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Clinton that Israel would never agree to return to
the borders that existed before the 1967 war, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting was the first of a series of discussions the
new Israeli prime minister will have with the president and other
top American officials over the next five days. The Washington
talks come barely a week after he was sworn in as prime minister
and are intended to dramatize his commitment to rapid progress
toward political reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also told the president that he would continue the
withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank under terms of a
deal reached with Palestinians at the Wye Plantation in Maryland
late last year, but that ``most'' Israeli settlers would remain in
the communities they have established there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the moment of truth,'' Barak told Clinton, according
to the Israeli official. ``Our generation must find a way to solve
this conflict. We will leave no stone unturned to reach peace
agreements that will enhance the security of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting with Clinton, Barak met briefly with Vice
President Al Gore, and then Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Barak and his wife, Nava, flew by helicopter to Camp
David to dine privately and spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden in an appearance with
Clinton before their meeting, Barak said he planned a vigorous
effort to resume discussions with all of Israel's neighbors and
with the Palestinians. He asked for the president's support, but at
the same time expressed a desire for the United States to play a
less prominent role in negotiations and in enforcing any ultimate
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton publicly agreed that the United States had become overly
intrusive in the Middle East dialogue in the last several years. He
said Washington should serve merely as a ``facilitator'' of talks
involving Israel, its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians, not as
an active participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be in a patronizing role. We should be in a
supportive role,'' Clinton said in his public appearance with the
prime minister. It was the first time Clinton had responded to
Barak's complaint this week that the United States had been too
deeply enmeshed in Middle East negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the United States had intervened only when it
appeared that progress toward peace had halted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a more active role, in effect as a mediator, when the
bonds of trust and the lines of communication had become so frayed
that we were in danger of losing the peace process,'' Clinton said.
``And I did not want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was far preferable for the parties to talk directly
to one another without American intercession, as Barak said he
intended to do.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said that he did not want the United States
to serve as ``policeman, judge and arbitrator'' of relations
between Israel and the Arabs. Barak seemed to be referring in part
to the CIA's involvement in security issues with the Palestinians,
a role that was established at the Wye accords and one that some
critics say supplanted the chances of direct contact between the
Israelis and the Palestinians on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did emphasize Thursday that restarting the Middle East
dialogue would require ``American leadership and support all along
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that he would abide by all agreements signed by
previous Israeli governments, including the Wye accords reached
last fall. He said he intended to try to reach agreement on ``all
tracks'' of regional peace talks, including a comprehensive accord
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he felt as if he had ``got the mission of
defusing a time bomb'' by taking office after a three-year period
in which Israel's relations with its neighbors, the Palestinians
and the United States were badly strained by the cantankerous
posture of the Likud government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who was sworn in just last week after winning a landslide
victory over Netanyahu in May, has already met with Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, King Abdullah of Jordan and President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thursday that he was prepared to sit down with Hafez
al-Assad, the president of Syria, to discuss peace with Syria and
an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, which Syria essentially
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes two to tango,'' Barak said. ``I am ready, the arena
is ready, maybe the dancing instructor is ready. We have to find an
opportunity and begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to travel to
Syria in the next several weeks to sound out officials there on
what conditions they will require for normalization of relations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has insisted that Israel withdraw all of its forces from
southern Lebanon and return land on the Golan Heights seized during
the 1967 war. He also wants a permanent international observer
force stationed in the Golan to insure that Israel lives up to its
commitments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Assad would also like the lifting of economic sanctions the
United States imposed because of the American determination that
Syria sponsors international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had not meant to signal a shift in American
policy toward Palestinian refugees or to prejudge the outcome of
so-called final status talks when he said two weeks ago that the
refugees should be able to settle ``wherever they want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark touched off a wave of criticism in Israel, where the
``right of return'' of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
scattered around the Middle East to territory now occupied by
Israel is one of the most emotional issues still to be resolved
with Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee issue is one to be negotiated in the permanent
status talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States, as a sponsor of the peace process, has
asked the parties to do nothing to prejudge the final status
issues,'' the president said. ``We certainly should be doing
nothing to prejudge the final status issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave a similar answer in response to a question arising
from Mrs. Clinton's statement last week that Jerusalem was the
capital of Israel and that the United States should move its
Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Her statement is at odds with
administration policy, which is that the status of Jerusalem has
yet to be decided and that the U.S. Embassy will remain in Tel Aviv
until it is.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Barak said he would like embassies from all
nations to be in Jerusalem, which both Israel and the Palestinians
claim as their historic capitals.

 &HT;    U.S. to pay workers sickened in bomb plants
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The government acknowledged for the first time
Thursday that thousands of workers were made sick while making
nuclear bombs, and it announced a proposal to compensate many of
them for their maladies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress still must approve the proposal outlined in Washington
by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. The compensation would end
years of litigation over claims by the workers that they became
sick while employed by private contractors at federal nuclear
facilities during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's plan initially would limit compensation to
workers suffering from exposure to beryllium, a chemical element
that was used as a strengthening alloy in atomic weapons. The cost
of such compensation was estimated at $13 million a year over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 310-square-mile Savannah River Site in South
Carolina near the Georgia border at Augusta played a key role in
developing the nation's nuclear arsenal, a plant spokesman said
Thursday that the kind of beryllium that may have caused illness
among nuclear workers was never used there. The main mission of
SRS, which was built in the early 1950s, was the production of
plutonium and tritium, the explosive ingredients of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy said that most of the workers with
chronic beryllium disease were employed at Rocky Flats in Colorado,
the Oak Ridge weapons complex in Tennessee, the Hanford reservation
in Washington state, Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
and the Argonne Laboratory in Chicago. Many also worked for private
vendors in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the workers eligible to file claims worked at plants
that date from the Manhattan Project, the World War II effort to
build a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government is acknowledging that we made a mistake.
... We need to right this wrong,'' said Richardson, who noted that
for a long time the government had rejected such claims.
</P>
<P>
   The workers and their unions and other advocates have argued for
years that they suffered from lung disease or cancers of exposure
to mercury, uranium, asbestos and various radioactive substances.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the proposal announced Thursday also calls for
the president's National Economic Council to examine compensation
for other occupational illnesses related to the nuclear weapons
program, including asbestosis and radiation-induced cancers. A
report is expected next March.
</P>
<P>
   If those illnesses are included, the program probably would
include workers at the Savannah River Site.
</P>
<P>
   A five-year DOE-funded program to screen thousands of former
workers for illnesses they may have acquired from exposure to
dangerous materials at the plant began in January in Augusta.
``There are 50,000 to 60,000 people who worked here since the early
1950s,'' said Tommy Yarbrough of the Augusta Building Trades group
that represents 14 building trade unions at SRS. The screening is
taking place at the organization's building in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   During the initial screening that lasts more than an hour, the
former workers are asked whether they handled or were exposed to
one of several toxic or radioactive materials and how long they may
have been exposed. The computerized information then is reviewed by
medical experts under contract for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The medical reviewers determine from the questionnaire whether a
worker should be referred to doctors for exams. Yarbrough said it
is ``quite likely'' that the program will turn up a number of
former workers suffering from exposure to dangerous materials while
working at SRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to reach as many former workers in these as
possible to undergo this screening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration's plan, workers found to be eligible
for compensation would be reimbursed for medical costs, compensated
for lost wages and given vocational assistance. In cases in which
the worker has died, survivors' benefits would be provided, DOE
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials representing the workers and others have claimed
for years that the DOE and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy
Commission, failed to provide proper safeguards to protect workers
in the production, manufacture and assembly of nuclear materials
and weapons.

SENATE APPROVES REPUBLICAN PLAN TO REGULATE HEALTH INSURERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the final hours of a bitter and sharply partisan
debate over health care, the Senate killed a Democratic effort to
expand the ability of patients to sue managed care providers and
then, in a near party-line vote Thursday night, approved a
Republican plan to regulate the companies that provide health
insurance for most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, designed to grapple with the health care revolution
that has shifted most Americans into managed care, passed by a
53-47 vote. Two Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island and Peter
Fitzgerald of Illinois, broke ranks with their party to oppose the
bill. The measure would provide $13 billion in new tax breaks for
health care and give an array of rights to consumers, most
significantly creating an appeal process for 124 million Americans
in employer-sponsored health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the other new protections _ including consumer
information, the right to a hospital stay after a mastectomy if
recommended by a doctor and access to an emergency room outside a
managed care network _ would vary according to the nature and
source of a person's insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new rights would apply only to the 48 million people
in self-funded plans offered by large companies. In many cases
these are not the more restrictive insurance plans that have caused
the most consumer concern because they channel access to care
through a ``gatekeeper'' physician.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats had tried unsuccessfully across four days of
impassioned debate to push through a more comprehensive plan that
would have applied to all 161 million Americans with private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   As the marathon Senate struggle over the issue drew to a close
Thursday night, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
espoused the Republican philosophy of regulation in moderation and
criticized the Democrats' efforts to expand the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should not imperil the continuing transformation of
American medicine,'' he said. ``It's not our job to dictate or
control that transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the Senate minority leader, harshly
criticized the Republican bill as a fraud. ``The Senate has missed
a golden opportunity to pass a real Patient's Bill of Rights,'' he
said. ``Instead the Republican majority is handing the insurance
industry its version of HMO reform _ half measures only.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans and Democrats sharply divided over an issue
they expect to resonate with the public, Vice President Al Gore
vowed that President Clinton would veto the Republican bill, making
it likely that the parties' different approaches to health care
will become an issue in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be under any illusions,'' said Gore, who came to
the Senate in the late afternoon in the unlikely event that he
would be called upon to cast a tie-breaking vote. ``If the
Republican leadership insists on going through a charade and
insists on passing that bill of goods they've been trying to
promote, President Clinton will veto it in a minute. It has zero
chance of going past his desk, because it's a fraud. And what
happens then? We will come right back here, and we'll start all
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who favored less federal regulation than the
Democrats charged that the Democrats' rival plan would raise
premiums and force more Americans into the ranks of the uninsured.
Of the veto threat, Sen. Don Nickles, the majority whip from
Oklahoma, said, ``We are going to find out if the White House is
interested in increasing quality health care or just wants to make
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Democrats and Republicans tried but failed in the
final hours of debate to find common ground in an attempt to head
off the impasse. ``If this gamesmanship continues the only winner
will be the status quo,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan would have implications for doctors, insurers,
businesses and consumers. The American Medical Association on
Thursday night sharply condemned the final bill, saying, ``In a
highly regrettable action, the Senate has bowed to the insurance
industry dictate that says their profits come first and patients
come last.''
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry by contrast praised the outcome. ``I
think it means that all patients will have a guarantee of
independent review that's a very important aspect of providing
trust and confidence,'' said Karen M. Ignagni, the president of the
American Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant provision of the Republican bill would
allow people in employer-sponsored health plans to appeal decisions
denying them coverage for a specific treatment or type of care.
Patients could appeal to an independent medical reviewer if a
health plan refused to pay for care.
</P>
<P>
   The bill enforces a decision against a health plan by allowing a
patient to obtain treatment outside a health network if treatment
does not begin in the time frame recommended by the reviewer. The
plan would be held liable for the charges and for a $10,000 fine.
And the plan may be assessed another fine of up to $10,000 if it
fails to comply with time frames for review.

</P>
<P>
   During the two years that managed care has been a major issue in
Congress, the most hard-fought question has been whether to go
further and expand a patient's right to sue in cases of
malpractice. Currently most patients suing over decisions in
managed care must do so in federal court, where they can typically
collect the value of the care denied but not punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again Thursday afternoon, Republicans charged that the
Democrats' proposal to give consumers the right to sue for punitive
damages in state court would drive up health care costs and serve
as a boon to trial lawyers, an important Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., called it ``lunacy'' to expect the
courts to solve health care problems. ``I am convinced that if you
let the trial lawyers solve a medical problem it is borderline
useless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats countered that they were trying to insure that the
insurance companies that deny certain health care treatments can be
held to account through the courts in the same way other businesses
are.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting a Republican amendment to strip the right to sue out
of the Democratic plan, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said, ``If
this amendment passes and the HMOs cannot be held accountable in
court of law, what it means is if they kill you, if they maim you,
if they hurt you or your family or your children due to callous or
uncaring bureaucrats they cannot be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   By a 53-47 vote, the Senate went on to kill the Democrats'
liability provision before beginning the final debate.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the grievance procedures the Republican plan provides
certain protections available to different groups of people
depending on the source of their health care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan all women with private health insurance would be
able to stay in a hospital after a mastectomy if their doctor
recommends it. The measure was a response to the emotional issue of
so-called ``drive-by mastectomies in which some insurance companies
had required the operation for breast cancer to be handled as an
out-patient procedure.
</P>
<P>
   An array of other protections were granted to 48 million people
covered by self-funded employer plans, which encompass both
old-style fee-for-service programs and managed care, but are
frequently no the kinds of restrictive HMO plans that have drawn
the most consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   These protections include access to emergency rooms outside a
provider network for services related to stabilizing an emergency
condition. It requires health plans to coordinate transfers or
discharges within an hour after being contacted by the
out-of-service hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The bill grants women in these kinds of health plans direct
access to an obstetrician for pregnancy and child delivery but
direct access to a gynecologist for ``routine'' care.
</P>
<P>
   And for these 48 million people the bill requires ``timely''
access to medical specialists, but only those inside a health
plan's network. For patients, among the 48 million, with cancers
best treated through clinical trials, the plan would require
payment of routine patient costs associated with approved cancer
clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the
department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these areas the Democrats had argued for protections
that were often broader and that would apply to all 161 million
Americans with private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would create $13 billion in new tax breaks,
allowing full deduction of health insurance premiums, the full
deduction of long-term care insurance that is not subsidized by an
employer and an expansion of medical savings accounts, _ tax-free
savings accounts for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats object to the medical savings accounts because they
say the accounts provide an incentive for the healthy and the
affluent to drop out of the general insurance pool.

   CLINTON HOPES BARAK CAN ADVANCE MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON Embracing Israel's new leader as the last hope for
the ``rejuvenation,'' of the long-stalled Mideast peace process on
his watch, President Clinton welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to the White House on Thursday for substantive, yet cordial,
talks.
</P>
<P>
   After a private conversation lasting 2.5 hours, the leaders
traveled by helicopter to the Camp David presidential retreat,
where they and their wives had dinner and spent the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very excited about the prospect of the rejuvenation of
the peace process,'' Clinton told reporters in the sun-splashed
Rose Garden, just before his first meeting with Barak since the
Israeli took office last week, vowing to move the peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has put peace at the top of his agenda,'' said Clinton,
adding to Barak that ``America will help you as you move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak reciprocated the optimistic sentiment. ``It is our
intention to inject new momentum into the peace process,'' he said,
attributing the victory of his Labor Party in May parliamentary
elections to Israelis' desire for peace with security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect us to provide them with a better and safer
future,'' said Barak. ``We cannot let their hopes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak later told Clinton he was prepared to make ``painful
compromises,'' in order to make peace with Palestinians, Syrians
and Lebanese, an Israeli official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the show of good faith and high expectations, however,
there were signs of the difficulties and risks that must be
overcome to end five decades of bloodshed and enmity between
Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pressed Barak to make the first move toward
jump-starting the long-stalled Mideast peace process by fulfilling
his country's pledge to hand over additional territory to
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he would honor Israel's agreement, brokered by
Clinton last fall, to turn over an additional 13.1 percent of
Israeli-occupied land in the West Bank to the Palestinians. He said
he would do so, however, only as part of a broader effort to reach
a comprehensive peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak further stressed that he would not permit Washington to
dictate the terms or the tempo of the peace process and that
Clinton's role as peace-broker should be limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the United States can contribute to the process
more as facilitator,'' said Barak, `` than as a kind of policeman,
judge and arbitrator at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, nodding as Barak spoke, said he agreed. But Clinton
also made clear the enormous stake the United States, and he as its
leader, has in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done what we could, consistently, for more than 20
years now, through all kinds of administrations, to try to advance
the peace process,'' said Clinton. ``I have probably spent more
time on it than anyone has, and certainly I've spent a lot of time
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first year in office, Clinton hosted former Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
for a South Lawn signing of an historic peace accord. Over the past
two years, however, progress on steps outlined in that accord
stalled amid mutual recriminations. The accord is a blueprint for
handing over certain Israeli-occupied land to Palestinian control
in exchange for Palestinian efforts to combat anti-Israeli
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to restart the process, Clinton spent several days last
October in negotiations between Arafat and then-Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Wye River resort in rural
Maryland. The result was an agreement that quickly ran aground, as
Netanyahu charged Arafat with failing to take strong enough
measures against anti-Israeli terrorists. And Arafat countered that
Netanyahu had bargained in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Thursday he would honor the Wye agreement, which
calls on Israel to relinquish to the Palestinians additional land
on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a need to combine the implementation of Wye with
the moving forward of the permanent status agreement,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent status issues, including the question of Palestinian
statehood and the future of Jerusalem, are regarded as among the
most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A May deadline for the resolution of those issues was missed,
and Clinton has said he would hope the permanent status talks can
begin soon and be completed within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting was designed as a first step toward building
confidence between the two men and, according to senior Israeli and
American officials, it achieved those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a career soldier who also serves as Israel's Defense
Minister, was scheduled to meet Friday with Secretary of Defense
William Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is to spend the weekend meeting with representatives from
the U.S. Jewish community in New York, before returning to the
White House for a state dinner Sunday night and further meetings
with Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the two leaders met by themselves, without the
aides and notetakers that customarily accompany heads of state in
such meetings. And the venue was the Treaty Room in the White House
residence, deemed a more intimate setting than the businesslike
Oval Office, where Clinton ordinarily receives official guests.

BUSH ANNOUNCES HE WON'T ACCEPT FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush declared Thursday that he would
not accept federal matching funds because of his enormous $37
million campaign war chest, giving him the capacity to far outspend
his Republican presidential rivals in the 2000 election, especially
in early and pivotal primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush, the governor of Texas, and another Republican
candidate, multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes, both forgoing
federal matching funds, one of the bulwarks of the post-Watergate
campaign finance system has been weakened.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to accept $16.5 million in matching funds from
taxpayers, Bush, with more than $30 million in cash reserves, will
not be restricted by a spending limit of nearly $40 million that
applies to candidates who accept matching funds in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Bush's chief Democratic rivals, Vice President
Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who are both
accepting matching funds, will both likely reach the spending limit
by the spring of 2000. But Bush would still have ample money left
to spend through the summer conventions. The Republican and
Democratic presidential nominees would then receive about $66
million each in public funds for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``After looking at the numbers, cash on hand of $30 million,
I've decided not to accept federal matching funds during the course
of this campaign,'' Bush said Thursday in a campaign appearance in
Waterloo, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bush decided to announce his intentions on the day that all the
candidates were required to report their quarterly fund-raising
totals to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   By not being hamstrung by spending limits, Bush said that his
campaign would be able to respond to ``attack ads'' broadcast by a
wealthy Republican rival, presumably a reference to Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has already announced that he would not accept federal
matching funds for the 2000 primary season. Forbes is raising money
and also intends to spend tens of millions of his own money on his
campaign, as he did in 1996 when he spent $37 million. Other
wealthy candidates in years past like Ross Perot, have refused to
accept the subsidies financed by taxpayers, choosing to spend
millions of their own money on their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got limits that constrain a candidate,'' Bush said. ``I
want to be in a position to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reform advocates, as well as some political
strategists, harshly criticized Bush's decision and predicted that
it might backfire with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system was set up in part to prevent a candidate from
drowning everyone else out by accumulating huge amounts of money,''
said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a public
policy organization. ``But by rejecting public funds, Governor Bush
is basically taking an approach to try to use political money to
try to drown everyone else out of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about why Bush was refusing to abide by the spending
limits that will apply to most of his rivals, Mindy Tucker, a
spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said, ``I think Governor Bush
feels that this is part of the democratic process that people can
contribute to a campaign to express their opinion. There are 74,000
who have heard his message and to convey their opinion they have
made a contribution in the sum ranging from $5 to $1000.''
</P>
<P>
   She also stressed that Bush ``understands the need for campaign
finance reform.'' Bush has called for several reforms, including
the banning of so-called soft money from corporations and unions
when the members or shareholders are not consulted about how the
money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore reported that he has raised a total
of $19.5 million in the first half of the year, but he has only
$9.4 million in the bank that can be spent during the primaries.
The vice president has two million more in cash on hand than his
only Democratic challenger, Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign strategists said that the relatively close disparity in
each campaign's cash reserves demonstrates that Gore may be even
more vulnerable to a lengthy campaign by Bradley through most of
the state primaries next year.

</P>
<P>
   The federal matching funds program was enacted in 1974 as part
of a legislative overhaul of the federal election laws after the
Watergate scandal. The goal of the 1974 law was to cleanse the
campaign finance system and provide some public funding for
presidential candidates after the campaign finance scandal that
surrounded President Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Under the matching funds system, candidates receive $250 in
federal funds for every $1,000 they raise. Qualifying candidates
can receive as much as $16.5 million in matching funds during the
primaries. In return, they must abide by an overall spending
ceiling of nearly $40 million during the primaries including the
matching funds. There are strict state-by-state spending limits.
For instance, each candidate who accepts matching funds can only
spend $1.13 million in Iowa and $661,200 in New Hampshire. But Bush
can ignore all these limits, although he must still adhere to
contribution limits of $1,000 for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's dominant lead in cash-on-hand creates an even wider
disparity between him and the other candidates in the field. His
commanding lead in cash and in national polls has already chased
two candidates out of the Republican race. Rep. John Kasich, who
had trouble raising money, dropped out of the campaign on Wednesday
and endorsed Bush. And Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire announced
he was leaving the Republican Party and would run for president as
an independent.
</P>
<P>
   In just four months, Bush raised $37.03 million, a sum even
higher than his campaign's estimate of $36.3 million in early July,
according to figures that the Bush campaign reported Thursday to
the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor received $1,000 from both his father, the
former president, and Barbara Bush, the former first lady. George
H.W. Bush of Houston's occupation was listed as ``retired,'' and
the contribution was reported to have been given on June 30, the
last day of the second quarter. Mrs. Bush's occupation was listed
as ``homemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also received $1,000 checks from other celebrities,
including actors Chuck Norris and Pat Boone, and Dallas Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman. Former Bush spokesperson David Beckwith,
who was dismissed by the campaign earlier this week, also
contributed $1,000. Bush's campaign reported that the average
contribution was $466.69.
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged Thursday that his decision not to accept
matching funds was inspired in part by a lesson he said he learned
from Bob Dole's 1996 campaign for president. Dole, who accepted
matching funds after setting his own fund-raising records in 1995,
hit the spending ceiling in April 1996 after being forced to spend
millions to keep pace with Forbes' advertising blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of 1996 and in the weeks leading up to the
election, the Republican Party had to prop up Dole's candidacy by
spending millions of dollars on issue advertising that prominently
featured the former Kansas senator. By then, President Clinton had
widened a big lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mindful of what happened in 1996 and I'm not going to let
it happen to me,'' Bush said Thursday. ``I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would also have to spend more to keep pace with
Gore, his probable Democratic foe. ``There's a chance I'll be
running against somebody who will be able to jump in a government
airplane and travel the country making promises,'' Bush said. ``I
want to be able to respond. The best way to do that is to not take
taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who now ranks a distant second to Bush in most
presidential opinion polls, reported raising $3.5 million during
the first half of the year, including $2.8 million between April 1
and June 30. Mrs. Dole also said she has $1.8 million in the bank.
Mrs. Dole's campaign reported that 43 percent of individuals that
gave her at least $200 were women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign is gaining strength and momentum,'' Mrs. Dole
said Thursday. ``This campaign is on its way to making history.''

 HMOs TO DROP 327,000 MEDICARE PATIENTS  (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Thursday that
327,000 Medicare beneficiaries would be dropped next year by health
maintenance organizations that are pulling out of the Medicare
program or reducing the areas they serve.
</P>
<P>
   The number is higher than initial estimates by spokesmen for the
managed care industry, who said two weeks ago that at least 250,000
people would be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The actual numbers, reported Thursday by the Department of
Health and Human Services, show thousands of people forced out of
Medicare HMOs in various states, including 39,000 in New York,
31,000 in Arizona, 29,000 in Florida, 34,000 in Louisiana and
32,000 in Texas. About 9,000 people in Connecticut and 6,000 in New
Jersey will also be affected.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these people may be able to join other HMOs, the
experience of being dropped by a health plan can be unnerving for
elderly and disabled people, who must hastily figure out how to
meet their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   The government data indicate that more than 10 percent of all
Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs have been or will be dropped by
their health plans in 1999 or 2000.
</P>
<P>
   About 407,000 beneficiaries were forced out of Medicare HMOs
this year, because of decisions announced by managed care plans in
late 1998. Thus, in two years, 734,000 people will have been
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Of the people dropped from private health plans last year, 44
percent enrolled in another HMO, 44 percent voluntarily decided to
go into Medicare's traditional fee-for-service program and 12
percent went into the fee-for-service program because they had no
other option.
</P>
<P>
   About 6.2 million of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are
in HMOs. They join because they are generally protected against
catastrophic costs and they usually receive extra benefits, like
prescription drugs. Many HMOs said earlier this month that they
intended to increase premiums or cut benefits for elderly
subscribers next year.
</P>
<P>
   When an HMO pulls out of Medicare, it is normally barred from
the program for five years. Forty-one of the 305 Medicare HMOs are
pulling out of the program next year, and 58 will reduce their
service areas.
</P>
<P>
   People dropped from Medicare HMOs can buy certain types of
private health insurance to fill gaps in the original
fee-for-service program. But Michael Hash, deputy administrator of
the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said
there was no guarantee that they could get insurance covering
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 327,000 people being dropped by HMOs next year, 79,000
live where no other managed care plans are available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Hash rejected the argument of HMOs that say they are not paid
enough by Medicare. He said the administration would oppose efforts
in Congress to restore some of the Medicare money cut from HMOs
under a 1997 law.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, which represents HMOs, said that Thursday's announcement
confirmed that Medicare's managed care program was ``in crisis.''
HMOs want to continue serving Medicare beneficiaries, Ms. Ignagni,
said, but often find that they cannot afford to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Hash said some health plans were trying to scare beneficiaries
by talking about a crisis in Medicare's HMO program.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, said: ``I don't know what the scare tactics are. If
people believe that disruption to the lives of 700,000 people is
not a crisis, we don't know what it takes.''

   CLINTON HOPES BARAK CAN ADVANCE MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS
</P>
<P>
   919. Moving in international and washington categories.
</P>

</P>

</P>

   Cox Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Embracing Israel's new leader as the last hope for
the ``rejuvenation,'' of the long-stalled Mideast peace process on
his watch, President Clinton welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to the White House on Thursday for substantive, yet cordial,
talks.
</P>
<P>
   After a private conversation lasting 2.5 hours, the leaders
traveled by helicopter to the Camp David presidential retreat,
where they and their wives had dinner and spent the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very excited about the prospect of the rejuvenation of
the peace process,'' Clinton told reporters in the sun-splashed
Rose Garden, just before his first meeting with Barak since the
Israeli took office last week, vowing to move the peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has put peace at the top of his agenda,'' said Clinton,
adding to Barak that ``America will help you as you move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak reciprocated the optimistic sentiment. ``It is our
intention to inject new momentum into the peace process,'' he said,
attributing the victory of his Labor Party in May parliamentary
elections to Israelis' desire for peace with security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect us to provide them with a better and safer
future,'' said Barak. ``We cannot let their hopes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak later told Clinton he was prepared to make ``painful
compromises,'' in order to make peace with Palestinians, Syrians
and Lebanese, an Israeli official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the show of good faith and high expectations, however,
there were signs of the difficulties and risks that must be
overcome to end five decades of bloodshed and enmity between
Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pressed Barak to make the first move toward
jump-starting the long-stalled Mideast peace process by fulfilling
his country's pledge to hand over additional territory to
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he would honor Israel's agreement, brokered by
Clinton last fall, to turn over an additional 13.1 percent of
Israeli-occupied land in the West Bank to the Palestinians. He said
he would do so, however, only as part of a broader effort to reach
a comprehensive peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak further stressed that he would not permit Washington to
dictate the terms or the tempo of the peace process and that
Clinton's role as peace-broker should be limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the United States can contribute to the process
more as facilitator,'' said Barak, `` than as a kind of policeman,
judge and arbitrator at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, nodding as Barak spoke, said he agreed. But Clinton
also made clear the enormous stake the United States, and he as its
leader, has in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done what we could, consistently, for more than 20
years now, through all kinds of administrations, to try to advance
the peace process,'' said Clinton. ``I have probably spent more
time on it than anyone has, and certainly I've spent a lot of time
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first year in office, Clinton hosted former Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
for a South Lawn signing of an historic peace accord. Over the past
two years, however, progress on steps outlined in that accord
stalled amid mutual recriminations. The accord is a blueprint for
handing over certain Israeli-occupied land to Palestinian control
in exchange for Palestinian efforts to combat anti-Israeli
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to restart the process, Clinton spent several days last
October in negotiations between Arafat and then-Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Wye River resort in rural
Maryland. The result was an agreement that quickly ran aground, as
Netanyahu charged Arafat with failing to take strong enough
measures against anti-Israeli terrorists. And Arafat countered that
Netanyahu had bargained in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Thursday he would honor the Wye agreement, which
calls on Israel to relinquish to the Palestinians additional land
on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a need to combine the implementation of Wye with
the moving forward of the permanent status agreement,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent status issues, including the question of Palestinian
statehood and the future of Jerusalem, are regarded as among the
most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A May deadline for the resolution of those issues was missed,
and Clinton has said he would hope the permanent status talks can
begin soon and be completed within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting was designed as a first step toward building
confidence between the two men and, according to senior Israeli and
American officials, it achieved those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a career soldier who also serves as Israel's Defense
Minister, was scheduled to meet Friday with Secretary of Defense
William Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is to spend the weekend meeting with representatives from
the U.S. Jewish community in New York, before returning to the
White House for a state dinner Sunday night and further meetings
with Clinton on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the two leaders met by themselves, without the
aides and notetakers that customarily accompany heads of state in
such meetings. And the venue was the Treaty Room in the White House
residence, deemed a more intimate setting than the businesslike
Oval Office, where Clinton ordinarily receives official guests.

DRUG COMPANIES FEAR MEDICARE REFORM COULD LEAD TO PRICE CONTROLS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top executives of the pharmaceutical industry said
Thursday that they shared President Clinton's goal of increasing
Medicare beneficiaries' access to prescription drugs, but for the
first time they criticized specific features of his proposal. In
particular, they said they feared that it could lead to price
controls.
</P>
<P>
   The executives drafted plans for lobbying and advertising at a
meeting of the board of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, a trade group for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Gordon Binder, chairman of the association
and chief executive of Amgen Inc., said: ``All seniors should have
access to our medicines, and we hope something can be done by
Congress and the president this year. But it should be done in the
right way, not the wrong way, or else it could discourage the
development of new medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   The association represents more than 100 companies, and 28
participated in Thursday's meeting. People who attended said the
board had discussed plans for a $30 million advertising campaign
and had reviewed two sample television commercials. Possible themes
for the campaign include ``no price controls'' and ``we don't want
the government in our medicine cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies said they wanted to be seen as constructive and
did not want to be vilified by the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton, both of whom in 1993 accused the industry of
price-gouging. But the executives acknowledged that the industry
did not have an alternative to Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holmer, association president, said drug makers had many
``questions and concerns'' about the president's plan, under which
the government would pay half the drug costs incurred by a Medicare
beneficiary, with the maximum federal payment rising gradually, to
$2,500 in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are greatly concerned that the proposal, as currently
structured, would inevitably lead to limits on access to
medicines,'' Holmer said. ``Under this proposal, the Federal Health
Care Financing Administration would become the largest drug
purchaser in the world. The history of Medicare and HCFA is that
policy makers start with unrealistically low cost estimates. Then,
having promised seniors a new benefit, the government limits access
to treatments _ in this case, medicines _ and imposes price
controls in order to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, a White House aide, said there was no basis for
the industry's concern. ``The president's proposal has no price
controls,'' Jennings said. ``And there's no intention to inject
price controls.''
</P>
<P>
   A drug company lobbyist who attended Thursday's meeting conceded
that ``on its face, it's hard to find the price controls'' in the
president's plan. Rather than overtly regulating drug prices, he
noted, the government would hire private companies to manage drug
benefits for the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But if the costs exceed estimates _ as has often happened in the
Medicare program _ the government ``will take it out of our hide,''
the lobbyist said, by cutting payments for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Holmer said the president's proposal ``would subsidize the rich
at taxpayers' expense,'' since taxes paid by workers with low and
moderate incomes would help pay for prescription drug benefits for
wealthy retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company executives said they also worried that the new
benefit proposed by Clinton would supplant drug coverage now
provided to retirees through the voluntary efforts of employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To discourage employers from abandoning those efforts,''
Holmer said, ``the president would reimburse employers for most of
their current costs _ a massive federal outlay, but no better
coverage for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   At its meeting, the pharmaceutical association reaffirmed that
its goal was to ``improve coverage of prescription drugs through
the private sector,'' including Medicare health maintenance
organizations, ``rather than the traditional Medicare
fee-for-service program.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is searching for the best mechanism to achieve that
goal and is struggling with the question of whether the government
should guarantee drug coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries or
just for the neediest ones.

   Cold Comfort For Migraines &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have spent millions of dollars researching new
treatments to relieve migraine headaches. Now comes a simple new
product called Migraine Ice from the Mentholatum Co. _ essentially,
an instant ice pack with adhesive backing to affix to the forehead,
temples or back of the neck for immediate pain relief.
</P>
<P>
   Funny to look at, yes. But cold therapy is a long-accepted
method for reducing migraine pain, according to Dr. Lawrence
Newman, director of the Headache Institute at St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital in New York and head of the Pain Management Council, a
promotional group sponsored by Mentholatum.
</P>
<P>
   Mentholatum's Japanese parent was looking to develop new
products based on a technology used in Japan to reduce fever: a
water-based gel that stays cold for up to four hours. Mentholatum
researchers concluded that migraine sufferers _ compared with
people with ankle sprains or joint pain, for example _ had the
greatest need for convenient cold therapy, if only to relieve the
pain between the time a migraine strikes and when pain medication
takes effect, said Marty Cohen, vice president of sales and
marketing at the company in Orchard Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Each treatment costs about $2.50 _ more, of course, than
wrapping a few ice cubes in a washcloth. But Mentholatum is
promoting the relative convenience of its new product. ``It was one
of those V-8 moments,'' Cohen said of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Migraine sufferers, though, are unlikely to slap their foreheads
at the thought. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Compuware Corp., a provider of business software and
technology support services, will acquire Viasoft Inc., a leading
vendor of software tools for fixing year 2000 computer problems,
for $164 million, the companies said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Viasoft, based in Phoenix, reached a market value of more than
$1 billion in 1997, its stock rising to more than $65 a share, as
investors anticipated soaring demand for its Year 2000 products.
But the company later became a prime example of the problems facing
year 2000 companies as the business wound down.
</P>
<P>
   With investors pessimistic about its future, Viasoft's shares
spent much of the year below $4 before climbing recently to $6.3438
on Wednesday. Viasoft rose $2.25 Thursday, to $8.5938. Shares of
Compuware edged up 50 cents, to $35.
</P>
<P>
   The price for Viasoft comes to $9 a share, a 42 percent premium
to Wednesday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Compuware, a more diversified company based in Farmington Hills,
Mich., began reducing its reliance on year 2000 revenue early last
year. Viasoft waited until this year to shift its focus to products
and services that could sell well after the year 2000 transition is
over. Compuware said it was particularly attracted to Viasoft's
tools to link existing mainframe computer systems to e-commerce and
for making improvements in old software.

   FILM-EYES (Undated) _ After years of rumors and retakes, the
opening of Stanley Kubrick's 13th and final film, ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' is likely to be considered a major disappointment by most
of the movie world. As a sexual thriller, it's so stylized and tame
that it almost seems silly. As a relationship drama, it seems
empty, drawn-out and often sophomoric. As a star vehicle for
Hollywood's power couple _ Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman _ it's
surprisingly lackluster.

DETAILS REVEAL INTERAGENCY RIVALRY IN HUNT FOR SUSPECT IN SERIAL
KILLINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
and JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Emerging details about efforts to track down and
arrest a suspected serial killer indicate that federal agents
tripped up on at least two critical occasions, threatening the
fragile relationship with the suspect's family, who ultimately
brokered the surrender of Angel Maturino Resendez.
</P>
<P>
   The first misstep occurred in early June, according to a
law-enforcement source close to the investigation, when an FBI
agent offended the fugitive's sister just as a Texas Ranger was
developing a relationship with her. The agent was acting at the
request of Don K. Clark, head of the FBI's Houston office, said the
source, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   According to a second source, a high-ranking Texas
law-enforcement official, Clark then frustrated Rangers and the
suspect's wife a week ago with his aggressive effort to put her on
television to appeal to Maturino Resendez to surrender. Maturino
Resendez also went by the alias Rafael Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow came when the FBI announced the suspect's arrest
Tuesday, again slighting the Rangers, who had pulled off the
dramatic surrender earlier that morning on an international bridge
in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just boils down to the fact that the FBI got beat
and they can't stand it,'' said the second source, who also asked
not to be identified. ``And then the FBI struggles to understand
why they are so disrespected and can't develop relationships with
other agencies. They want it to be a one-way street, all for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the differences were set aside.
</P>
<P>
   The sister, Manuela Maturino, came to trust the Ranger, Sgt.
Drew Carter. Her brother came out of hiding in Mexico and
peacefully surrendered in Texas. He now is in the Harris County
Jail in Houston, a suspect in at least nine slayings since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But these new details are significant in the implication that
interagency rivalry may have jeopardized one of the largest
manhunts in recent U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   According to the first source, Clark apparently tried to
undercut Carter several weeks ago by asking the FBI office in
Albuquerque, N.M., to dispatch an agent to Maturino's home in that
city _ before Carter could arrive for an interview he had already
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Carter got a chilly reception from the woman.
Details of the meeting are unclear, but Maturino shut down talks
with investigators afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word I got was she was offended by the way she got
approached by the FBI,'' said the source. ``The initial contact on
her was not good, and that was the FBI. (Carter) had to re-initiate
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident caused a riff because the Rangers were not told
ahead of time about the Albuquerque visit initiated by the FBI in
Houston. Shortly afterward, representatives of the multiagency task
force investigating the serial crimes held a meeting to defuse the
animosity and prevent future breakdowns in communication.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a 32-year-old rookie in the elite Rangers corps who has
assumed folk-hero status for his work on the case, was reluctant
this week to discuss the incident because he must work with the FBI
in future investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what happened, I know, and I just don't know that
that's a wound that needs to be addressed,'' he said. ``To bring
that up, I think we're digging up a wound that I don't want to
open. I don't think that will be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, though, it was Carter who smoothed things over.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had been assigned to the investigation of the Dec. 17
slaying of a Houston-area physician and had been one of the first
to suspect it was linked to another brutal killing in Weimar in
May. When he heard about Manuela Maturino, he telephoned to set up
an interview. After the rocky start, the two bonded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We established a trust in that we both sensed sincerity in the
other individual's questions and in their answers and in their
concerns,'' Carter said. ``I think Manuela and their family are
good people. They were legitimately concerned for the safety of
their brother, but at the same time they did not approve of the
crimes that were being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal officials assented, telling Maturino that Carter was
the point man in their discussions. In the six weeks he worked with
Maturino, Carter said, he flew to Albuquerque three times and
talked to her frequently by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The major break in the case came last Sunday, when Maturino
called Carter on his cellular phone to report that her brother was
ready to give himself up.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino's pastor in Albuquerque, Troy Robinson, however,
downplays any impression that there was ever any tension between
the woman and any law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every meeting there was a Texas Ranger, a U.S. marshal and
an FBI agent. All of them were very considerate to her,'' he said.
Three formal meetings were held, beginning in mid-June, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second source has a harsher view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe that had those folks treated that lady
properly ... had shown the respect and compassion that Drew Carter
did, she would have picked up the cell phone and made the call to
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the investigations, authorities convinced Maturino
Resendez's common-law wife, Julieta Dominguez Reyes, to fly to
Houston from her home in Mexico to talk with two FBI experts who
were crafting a psychological profile of the fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal we cut with the FBI was that we would let two FBI
profilers in the hotel to interview her,'' the second source said.
Clark told one of his profilers that he wanted to bring her over to
the task force office and have her publicly plead for her husband
to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez refused, the Mexican assistant attorney general who
was with her refused and the Rangers didn't like it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, we had homicide cases we had to talk to her about,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark wound up making the appeal himself.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw was on the day of the surrender. The Rangers
were planning to announce Maturino Resendez's arrest. But word got
back immediately to the FBI, and the announcement was made directly
from Washington, with FBI Director Louis Freeh announcing the
arrest during a congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clark defended his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret having made any decisions that I had to make in
this case,'' said Clark. ``If we made some calls somewhere along
the line that may have appeared to upset or do something else, then
we live with those and we go ahead on. The end result is what
counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to look back at adverse things in this
investigation because I think there's a lot of hard work by a lot
of people here on a very complex investigation and a whole team it
took to put this together, not one agency, not one person, not one
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said several factors contributed to the Maturino
Resendez's surrender, including placing the suspect on the FBI's 10
Most Wanted list, generating nationwide publicity on the case and
getting the suspect's wife to beg her husband to surrender himself.

ETHNIC ALBANIAN LEADER RETURNS TO KOSOVO AMID CHEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Ibrahim Rugova, leader of a decade of
principled, but largely futile, nonviolent resistance to Serbian
domination, returned here Thursday to a political landscape that
was at once transformed and confused.
</P>
<P>
   He has been criticized for appearing on television with Slobodan
Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, in the midst of the brutal
campaign to drive Albanians out of Kosovo. He has also faced
criticism for failing to visit refugee camps and refusing to
actively support the Kosovo Liberation Army's armed rebellion. But
he received a warm welcome Thursday from a cheering crowd as he
arrived at the new U.N. headquarters here, accompanied by American
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Rugova held a crowded, sweaty and enigmatic news
conference for a crush of foreign journalists Thursday afternoon,
the man who _ if all goes according to plan _ will really run
Kosovo came to town with considerably less fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   The man is Bernard Kouchner, the former French government
minister and leader of Doctors Without Borders, who is to be the
chief civil administrator of the war-torn province, with the title
of special representative of the secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority is law and order, order and law,'' Kouchner said
in a brief meeting with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It is a daunting task. His predecessor, Sergio Vieira de Mello,
ended his brief tour in office by issuing a statement decrying
Kosovo's postwar slide toward chaos despite the presence of more
than 32,000 NATO peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killings, kidnapping, forced expulsions, house burnings and
looting are a daily occurrence'' directed at members of minority
groups, the statement said. ``These are criminal acts. They cannot
be excused by the suffering that has been inflicted in the past.
Kosovo's future must be built on justice, not vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are simply no Kosovo government institutions left. Kosovo,
treasured in Serbian history and folklore, was the key to
Milosevic's plan to seize power by unleashing Serbian nationalism.
In 1990, Milosevic ended Kosovo's constitutional autonomy,
effectively firing the parliament and dismissing Albanians from
jobs in government and state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rugova's leadership, Albanians resisted with a nonviolent
``parallel society,'' holding school classes and even elections for
a powerless parliament and president _ Rugova _ in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic loyalists and nationalists were the mayors and police
chiefs for the most part, but these Serbs were swept away by the
arrival of NATO troops a month ago. Kosovo Albanians, out of work
for a decade, now want their old jobs back.
</P>
<P>
   In this void have come the United Nations and other
international agencies like the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is supposed to concentrate on
developing democratic institutions; the European Union, focusing on
physical rebuilding, and a host of lesser aid groups. So many
hundreds of millions of dollars of aid have been pledged that
senior international officials worry privately that the money
cannot be effectively absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. operation here, which is carrying out the mandate of
the Security Council, says it will determine what the law is,
mostly old Yugoslav law except where that conflicts with European
norms.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two other claims to a government. One is from
Rugova, who drew an 80 percent turnout as the sole candidate in an
underground election in March 1998, which was boycotted by his
critics. The other is from his rival, Hashim Thaci, the rebel army
leader who dominated the Albanian delegation at the Rambouillet
peace conference in France, and who calls himself the president of
the ``provisional government.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rebel army gained popular support because of killings by
Serbs, Rugova's stature here is believed to have declined. In
recent weeks, however, the rebel force has appeared to be splitting
into factions.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials believe it will be about a year before elections
can be held.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is attempting to form a Kosovo Transitional
Council of about a dozen people _ its final membership is still
uncertain _ from various political parties and factions. Rugova and
Thaci have both said they would join.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will cooperate with everybody and we will be represented on
the international forums together,'' Rugova said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his appearance with Milosevic during the war and
rumors that he might have been drugged, Rugova replied, ``That was
not cooperation and it's over now.''

 &HT;    CompuServe, AltaVista keep free deals coming
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Want to get on the information superhighway on the
cheap? Online service CompuServe continues to offer rebates on
certain makes of IBM computers if users sign up for three years of
the service at the $21.95 monthly price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Then after you get your computer, you can sign up with search
engine AltaVista, which may have come up with the Internet service
provider's worst nightmare: free dial-up Internet service. Both
deals are designed to draw more users and more advertising dollars
to the respective services.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista's free Internet access is made possible through a deal
with a small Silicon Valley start-up called 1stUP.com. The company
claims to be the first to provide the technology for Web
businesses, e-commerce players and any Web site to offer Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   As with Juno's free e-mail and Internet service, users will have
to look at constantly rotating advertising banners in exchange for
free access to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The service should be available sometime next week. Consumers
who decide to use AltaVista's free ISP service will download the
software from the AltaVista Web site (www.altavista.com), although
AltaVista may eventually offer the software on a CD.
</P>
<P>
   As with Juno and other free online services, subscribers will
complete a registration questionnaire and they'll receive ads for
products they are interested in. 1stUp says that access will be
available from almost anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The AltaVista ISP will have an online advertising window framing
banner ads as well as an AltaVista search window.
</P>
<P>
   1stUp co-founder and Vice President Jonah Steinhart says the
company's mission is to ``be the leading technology provider for
ad-supported Internet access. We want to enable our partners to
build even stronger relationships with their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   1stUp hopes to join with other major Internet companies and
offers a wide range of solutions along with dial-up Internet
access, including e-mail and customer support. The type of service
will vary by what each individual partner needs. In the case of
AltaVista, the search engine has its own free e-mail service and
doesn't need 1stUp's e-mail component.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola's profit down, but optimism up
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola's stock rose more than 3 percent Thursday
after the company reported a sharp drop in second-quarter earnings
but indicated the worst may be over.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt by a European health scare and troubled economies overseas,
Coca-Cola said Thursday its second-quarter profits fell 21 percent
from a year ago. The recall of its products last month in Belgium
and France was responsible for about 25 percent of the profit
decline.
</P>
<P>
   But while the first half of the year has been disappointing for
the company, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer M. Douglas
Ivester and industry analysts are expecting the rest of the year to
be kinder.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts predict the company will be able to earn more in
the second half of 1999 than it did in 1998. For the first six
months of this year, Coca-Cola's earnings have fallen 18 percent
from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now starting to see stabilization in many markets and
gradual economic improvements in others,'' Ivester said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, however, the company earned $942 million,
or 38 cents a share. That was down from $1.19 billion, or 48 cents
a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 cents-a-share decline, the company attributed 2 cents
to 3 cents to the recall of its products that caused full or
partial sales bans in several key European markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company also experienced increased marketing expenses as it
tried to reinvigorate its brands once the recalls were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, Coca-Cola saw a 2 percent drop in quarterly case sales
_ only the second time that has happened in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This past year can be characterized as a period of volatility
and uncertainty in the global economic environment,'' Ivester said
in a statement. ``Looking back, the depth of the economic downturns
in many markets has been greater than we had originally
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, case volume dropped 6 percent. That compared with a
10 percent gain a year ago. In addition to the recall, sales were
hurt by ``continued difficult economic conditions in Germany,
Russia and parts of Eastern Europe which were influenced by the
recent war in Kosovo,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Case sales _ the number of 24 eight-ounce servings shipped to
retailers _ fell in virtually every part of the world, except in
Latin America, where volume was flat. Mexico, Central America and
the Caribbean saw gains, but Brazil, Chile, Venezuela and Colombia
posted declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ongoing problems with Coke's international
operations, which dominate the company's earnings stream,'' said
Roy Burry, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was down 9 percent in China, which is a major contributor
to results in Coca-Cola's Middle and Far East group. Although the
company blamed poor weather and a backlash to U.S. products
following the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, Wall Street expected better results.
</P>
<P>
   Even in North America, which has not been hit by a recall or
economic turmoil, case sales fell 1 percent. This time the culprit
was recent price increases that crimped consumer demand. Partly
because of price increases, company revenue rose 4 percent to $5.38
billion in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, the forecast is for Coca-Cola to earn 37 cents a
share in the third quarter, compared with 35 cents a year ago, and
about 33 cents in the fourth quarter, against 24 cents in the 1998
period.
</P>
<P>
   While Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Martin Romm predicts a
moderate improvement in the third quarter, he expects the company
will still feel the effects of the European recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the ongoing expense in the third quarter _
getting back the consumer and the shelf space and market share _
but I think all those things will come at a price,'' Romm said.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives, including Ivester, are scheduled to talk to
industry analysts at a meeting next Thursday in New York.

 &HT;    Class-action part of Coca-Cola suit is not dismissed
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. failed Thursday in its bid to get the
class-action portion of a racial discrimination suit dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story said it would be ``premature''
and a ``disservice'' to both sides to throw out the class-action
allegations at such an early stage in the case. The information
gathering, or ``discovery,'' process has just begun, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the grave concerns I have is a lack of knowledge,''
Story said during the two-hour hearing in Atlanta. As a result, he
wants both sides to spend the next few months accumulating and
exchanging information, analyzing documents and taking depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Story pointed out that his ruling does not mean the plaintiffs
have succeeded in gaining class-action status. That could only come
after the discovery process is completed, and only if the judge is
convinced the case is appropriate for a class action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still significant legal and management issues to be
resolved,'' Story said.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing his ruling, the judge said he must take
employment discrimination cases very seriously. Story quoted from a
Court of Appeals case saying the legal system has ``consistently
recognized that discrimination in employment is one of the most
deplorable forms of discrimination known to our society.''
</P>
<P>
   One former and four current Coca-Cola employees have sued the
company, alleging discrimination against African-American employees
in pay, promotions and performance evaluations. They seek
class-action status so they can represent another 1,500 black,
salaried Coke employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola denies it has discriminated against African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the company unsuccessfully argued Thursday that there are
too many individual facts and circumstances among existing and
prospective plaintiffs for the case to ever be handled as a
class-action suit. Company attorney William Clineburg Jr. argued
that it would break down into 1,500 mini-trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having 1,500 jury trials is not going to result in any benefit
for the class as a whole,'' Clineburg told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Story, however, remained unconvinced. He said it might be more
efficient to have one case and 1,500 trials than 1,500 cases and
1,500 trials.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision, the judge said, needs to be made after more
facts are known. The company just recently handed over to the
plaintiffs some 13,000 pages of documents that need to be read and
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed with this ruling,'' said Coca-Cola
spokesman Robert Baskin. ``But it's the first step in a long
process. ... After it's over, we're confident it will be determined
that Coca-Cola does not discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys Cyrus Mehri and Pamela Coukos said they
were delighted with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most powerful institution in the South tried to turn back
the clock,'' Mehri said, referring to the company's attempt to get
the class-action claims dismissed. But, he added, a ``courageous
judge'' stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the time to do a victory lap,'' Mehri added. ``This
is the time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.

 &HT;    Marketers rush to land deals with apartment units
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Competition is fast and furious for the natural gas
accounts of apartment managers and residents.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Energy, one of Georgia's 20 certified gas marketers, and
Lane Co., one of Atlanta's largest property management companies,
announced a deal this week designating Shell as the ``preferred
natural gas provider'' for Lane's rental units. Lane owns and
manages between 20,000 and 25,000 Georgia apartments, 30 percent of
which use natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Post Properties chose SCANA Energy this year for its 16,000
units. Julian LeCraw &AMP; Co. also chose the South Carolina-based
natural gas supplier to serve 5,000 to 6,000 of its apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Gables Residential signed up with Peachtree Natural Gas for more
than 7,000 units. The gas supplier also counts a number of public
housing authorities among its customers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Georgia Apartment Association, there are about
500,000 apartment units in the state. About 60 percent are
all-electric, and 40 percent use natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Landlords typically negotiate ``continuous service'' agreements
that ensure the gas flow will continue when apartments are vacant,
avoiding such problems as frozen pipes during the winter. The
agreements also pre-empt $25 disconnect and reconnect fees to
landlords from AGL, which will remain a distribution company even
after deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   When tenants move out, they notify marketers and are billed for
their usage. The gas flow to the apartment then goes on landlords'
accounts until a new tenant moves in.
</P>
<P>
   But most tenants are winding up with less choice than homeowners
when it comes to selecting a marketer. Landlords are rewriting
leases en masse to make clear that they _ and not tenants _ have
the right to choose gas suppliers. Many have asked tenants to sign
over those rights until their current leases expire.
</P>
<P>
   John Slattery, president of the apartment association, estimated
that 85 percent to 90 percent of residents have agreed, though they
are giving up the right to choose their own suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Public Service Commission and the Governor's
Office of Consumer Affairs both said the practice is permissible,
so long as tenants give proper authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Several marketers said they charge landlords the same prices
that tenants pay. Other financial inducements offered the landlords
have been kept confidential. AGL has offered ``continuous service''
agreements for years as a monopoly supplier, and marketers are
rushing to fill the void that will be created when the utility
exits the sales business this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A. Clifton Payne, vice president for marketing at Georgia
Natural Gas, said agreements with apartment managers are highly
sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give us a block of meters we know will remain ours
although people are turning over in the apartments,'' said Payne,
whose company claims 30,000 units. The turnover rate in Georgia
apartments is estimated at 60 percent to 70 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Latham, president of Peachtree Natural Gas, said her
company has ``cut every kind of imaginable deal you can think of''
to secure such agreements, from supplying gas grills for pools to
``sales development fees'' paid directly to landlords or to upgrade
units for energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Joyce-Menk, director of cooperative programs and services
at Lane Co., said her company was offered sign-up bonuses but
declined to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not see deregulation as a moneymaker,'' she said.
``This is not something you get greedy over.'' But she added that
Lane is seeking to recoup more than $30,000 it has spent to figure
out deregulation through its deal with Shell.
</P>
<P>
   SCANA said its customers in apartments have received all the
benefits extended to other customers, including SCANA's $50 free
gas offer that expired in April. SCANA distributed $50 grocery gift
certificates to Post residents displaced by a recent Atlanta
apartment fire.
</P>
<P>
   Latham said Peachtree's offer of free gas during the summer is
going to tenants in apartment houses it serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are treating tenants just like everybody else,'' she said.

ATLANTA'S MAYOR DEFIES THREAT TO END AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Leaning over four floors of balconies and surrounding
a stage at City Hall, hundreds of black Atlantans let loose their
``amens'' Thursday at a rally called by the mayor in defiance of
the threat of a lawsuit to end the city's affirmative action
program.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the courts in recent years have chipped away at similar
race-based benefit programs across the country, the mayor, Bill
Campbell, has said he refuses to allow the same thing to happen in
Atlanta, which is more than two-thirds black and is known as the
cradle of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative public interest legal group, the Southeastern
Legal Foundation, gave the city 30 days' notice on June 14 that if
its affirmative action program was not abolished voluntarily, the
foundation would file a lawsuit. The foundation, led by its
president, Matthew Glavin, has said that the program violates the
Fourteenth Amendment and that it will file suit by the first week
of August.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who in 1960 was the only black child to integrate the
school system in Raleigh, N.C., told the rally that Atlanta must
not let outside forces push back the gains of the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want us to be able to dunk, to dance and to run, but not
to run our own businesses,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's affirmative action program was started in 1975 by its
first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, when minority-owned companies
received less than 1 percent of the money from city contracts. The
program got the attention of business when Jackson held up airport
construction because, he said, there were not enough minority
companies involved.
</P>
<P>
   Today the city, which is home to the nation's largest
black-owned contractor, H.J. Russell &AMP; Co., requires that 35
percent of its contracts be handled by minority-owned companies. In
1997 Atlanta awarded $109 million to about 800 companies registered
as minority-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous year the private corporation established by city
officials to run the 1996 Summer Olympics, the Atlanta Committee
for the Olympic Games, awarded almost a third of its $387 million
in construction and vending contracts to companies owned primarily
by minorities and women. One of the main beneficiaries was H.J.
Russell, which won a 29 percent share of the $207 million spent to
build the Centennial Olympic Stadium, the main arena of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been the focus of controversy outside of the
general debate over affirmative action. A series of articles in The
Atlanta Journal and Constitution this year detailed several abuses
in the system, including an incident in which a city employee
certified a business as eligible to bid as a minority-owned company
and then left to become head of that company, which later received
a $3 million contract from the city.
</P>
<P>
   There have been instances in which both white and minority
business people have said the program amounts to a patronage
system, where friends of city leaders receive big contracts. In
particular, there is a small core of Atlanta developers who have
over the years won bids on most of the city's biggest contracts,
including part of a $283 million renovation of the city's biggest
hospital and a $142 million project at the city's Underground
Atlanta shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Thursday morning, Campbell said that
Atlanta must remain a mecca for black businesses and that he would
go to jail before he sees the city stop its affirmative action
program. Losing, he said, is ``not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   If the foundation follows through with its threat of a lawsuit _
and it seems likely that it will _ Campbell and the city's
minority-owned contractors will face a coalition of lawyers that
has won a series of victories in this decade in shutting down
race-based preference programs in the South. The foundation,
through lawsuits and threats, has effectively drawn an
ever-constricting ring of affirmative-action defeats around
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In June the foundation successfully sued Fulton County, of which
Atlanta is the county seat, to discontinue its affirmative action
program. In his decision, a judge in U.S. District Court here said
that the data supplied by Fulton County officials could not show a
clear pattern of discrimination by the county against
minority-owned companies there. Atlanta uses the same set of data
as Fulton County to justify its program.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation ended affirmative action in Jacksonville, Fla.,
in 1991, in the Atlanta public schools in 1996 and in DeKalb
County, which adjoins Fulton County, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, letters from the group led DeKalb County's
public schools to stop its minority-to-majority busing program, and
the school board in Nashville to cease using race as a factor in
its magnet school program.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell says that he remembers being that little boy in a
sea of white in the 1960 school year and that he is not intimidated
by the foundation's track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight to the death,'' Campbell said. ``There will be
no compromise, no capitulation whatsoever. There will be no judge
browbeating us into submission. Just because these right-wing hate
groups dress themselves in suits instead of robes doesn't mean it's
not still racism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight to the death,'' he said. ``There will be no
compromise, no capitulation whatsoever. There will be no judge
browbeating us into submission. Just because these right-wing hate
groups dress themselves in suits instead of robes doesn't mean it's
not still racism.''

IN NORTHERN IRELAND, CHAOS, FARCE AND A DREAM DEFERRED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to add new 18th graf on George Mitchell joining Tuesday
talks. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ What was supposed to have been the
most important day in the evolving Northern Ireland peace agreement
became a scene of chaos, farce and recrimination Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a Thursday morning meeting of politicians at the
Stormont parliamentary building that was meant to inaugurate a new
era of government for the conflicted British province, the new
Northern Ireland Assembly had been shut down indefinitely, one of
its principal figures had resigned in disgust and the British
government had announced in London that the peace agreement was on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion began Thursday when David Trimble, head of the
main Protestant party, and his 28 Ulster Unionist colleagues
boycotted the Assembly session, which was scheduled to nominate
Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who is also the first minister of the Assembly, had
dashed hopes of any further progress on the peace accord when he
said Wednesday night that his party could not share power with the
largely Catholic Sinn Fein, the political associates of the Irish
Republican Army, unless the IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon of the moderate Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party reacted with fury, announcing
Thursday that he was resigning and calling on Trimble to do the
same. He accused Trimble of ``dishonoring the spirit and insulting
the principle'' of the peace agreement and said he had ``bled the
process dry'' with his unyielding pressure for concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon concluded with a dismissive motion towards the empty rows
of black benches belonging to the Ulster Unionists. ``I,'' he said,
``do not treat this house with contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   It emerged afterwards that Mallon's resignation may force
Trimble to give up his position as first minister. Under the
procedures of the power-sharing assembly, in six weeks Trimble must
either find another Roman Catholic deputy _ a daunting task in the
current rejectionist atmosphere he has created _ or step down.
</P>
<P>
   The break between the two men sent a dismaying message to those
working for peace in Northern Ireland because their public
partnership had been one of the most promising symbols of an
emerging cooperation between Ulster's warring religious communities
in the 15 months since the signing of the accord. Trimble was
awarded the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with John Hume, who is
the head of Mallon's party and his closest associate.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite of that kind of spirit was symbolized by
Thursday's uproarious session, with the members of the hard-line
Ulster Democrats jeering Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein,
and Adams excoriating their leader, the Rev. Ian Paisley, as
disgraceful. The one thing they agreed on was the use of ``farce''
to describe the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the absence of the Unionists, the Assembly was unable
to name a new Cabinet with the required Catholic-Protestant mix,
and it adjourned with no date for returning. The only parties
willing to nominate ministers were Sinn Fein and the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and the result was a 10-member all
Catholic shadow Cabinet that history will record held office for
less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise descended into farce when the acting speaker, Lord
Alderdice, had to give the missing Trimble five minutes under the
body's standing orders to name his minister. Derisive laughter
filled the hall as the legislators watched the minutes tick off on
the official clock above Trimble's empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists' decision had the effect of blocking the transfer
of power over local affairs from the British Parliament in London
to the Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast, which had been
scheduled for Sunday. The step would have represented the most
substantive evidence yet that the province had put behind it the
sectarian violence that has taken more than 3,200 lives in favor of
a political path.
</P>
<P>
   In London Mo Mowlam, the secretary for Northern Ireland, said
that the British and Irish governments were reviewing the peace
accord and that Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, would meet next week to decide on the
``nature, agenda and timetable'' of the review.
</P>
<P>
   She told a somber House of Commons that it was the
implementation of the agreement rather than the agreement itself
that would be under study. ``Today is a setback, it would be
foolish to deny that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it would be even more foolish to conclude that the Good
Friday Agreement cannot continue,'' she added, in a reference to
the day in 1998 when the accord was signed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Andrew Mackay, the Conservative Party spokesman for Northern
Ireland and an aggressive advocate for Trimble, asked Ms. Mowlam to
praise the Unionist leader and declare that the blame for the
setback lay entirely with the IRA and other paramilitary groups for
not handing over their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   She responded by saying that she had respect for all the party
leaders and that ``the last thing the people of Northern Ireland
need now is an outbreak of recriminations.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters quoted a spokesman for Blair as saying that the meeting
with Ahern would take place on Tuesday, and that George Mitchell,
the former U.S. senator who was chairman of the 1998 peace talks,
would attend.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1998 agreement establishes governmental bodies and
commissions aimed at balancing the demands of Northern Ireland's
two main religious communities and parceling out authority between
them.
</P>
<P>
   It was approved overwhelmingly in referendums in Northern
Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, but politicians have been
quarreling about it for more than a year, with guerrilla
disarmament at the root of disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists say they cannot let a party with a private army
into government. The IRA will not agree to dismantle its arsenal.
But Sinn Fein argues that disarmament was never a precondition to
putting the plan into place. Sinn Fein also says that the IRA
cease-fire, now in its third year, is proof of the organization's
commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
   While the Assembly is indefinitely suspended, other parts of the
agreement, like the commission to examine reforms of the police
force, will move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, the Conservatives pressed Ms. Mowlam to end
the early release of prisoners, but she said she could not do that
by law unless paramilitary groups violated the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   There was no public admission of whatever frustration was felt
by Blair, who seized upon the Northern Ireland problem in his first
week in office in May 1997. Blair has made it a personal crusade,
spending enormous amounts of time with the province's politicians
here and in London.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Blair had come up with compromises and
concessions in an attempt to persuade Trimble not to back out of
entering government with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a conference in London's financial district Thursday
afternoon, Blair said the politicians of Northern Ireland would
never be able to work together unless they developed some
confidence in one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one thing remains outstanding,'' he said. ``It is a
matter of trust: Will Unionists really share power with
non-Unionists, will republicans really give up the gun?''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said he believed the answer to both questions was yes, but
that unless people learned from the pain and injustice on the other
side as well as their own, ``then politics, normal politics in
Northern Ireland will never take root and there will therefore
never be peace.''

 &HT;    SENATE APPROVES REPUBLICAN BILL ON MANAGED CARE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four days of rancorous debate over competing
proposals to give patients more power over their managed care
health plans, the Senate voted along party lines late Thursday for
a Republican bill that the White House said would be vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   The final 53-47 vote vote seemed preordained early in the week
as Republicans, who hold a 10-seat majority, were able to hold all
but two or three members on every vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats remained united throughout the week, but lost on a
dozen amendments aimed at broadening the bill's coverage and giving
both patients and doctors greater influence over health care
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans John Chafee of Rhode Island and Peter Fitzgerald of
Illinois joined the unanimous Democrats in opposing the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has not been voted on in the House. But Vice President
Al Gore, who joined key Democratic senators in the Capitol a few
hours before the final Senate vote, said that ``if the Republican
leadership insists on going through this charade and passing a bill
of goods they've been trying to promote, President Clinton will
veto it in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., urged senators not
to be swayed by a veto threat. Lott noted the administration had
indicated it would veto several bills that were later signed into
law after a House-Senate conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the president and to those who have not supported the
Republican position on the 'Patients' Bill of Rights Plus', work
with us,'' Lott said. ``Let's make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-sponsored bill would cost the federal government
$13.4 billion over five years. Among its major components:
</P>
<P>
   _ Patient protections: It covers 48 million people in employer
self-financed insurance plans, prohibits managed care plans from
charging patients more for using emergency rooms outside of the
plan, gives women direct access to gynecologists and allows
obstetricians and gynecologists to serve as primary care providers,
requires access to specialty care ``in a timely manner,'' covers
clinical trials for cancer patients only, and requires all managed
care plans to allow mastectomy patients to remain in a hospital as
long as determined necessary by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Appeals: The bill covers 124 million people in most managed
care plans, creates an internal and external appeals process in
cases of denial of treatment, and would impose a $10,000 fine for
managed care plans that do not comply with the ruling of the
external appeals panel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tax provisions: It allows full tax deduction of health
insurance for the self-employed, the creation of tax-free medical
savings accounts to pay for health care, and full deduction of
long-term care insurance that is not employer-subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton blamed the power of the insurance
lobby for a 53-47 rejection of a key Democratic amendment that
would have allowed patients to sue their health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health insurers won't let them do it,'' Clinton said.
``It's a sad day for health care in America, but we're not done
yet, and this won't die.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore predicted the patients' rights issue could play a major
role in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't do the right thing on this, I think it will be a
major topic of debate all over the country this year, next year and
until this bill is passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Democratic criticisms that the GOP would leave
about 113 million people without adequate protection, Republicans
argued that their bill covered 48 million people in federally
regulated plans without usurping existing state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also argued that if the Democratic proposal was
approved, insurance premiums would rise by more than 6 percent and
the number of uninsured Americans would increase by 1.8 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., the only physician in the Senate, said
he was convinced the GOP bill ``keeps the patient at the center of
this debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bill takes medical decisions out of the hand of the huge
bureaucracy of HMOs,'' he said, ``and puts them back in the hands
of the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the Senate minority leader, said
the ``HMO'' in the Republican HMO reform bill stood for ``half
measures only.''
</P>
<P>
   The final action came after Lott objected to a request by Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla., that would have allowed a bipartisan group of
moderate senators to offer a compromise plan that included many of
the Democratic provisions and a scaled-back right to sue HMOs for
damages.
</P>
<P>
   After Lott's objection, Graham said the group would ``continue
the effort to fashion a reasonable, bipartisan plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the last chapter of this debate,'' Graham said.
Referring to the veto threat, he said, ``We don't want an issue. We
want a result that will help American families.''

A SON FEELS WRONGED BY POLICE, AND A FATHER, THE MAYOR, NODS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The yuppie couple was driving home through the suburb
of Royal Oak after dinner and a movie when a police car behind them
turned on its lights and siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled over,'' Dennis W. Archer Jr. said, recalling the
Memorial Day incident. ``Completely surrounding us there are six
police cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite politely asking why they had been stopped, Archer said,
he and his date were ordered out of the car without explanation. As
an officer aimed a shotgun at him, Archer said, he was patted down
and then pushed into the back seat of a police cruiser, where he
watched as his date was handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   After about 15 minutes, he said, the officers let them go,
acknowledging, with little apology, that the couple were unlikely
to have committed a nearby armed robbery minutes earlier. Archer's
date works as a county prosecutor. Archer, 30, is a lawyer and the
eldest son of Detroit's mayor, Dennis W. Archer.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were white. Archer and his date are black.
</P>
<P>
   For the mayor, there was a sad familiarity. When his son called,
Archer said, ``I had flashbacks to when I was stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 15 years ago, when police officers in Detroit pulled
him over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had pulled guns and put me in the back seat,'' the mayor
said. They went through his Cadillac Seville, looking for evidence
that he was the drug dealer they were looking for, he said. But
when the police rifled through his briefcase, they learned he was
president of the State Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   In stopping the mayor's son, the Royal Oak police said, officers
responded appropriately and followed normal procedures for an
investigation of a felony, rather than a simple traffic stop. Three
minutes before stopping Archer, the police had received a report
that a gunman robbed a convenience store nearby, then drove off
with another person in a dark blue Jeep. Archer's Jeep Grand
Cherokee is black, and carried two people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case of stopping a black driver for the sake of
stopping a black driver,'' said Cmdr. Thomas Wightman of the Royal
Oak Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor's son believes that the police would have given
better treatment to a white couple, and he plans to file a
complaint with the police department on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities across the country say it is so common for them to be
stopped for what they feel are slender reasons that they have a
name for an imaginary crime: DWB, driving while black.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton ordered federal law-enforcement
agencies to compile data on the race and ethnicity of those they
stop and challenged state and local police to do the same. Clinton
called the practice of racial profiling, the stopping of drivers
because of the color of their skin, ``morally indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, New Jersey officials admitted that state troopers had
unfairly singled out minority drivers.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York, where the police shooting of an unarmed black
man who was approached for questioning led to weeks of protests,
Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington recently told of his own experience in
being harassed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Detroit, a city that is 76 percent black, the police are
long past the days when squad cars carrying burly white officers
would pull up to street corners and beat up blacks. In the 1967
riots here, white officers opened fire on a black uniformed rookie
officer, Isaiah McKinnon, who later became the city's police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's police force has been well integrated, and for more
than 25 years the city has been run by black mayors.
</P>
<P>
   But blacks _ rich, middle-class and poor alike _ still tell of
being followed by the police when they drive into the primarily
white suburbs or of being otherwise harassed when they encounter
suburban police.
</P>
<P>
   A black executive with General Motors sent his nephew to shop in
his exclusive neighborhood, only to soon have the police interrupt
a party at his house to investigate whether the youngster had
stolen a can of vegetables. The receipt was produced and the police
left, but the executive said he was still shaken.
</P>
<P>
   The recent stop was the worst, but not the first, for the
mayor's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been stopped before for what has been, in my opinion,
no apparent reason,'' Archer said. ``You cannot come across anyone
who is African-American who has not at some point felt that they
have been either subtly or very directly discriminated against
because of their race, myself included.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the incident made him feel that society had gone
``back in time, as opposed to moving forward where we can put these
issues behind us and have a society based on mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat with his son in the mayor's office, under a print of the
famous Norman Rockwell painting of bygone days, when U.S. marshals
were needed to escort a young black girl to a once-white school,
past a wall where someone had scrawled a racial epithet and thrown
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   His son's traffic stop was a curt reminder, Archer said, ``that
we happen to be people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what your name happens to be, what your
title happens to be, whatever the case may be,'' the mayor said.
``Doesn't matter.''

BP AMOCO TO CUT $4 BILLION IN COSTS AND SELL $10 BILLION IN ASSETS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ BP Amoco PLC, the newly formed petroleum giant,
announced ambitious plans Thursday to cut annual costs by $4
billion over the next three years _ double the previous target _
and shed $10 billion of assets, including low-profit oil fields and
refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the cuts was a surprise and went far beyond
reductions the company first envisioned when the $55 billion merger
of British Petroleum and Amoco was completed six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that is was going to be hard for them to do
anything beyond the promises they had already made,'' said Adam
Sieminski, an oil analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts almost certainly mean that the company will exceed its
previously announced goal of cutting 10,000 jobs from the
98,000-employee work force. Many of the jobs it already eliminated
were in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco officials would not specify how many additional jobs
might be cut, but said one of the first refining assets to be
divested would be its large Alliance Refinery in Louisiana. It
employs about 800 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Browne, the chief executive of the company, told
securities analysts at a meeting in London that the steps were
aimed at achieving a ``very significant improvement in underlying
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced it had discovered one of the biggest
untapped pools of oil in the Gulf of Mexico and said it would
sharply increase capital spending to total $26 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum shook the oil industry last year with its
acquisition of the Chicago-based Amoco, setting off a chain of
mergers that reflected the impact of weak oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Many large oil companies have concluded that the only way to
remain profitable is to combine. The Exxon Corp. and The Mobil
Corp. announced an $87 billion merger deal in December, which would
create the world's largest oil company. BP Amoco itself announced a
$27 billion deal to buy the Atlantic Richfield Co. in March. Just
last week, Total Fina SA of France began a $43 billion hostile
takeover offer for another big French petroleum business, Elf
Aquitaine SA.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, oil prices were languishing at $10 per barrel.
Although they have since nearly doubled to $19 a barrel, the
measures BP Amoco announced Thursday were aimed partly at preparing
the company for any new shocks. Browne told analysts that the cost
reductions were designed to make BP Amoco ``robust at $11 a
barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the planned savings by the end of 2001 would take
effect before any other cost-saving from the pending acquisition of
Atlantic Richfield.
</P>
<P>
   The BP Amoco news pushed up its shares by 2.6 percent to 1,292
pence in London, or about $20, valuing the company at more than
$195 billion and adding 11 points to the blue-chip FTSE 100 index,
where it has the biggest weighting.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the BP Amoco merger, Browne forecast annual cost
savings of $2 billion by the end of 2000, but said Thursday those
savings would be achieved more than one year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said the $10 billion in planned disposals included $4
billion from exploration and production, $3 billion from sales of
refineries and $2.5 billion in chemicals, where the company intends
to abandon low-growth activities and focus on fast-growing markets
in China, Korea and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Brown said, BP Amoco will move ahead with shedding
its Canadian oil interests, which are already on the market, and
its 64 percent stake in Altura Energy, an oil and gas producer in
Texas and New Mexico. But the biggest cuts are in refining.
</P>
<P>
   ``With worldwide refining capacity continuing to grow faster
than demand, our expectation is that the global refining margin
will average little more than $1 a barrel over the medium term,''
Browne said. ``Our aim, therefore, is to reduce our refining
coverage by around a third.''
</P>
<P>
   The reduction would drop BP Amoco's ranking among the world's
oil refiners from fourth place to eighth, according to figures from
Arthur Andersen consultants. The size of the cuts in refining was
the most surprising element in the cost-savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   The steep cutbacks also come at time when refining capacity in
the United States has become tight and has helped oil companies
strengthen their earnings. Frederick P. Leuffer, an oil analyst for
Bear Stearns, said that selling major assets like refineries would
allow competitors to pick up assets for low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Browne appeared to be unfazed by such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only wish to be involved in the refining business when we
cannot buy the supplies we need for our own marketing network at
reasonable prices,'' Browne said. ``We now have more refining
capacity than we need.''

STATE COURTS STRIKING DOWN LAWS THAT LIMIT LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct placement of quote marks in 4th graf of 2nd take.
No other changes.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a decade after states began enacting laws to cut back
big jury awards and curtail injury lawsuits, state courts across
the country are overturning one measure after another, concluding
that Americans have a powerful right to settle their disputes in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Top courts in states like Illinois, New Hampshire, Kentucky and,
most recently, Indiana on July 8 and Oregon on Thursday, have
relied on provisions of state constitutions like guarantees of fair
access to the courts to strike down all or part of the new laws
that were passed under the banner of ``tort reform.'' The new
liability laws make it more difficult to bring some suits and seek
to limit how much people can collect in accident, malpractice and
other injury cases.
</P>
<P>
   The highest courts of at least seven states have struck down all
or part of new liability laws in the last three years. Dozens of
new challenges to such laws are working their way toward state
supreme courts across the country, including in Wisconsin, Alaska
and Colorado, and a major decision is expected soon from the
Supreme Court in Ohio, which enacted a sweeping new liability law
two years ago. The cases focus on such state constitutional
guarantees of ``open courts'' or the right to a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   In this rancorous second phase of the battle over the liability
system, at least 87 decisions by state courts at all levels have
found flaws with laws that have been enacted since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state courts are invalidating huge parts of the tort
reform legislation to the consternation of supporters of tort
reform,'' said professor Mark Geistfeld of New York University Law
School. ``There is much more judicial hostility to this kind of
legislation than anyone was expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws have also been upheld by lower courts across the
country, with judges taking sides in one of the country's fiercest
but least noted legal wars. In a decision this January, the
Virginia Supreme Court, one of the few top state courts to affirm
the new laws recently, said a law limiting damages in malpractice
cases passed muster under that state's constitution. But legal
experts on both sides of the issue say the momentum is clearly on
the side of the critics of the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision Thursday striking down a law limiting to
$500,000 the amount of damages injured people can recover for pain
and suffering, the Oregon Supreme Court said that state's
constitution ``prohibits the legislature from interfering with the
full effect of a jury's assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case involving a man who was brain
damaged and partly paralyzed when a pneumatic nail gun
malfunctioned, sending a 3-inch nail into his skull. A jury had
awarded the man and his wife more than $2.8 million in damages for
pain and suffering on top of more than $7 million in other
compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The new liability laws, enacted in waves across the country
after intense lobbying by business groups, have tried various
approaches to limit what critics call frivolous suits that
unnecessarily tie up the courts and lead to outlandish awards.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups typically say limits are justified because of
what they call irrational verdicts, like the 1994 case of the
McDonald's customer who won a verdict of $2.9 million, later
reduced to $600,000, after she spilled scalding coffee on herself,
or the $4.9 billion verdict against General Motors last week in the
case of a fuel tank explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Business, professional, medical and other groups that have been
remarkably successful in pressing for liability law changes in the
legislatures of most states are incensed at the reversal of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only recently that the state courts have begun
second-guessing state legislatures,'' said Richard Willard, a
Washington lawyer who represented Union Pacific Railroad in the
Illinois case that struck down that state's broad law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really no basis for it,'' Willard continued, ``other
than an assertion of raw power by the courts to overturn the will
of the popularly elected legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates and trial lawyers say the business lawyers
are simply being forced to contend with the reality that the laws
stripped consumers of fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peck, legal director of the Association of Trial Lawyers
of America, who is coordinating several of the attacks on the laws,
said business groups had used political contributions to
effectively buy laws that immunized them from damage suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem they are having now,'' Peck said, ``is that these
laws frequently violate fundamental state constitutional principles
and the courts are saying so.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the legislatures in the New York region have been far
less aggressive in enacting new liability laws than most other
states, the significant court battles are not now in the courts in
New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Business lawyers said the national trend of decisions
invalidating the laws simply represents judges' coming to the aid
of the trial lawyers, who often use campaign contributions and
political clout to press their cause. Victor Schwartz, a Washington
lawyer who is one of the chief legal strategists for business
groups on liability issues, said the reversals in state courts were
the biggest threat in decades to what he calls liability reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trial lawyers' strategy,'' Schwartz said, ``is to find
obscure provisions of state constitutions or provisions of state
constitutions that have more rubber than Goodyear has in a tire to
allow a court to do whatever it wants to nullify the intent of the
legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The state courts are relying on provisions of state
constitutions like those giving citizens the ``right to a remedy''
in more than 35 state constitutions. Legal experts say many of the
provisions have received little judicial interpretation before.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the provisions have no parallel in the U.S.
Constitution. But even where there is similar language, like the
guarantee that citizens have a right to equal protection of the
laws, many of the decisions have been made on the state
constitutional grounds alone. As a result, state supreme court
decisions cannot be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   When striking down the liability laws, some courts use language
suggesting that they are offended by the legislation. In the 1997
Illinois decision, one of the most influential, the court said the
Legislature disregarded a century-long tradition concerning the
role of juries and the courts when it enacted a 1995 law, which,
among other provisions, limited damages to $500,000 to compensate
injured people for pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In a case brought by the family of a 20-year-old truck driver
who had been killed when a train smashed into his truck at a
railroad crossing, the court said the $500,000 limit violated the
Illinois constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Justice Mary Ann McMorrow said the law
``arbitrarily and automatically'' reduces the jury's award for a
lifetime of pain and disability, ``without regard to whether the
verdict, before reduction, was reasonable and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Some judges have expressed equally strong sentiments in
upholding the laws. In its decision in January, the Virginia
Supreme Court rejected the argument that a law limiting damages in
medical malpractice cases to $1 million violated the state
constitution's guarantee of a right to trial by jury.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the husband of a woman who died after she was
treated in an emergency room sued, claiming her condition had been
misdiagnosed. The jury agreed and set damages at $2.04 million. The
judge reduced the award to $1 million and the husband appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision written by the state's chief justice, Harry
Carrico, the court upheld the law, saying the husband had had a
jury trial. ``It is not the role of the jury but of the legislature
to determine the legal consequences of the jury's factual
findings,'' Carrico said, concluding that there was no violation of
the right to a jury trial merely because a plaintiff did not
receive the full amount the jury had awarded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Schwartz, who is the general counsel of the American
Tort Reform Association, a group pressing for liability limits,
wrote a scholarly article that was one of the first to identify the
trend of ``judicial nullification'' of the new liability laws.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, a former law school dean, said in an interview this
week that he had counted 87 decisions by state courts at all levels
that had declared all or part of new liability laws invalid in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   His article, published by the conservative Washington Legal
Foundation, has received wide circulation among business lawyers as
a harbinger of what some of them see as a kind of stealth attack on
the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   The article also identified more than 100 decisions upholding
the laws since the era of so-called tort reform began in 1983. But
Schwartz and other lawyers for business say the momentum is toward
declaring the new limits on lawsuits unconstitutional, with more
high-level state courts striking down more significant liability
laws recently.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision on July 8, the Indiana Supreme Court was presented
with a doctor's claim that a malpractice suit filed by a woman
suffering from breast cancer should be dismissed because it was not
filed within a new time limit of two years after the alleged
malpractice had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But as the court pointed out, in an opinion by Justice Myra
Selby, the heart of the suit was that the woman claimed the doctor
had misdiagnosed her condition. As a result, she said, she had not
discovered she had breast cancer until three years after she saw
the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   To enforce the law, the court said, would have meant the woman
would have been barred from court because she did not file her
malpractice suit at a time when she thought she was healthy. The
court said it would be unconstitutional to apply the law in that
case. Any other decision, Selby said, ``would be boarding the bus
to topsy-turvy land.''

CLINTON TELLS COLORADO YOUTHS HE'LL STAND FAST ON GUN CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mo.)   (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that he would veto
the juvenile justice bill if it emerged from Congress with
provisions that weakened existing gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not in any way, shape or form countenance a weakening
of the law,'' Clinton declared at the White House, standing in
front of 90 students from Colorado _ six of them from Columbine
High School in Littleton _ who are in Washington to lobby Congress
for gun controls that the Senate version of the bill would add.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that the Senate legislation also included a
weakening provision, eliminating background checks on people who
retrieve their guns from pawnshops. Even as he issued his veto
threat, though, Clinton said that he was not fully aware of what
else was in the bill and that ``the attorney general has to give me
a briefing on it before I can make a final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke after meeting privately with the students at
the White House. The students, organized by a gun-control group
that was formed in Colorado after the killings at Columbine in
April, have proved to be an unusual lobbying force.
</P>
<P>
   Most lobbyists come to Washington begging for a moment with
lawmakers, which both sides generally like to keep private. In this
case, these students have been sought out by politicians. Vice
President Al Gore went to the Capitol Thursday afternoon where he
and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., his party's leader, posed with them
after the president met with them at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The students also met with the six-member Colorado delegation in
the House, the state's two senators and more than two dozen other
lawmakers they had identified as possible swing votes on gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Some students acknowledged that they were being used as
political props but said that they were also accomplishing their
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get a group of kids who are as impassioned as we
are, it generates media,'' said Jared O'Brien, a 17-year-old from
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Gold, 28, an Internet consultant and one of the chaperones
of the group, said that the students discussed with Clinton how to
keep Congress focused on gun control now that Columbine has faded
from the news. He said the president's advice to the students was
to expand their numbers in Colorado, create similar groups in other
states and return next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was teaching,'' Gold said. ``He was explaining that
legislation is like turning an aircraft carrier, slow, saying we
need to be persistent and ask for the right kind of reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite pessimism about the bill, Clinton said it was not too
late for Congress to heed the students' message. ``Don't forget
Littleton,'' Clinton urged Congress. ``Don't allow the victims of
Columbine to have died in vain. Don't forget the 13 children who
die every day from gun violence. Many, many, many of them can be
saved. We must not lose the urgency of our mission.''

COLORADO STUDENTS IN CAPITOL URGE TIGHTER GUN CONTROL 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Congressional Democrats got
some help Thursday in their push for stricter gun control as
Colorado students, including several from Columbine High School,
descended on the Capitol to lobby lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the student group at the White House, Clinton
said lawmakers should put aside partisan differences and pass
legislation that would, among other things, force background checks
on those who purchase firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past three months the gun lobby has been calling the
shots on Capitol Hill, now it's time for Congress to listen to the
lobbyists who truly matter _ our children, the people who will be
most affected by what is or is not done by Congress,'' Clinton said
after meeting with the Denver-area student group.
</P>
<P>
   The latest push for gun control was prompted by the massacre
April 20 at Columbine High School outside Denver, which resulted in
the deaths of 15 people, including a teacher and the two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   But last month the House defeated gun legislation approved by
the Senate because of opposition by most Republicans and some
Democrats to a provision giving authorities three days to conduct
the background check. Republicans want to give authorities one day
to conduct the check.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders said they expect some gun-control
measures, such as safety locks on guns, to emerge from compromise
legislation that will eventually be hammered out by the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would reject any legislation that weakens
current laws but would not say how he would react to compromise
legislation that may emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The 90 Colorado students, who visited with Democratic House
leaders and with lawmakers of both parties, said Congress needs to
stop dawdling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders are not leading, and the representatives are not
representing,'' said David Winkler, a leader of the student group
called Colorado SAFE (Sane Alternatives to Firearms Epidemic).
</P>
<P>
   The students met later with House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., and Vice President Al Gore and urged them to use
their bully pulpit to ensure the passage of stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that he has spoken out frequently about the need for
gun control and took an indirect swipe at GOP presidential
contender Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that anyone in a position of leadership who has a
chance to change the way people think about an issue like this has
an obligation to do so,'' Gore said. ``And if you have that chance
you need to do that for the right purposes and not the wrong
purposes. We don't need new protections for the gun industry. We
need new protections for families. We don't need more concealed
weapons, we need more gun safety laws and strict access to those
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush signed laws allowing concealed handguns and
prohibiting municipal suits against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The students did not meet with the key Republican leaders who
control the agenda in the House, including Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert spokesman John Feehery said that no one asked his boss
for a meeting. Feehery said he expected that a compromise gun
measure would be part of legislation fashioned by House and Senate
negotiators. However, Hastert has yet to appoint House members to
the committee that must iron out differences with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Hastert blamed Democrats for the lack of
any gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is appropriate that these students are meeting with the
minority leader (Gephardt). Hopefully they can convince him to put
aside the partisanship and work with us to pass good legislation,''
Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   The students, six of them from Columbine, were not afraid to
confront lawmakers who did not share their views on guns.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with Colorado Republican Rep. Scott McInnis,
several disputed his contentions that it was important to protect
Second Amendment rights and that guns were needed for protection.
</P>
<P>
   One student told the congressman, ``if there weren't violent
people with guns you wouldn't have to protect yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kurtz-Phelan said the session ``turned a bit
confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the speech intending to blow us off,'' said
Kurtz-Phelan, 18, who just graduated from George Washington High
School in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz-Phelan said this lobbying experience has ``been a sobering
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to see the influence of special interest groups,
especially money,'' he said.

LOTTERY VICTIMIZED BY SCAM ARTISTS, AUDITOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Scam artists, cashing in on the state Lottery's lack
of financial controls, appear to have collected millions of dollars
in fraudulent winnings, according to a scathing report released
Thursday by state Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci.
</P>
<P>
   The audit portrayed a carelessly managed system in which many
scratch tickets were cashed by people using fake identification.
Lottery staffers often did not ask winners for identification _ as
required _ and did not pursue suspicions about winners who cashed
tickets dozens of times in a year, auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, 319 winning tickets worth $412,000 were cashed in a
year, all by a person, or people, using the name Clarence Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 most frequent winners cashed in 842 times for a total
of $1.8 million in 1998, DeNucci said. Five of those winners were
found to have used fraudulent names.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors suspect that professional ticket cashers, using the
bogus names, were cashing tickets for others so the real winners
could avoid paying taxes or other obligations like child support.
The ticket cashers would then receive a cut of the winnings,
usually 10 or 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DeNucci said the audit provides ``very, very strong''
indications that scam artists were aided by Lottery employees and
referred the report to Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, for
possible criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   . ``There is a strong possibility that there is some collusion
involved here, a strong possibility that there is an inside gimmick
going on,'' DeNucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have been passed to Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien,
who has trying to impose new, strict controls at the Lottery, which
generates $3.2 billion in annual revenue - two-thirds of it from
scratch tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate fraud. We will not tolerate abuse,'' said
O'Brien, who noted that operations in the state Lottery's regional
offices have been under scrutiny since she took office in January.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to suspicious multiple winners, DeNucci said the
audit found that:
</P>
<P>
   -- $7 million in withholding taxes from Lottery winnings is due
the state from 1,800 people who gave the Lottery ``undeliverable''
addresses when cashing in tickets.
</P>
<P>
   -- $2.2 million in 1998 winnings went to people with suspicious
identification, including fake names, Social Security numbers and
addresses. Some of the names included ``Chris Mis,'' ``Joe
Bellone,'' Dave Mograss,'' ``Nu Bank,'' and ``Kris Kristofferson,''
yet Lottery workers apparently never reported anything amiss.
</P>
<P>
   -- $15 million is owed the state by Lottery sales agents.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dozens of sales agents, owing millions of dollars, are
estimated to have moved to unknown addresses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Internal records for 29,000 winning Instant Game tickets
worth more than $600 each are incomplete, raising the possibility
of theft or abuse.
</P>
<P>
   -- Unsecured bundles of active scratch tickets were left
unattended in locations easily accessible to employees at Lottery
headquarters in Braintree.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, awaited since March and covering 1998, further dents
the already damaged reputation of former Treasurer Joseph D.
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, two Treasury managers were accused in the theft
of $8.9 million from the Unpaid Check Fund during Malone's tenure.
In addition, O'Brien last month fired a staffer in the Boston
Lottery office who allegedly stole $24,000 in scratch tickets. Two
employees are serving suspensions in that incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attitude problem in an entrenched bureaucracy,''
Deputy Auditor Robert Powilatis said. ``This is going to take a
long time to fix. It's like turning around the Queen Mary in the
Charles River.''
</P>
<P>
   DeNucci, a Democrat, blamed the administration of Malone, a
Republican, for the problems. Malone, who served from 1991 until
this year, oversaw a complacent office that ignored directives to
improve management, DeNucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone could not be reached Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   DeNucci said that Lottery staffers at offices that cash scratch
tickets must use a consistent, rigorous method of verifying the
identities of winners. Lottery staffers are required to ask for a
photo ID that shows a Social Security number. Although Lottery
managers were aware of the requirement, auditors said, employees in
the field appeared ignorant of it.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, said auditor spokesman Glenn Briere, winners were
not asked for any identification.
</P>
<P>
   The question of employee collusion must be investigated by
another agency, DeNucci said. In the most suspicious example, that
of 319-time winner Clarance Jones, the bulk of his tickets were
cashed at a Woburn office where only three employees regularly
handle claims.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clarence Jones of Lynn, auditors said, the name
could have been used by as many as 20 different people who cashed
tickets in the Woburn office. Briere said that Jones' name was
traced to a post office box in Lynn, had a matching Social Security
number, and had even been used to apply for credit. Any criminal
investigation, which would determine if such a person exists, would
be handled by the attorney general's office, they said.
</P>
<P>
   State auditors, who said they conducted the review with computer
technology installed in 1997, focused the study on scratch tickets
that paid between $600 and $5,000. In this range, tickets can be
cashed at one of the regional Lottery offices, and taxes do not
have to be deducted at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For winnings above $5,000, taxes are deducted from the tickets
before they are cashed at Lottery headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   DeNucci also blasted collection procedures at the Lottery, which
he said allows sales agents at stores throughout the state to
withhold payment for months at a time. When Lottery officials
visited one store in Taunton, they discovered no inventory for
$234,000 in scratch tickets and ordered him to repay the amount in
two days to retain his license.
</P>
<P>
   Powilatis said that the loss of millions of dollars in taxes
should be a major impetus for streamlining the agency. ``You need
to reengineer their minds to do their jobs,'' Powilatis said of
Lottery employees.
</P>
<P>
   DeNucci said that lax controls at Lottery sales offices became
apparent two years ago after his office was notified of a $597
theft at Braintree headquarters, where residents can buy tickets.
Further review has shown that $129,344 is unaccounted for in
Braintree, DeNucci said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien has also commissioned an independent audit of the
Lottery by the KPMG Peat Marwick accounting firm. The results of
that study have not been received, but preliminary findings led to
the discovery of the $24,000 in stolen scratch tickets.

MOSTLY A RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The way R.D. Hubbard tells it now, he had no
intention of becoming the boss of Hollywood Park when he bought
stock in the track in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't plan to become the most influential figure in
California racing _ perhaps in all of American racing _ in the
tumultuous decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a job I went after,'' Hubbard said Thursday on the
phone from a golf course in Park City, Utah. ``It just escalated.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason, Hubbard said, that his overwhelming emotion
is not sadness but relief as his 8{ years as Hollywood Park's
chairman and CEO end with the close of the track's spring-summer
meet on Monday. The 61-year-old facility will be operated by
Churchill Downs after the $140 million purchase announced in May
becomes final in August or September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of years were a lot of fun,'' said Hubbard,
64, the Kansas-born glass manufacturer who led the takeover of
Hollywood Park from Marjorie Everett in February 1991. ``But the
last few were frustrating. I came in thinking there were lots of
changes we could make, and then we ran up against (opposition). It
seemed like one thing would work, and something else we'd get a lot
of criticism for.''
</P>
<P>
   Swaggering, fun-loving and imaginative, Hubbard and his staff
did make lots of changes at the run-down track he believes was
heading out of business. They spruced up every corner of the 380
acres, beat back horsemen's protest to build the nation's first
trackside casino, breathed life into Friday-night racing and made
the Autumn Turf Festival a reason to attend the November-December
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance went up 11 percent in 1991 _ before suffering the
same slide as the rest of the racing industry. Company earnings
tripled in '92.
</P>
<P>
   When Hollywood Park hosted the best-run Breeders' Cup in 1997,
it showed the world ``The Track of Lakes and Flowers'' was back in
bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard's experimentation also produced forgettable failures
like the EZQ, the short-lived wager that required fans to merely
pick two of the top three finishers in a race, and unfulfilled
plans for a football stadium, music arena and police station on
track property.
</P>
<P>
   Other near-misses frustrated Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a lot more we could have done (with tracks)
working together,'' he said. ``Every time there's legislation that
would be good for racing overall, the greed factor kicked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard worries about the rapid changes at Santa Anita under
chairman Frank Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be facing a lot of tough times and
criticism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He worries about the potential for fights over racing dates as
Stronach battles Churchill Downs management in California and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope cooler heads prevail,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to see changes in the California-breds incentive
program. He's optimistic about the sport's future, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that as we go into the 21st century, there are more
positive things going on for racing than there have been in 25
years,'' including the consolidation of track ownership and the
spread of home wagering through telephone and online accounts,
Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks that if California permitted slot machines at
racetracks, as many states do, ``purse money could easily be
doubled or tripled.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard isn't getting out of racing. He controls Turf Paradise
in Phoenix and Ruidoso (N.M.) Downs. And he owns more than 400 head
of racing and breeding stock after buying into 200 horses earlier
this month with Rio Claro Thoroughbreds, the South American outfit
best known for 1996 Hollywood Gold Cup winner Siphon.
</P>
<P>
   So Hubbard will remain visible at Hollywood Park. Only he'll be
seen in the saddling paddock and not the executive wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall,'' Hubbard said, ``I think it's been a good ride.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: General Challenge will try to become the fifth
favorite in a row to win the Swaps Stakes for 3-year-olds on
Sunday, the second-to-last day of the Hollywood Park season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal-bred lowered his odds Tuesday by working 6 furlongs in
1:09 4/5 at Santa Anita _ 2 3/5 seconds faster than the morning's
next-best drills at the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any other horse, I would say it was too fast, but not for
him,'' trainer Bob Baffert said of the Santa Anita Derby winner.
``He does things I've never had any other horse do.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge (a troubled 11th in the Kentucky Derby) will
be ridden by David Flores in the 1[-mile Swaps when he faces Cat
Thief (third) and Pat Day, Desert Hero (13th) and Jerry Bailey, and
Walk That Walk and a jockey to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   __ Other highlights of closing weekend: Saturday's Hollywood
Oaks for 3-year-old fillies (including Excellent Meeting), and
``Super Sunday's'' Sunset Handicap on turf (River Bay, Lazy Lode)
and Hollywood Juvenile Championship for 2-year-olds (D. Wayne
Lukas-trained Exchange Rate, Richard Mandella-trained Dixie Union).
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar opens Thursday for 42 days.
</P>
<P>
   __ Turf war: Hollywood Park has affirmed its commitment to TVG,
the interactive racing network, by terminating its agreement with
Youbet.com, the online wagering service. Youbet took its last
Hollywood bets last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard said the $21,000 wagered daily through Youbet was
``extremely disappointing'' and said TVG ``offers a far superior
platform for our product.''
</P>
<P>
   But Youbet executive vice president and CEO Ron Luniewski noted
that the $1.1 million wagered on Hollywood races this season would
rank in the top 40 percent of the track's simulcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised,'' Luniewski said of Hollywood's
announcement. ``In the last five years, nobody has canceled a
simulcast contract through a press release.''
</P>
<P>
   Youbet began its marketing effort in January and claims 6,000
subscribers. TVG was launched Thursday and is available to C-band
satellite customers on GEI, transponder 23.
</P>
<P>
   __ Building suspense: Plans to add an entertainment arena and
dining complex to Santa Anita's Paddock Gardens following the
1999-2000 season will be revealed this morning in Arcadia.
</P>
<P>
   Work is underway on phase one of Stronach's changes, putting a
575-seat restaurant, 215-foot bar and dance floor in the clubhouse;
adding terraces to the track apron; enlarging the winner's circle
and installing a huge TV screen in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach calmed traditionalists in April when he said the
paddock and walking ring won't be moved, and the unique hillside
turf course will remain.
</P>
<P>
   New Santa Anita general manager Lonnie Powell took office on
Thursday.

INDEX FUNDS ARE A LITTLE LESS POPULAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Calif.)   By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the last few years investors have increasingly favored
mutual stock funds that track stock-market indexes, since few other
funds have done better.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of competing funds _ run by stockpickers who
try to beat the indexes _ has roared back this year, and investors
have begun cutting back their purchases of index funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of the year, about $3 of every $4 that
flowed into stock mutual funds went to an index fund. In the second
quarter, though, only about $1 of every $4 did, according to AMG
Data Services, which tracks mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a decline in total net sales, too, though much
milder. After a staggering $17.8 billion inflow in the first three
months of the year, index funds took in just $12.3 billion in the
second quarter, according to AMG. Their portion of new dollars fell
more drastically because total net cash flows to the stock mutual
funds tracked by AMG doubled in the second quarter. Fund industry
officials say the latest figure was depressed slightly by a
one-time shift in June of a large amount of money to an indexed
portfolio outside the fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds remain popular. Vanguard Group, the index-fund king,
took in nearly twice as much money as any other fund family in the
first five months of the year, according to the Financial Research
Corp. of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds are ``still taking in money faster than the average
equity fund,'' said Carl Wittnebert, director of research at
Trimtabs.com Investment Research in Santa Rosa, Calif. ``It's just
not as lopsided as it was a few months back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent slowdown has come as actively managed stock funds
have begun beating indexes for the first time in years. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 28.6 percent last year _
twice the return of the average diversified stock fund. In the
first quarter of this year, the S&AMP;P 500 rose 5 percent, while the
average diversified stock fund managed a measly 1.3 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, the improving global economy and nosebleed
valuations of some of the largest stocks in the S&AMP;P spurred
investors to step up purchases of cyclical stocks and
smaller-capitalization shares, providing an easier environment for
stockpickers to beat their benchmarks. As a result, about
two-thirds of mutual funds topped the S&AMP;P's 7.1 percent return in
the second quarter, according to Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the giant Magellan fund run by FMR Corp.'s
Fidelity Investments arm; Thursday the closed fund's assets hit the
$100 billion mark for the first time, benefiting from recent strong
performance and continuing contributions from existing
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adler, AMG's president, is not sure if a shift in
performance is the only factor at play or even whether index-fund
sales will continue to slow. It would be bad for the stock market
if the flows for index funds actually turned negative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures ``indicate a slowing demand for these funds from the
beginning of the year, but clearly the trend is not negative,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Mattes, a Vanguard spokesman, said: ``If anything is
predictable, it is that cash flows follow tremendous performance.
Indexing is a long-term strategy and one quarter, or a six-month
period, or even a year of relative underperformance against active
management is meaningless. Over the long term, indexing wins out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't buy yesterday's performance,'' he added, ``but
people want to do that.''

UPR CHAIRMAN ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>

By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jack Messman, who oversaw an aggressive
expansion at Union Pacific Resources Group, took the energy company
public, and led its unsuccessful bid to acquire Pennzoil, announced
his retirement on Thursday from the oil and gas exploration
company.
</P>
<P>
   Messman, 59, said he will become the chief executive of a
high-tech company in the northeastern United States, but he gave no
other details. Messman has a history in technology; he was
co-founder of Novell _ the Utah software company _ in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time for me, and the opportunity came out of
nowhere,'' Messman said just hours after UPR's directors had
accepted his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Messman's departure comes as the company's fortunes have turned,
thanks to a recent rise in the price of crude oil. During his eight
years at the helm, revenues nearly doubled to $1.8 billion, making
it one of Tarrant County's 10 largest companies. UPR stumbled last
year, losing nearly $900 million due to a big writedown of assets
as oil prices dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But as prices recovered, UPR rebounded, posting a first-quarter
profit this year of $42.3 million from continuing operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going pretty well for UPR, and this is a rather
surprising time for someone to leave,'' said analyst Kevin Boone of
the Bear, Stearns investment firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   UPR immediately named UPR President George Lindahl III to
succeed Messman as chairman and chief executive. Lindahl, who also
will retain the president's title, has been with UPR since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The change came as a surprise to the energy and investment
communities, even to Messman himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just moved into a new house last month, and now we'll move
again,'' Messman said of the Fort Worth home he shares with his
wife, Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market took the news calmly. UPR stock closed on the
New York Stock Exchange up 62 cents, at $16.06.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hadn't been any indication or advance warning that Jack
was about to make a change, but the appointment of George Lindahl
looks like a pretty normal progression,'' said analyst David
Garcia, of the Everen Securities investment firm in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Messman is not a lifetime oilman. He came to UPR in 1991,
succeeding Bill Adams, from USPCI, the hazardous waste subsidiary
of Union Pacific Corp. UP at the time owned Union Pacific
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Messman is a native of West Virginia, and was educated at the
University of Delaware and Harvard University's business school. He
was trained as a chemical engineer and has worked for Union
Carbide, the Somerset House publishing company, and Warner Amex
Cable in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At UPR, Messman pursued what he referred to as ``manufacturing
approach'' to energy, which essentially meant laying numerous wells
over formations for fast, voluminous extractions.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive strategy, particularly in the Austin Chalk
formation of South Texas where UPR pioneered the use of horizontal
drilling, increased UPR's production by an average of 17 percent
annually during Messman's years and made the company the largest
independent driller in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Messman oversaw the separation of UPR from parent Union
Pacific corp., owner of the railroad of the same name, into an
independent company.
</P>
<P>
   With the company now under his own control in 1996, Messman set
about to reshape the corporation's culture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the company moved from its headquarters to another
downtown Fort Worth location, and shifted from a traditional,
mahogany wall environment to an open, workstation arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   By then Messman already had adopted Friday casual dresscodes for
the 1,200 workers (a number reduced by about 400 when falling
energy prices forced a layoff late last year). Messman now allowed
casual dress each day of the week and jeans on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Messman also began new performance review systems, where
employees were rated not only by their superiors, but also by their
peers and by those under them.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked to impart more of a marketing approach to a
company whose industry long has been commodity-based.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to persuade people that we do have customers, instead
of just commodity users,'' Messman said.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of those efforts, UPR was named one of
``America's Best Companies to Work For'' by Fortune magazine in
1998. It also received a commendation from Working Mother magazine
for his programs for women employees.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Resources was a steady profit earner through
Messman's era until the price of crude oil plunged beginning late
in 1997 through earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frustrated me that the price of my company's product was
set by three or four people in the Middle East,'' Messman said of
OPEC, the oil producers' cartel that still exerts the largest
single influence over worldwide oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of his time at UPR, Messman was put on notice
by Wall Street of the need to expand the company's resources beyond
its traditonal base in Wyoming and Colorado and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Messman tried to buy Pennzoil of Houston in 1997, but his
unfriendly takeover bid of $84 per share was rejected. UPR then
paid $3.5 billion for Norcen Energy Co. of Calgary, Canada. The
purchase almost doubled UPR's resources base and made it a major
player in Canada, the offshore Gulf of Mexico, Guatemala and
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But it also laid heavy debt upon UPR at a time when revenues
began to erode because of the falling prices. For the last year,
UPR has had to spend more than $2 billion of its cash flow to pare
down debt.

EDITORIAL: BARAK COMES TO WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, July 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak winds up his first diplomatic tour as Israel's prime
minister with a long weekend of meetings with President Clinton
that began Thursday. The mood in Washington is upbeat and
encouraging, as it was during Barak's earlier meetings with Arab
leaders. Clinton welcomes Barak's aspiration to complete peace
agreements with the Palestinians and Syria. The two men will also
explore how America can help.
</P>
<P>
   Barak would prefer less direct U.S. participation in negotiating
and carrying out peace agreements. He wants Washington to return to
its former, less intrusive role while Israelis and Arabs find their
own way to peace. That is fine. America's involvement increased
under Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, when a long and
dangerous stalemate imperiled carrying out the Oslo peace
agreements. With Israelis and Palestinians unable to work out their
problems and unwilling to trust each other's promises, both needed
American help.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Wye River meeting, the White House helped devise
the formula for Israeli troop withdrawals from a further 13 percent
of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security guarantees.
The CIA also agreed to monitor Palestinian performance against
terrorism, including the handling of terrorist suspects by
Palestinian courts and prisons. Barak now wants the CIA to reduce
this monitoring role. That, too, is reasonable, though Israelis and
Palestinians should put new mechanisms in place to assure that this
chronically troublesome issue does not lead to renewed crises.
</P>
<P>
   Barak would also like to skip some withdrawals agreed to at Wye
and move directly to talks on a final settlement. Yasser Arafat is
reluctant to enter those talks with less than the 40 percent of the
West Bank the Palestinians would get under Wye. Barak, for his
part, hopes to avoid clashes with Jewish settlers over the Wye
pullbacks that could brake the current momentum toward peace. Both
arguments have merit. It would be best to carry out the withdrawals
unless Arafat agrees to bypass them. Debating how to move ahead is
a welcome change from trading blame for delaying peace. &QL;

Saturday. Instead, she spent the entire, excruciatingly thrilling
tournament on the bench, her hair spray-painted red, white and
blue, cheering her team and watching Briana Scurry, the starting
keeper. Webber's story is about persistence and defeat, three times
over, and finally, victory: being chosen second best. (Ozier

CABARET-BALKAN-FILM, 07-15 -- Goran Paskaljevic, the director of
``Cabaret Balkan,'' a film about people driven to violence and
despair by politics. Paskaljevic, who has long opposed Slobodan
Milosevic's regime and has expressed shame over the atrocities
committed by Serbian forces in Bosnia and Kosovo, still remains a
Serb, and, as such, he is expected to throw light on the collective
madness that has gripped a good many of his fellow Serbs of late.

DAVIS CUP LINEUPS HAVE SAMPRAS ONLY IN DOUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ History was in the air Thursday at the
Longwood Cricket Club, site of the first Davis Cup competition in
1900 and of a centenary quarterfinal between the United States and
Australia this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Pete Sampras, now a six-time Wimbledon champion and arguably
the greatest player in tennis history, will apparently not take a
singles role in the encounter between Davis Cup's two superpowers,
despite speculation that the United States had a secret weapon
waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't drag someone out on the singles court,'' said Tom
Gullikson, the U.S. captain. ``He wouldn't have come back on the
team if he felt like he was taking a singles spot away from one of
our other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson admitted that the decision to leave Sampras on the
singles sideline could end up backfiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, nobody will care,'' Gullikson said. ``If we lose,
everybody thinks I'm nuts and I get my head chopped off. But it's
better to have Pete Sampras back in the fold, even if just to play
doubles. It's better than nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a sudden injury to Todd Martin or Jim Courier, the
anchormen of the United States' first-round upset of Great Britain,
Sampras' role will be limited to doubles. According to Sampras,
Martin and Courier ``deserve to play singles'' because of their
sustained commitment to Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been in the same boat,'' said Sampras, who ignored
Davis Cup last year to concentrate on his ranking and on the Grand
Slams. He only decided to join the 1999 squad after Martin and
Courier's first-round coup rekindled his team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief noontime draw ceremony on the Longwood veranda, the
lineups of both teams, along with the schedule for the four singles
matches and one doubles match, were disclosed. In the opener on
Friday, Martin, playing the top singles slot for the United States,
will face 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, a replacement for the injured
Mark Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   The second singles match features Patrick Rafter, the two-time
defending U.S. Open champion, and Courier, the veteran scrapper who
pulled off pivotal upsets of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski in very
hostile territory in the opening round at Birmingham, England, this
year. The singles pairings reverse on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The best player on the podium, and the only one with a winning
record against Rafter, was not mentioned until it was time for the
doubles pairings for Saturday. Sampras will join Alex O'Brien
against another impromptu doubles tandem: Sandon Stolle, like
Hewitt a Davis Cup neophyte, and Mark Woodforde, a 33-year-old Cup
fixture whose usual partner, Todd Woodbridge, begged off because of
what John Newcombe, Australia's captain, called a confidence
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said he was not averse to using Sampras in singles.
But he said he had failed to convince Sampras that he could play
singles without slighting Martin, who indicated he would give up
his singles spot if Gullikson asked him to, and Courier, who made
it clear he felt he and Martin had earned the roles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``jumping on the bandwagon and carrying the flag''
after an acrimonious year's hiatus from Davis Cup duty, Sampras
stuck to his plan of tiptoeing back into the good graces of the
team's stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras had no qualms about returning to the top singles
role if the American squad reaches the semifinals. ``If we advance,
I would think I've showed Todd and Jim and the rest of the guys
that I am committed to Davis Cup,'' he said.

THE REIGN OF TERROR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)The director of the small nonprofit organization
where I work is absolutely impossible. She is controlling and has
poor management skills, and her mood swings result in unpredictable
tirades. As a result, we have high turnover at all levels. Our
board members are aware of the situation, but their attitude seems
to be that, as long as the work gets done, it doesn't matter how
the office is run. Any advice?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ouch. Since you presumably aren't in a position to play
therapist to your boss, or to give her a swift kick in the pants,
it's time to gather your co-workers to talk about your options _
keeping in mind, of course, that any action could leave you without
a job.
</P>
<P>
   You should discuss your perceptions of the problem, potential
strategies for solving it and possible fallout. ``You need to
operate as a support group for one another,'' said Daniel K.
Oestreich, co-author of ``Driving Fear Out of the Workplace''
(Jossey-Bass).
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the discussions degenerate into pointless
complaining, warned Renee Magid, president of Initiatives Inc., a
consulting firm in Fort Washington, Pa., that helps companies
balance employees' work and personal issues. ``Often, the biggest
problem is that everybody is very good at moaning and groaning,''
she said, but when it comes to doing something, they back off.
</P>
<P>
   Start documenting your boss's behavior, Ms. Magid said. ``Keep a
log so you have actual facts,'' she advised.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Foster Reed, author of ``The Toxic Executive'' (Random
House, 1994), agreed that the complaints must be specific. ``You've
got to know when the person said this or did this. No
generalizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard part, however, is deciding who is going to approach the
boss or the board. Everyone should be involved in the decision,
Oestreich said. ``There's the possibility that one person speaking
up will affect others,'' he explained. ``You need to be talking in
a candid way about who's going to do what.''
</P>
<P>
   In meeting with the boss, your emissary should make it clear
that he or she represents the entire group, Ms. Magid advised.
``You have a much better chance with a group involved,'' she said,
``because it can't be that everyone's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep the conversation professional, about business rather than
hurt feelings. Explain how certain actions are undermining
productivity. ``The idea is not necessarily to be accusing as much
as to say how this is impacting the organization and its people,''
Ms. Magid said.
</P>
<P>
   If the boss does not seems receptive, it's time to repeat your
presentation for the board members.
</P>
<P>
   The board may well have an incomplete picture of the situation,
Oestreich said. Outline for them the precise costs of your boss's
leadership failures.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how delicately you handle the issue, however, heads
may roll. So your best recourse may be to abandon ship. But if you
and your colleagues are committed to the organization and believe
in its future, your actions _ rational and organized _ may be worth
the risk. &QL;

   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ When the day mercifully ended, nobody who
had played Thursday could remember enduring a tougher first round
in the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred fifty-six of the world's best golfers teed off.
Nobody finished under par, and only one player, Rodney Pampling of
Australia, shot even par. The average score was 78.3 on a par-71
course. Fifty-five players finished in the 80s, while two finished
in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   The highest winning British Open score of the last 50 years was
Gary Player's 289, also at Carnoustie in 1968, but that mark is in
jeopardy. The last time that no golfer was able to shoot under par
during a round of the British Open occurred in 1986, at Turnberry,
Scotland, in both the first and third rounds. In the United States
since World War II, there has never been a round in the Masters and
the PGA Championship in which a golfer has failed to break par. In
the more difficult U.S. Open, it has happened 11 times since World
War II, with the last instance coming at Winged Foot in New York in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   All the pre-tournament talk about Carnoustie's being one of the
world's most difficult courses rang true, especially because the
7,361-yard bunker-laden course has been toughened for the Open. The
fairways are narrow, some only 15 to 20 yards wide, and from the
tee box they look as narrow as a hallway. And all of the fairways
are framed by thick, knee-high rough, deep enough to make a golf
ball disappear, along with any chance for victory.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend amateurs could relate to the inflated scores. Many of
the world's best players could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the average player had to play out there, he'd probably
quit the game _ a lot of pros, too,'' said David Duval, the world's
No. 2-ranked player, who shot an 8-over-par 79. ``When the guys
said 300 would be the winning score, everyone thought they were
crazy. You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   With the wind averaging around 20 miles an hour and gusting up
to 30, all the ingredients were in place to make players fall to
their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, the defending champion, shot an 83. Sergio
Garcia's first major as a professional became a major disaster as
he triple-bogeyed the first hole, finished with an embarrassing 89,
declined to comment before leaving the course, and bravely returned
several hours later to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The later it got, the wilder it got. Tiger Woods, who shot a 74,
was surprised on his final hole by a scantily clad woman who ran on
the green and gave him a kiss while he was trying to line up a
putt. Woods would rather have had a birdie than a kiss, but he took
the incident in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just put my ball down, all of a sudden I see these
feet,'' Woods said. ``I looked up, there she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the chaos was the competition. Even the leader
board was bizarre. Playing in his first Open, Pampling shot a 71
and led by one stroke over Bernhard Langer and Scott Dunlap. Seven
players were tied for fourth place at 73: Justin Leonard, the 1997
British Open champion; Hal Sutton; Dudley Hart; Paul Lawrie of
Scotland; Len Mattiace; Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe, and Steve Pate.
</P>
<P>
   Pampling and Langer took advantage of their early tee times
(7:25 a.m.), as did Dunlap (8:05 a.m.), finishing some holes before
the wind was at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   Pampling, a 27-year-old native of Queensland, started the week
having to introduce himself to many players. He ended the day
leading them. Who would have thought? But it was that kind of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun,'' said Pampling, a 30-year-old who has
won just once on the Australasian Tour, where he plays regularly.
``I was enjoying the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others did not. All of these formidable players finished at
79: Duval; the reigning U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart; the 1995
PGA Championship winner Steve Elkington, and this year's U.S. Open
runner-up, Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   The par-4, 474-yard No. 9 was the most difficult hole today,
with an average score of 4.73. There were four birdies on the hole,
62 pars, and 90 double-bogeys or worse. Jim Furyk, who shot a 78,
double-bogeyed No. 9, as did Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the right club to hit was an adventure. How much of a
factor was the wind? On the par-5, 515-yard No. 14, which played
downwind, Woods hit a 4-iron off the tee, then reached the green
with a 7-iron. Think about that.
</P>
<P>
   But playing into the wind on the par-4, 459-yard No. 17, Woods
hit a 2-iron off the tee, and when he followed that shot with a
3-wood from the fairway, the ball landed well short of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, any trip into the rough was a possible ball-searching
expedition. ``You might find a few players with injured wrists at
the end of the week,'' said Colin Montgomerie, who shot a 74.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III (74) double-bogeyed No. 12, when he took a mighty
swing at a ball buried in deep rough, and the ball moved about
three inches.
</P>
<P>
   Having won two U.S. Opens, Stewart is not one to complain about
courses. He complained about this one. ``I do not think these
conditions will recognize the best player,'' Stewart said. ``The
landing area where you have to lay up on No. 6 is 11 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we trying to do here? It's a great championship, it
means a lot to me, but I'm just sorry everybody is coming off the
golf course having these opinions. This is a wonderful golf course
played a little bit wider. You know you're going to have wind, so I
don't understand it. It could actually be a place where people wish
they'd missed the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart might. But Thursday's game plan was to avoid shooting
oneself out of the tournament. Players like Duval and Stewart
seriously hurt their chances. Anyone who shot 75 or better had a
strong day.
</P>
<P>
   They will do it again Friday, and with the wind not expected to
die down, expect more of the same. Somebody will ultimately win,
but their scorecard will look ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, recalling this year's U.S. Open, said: ``It was
only 30 days ago that we were saying Pinehurst was the hardest
course we ever played. We're all changing our opinion.''

BANK CHIEF HINTS AT POSSIBLE BOOST FOR EURO 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a move that helped push up the sagging
value of the euro against the dollar, the head of the European
Central Bank signaled Thursday that it might toughen monetary
policy in the not-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, president of the central bank, said the bank
might tilt toward an increase in interest rates if the supply of
credit and money in Europe continues to expand robustly.
</P>
<P>
   Though he stopped well short of announcing a change in policy,
Duisenberg said that ``a bias may be creeping into our
considerations'' and that ``a reassessment might be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks helped nudge the euro up about a half-cent against
the dollar, reaching $1.024 in European trading Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks marked a small but significant shift by the bank,
which has been watching Europe's new single currency sink about 13
percent against the dollar since it was introduced on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The currency's weakness has become a source of embarrassment and
concern among the 11 nations that adopted the single currency.
There had been widespread expectations that it would strengthen in
value fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Duisenberg and other European central bankers have
repeatedly refused to do anything to prop up the value of the euro,
even as it has drifted down from nearly $1.18 at its introduction
to nearly a one-to-one parity with the dollar last week.
</P>
<P>
   Though Duisenberg said nothing new about the euro's exchange
rate Thursday, higher interest rates would represent a tightening
of the monetary spigots and would put upward pressure on the euro's
value.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The comments on Thursday marked a new turn in the central bank's
delicate dance between promoting the euro's credibility in world
markets and promoting a recovery in Europe's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the sharp slowdown in industrial production and
exports toward the end of last year, the bank reduced its baseline
interest rates on April 8 to 2.5 percent from 3 percent. That
reduction followed an earlier cut imposed simultaneously by all the
individual banks in the 11-nation euro-zone last December, just
before the euro came into formal existence.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was hovering around $1.02 before Duisenberg spoke this
afternoon after a meeting of the bank's board of governors.
</P>
<P>
   For months, bank officials have publicly asserted that they were
not concerned about the euro's decline, because it merely reflected
Europe's slower economic growth and still had considerable
``potential'' for moving higher.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg reiterated that line Thursday. ``We believe that the
euro is firmly based on internal price stability and therefore has
potential for a stronger external value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated conclusions in the bank's July monthly bulletin,
saying the signs of economic recovery have become more numerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``While signs of recovery are still modest and are not yet
reflected in labor market developments, recent data appear to
confirm the outlook for a continued improvement in the course of
the year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg said the new ``bias'' toward higher rates reflects
strong growth in the money supply and in the volume of new credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If money and credit growth increase further, a reassessment
may be appropriate,'' Duisenberg said. But, he added, he had no
regrets about the last decision to cut rates.

 &HT;    Cruise plays latest risky role with eyes wide open
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Tom Cruise has enjoyed a seemingly charmed
career. The two-time Oscar nominee has more than $1 billion in
box-office receipts to his credit and commands $20 million per
film, making him one of Hollywood's top guns. He produced the
blockbuster ``Mission: Impossible,'' in which he starred, as well
as last year's ``Without Limits,'' the critically acclaimed film
biography of Olympic runner Steve Prefontaine.
</P>
<P>
   The latter title could easily apply to Cruise himself. The
37-year-old actor surmounted a difficult childhood and a brief
association with Hollywood's ``Brat Pack'' to become a superstar.
In 1990, he married beautiful Australian actress Nicole Kidman, his
frequent co-star, with whom he has two adopted children, Isabella
and Connor.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few stumbles, such as the fantasy flop
``Legend'' and the meandering immigrant saga ``Far and Away,'' but
Cruise appears to have made all the right moves. Like Prefontaine,
he's confident, disciplined and driven by a strong personal
commitment to excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to believe in yourself,'' Cruise said at a press
conference in September at the Toronto Film Festival, where
``Without Limits'' premiered. He was discussing whether he ever
faced self-doubt. ``Things seem like they can't get any worse _ I
say, `Well, things can't get any worse, so let's keep going.' It's
got to get better at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise's best performances usually have involved the greatest
risk, like when he abandoned his cocksure screen persona to play
paralyzed Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone's ``Born on the
Fourth of July,'' which earned Cruise his first Academy Award
nomination. Author Anne Rice denounced his casting as the cruel and
seductive Lestat in ``Interview With the Vampire,'' only to take
out a full-page ad in ``Variety'' to rave about Cruise's
performance after she screened the film.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest chance of his career _ Stanley Kubrick's highly
anticipated psychosexual thriller, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' _ emerges
today from under a shroud of secrecy. Cruise refused to discuss the
production at the Toronto press conference, except to say that
``filming `Eyes Wide Shut' was an extraordinary experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is Kubrick's first since 1987's ``Full Metal Jacket,''
as well the last from the legendary director of such films as
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``Dr. Strangelove'' and ``A Clockwork
Orange''; he died in March at age 70. The plot, which was
deliberately withheld from the media per Kubrick's instructions,
was inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella, ``Dream Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' also sees Cruise resurface for the first time
since his Oscar-nominated turn in 1996's ``Jerry Maguire.'' The $65
million film's scheduled 18-week shoot mushroomed into 52 weeks
over 15 months, during which Cruise, who had reduced his usual
salary to work with Kubrick, passed on a number of other projects
and reportedly developed an ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   His health problems might be attributed to the emotional demands
of his character, a wealthy New York physician who explores the
dark side of his sexual nature after learning that his wife, played
by Kidman, was once strongly tempted to have an extramarital
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick presented ``Eyes Wide Shut'' to Cruise, Kidman and
Warner Bros. executives Bob Daly and Terry Semel five days before
his death. The director's contract gave him final cut, but the
Motion Picture Association of America insisted on a ``digital
adjustment'' before it would issue an R rating, according to
Variety. To skirt an NC-17, digital characters have been
strategically imposed over the action in a large-scale orgy scene.
</P>
<P>
   Such a depraved setting is probably the last place one would
expect to find Cruise, whose All-American good looks,
million-dollar smile and earnest demeanor portray him as a fairly
regular guy to whom audiences can easily relate.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV on July 3, 1962 in
Syracuse, N.Y. As a boy he suffered from dyslexia and from the
breakup of his nomadic family. His father, an itinerant electrical
engineer, dragged Tom, his mother and his three sisters to at least
a dozen different cities _ including Cincinnati, where Tom attended
a Franciscan seminary. He settled in Glen Ridge, N.J., after his
mother remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise used his athletic ability as a means to fit in and didn't
discover acting until a knee injury forced him to quit his
high-school wrestling team. He dropped out during his senior year
to move to New York City, where he struggled through auditions and
night classes while barely supporting himself as a busboy and
maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
   He made his film debut in 1981 with a fleeting role as an
arson-prone teen-ager in ``Endless Love,'' followed by his
appearance the same year as a trigger-happy cadet in ``Taps.''
Cruise would establish himself in coming-of-age movies such as
``Risky Business'' and solidify his star status in escapist action
fare such as ``Top Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   His rich characterization of an arrogant young pool player in
Martin Scorsese's ``The Color of Money'' proved him to be a serious
actor who could hold his own alongside screen legend Paul Newman.
He did the same with Dustin Hoffman in ``Rain Man'' and Jack
Nicholson in ``A Few Good Men,'' consolidating his credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise's weaker films, such as ``Cocktail'' and ``Days of
Thunder,'' have often presented little more than slight variations
on his cocky persona. It's when he has dug deep under the surface
of such characters, as in ``Jerry Maguire,'' that Cruise has
shined.
</P>
<P>
   Having completed ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Cruise will return to
theaters with a vengeance. He recently wrapped production on
``Magnolia,'' the new film by ``Boogie Nights'' director Paul
Thomas Anderson, due in December. Cruise signed this week to star
in ``Death Race 3000,'' Anderson's remake of ``Death Race 2000,'' a
1975 Roger Corman film about race-car drivers who get points for
running down pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Mission: Impossible 2,'' he will reprise his role as Ethan
Hunt, who must recapture and destroy a deadly German-manufactured
virus before it falls into the wrong hands. Cruise produced the
action thriller, which is being shot in Australia by John Woo and
is due Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer Cruise will star in ``Minority Report,'' a sci-fi
action thriller directed by Steven Spielberg. Mark your calendar
for June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love movies, plain and simple,'' Cruise said in Toronto. ``I
enjoy making them. The process of it can be very difficult. Every
day is different. And working with the people that I've had the
opportunity to work with, I feel that I've learned a lot from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that I've realized that I could do in my
situation is that whatever amount power and responsibility I carry
is to channel them in a way that allows me to hopefully make good
films. That's always been my goal.''

 &HT;    Low-voltage, solar lighting easy to install
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There are few projects that can be done quickly
and inexpensively that have as much impact around the house as
installing outdoor lighting.
</P>
<P>
   By working a few hours and spending less than $100, you can
dramatically change the look of your property and improve its
security at the same time. It costs a bit more to step up from
basic plastic light fixtures to sturdier designer models, but the
time investment still will be low.
</P>
<P>
   The most common landscape lights are low voltage and are a snap
to wire. And for a little more money, you can have solar-powered
lights that require no wiring at all.
</P>
<P>
   Low-voltage lights
</P>
<P>
   While your inside lights run on 120-volt circuits, outside
accent lights typically function on 12 volts. Low-voltage lighting
systems consume less energy and are safer and easier for a
do-it-yourselfer to install and maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fixtures that can run on 12 volts are floodlights to
light large areas and spotlights to illuminate individual objects
or architectural features, as well as lights for paths, ponds and
steps. A trip to a lighting or home-improvement store will give you
an idea of your options.
</P>
<P>
   Decide where you want the lights to go, what type you'll need
and where the power supply will be. Draw a simple map of your
planned layout and measure distances to determine how much power
cord you'll need.
</P>
<P>
   The main component of a low-voltage light system is a
transformer. This device attaches to the main house current and
converts it to the lower voltage.
</P>
<P>
   Like all outdoor-lighting components, transformers come in a
wide range of prices. But because it is the heart of a lighting
system, it doesn't pay to skimp on a cheap transformer. And, of
course, the more lights you plan to use, the more power capacity
you need in the transformer.
</P>
<P>
   If your needs are basic, you can buy an inexpensive kit that
comes with a transformer, light fixtures and wiring. You can find
kits with eight to 10 lights for less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can build a custom system by buying individual accent
lights and a transformer. Prices for individual lights vary, but
they start at around $20.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Johannes, an electrical specialist at the Lowe's store near
the Dayton Mall, said the best way to install low-voltage lights is
to position all the lights and run the wiring to connect them.
Don't bury the wires yet.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching fixtures to the power supply is very simple. Most
fixtures come with clamps that have electrical contacts that
automatically punch through the coating on the power supply wire.
You ordinarily don't have to do any cutting and splicing.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until dark to see how the lights look, Johannes said. If
you're satisfied with the arrangement, come back the next day and
conceal the wires. Low-voltage wires don't have to be deeply buried
like 120-volt lines do. A one-inch-deep furrow or a layer of mulch
is all it takes.
</P>
<P>
   If the wires are accidentally cut (such as by a hoe or lawn
mower), they may deliver a mild shock but nothing dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the wires, you may want to run them close to the
foundation of your house.
</P>
<P>
   They also can be tucked against the edge of a sidewalk or
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Solar-powered lights
</P>
<P>
   In the past, solar-powered lights tended to be dim and
unreliable. With advances in technology, they've become brighter,
more dependable and relatively cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Solar-powered lights also have become easy to find. Both
Wal-Mart and Lowe's, for instance, carry at least one brand that
can be attached to a wall or driven into the ground with a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Solar-powered landscape lights collect energy from the sun
during the day and release current at night to illuminate a bulb.
The ones I've seen for sale locally use LED (light-emitting diode)
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The length of time the light stays lit depends on the brightness
of the sun. But even on an overcast day, solar-powered lights store
enough power to stay bright through the evening.
</P>
<P>
   A basic solar-powered light costs about $20, which is
considerably more than a basic low-voltage light in a kit.
Low-voltage lights don't use much electricity, so they're
inexpensive to run. Solar-powered lights don't cost anything at all
to run.
</P>
<P>
   The major advantage of solar-powered lights, though, is that
they don't require any wiring; each light fixture is self-contained
and doesn't need to be connected to a power source.
</P>
<P>
   That means you can easily place a set of solar-powered lights at
the far corner of your property where it would be impractical to
run a power line.
</P>
<P>
   Another outdoor-lighting project that will improve the security
of your home is replacing an outdoor fixture, such as one on a back
porch or garage, with a motion- or light-sensor fixture.
</P>
<P>
   A traditional porch or garage light is only on when you turn it
on, so it provides no security if you forget to turn it on every
night.
</P>
<P>
   A motion-sensor fixture turns the light on when it detects
motion nearby, such as an intruder approaching the porch. A light
sensor turns the light on at dusk and off at dawn. You can find
either kind starting at around $20.
</P>
<P>
   To replace a light fixture, start by cutting power to the
circuit. Go to your house's main service panel or fuse box and turn
off the circuit breaker or remove the fuse corresponding to the
room or garage where the light switch is located.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to the light fixture and carefully take off removable
shades and light bulbs. The fixture should be held to the wall with
screws. Remove the screws and pull the fixture a few inches from
its bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Use a circuit tester to confirm power has been cut to the
fixture before using a screwdriver to disconnect the electrical
leads.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the electrical leads separated, attach them to the new
fixture in the same way they were attached to the old one. The
replacement light fixture will have screws and other hardware to
hold it in place.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ So you've stumbled across a gorgeous old coffee
table being used to display knickknacks at a neighbor's garage
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the chest of drawers Grandma Schwartz left you is

   ``Not to worry,'' you think. ``I'll just refinish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, refinishing is rarely an easy or simple process.
It's messy, complicated, sweaty work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize how much elbow grease this is going
to take,'' said Ralph Swigart Jr. of Swigart Refinishing Co. in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   If you're determined to make an old piece of wooden furniture as
attractive, valuable and useful as possible, you should take a
research trip to the library or bookstore and interview people who
have done it before.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Daily News talked to Elma Hyatt and Mike Cole, who
run American Heritage Furniture Stripping and Refinishing in
Dayton, and Ralph Swigart Sr. and Ralph Swigart Jr. of Swigart
Refinishing, to gather insights on what the job entails.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage refinished a 150-year-old oak writing table Hyatt found
at a yard sale to demonstrate techniques the company uses, and the
Swigarts showed us the work they did on a client's dining room
chair that probably is about 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   And the word is ``sanding.'' Expect to do a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   To strip or not to strip
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're thinking of reselling a piece at some point and you
think it might have the original finish on it, you definitely
should not strip it,'' said Ralph Swigart Jr. Retaining the
original finish on an antique generally enhances its value. Do what
you can to maintain the finish without removing it.
</P>
<P>
   Cole pointed out that some pieces were painted over an original
finish while some other pieces were painted directly on the bare
wood. In cases where the bare wood was painted, stripping will not
remove color that has seeped into the wood itself. You won't be
able to use a clear finish after stripping, but you can repaint to
give an attractive new surface.
</P>
<P>
   Stripping
</P>
<P>
   The Swigarts use a stripper the consistency of a light paste
that sticks to surfaces as it is applied. Similar thick-bodied
strippers are available where refinishing supplies are sold. They
apply the paste with brushes, monitor the project closely to see
when the old finish loosens, then work off the old finish with
burlap rags. ``A common mistake people make is applying stripper
then walking away to wait while it works,'' said Ralph Swigart Jr.
``You have to keep right on top of it or the stripper can stay on
too long and streak the wood.'' Swigart workers use tools to
carefully work the finish out of crevices. Fine steel wool followed
by burlap bags help remove stubborn finishes. Sometimes more than
one application of stripper is needed. After the stripper, the
piece is cleaned with denatured alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   At American Heritage, furniture is stripped in a continuous
stream of liquid stripper. A pump pushes the stripping solution
containing methylene chloride through a hose and it comes out
through the bristles of a brush that is used to rub until the
finish loosens. As in home applications of stripper, the liquid is
collected after use to be used again.
</P>
<P>
   Strippers are generally harsh, somewhat caustic chemicals. Wear
gloves, use them in a well-ventilated area and follow other label
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Sanding
</P>
<P>
   As wood becomes wet in the stripping process, the fibers absorb
water and the grain opens, Cole said. Sanding closes and smooths
the grain. He starts with a 120 grit sandpaper if the wood is
roughened or scratched and advances to a finer 320 grit to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Swigart Jr. said it's OK to use an orbital sander on flat
areas, but he said it's best to do most of the sanding by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Repair
</P>
<P>
   If the piece has loose joints or legs that don't sit solidly on
the floor, remove the screws or other hardware holding the piece
together and gently tap the joints apart with a soft mallet. ``Mark
each piece carefully so you'll know where it goes when you put
things back together,'' Swigart said. Fill small cracks with wood
filler that matches or is slightly lighter than the surrounding
wood. It's easier to darken a light-colored filler with a stain to
match its surrounding than it is to lighten a dark-colored filler.
Cole also had to replace a piece of missing wood veneer on the
writing table. Carefully glue and clamp broken pieces. Consult a
furniture repair book on techniques for clamping and strapping
furniture to hide repairs and make it sturdy. Sand again to smooth
repaired surfaces and remove any stray glue. Vacuum the piece and
use a tack cloth to remove sawdust residue.
</P>
<P>
   Color
</P>
<P>
   To see what the piece will look like without color, wipe it a
damp cloth, Cole suggests. If you're satisfied with the wood's
natural color, you can skip ahead to sealing.
</P>
<P>
   The dining room chair done by the Swigarts was stained with a
traditional red-brown mahogany stain. They use an oil-pigmented
wiping stain applied with rags and small brushes to reach into
crevices. ``Apply it and wipe it out evenly with clean rags,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sealing
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to seal the wood to protect the wood and the
stained color. To get a rich color, a deep glow and a smooth
surface, you'll probably need to apply several coats of sealer,
sanding between each coat. ``The more porous the wood, the more
sealer you'll need to apply,'' Cole said. ``Oak might take three or
four coats while maple may seal nicely with one or two.'' Both
Swigart and American Heritage apply sealer using fine-mist spray
equipment, but nonprofessionals can get good results with a paint
brush and clear shellac or varnish. A 2-inch brush for broad
surfaces and a 1-inch brush to reach smaller areas are common.
</P>
<P>
   Sealers come in a variety of compositions with various
properties of durability, shine, water resistance and so on. Spend
some time with a knowledgeable salesperson in a paint or furniture
refinishing retailer and read cans carefully to pick the sealer
that best suits your needs.
</P>
<P>
   After applying each coat of sealer, you must let it dry then
sand it smooth with very fine sandpaper. The amount of times needed
for drying depends on the sealer you use, the ventilation in your
work area, humidity and other factors. Both American Heritage and
the Swigarts use 400 or 600 grit sandpaper at this point. After
sanding each coat of sealer, wipe the piece down with a tack cloth
to remove sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   Final coat
</P>
<P>
   The sealer coats typically will dry to a high gloss, but most
people prefer a softer glow for their old wood furniture. ``They
don't want an antique to look like they just bought it at Elder
Beerman,'' Cole said. The finishers use products that have been
designed as final coats with satin or semigloss shines, and you
should be able to find similar products at your refinishing supply
retailer. Before applying the muted sheen coat, make sure the
shinier sealer coats are perfectly smooth. A light rubdown with
0000 steel wool followed by a tack cloth is not a bad idea. Then
apply the finish coat. Some people will apply two or even three
layers of finish coat, drying and sanding between coats.

ELIZABETH ARDEN PLANS AN IMAGE MAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Elizabeth Arden Co. received some alarming news earlier this
year when it heard the results of a study of consumer attitudes
about its company and the beauty industry.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Lubin Lawrence Inc. found that most women were
turned off by the industry's dictates, that they considered the
industry's view of beauty unreal and unattainable, and that all the
advertising looked alike. Worse, said Peter England, Arden's
president and chief executive, the study found women saw the beauty
industry as irrelevant to their lifestyles, and they had little or
no relationship with brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry had a huge focus on glamour, but over time
people's view of beauty has changed,'' England said. ``Crudely, the
view has gone from `I do it for him' to `I do it for myself.' The
self is much more important.''
</P>
<P>
   For Arden, which has been struggling in a slow market dominated
by giant Estee Lauder Cos., it was a wake-up call. Now as part of
huge $50 million corporate makeover, Arden will redefine its image
in an unconventional new advertising campaign, telling women that
beauty comes from within, not from a jar.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Arden will use that message to offer a host of
products to help women find that inner beauty _ colorful lipsticks,
new fragrances and special skin-care products.
</P>
<P>
   Themed ``Embrace yourself,'' the campaign offers a single image
for the brand that will be used for all Arden products around the
world. New products _ the lifeblood of the industry _ will be
introduced inside the ``Embrace Yourself'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gutsy move,'' said Allan Mottus, editor of The
Informationist, a beauty industry trade publication. ``Arden is
trying to set up a dialogue with the consumer and create more of a
subliminal trust thing. Quite honestly, I think it's needed in the
industry; a lot of customers are turned off by the hard sell and
one new product after the next.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, a division of Unilever HPC North America, which had
done all its advertising in house for nearly 15 years, in April
appointed J. Walter Thompson, New York, a unit of WPP Group PLC, to
create the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Thompson campaign begins in August with a blind teaser
campaign on bus shelters and billboards in New York, Los Angeles
and Chicago. A single word in lower-case type, such as
``fearless,'' ``sweetheart'' and ``leader'' appears in black type
against a white backdrop, but the ``ea'' of each word is in Arden's
signature red. Two weeks later in mid-August, a second set of ads
will finish the words in a sentence, such as ``I am the fearless
girl my mother warned me about'' and ``I am the leader of my own
free world,'' and identify Arden as the messenger.
</P>
<P>
   National print ads breaking in September beauty and shelter
books use the same minimalist style but will also carry a
black-and-white photograph by Carter Smith, a hot, young fashion
photographer. The models in the ads represent various ethnicities
and ages, and the photos are unretouched, journalistic-style
pictures, not the industry's traditional highly stylized glamour
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our casting call was for real women,'' said Ed Evangelista,
the art creative director on the campaign with Chris D'Rozario,
creative director-copy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ads shows a woman laughing, the fine lines around her
eyes clearly visible, and the headline reads: ``Free your mind and
your beauty will follow.'' An ad to run in Cosmopolitan has the
headline ``My best feature is my big beautiful sexy brain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are no longer aspiring to society's ideal of the moment,
they want to feel and look their best at any age,'' said Teresa
Russell, Thompson management director.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has long played on women's insecurities about their
looks and age. But the research showed that while in the past women
wanted cosmetics to cover and mask imperfections, today they want
makeup and skin care ``that bring out my natural best,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is aimed at women ages 25 to 55. The younger women
are always needed to replenish the customer base, but Arden, which
was founded in 1910, does not want to lose its older customers
either, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of each ad is the Elizabeth Arden name and its
longtime red door logo shown as a minimalist red rectangle. TV
spots as part of the multimillion-dollar campaign will air during
the holiday period beginning in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.2 billion prestige beauty market, which includes skin
care, cosmetics and fragrances sold in better department stores,
grew just 3 percent last year, according to NPD Research, Port
Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder Cos., which also owns Clinique and other prestige
brands, has 44.9 percent of the market, and has widened its share
in recent years, said Amy Low Chasen, a Goldman, Sachs cosmetics
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The Estee Lauder brand is the leader with an 18.1 percent share,
followed by Clinique, with 17.6 percent and Lancome with 12.3
percent. Arden is the seventh-largest brand, with 3 percent, and
Ms. Chasen said that share had been slowly declining in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Arden has also been active on the new products front, and will
introduce several in the new campaign. The first, called Millennium
Energist Revitalizing Emulsion, uses soy technology to treat aging
skin. Another, Lip Lip Hooray, is a lipstick that promises to fight
bad breath.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arden will continue running its image campaign, along
with the product ads, to tap into the heritage of the Arden brand
name, said England, who helped revitalize the Ponds business with
image and technical advancements.

 &HT;    Legal note: Dupri tries to beat the rap
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Fayette County judge wants to lock up a millionaire
rap music star for dodging jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Chris Edwards found Jermaine Dupri in
criminal contempt of court and sentenced him to three days in jail.
Dupri, whose legal last name is Maudlin, remains free while
appealing the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Both the judge and the rapper declined comment Thursday, but
Edwards expressed himself with vigor in a May 13 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me if Mr. Maudlin was a brain surgeon or
whatever he does. If somebody doesn't show up for jury duty then
everybody is deprived of justice,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri's lawyer, Michael W. Tyler, said the rapper made an
innocent mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri showed up for the first day of jury duty March 1 and was
excused for March 2 with the rest of the jury pool. Dupri, assuming
Edwards would grant him a waiver from the rest of jury duty, left
town to perform March 3 at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, Tyler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette judges granted Dupri waivers three times previously,
Tyler said. But Assistant District Attorney Jim Hardin said Dupri's
lawyers were told in August, when the last waiver was granted, not
to ask for any more.
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual for judges to put jury no-shows in jail. Usually a
judge sends a deputy out to find the missing juror, said Fayette
District Attorney Bill McBroom.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri, 26, lives in the northern tip of Fayette County, where he
shares a neighborhood with heavyweight boxing champion Evander
Holyfield, Chris Kelly of Kris Kross, singer/songwriter Kandi
Burruss of R&AMP;B quartet Xscape and LaFace Records executive/producer
Tony Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri made his first million before he turned 21 as the producer
of Kris Kross, a preteen rap duo. He has since written
million-sellers for Mariah Carey (``Always Be My Baby''), Usher
(``You Make Me Wanna'') and himself (``Money Ain't a Thing'').

   A Way to Give It Before You've Got It &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chris Evans sold Accipiter, a 22-month-old maker of
software that manages banner ads on the Internet, to CMG
Information Services for $55 million and joined the ranks of
Americans with enough cash to become philanthropists. Now Evans,
33, has invented a way to help other entrepreneurs get into giving
while their companies are young.
</P>
<P>
   They will be able to give some private shares in their start-ups
to the Entrepreneurs Venture Fund, advised by Evans and others and
associated with the Triangle Community Foundation in the Raleigh,
N.C., area.
</P>
<P>
   Then other donors, called ``investors,'' will lend some of their
money to the fund, linking it to the value of the shares. The
start-up owners will choose the causes that get the money.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when start-up companies are sold or go public, the fund
will turn its shares into cash, presumably at a profit. First the
fund will pay back the investors, who must use the money for other
giving. Any profit will go to the fund or to the start-up owners'
favorite charities.
</P>
<P>
   So what's in it for the investors? Not profit; the money they
get back will be pledged to charity. They will invest in the idea
of philanthropy itself by helping to recruit new givers.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Cohen &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working for the Fun of It &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger Berman, the investment company, calls it
``surprising'' that the more money people make, the less likely
they were to say in a survey it sponsored last spring that they
would quit their jobs if they received a windfall inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Among earners of less than $125,000 a year, 54 percent said
they'd quit, while only 28 percent of those making $250,000 or more
would. But if job satisfaction rises as one climbs the ladder, it's
hardly surprising that those with high earnings are more likely to
love what they do. Or perhaps the result confirms what many at
drone level suspect: that the more money you make, the more fun it
is to go to work.

INSTANT ALLURE FOR THE PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY FIT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The AIV Roadster is a purist's car, meant for one thing:
driving,'' Danny Panoz warned, obviously anxious that a test driver
might write critically about his baby's lack of creature comforts.
</P>
<P>
   The $62,500 Roadster is, indeed, ill-suited for a night at the
opera _ or, for that matter, a trip to the market. It takes some
practice to climb over the door sill and plop into one of the low,
low bucket seats without looking like an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   The vestigial doors are too fragile to use for leverage. And the
seats are too narrow for comfort, unless you have the general
physique of Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject of convenience, the Roadster has no
room for a glove compartment; the only place to store a map or an
insurance card is the Velcro-fastened door pocket. And then there
are the windows _ or, rather, the lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadster is designed to be driven without top or windows. A
cloth and plastic contraption, rather like a pup tent, is stored in
a duffel bag in the diminutive trunk and can be used to cover the
occupants in a hailstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadster comes with both air-conditioning and a sound system
with a CD player. But without a roof (or a muffler that can quiet
the engine below a roar) their presence is largely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Panoz need not have worried. For anyone who likes
fierce acceleration; quick, precise steering, and the glorious
thunder of a 305-horsepower V8 will love the Panoz Roadster. You
may care less that this car can go from zero to 60 in 4.5 seconds _
faster than an Acura NSX, a BMW M coupe, a Corvette or a Porsche
911 Carrera.
</P>
<P>
   But almost anyone with a pulse will get a kick out of its
appearance, a playful yet polished cross between a 1930s
Mercedes-Benz racer and a 1950s dragstrip bad boy. In my
experience, no vehicle has attracted more oohs and aahs from
attractive members of the opposite sex. Well, maybe the gull-winged
Lamborghini Diablo, which costs almost four times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Up close and personal, there is much more to the Roadster than
an oversized engine and a pretty face. The superrigid chassis is
made largely of aluminum (AIV stands for ``aluminum intensive
vehicle''), a first for an American car.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed stick shift from Borg-Warner is as slick and
precise as the transmission on a BMW. And the engine, a
dual-overhead-cam, 4.6-liter V8 from Ford, with an aluminum block
and 32 valves, is proof that Detroit can still come up with the
right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The real fun begins when you turn the key. The engine rumbles
(but doesn't vibrate) like a racing machine's. Shove the shifter
into first, ease off the clutch and the car explodes off the line.
Shift to second and before you can blink, the Roadster is howling
at 50 mph near the red line. Amazing what 300 foot-pounds of torque
can do in a vehicle that weighs just 2,570 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The handling, with slightly excessive power steering, requires a
little getting used to. But it never disappoints. In fact the car's
exceptionally wide track, light weight, low center of gravity and
superwide tires on 18-inch wheels create a feeling of omnipotence,
a somewhat dangerous impression that the Roadster can take any
curve at any speed.
</P>
<P>
   The disk brakes, with their oversized vented rotors, are a
proper counterpoint to the explosive acceleration. Thus, while this
delightful beast is probably no match for a 12-cylinder Ferrari at
three-digit speeds, I expect it could hold its own on a mountain
road with any street-legal car in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Beefs? Apart from the limited amenities, just a handful. The car
lacks air bags and antilock brakes, taking purism a step too far.
And the cockpit is so narrow that the only way to hold the wheel
properly is to rest your elbow on the door. This could prove
awkward in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, the Roadster offers one perk
that is exceptional in a car this exotic: In a pinch, virtually any
Ford dealer can repair the drivetrain. And with proven, durable
parts largely derived from high-end Mustangs, maintenance should be
reasonably cheap. &QL;

AT PANOZ, DAYS OF WINE AND ROADSTERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., W.Va., Calif., Fla.)   (af)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what does the nicotine skin patch have to do with wine, golf
champions and, yes, really cool sports cars? Royalties from the
transdermal patch have helped to pay for the Panoz family's
delightfully decadent conglomerate, a host of enterprises that
includes Georgia's only serious winery and the company that builds
a car Parnelli Jones has dubbed ``the great American roadster.''
</P>
<P>
   The story really begins in the backwaters of West Virginia,
where Donald Panoz, the son of an Italian-born professional boxer
was born. By his late 20s Don Panoz, an entrepreneurial sort, had
acquired a couple of drugstores in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1960, with financial backing from friends who played for
the World Series-winning Pittsburgh Pirates, he started Mylan
Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company that would become a power in
the generic drug business.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling the dice again in 1969, he took his wife, four daughters
and son to Ireland to start another drug company, this one
pioneering in transdermal delivery of medications. He struck gold:
The Elan Corp.'s market capitalization is now close to $8 billion;
it was in the news this month after scientists at one of its
subsidiaries said they had developed a potential vaccine for
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia connection dates from 1981, when Panoz was scouting
locations for a new facility for the drug maker. The ever-restless
entrepreneur decided to combine pleasure with profit, and in the
process managed the nearly impossible: making potable wines from
European varietal grapes grown in the hot, humid hills of the
mid-South.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Elan's first offerings were marketed in 1985. An art
gallery, hotel, golf courses and conference center followed in
short order on the 3,300-acre site in Braselton, 35 miles north of
Atlanta. Next came a spa and a line of bottled waters (both
projects of Donald's wife, Nancy), along with the Gene Sarazen
World Golf Open.
</P>
<P>
   And what would a great golf course be without a lot of affluent
retirees and weekend duffers camped near the fairways? Building
lots in the Panoz-sponsored development start at $75,000, and
finished houses run $1 million or more _ real money in the Atlanta
market.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to think small, Panoz has since bought 33,000 acres of
undeveloped land near Modesto, Calif., with plans to offer a
similar package of winery, golf and indulgences to San Franciscans
with quality time and money to burn.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the cars: For all his fascination with the
consumables of the good life, Panoz has never admitted any
enthusiasm for fast iron. Indeed, he once told a reporter that he
didn't know how to open the hood of his Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   But his son, Danny, is definitely a gearhead. While working with
the family business in Georgia, he dreamed of building a
high-performance sports car. Others have climbed this mountain
without success, partly because the finished product was too
expensive to sell at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Panoz planned to make his car both affordable and reliable
by purchasing most components off the shelf from the big auto
makers.
</P>
<P>
   He got his chance in 1989, adopting an innovative chassis design
from a tiny, failed Irish sports-car startup called TMC opening a
modest factory down the road from Chateau Elan. The first vehicle
from Panoz Auto Development, a somewhat austerely finished open-top
roadster that Danny Panoz describes as ``perfect for bikers,''
rolled off the assembly line in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   With an outlandish hot rod-retro body reminiscent of the
all-show, not-much-go Plymouth Prowler, and a monster Ford V8 for
muscle, the Panoz Roadster was bound to turn a few heads. And of
course, it graced the covers of car-buff magazines with lots of
pages to fill each year.
</P>
<P>
   But curiosity quickly morphed into respect, with the early
reviews ranging from encouraging to ecstatic. Car and Driver called
it ``the best street-legal, turn-key, cottage-industry roadster
available in the United States.'' Today, a few dozen Ford dealers
sell a more refined version of that original Panoz Roadster, and
many more can service it, since the drivetrain comes largely from
the Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Danny Panoz started Phase 2 of his operation,
designing a less playful-looking and far more polished ``grand
touring'' sports car with plenty of room for two well-fed Americans
and even a trunk that can handle a couple of sets of golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum-bodied Esperante convertible, with a 320-horsepower
V8 from Ford's Special Vehicles Team; a handcrafted, heavily
leathered interior, and styling cues from Jaguar and a half-dozen
other European sports cars, is set to go on sale later this year
for about $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Esperante will almost match the performance of a
12-cylinder Ferrari, yet cost $200,000 less,'' Danny Panoz
promised. The people in Armani suits from Maranello may not be
losing much sleep over the competitive threat from rural Georgia.
But the auguries are promising.
</P>
<P>
   This story hardly ends here. In 1995, Papa Panoz, who was about
to retire as chairman of his pharmaceutical house, was searching
for another challenge. He decided to plunge into the race car
business with all the enthusiasm, smarts _ and deep pockets _ that
he had brought to Chateau Elan.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz Motorsports hired Adrian Reynard, the racecar designer, to
build a carbon-fiber car, and Jack Rousch, the maven of sports car
engines, to produce the innards for a vehicle that superficially
resembles the Esperante. It added a team of drivers recruited from
racing's top echelons and instantly became a power to reckon with
in the take-no-prisoners world of motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz race cars hold their own with the best from McLaren,
Ferrari and BMW, placing 7th and 11th at Le Mans last month. And
they are pushing the envelope of racing technology, developing the
first electric-gasoline hybrid car for the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``This much success, this quick, is just amazing,'' said Brock
Yates, an automotive writer whose books include a biorgraphy of
Enzo Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Does racing make economic sense for the Panoz dynasty? The money
spent on vroom and zoom largely come from multi-millionaires with
too much time on their hands, or from oil, tire, auto and cigarette
companies with mass-market products in need of racing's reflected
glory. Think of Cadillac, now heading back to Le Mans.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million-plus that Don Panoz admits to spending on his
racing program will no doubt sell a few more Esperantes. ``Building
successful race cars gave our sports cars instant credibility,''
his son said.
</P>
<P>
   But with that kind of money, you could probably convince NASA to
launch an Esperante into orbit. If there is any commercial method
to Panoz's racing madness, it's probably in the sale of tickets
rather than cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Don Panoz purchased Road Atlanta, an ailing track in
Georgia, and Sebring, the legendary race circuit in Florida. With a
few home-team winners, Panoz Motorsports may yet fill the
bleachers. And who wants to second-guess a man who made a fortune
on the nicotine patch? &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ From Mario Garnero's penthouse office in a
skyscraper he built here, the view invokes the way Mario de
Andrade, Brazil's modernist writer, once described this city _ ``a
great mouth with a thousand teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost every direction, crops of steep structures jut out of
the concrete in a show of the magnitude of Sao Paulo, the
third-largest metropolis in the world, after Tokyo and Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   But Garnero, 61, a business tycoon with interests ranging from
waste treatment to telecommunications, plans his newest and
grandest venture for a spot eclipsed by this jagged skyline, in the
decrepit, neglected downtown district where the city's first
high-rises were built in the 1920s. There he hopes to build the
world's tallest skyscraper, 1,622 feet high. Modeled on the Vedic
temples of India, it would surpass the 1,483-foot Petronas Twin
Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building will be the symbol of Sao Paulo's new era, of a
post-industrial Sao Paulo in a league with the world's great
cities,'' Garnero said.
</P>
<P>
   To compete with tallest-building projects that are planned or
under way on other continents, Garnero, a tall man himself, with a
penchant for pinstriped suits, is teaming up with the investment
arm of the followers of the Indian-born guru, Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi. The Maharishi Global Development fund, whose assets are
gathered mainly from contributions by practitioners of the guru's
twice-a-day meditation methods, has agreed to be the main investor
in the project, with a role in overseeing its design.
</P>
<P>
   The Maharishi fund and Garnero hired Minoru Yamasaki Associates,
the architectural firm based in Rochester Hills, Mich., that
conceived the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting design for the 103-story Sao Paulo Tower, unveiled
in May, has stirred up a tempest. Stylistically, it has nothing in
common with the postmodern skyscrapers erected here during the
relative economic calm of the 1990s, nor does it resemble the drab
high-rises of earlier decades, many of which seem better suited to
Eastern Europe under communism than to subtropical southeastern
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Sao Paulo Tower, which will look something like a
layered pyramid with ornate touches, will be hotels, offices,
residential apartments, a convention center, a university and,
during the workday, about 50,000 people, Garnero said. At the top
will be a restaurant within a golden crown.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the surprise expressed by some architects over the
unusual design, most critical views center on the project's
contribution to a troubling trend _ the confining of more and more
aspects of public life within buildings. In crime-plagued Sao
Paulo, better-off residents increasingly retreat into gated
communities and guarded shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fortress, a mega-intervention in a city dying for
public space,'' said Raquel Rolnik, an architecture professor at
the Catholic University of Campinas.
</P>
<P>
   Another well-known expert, the urban planner Jorge Wilheim,
said, ``We need this building like we need a hole in our head.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Brazilian architects defend the project, saying it could
bring new creative energy and international attention to Sao Paulo.
``This building would catalyze popular hope,'' said Edison Musa,
the president of a national association of architects and chairman
for Latin America of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban
Habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Musa likened the Sao Paulo Tower to American skyscrapers,
including the Empire State Building, that were finished during the
Depression. ``It is an affirmation of our national capacity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has long had faith in the idea that the design of its
buildings and cities can bring positive change. This thinking was
behind the construction 40 years ago of a new capital, Brasilia,
deep in the savannas of the country's interior. And just as the
inventors of Brasilia have defended their creation from criticism
that it is artificial and sterile, so the architects of the Sao
Paulo project stand by their design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a cookie-cutter repeat of other tall
buildings,'' said Henry Guthard, senior vice president of Minoru
Yamasaki. ``When seen silhouetted against the sky, this building
will be striking.''
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy unfolds over the building's design and its
eventual impact on the city's crazy-quilt sprawl, a more urgent
issue presses: financing. The Maharishi fund, which manages assets
of roughly $600 million, is committed to raising money through
donations, borrowing and returns on its investments to provide half
the estimated $1.6 billion needed to complete the building.
</P>
<P>
   If construction is to begin as planned in January, the fund's
managers and Garnero will have to drum up the other half quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is currently so expensive that one has to wonder where
they will get it,'' said Daniel Citron, the chief financial officer
of Brazil Realty SA, a large developer of commercial real estate
here. Indeed, many people in Sao Paulo's real estate industry have
expressed doubt whether the project can get off the ground at a
time when domestic interest rates for real estate lending are above
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions about the supply of tenants, given the
market's doldrums as the country just begins to emerge from
recession.
</P>
<P>
   If the project is built, there are chances it will not retain
the title of tallest building for very long. Investors in Shanghai;
Taipei, Taiwan, and Melbourne, Australia, are also competing to
erect the world's tallest building.
</P>
<P>
   A real estate firm in Chicago, where the Sears Tower reigned as
the world's tallest until 1996, unveiled plans last month for
another contender, although, at 1,537 feet, it would be shorter
than Garnero's.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't kept Garnero from knocking with gusto on the doors
of potential partners. He hopes to interest Brazilian investment
firms and pension funds that have invested in other developments in
Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the attention attracted by the project has helped
renovate the public image of Garnero and his business empire,
gathered under the merchant bank Brasilinvest. Brazil's highest
court recently cleared Garnero of accusations of fraudulent
financial transactions in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the Maharishi fund are confident about the
plans. ``There are always people who think small,'' said Benjamin
Feldman, a member of the fund's board who is responsible for its
activities in Latin America. ``Any great endeavor is criticized by
people who have no understanding of it.''

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Every step of the way, it seems, Bruce
Springsteen has managed to produce the perfect songs and perfect
lyrics for the soundtrack to Matt Facendo's life.
</P>
<P>
   Facendo, 39, grew up in Hazlet, a Jersey guy like Springsteen.
His dad worked in a factory; so, too, did Springsteen's. He
escorted his younger brother, Doug, to his first Bruce Springsteen
concert, in Pittsburgh, when Doug was 12. He became a father just
as Springsteen was writing lyrics about the wonders of fatherhood.
And Facendo went through a bitter divorce _ just as Springsteen did
_ scathed, but full of appreciation for the small and precious
things in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can identify with him so much,'' said Facendo, a salesman
for Sears. ``He was writing songs about the emotional distress he
was going through, and you can identify with that. He's not better
than you when it comes to emotional or psychological problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Facendo wasn't the only one who was identifying with Springsteen
on Thursday. In fact, there were thousands of people who descended
upon the Continental Airlines Arena, right in the heart of the
swamps of Jersey, to absorb the first of 15 sold-out Springsteen
shows and, presumably, to make the kind of intimate connection with
Springsteen that few performers can hope to achieve in a big-arena
setting.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of statistical posterity, of course, it should be
noted that there are many things about the 15-show stint from
Springsteen and the E Street Band that can be described as big, as
mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he will surpass the Grateful Dead as the leading
draw in the history of the arena. The 15-night run will be the
longest by a single artist, eclipsing Springsteen's own record of
11 shows in 1992. And the show figures to be one of the
biggest-grossing concerts of the summer, if not in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But these were not the kinds of conversational tidbits that
could be heard in the parking lot of the arena Thursday afternoon,
the kinds of things that attracted people of different generations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with Springsteen songs oozing from every other car,
there was the distinct sense that this was more, perhaps, than just
a concert: It was about appreciating the good times, waxing
nostalgic and sharing wistful thoughts about how Springsteen _ and
by extension, everyone in the crowd who aged with him _ had changed
over years, and that nothing, nothing, should be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a decade, after all, since Springsteen
toured with the E Street Band, and there is no telling when, if
ever, they will perform together again on such a tour. Springsteen,
who turns 50 in September, has not had a big hit in many years; he
has not even released an album with new material in quite some
time. And he has written about changes in his life with the kind of
sharp details that a painter could appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, Springsteen's fans understand mortality in a way
that they didn't when they were 19,'' said Charles Cross, editor of
The Rocket, a music magazine based in Seattle, and author of book
about Springsteen called ``Backstreets'' (Harmony Books, 1989).
``They find an appreciation for the moments where you can transcend
your life. There are a lot of pressures in life, so any time you
can have escapism in its purest form, people savor that.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which runs the
Meadowlands sports complex, set up a mini-boardwalk in the parking
lot before Thursday night's show, with volleyball courts, carnival
games, food stands and a deejay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think that we brought a little bit of the Jersey
shore here to the Meadowlands,'' Helen Strus, a spokeswoman for the
New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, told The Associated
Press. Springsteen first made his name playing in Asbury Park and
other places along the New Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   Fans snatched up 308,000 tickets for the East Rutherford shows,
from Thursday through Aug. 12. After he finishes this run at the
arena, Springsteen will become the No. 1 selling artist at the
Meadowlands, selling more than 1 million tickets for all his shows
since he opened the arena in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen and his band arrived after wrapping up a 17-city
European tour. After they finish the New Jersey shows, they'll move
on to Detroit, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia.

HEALTH OFFICIALS SUSPEND USE OF VACCINE TO PREVENT INFANT
DIARRHEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for complete writethru to recast, add that drug maker is
suspending drug shipments. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal health officials Thursday recommended that doctors
immediately stop using a vaccine recently recommended for all
infants to protect against rotavirus, the most common cause of
severe diarrhea in infants and young children.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it
took the extraordinary action because a program that monitors
vaccine side-effects suggested a link between the drug, licensed
last year, and 20 cases of a painful blockage of the bowel called
intussusception. The disease, which can in rare cases be fatal,
affects an estimated 3.5 million children in the United States a
year.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products Corp. told Reuters Thursday that it had
temporarily suspended shipments of vaccine, RotaShield, which is
made by a subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst of St. Davids, Pa. American Home
Products also said it had sent letters to doctors informing them of
the CDC report.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no conclusive evidence that the vaccine causes
the bowel condition, CDC officials said the data are so strongly
suggestive of a link that they considered it prudent to advise
halting rotavirus vaccinations at least until November, by which
time a new study of the vaccine will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should now be giving rotavirus vaccine to anyone,''
said Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the centers.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has no enforcement power, and its call for a suspension
is only a recommendation. But doctors generally follow such
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was developed at the National Institutes of Health.
One million infants have received the vaccine, Douglas Petkus, a
spokesman for Wyeth-Ayerst, said Thursday. He said the company was
cooperating with the federal officials looking into the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Rotavirus vaccine is injected three times: at 2, 4 and 6 months
of age. Infants who have already received one or two shots should
not receive another, CDC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration licensed the product on Aug.
31, 1998, as the first vaccine against rotavirus, which is said to
be the biggest diarrheal killer of children around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of bowel obstruction were noted in the experimental trials
that were required for the vaccine to be approved, but not in
unusual numbers. As part of the approval, the FDA required further
studies to monitor the incidence of blockages among the infants who
received the vaccine. The CDC used information from those studies
in deciding to recommend a halt to the rotavirus vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the CDC said they hoped to better understand how
much risk is posed by the vaccine through a study the agency, based
in Atlanta, has undertaken with health officials in 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vaccine is still licensed by the Food and Drug
Administration,'' Dr. Melinda Wharton, a CDC epidemiologist and
expert on childhood vaccines, noted in an interview. ``It is a
highly effective vaccine, and we don't want to take this disease
prevention tool away from practitioners in the United States unless
there is a real good reason to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has also been approved for use in most European
countries but has not been marketed there because Wyeth-Ayerst
lacked a sufficient supply, Petkus said. He said the company would
now postpone marketing the vaccine there until the risk was
clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Intussusception is rare and of unknown cause, although some
studies have hinted at a link to other viruses. The condition
results when a portion of bowel slides inward, like a telescope,
into another part of the bowel. In severe cases, a previously
healthy infant suddenly screams in paroxysms of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Other symptoms include persistent vomiting and a bowel movement
that contains blood or appears black. A doctor often can feel a
knot from the telescoped bowel and make a tentative diagnosis.
Confirmation comes from giving a child a barium enema and then
taking X-rays of the region.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the enema itself can straighten out the telescoped
bowel. But in others, surgery is required. Of the first 15 cases
investigated, eight infants underwent surgery to repair the bowel.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should immediately call a doctor if a child develops
symptoms of the disease, CDC officials said. The agency also
alerted doctors to consider the possibility of bowel obstruction in
an infant who has recently received rotavirus vaccination.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Concern about the rotavirus vaccine arose about four weeks ago,
when an epidemiologist noticed an unusual number of intussusception
cases in seven states, Dr. Wharton said.
</P>
<P>
   The reports came from doctors, Wyeth-Ayerst and parents. After
sorting out duplicate reports and confirming that the cases were
intussusception, a CDC team began to see a consistent pattern in
the timing of the bowel condition in relation to the vaccination,
Dr. Wharton said. The bowel condition seems to develop about one to
three weeks after the vaccination is given.
</P>
<P>
   Two other reports also stirred concern, one from officials of
the Minnesota Health Department, the other from doctors at Northern
California Kaiser Permanente who are conducting a post-licensing
safety study for Wyeth-Ayerst, Dr. Wharton said. Those reports also
suggested an increased risk of bowel blockages.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC then joined with health officials in 15 states to
undertake a study involving more than 2,000 infants. The study is
expected to be completed by October, when a committee on
immunizations that advises the CDC holds its next regular meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The advice to suspend use of the vaccine until November reflects
the seasonal nature of rotavirus infection, which usually occurs in
the winter and spring. Each year, rotavirus sends 50,000 American
children to the hospital and kills 20.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the RotaShield vaccine is the latest in a
string of misfortunes for Wyeth-Ayerst and American Home Products.
The company, the subject of two failed merger attempts last year,
recently pulled several other of its drugs from the market after
health concerns were raised. And last month it announced that its
second-quarter earnings would not meet analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how investors would react, given that American
Home Products made its announcement about the vaccine after the New
York Stock Exchange had closed Thursday. Shares of American Home
Products, which is based in Madison, N.J., closed Thursday at
$54.875, down 12.5 cents.

SUSPECT'S FAMILY SAYS LAWMEN TRICKED THEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
and MARIA LUISA PEREZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The mother, sister and brother of accused serial
killer Angel Maturino Resendez said Thursday that U.S. lawmen
``betrayed'' them because they thought there was an understanding
that he would not face the death penalty in Texas if he
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   But the written agreement that led to the surrender says nothing
about capital punishment, and even Mexican government officials
were dubious of Maturino Resendez's claim that he thought he would
not face the death penalty if he surrendered on Texas soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were upset and crying,'' said Allen Tanner, who
represents Maturino Resendez, 39, and talked with his family
members before they visited him in jail. ``They feel like they have
been betrayed. They're going to the Mexican Consulate and will try
to convince them to help convince the district attorney's office
not to seek the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, he told a judge
Wednesday that his real name is Angel Maturino Resendez.
</P>
<P>
   Family members helped broker the deal with Texas Rangers that
led to Maturino Resendez's surrender Tuesday in El Paso. He is
charged in Harris County with the burglary of the home of Dr.
Claudia Benton, but is expected to be charged soon with her murder.
</P>
<P>
   The rail-riding fugitive has been charged with one murder in
Hughes Springs, Texas, is a suspect in five others in the state,
including two in Harris County, and has also been linked to
killings in Illinois and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner and his co-counsel, Rudy Duarte, met Thursday with
Maturino Resendez's brother, Florentino Resendez, a pastor; Manuela
Maturino Resendez, the sister credited with helping to negotiate
his surrender; and his mother, Virginia Resendez Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said all three think they were tricked into convincing
Maturino Resendez to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were totally convinced he would be treated `humanely' and
they don't think that includes the death penalty,'' Tanner said.
</P>
<P>
   But a copy of the written agreement shown to the family does not
include the word `humanely' or mention capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The two-paragraph document, which was faxed to the Texas Rangers
who were dealing with the family, mentions only that Maturino
Resendez can have two visitors at a time while in jail and will be
given a psychological exam. It is signed by Harris County District
Attorney John B. Holmes Jr., dated July 12 and is conditioned on
his surrender to Texas authorities within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, the 5-foot-7 Maturino Resendez appeared
briefly before James V. Garrett Jr., a senior criminal law hearing
officer, who advised him that the 1963 Vienna Convention gave him
the right to contact Mexican authorities about his case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials later confirmed that Maturino Resendez had been
advised of that right while in El Paso, but lead prosecutor Devon
Anderson said she wanted to make sure it was on the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to cross every `t' and dot every `i' with this guy,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez remained silent while Garrett told him of the
right, and he signed a form acknowledging it. He reportedly added a
small star alongside his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Rodulfo Figueroa, the Mexican Consul General in Houston, said
Thursday they had not heard from or contacted Maturino Resendez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was asked in El Paso, Texas, if he wanted to contact the
Consulate there and he gave a negative answer,'' Figueroa said.
``This was confirmed to me by Armando Ortiz Rocha, the Consul
General in that city.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa said consulates do not generally intervene in the U.S.
legal system unless the defendant asks for help, which can take
several forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the lawyers call us asking for help to bring
witness, family or friends from Mexico,'' Figueroa said. ``Other
times they just need some documents. It is up to the defense to
establish which kind of help would they ask from the Consulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said he hopes that Mexico will present legal or
diplomatic arguments to help Maturino Resendez
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa said Mexico has stated many times that it does not
agree with the death penalty but respects the laws of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Figueroa said, ``In different times, each time an execution
is imminent, Mexico has expressed its disagreement with the death
penalty. But the United States law is the one that rules here.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa also expressed disbelief that Maturino Resendez did not
know he could be exposed to the death penalty if convicted in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that one of the consequences, when a capital
murder is proved, is that the suspect can receive the death
penalty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa said he didn't know why Maturino Resendez surrendered
on U.S. soil, and he declined to speculate about what kind of legal
dilemma could have developed if he had been captured or surrendered
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Maturino Resendez was charged with capital murder
in Cass County for the October slaying of Leafie Mason in the East
Texas town of Hughes Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County is holding him on the Dec. 17 burglary of the West
University Place home of Benton, who was stabbed, raped and beaten
to death. West University is an affluent enclave of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are not going to charge him with capital murder in
that case until they receive DNA test results, though Anderson has
said that fingerprints have already placed him at at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA tests could also link Maturino Resendez to another
Harris County murder _ that of Noemi Dominguez, 26, who was killed
in her Houston home in June. Prosecutors could also file capital
murder charges in that case, but the evidence is more likely to be
used in the punishment phase of a trial for Benton's death,
assuming there's a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County sends more killers to death row than any other
county in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas prison system, there are now 468 people
on death row _ 460 men and eight women. Of those, 143 _ 140 men and
three women _ were convicted in Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   There are 165 men white men on death row, five white females,
192 black males, three black females, 99 Hispanic males, including
13 Mexican nationals, and four who list their origins as ``other,''
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Since capital punishment was declared constitutional again in
1976, Texas has executed 180 people, more than any other state,
said prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald. Most of those were from
Harris County, which has sent more killers to death row than any
state, except, of course, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County Sheriff Tommy Thomas said jailers have given
Maturino Resendez a Bible to replace the one that was taken away
when he was booked.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Maturino Resendez was immediately provided with a
Bible from the jail when he asked for one and that it was standard
procedure to take an inmate's possessions at booking.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez could have gotten his own Bible back if it had
been checked and he had asked for it.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant is currently in what's called ``administrative
segregation'' or ``lockdown.'' When he's not in court, he is in a
cell by himself 23 hours a day and is watched constantly by a
jailer.
</P>
<P>
   For one hour each day, he is allowed out to exercise under
supervision, Thomas said. Constant supervision will continue at
least until a psychological evaluation on him is complete.

UMPIRES CALCULATE THEIR RISK, AND SAY BASEBALL'S IS BIGGER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They saw a fight coming and decided that they, and
not their employers, would pick the time and place to start it. Now
baseball's major league umpires, whose letters of resignation,
effective Sept. 2, were sent by fax to the league offices Thursday,
will wait to learn if they have taken too great a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in Orlando,'' Rocky Roe, an American League umpire,
said Thursday in St. Petersburg, Fla., before the Mets-Devil Rays
game. ``There's always the possibility I could be at Disney World
looking for a job. Sure, there's an inherent risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball officials were silent Thursday on the
umpires' unexpected action, saying only that they were reviewing
the situation. But some are known to welcome the resignations,
because they feel they would be able to start over with new umpires
and regain the control they feel they have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Like Roe, Richie Phillips, head of the umpires union,
acknowledged the risk in the umpires' action. But, he said, if
baseball hired replacement umpires, it would be taking a much
bigger risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They risk having 25 years of inferior umpiring ahead of
them,'' Phillips said in a telephone interview, ``in a game in
which they will be presenting a very, very watered down product.
That's a real risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor agreement between the umpires and the National and
American leagues expires Dec. 31. Negotiations for a new deal were
going to be confrontational because the two sides have been headed
for a fight for more than a year, and the tension has been
especially high since the beginning of this year. The fight is just
starting earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires, who are barred by the labor contract from striking,
decided to adopt the resignation strategy because they will receive
$15.5 million in termination pay. The severance ranges from
$150,000 for a 10-year umpire to $400,000 for one who has 20 or
more years in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen and a half umpires out of the 66-member union do
not qualify for severance, but those who do have agreed to share a
percentage of their termination pay with the younger umpires.
Phillips said resignation letters of 63 umpires were faxed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires acted before they could be acted upon. They believed
management planned to try to induce lower-rated umpires to leave,
telling them they could resign and receive severance or be fired
and get nothing. Rather than have severance used as a weapon
against them, the umpires opted to have it work for them.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, the fight is economic. But it is also about
respect. ``A lot of times we feel that we're not appreciated,''
said Roe, a 20-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires chose a resignation date seven weeks away, figuring
there would be time for the two sides to achieve an agreement that
would prompt them to rescind their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Roe said, ``the parties will be able to get
together and negotiate in good faith and get a deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   The players pursued a similar strategy in 1994, figuring the
owners would rush to an agreement to salvage the post-season. But
the owners, for the first time, held firm, then congratulated
themselves on their ability to do that as the World Series was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In previous work stoppages involving umpires, the leagues hired
replacements, but they turned out to be inadequate and prompted
players and fans alike to clamor for the return of the regular
umpires. Fans at various parks booed umpires when they walked onto
the field last night, but Phillips recalled different scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Bud Selig and his errand boys don't understand,'' the
Philadelphia lawyer said, referring to the commissioner, ``is that
in 1979, when the umpires returned May 19, they received standing
ovations at every park in America. In 1984, in San Diego, when they
returned for the fifth game of the Padres-Cubs series, the umpires
got a standing ovation. After the 1995 lockout, upon their return,
they received standing ovations.''
</P>
<P>
   But a different dynamic could come into play this time. While
the umpires are gambling that the major leagues cannot do without
them, management could decide to let them resign, then go out and
hire permanent replacements. By hiring umpires on a permanent
basis, they may be able to recruit more capable men than they have
been able to lure for previous, temporary work stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the major league umpires could change their minds
if they are faced with permanent loss of their jobs, which,
including a $25,000 year-end bonus, pay from $95,000 to $262,500.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the union umpires are enamored of Phillips'
leadership. Last spring about a dozen umpires approached Ron
Shapiro, a noted player agent, and asked if he would be interested
in representing the umpires. They told him they were concerned with
Phillips' confrontational stance. But nothing developed, and an
overwhelming majority of umpires continued to support Phillips,
voting him a new five-year contract. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of the commissioner's office hiring an entirely
new crew of umpires contains an unusual element. New umpires would
be represented by the same bargaining unit, the Major League
Umpires Association. The old members of the union would go away,
but not the union. The head of the union is Phillips, and he would
continue under his five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday what he thought would happen next, Phillips said,
``I expect that in keeping with their attitude of smugness and
typical management arrogance, they will start recruiting their
amateur umpire force in order to intimidate the umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   One large group of umpires may not be available. With 220 of the
228 minor league umpires voting for it and the other 8 abstaining,
a new union of minor league umpires has been formed. It has yet to
be recognized by the minor league group that hires umpires, but the
umpires are represented by Phillips and he said they support the
major league umpires.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the lure of lucrative major league jobs, if
offered, could be difficult to resist.

AUTHORITIES SAY INSURANCE SUSPECT MAY BE IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities on the trail of suspected insurance swindler
Martin R. Frankel have tracked wire transfers of nearly half a
million dollars to Rome and are focusing on the possibility that he
is hiding in Italy, a country integral to his complex financial
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Several FBI agents, including Joseph P. Dooley, the lead agent
tracking Frankel, have flown to Italy in recent days in what one
person interviewed by the FBI called ``hot pursuit'' of the man
wanted for absconding with several hundred million dollars he
managed on behalf of Southern insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have also followed up leads suggesting that Frankel
might have joined a Catholic monastery in Assisi, the home of the
saint after whom he named a charitable foundation involved in his
suspected fraud. Officials at the monastery in Assisi said in
recent interviews that no one matching Frankel's description had
become a monk.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Frankel's likely whereabouts adds a fresh dash of the
unexpected to the case. Though notes rescued from smoldering
documents at his home in Greenwich, Conn., suggested that Frankel
had studied countries from which the United States might have
difficulty extraditing him, including Brazil, he appears to have
traveled to a country where he would seem to be decidedly insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in international crime consider it highly unlikely that
Italy would shelter Frankel from charges he faces in the United
States, and the FBI has worked closely in the past with Italian law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he and an entourage that associates say included several
women who lived in his Greenwich homes have eluded police, at least
so far. There are suggestions he has a financial cushion that could
allow him to live in hiding in luxury.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, Frankel purchased $10 million in
diamonds just before fleeing the United States. And although the
FBI has frozen many of Frankel's bank accounts around the world, he
almost certainly has access to cash as well.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale dealer who arranged Frankel's huge last-minute
diamond purchase said Thursday that he had wired $455,000 to an
Italian bank account in the name of a woman who is said to be
traveling with Frankel. It could not be learned whether Frankel had
withdrawn the money before American authorities found out about the
payment last month.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Wiener of the Worldwide Diamond Co., which arranged
the sale, said the money had been withheld from the $10 million
Frankel paid for diamonds to settle California sales taxes. But
because the diamonds were delivered to Frankel's representatives at
an airport in New Jersey, the California tax withholding was
unnecessary and needed to be refunded, Wiener said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, well after Frankel is thought to have fled the
country, he telephoned Richard Teel, another merchant involved in
the diamond sale, to inquire about the refund. Frankel phoned again
on May 21. This time, he instructed the diamond dealers to wire the
funds to an account at Rome's Banca Popolare di Brescia. The
transfer was made May 21, Wiener said. That was two weeks after
firefighters discovered documents ablaze at Frankel's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Wiener said at the time that he had no knowledge of Frankel's
whereabouts. Teel's lawyer said his client also did not know at the
time that Frankel had left the country.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel has friends in Rome. Just before leaving the United
States, he wired $3 million to an account controlled by Fausto
Fausti, an Italian business consultant who had earlier helped
Frankel try to recruit a Catholic charity as a partner for
Frankel's business dealings. The transfer to Fausti's account was
mentioned in an affidavit prepared by the Internal Revenue Service,
according to people who have seen the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Fausti could not be reached for comment.

 &HT;    Actor Martin Sheen to accept peace award
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Actor and Dayton native Martin Sheen will receive
the 1999 Pope Paul VI Teacher of Peace Award from Pax Christi USA,
a national Catholic peace movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, 58, who has almost made a second career of advocating for
such causes as environmentalism and the homeless, and against
capital punishment, oppression in Central America and the nuclear
arms race, will receive the award today in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Small, Pax Christi USA national coordinator, said Sheen
``is an actor who integrates his faith and deep convictions with
his life's work.''
</P>
<P>
   He was nominated by several Pax Christi members, including John
Dear, executive director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an
interfaith organization committed to seeking peace and justice.
Dear called Sheen ``a teacher of peace to the whole mainstream
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, a 1958 graduate of Chaminade High School, is the first
actor to win the award. Past winners have included Dorothy Day,
co-founder of the Catholic Workers, a social reform organization;
author Joan Chittester; Dom Helder Camara, a Brazilian bishop;
Helen Prejean, author of ``Dead Man Walking,'' and Maura Clarke,
Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Jean Donovan, the three nuns and a
social worker who were murdered in 1980 while working with the poor
in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen is perhaps best known for his role as the narrator in the
war film ``Apocalypse Now,'' as well as for roles in ``Gandhi'' and
``Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he narrated ``An Act of Conscience,'' a
documentary about Randy Kehler and Betsy Corner, who refused to pay
federal income taxes as a protest against government military
spending.
</P>
<P>
   He will star this fall in the NBC television drama ``The West
Wing,'' about the inner workings of the White House Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, born Ramon Estevez, was one of 10 children born to
Francisco Estevez, a Spanish immigrant, and Mary Ann Phelan, an
Irish immigrant. He left Dayton for an acting career in New York
after high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was raised Roman Catholic, he said in a 1995
National Press Club speech that as a young adult, he let his
``Catholic faith kind of slide.'' He didn't rediscover it, he said,
until he was about 40, when he traveled to India and met Mother
Teresa while filming ``Gandhi.''
</P>
<P>
   That experience, he said, led him to ``the real faith of

EPA ACCUSES SOME UTILITIES OF VIOLATING RULES ON COAL USAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency has found that
several electric companies have violated the terms under which
their coal plants were ``grandfathered'' under the Clean Air Act,
by making major changes to produce more power without installing
the required pollution controls, according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors have completed field audits of six plants, and were
preparing to complete work on 22 more, the officials said. No
action has been taken against the plants yet, as investigators
continue reviewing the data. The EPA could require the companies to
install equipment to control their emissions and fine them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been making what we believe are major capital
improvements, not routine maintenance,'' said one federal official,
who asked not to be further identified because the investigation is
still under way. The improvements included new boilers, burners,
and blowers for moving coal, all of higher capacity than the old
ones. In some cases, the official said, the ability of the plants
to produce power had been increased ``dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act set strict pollution standards for new sources
but much looser ones for existing power plants and factories. Under
the grandfather clause, the old sources could continue to operate
with minor improvements as long as their owners did not undertake
major renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for power from coal-fired plants has risen in the last
few years, as de-regulation of the utility industry has allowed
electric companies with old, paid-for plants consuming cheap fuel
to sell their electricity profitably across state lines, into
higher-priced eastern markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the nitrogen oxides they produce add to smog in the east,
according to the EPA and air pollution officials in the eastern
states. Smog, or ground-level ozone, is produced by the action of
sunlight on nitrogen oxides, which come from cars and power plants,
with hydrocarbons, which come from cars, oil refineries and other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against the power companies, most of them in the
Ohio Valley, are only the latest dispute about the plants;
officials in Northeastern states have long complained that their
pollution travels hundreds of miles to create smog from Washington
to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But people in the industry said that they were under a legal
obligation to keep their plants in top condition, and had done
nothing that would require stricter pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 EPA investigators are looking at records and hardware
in the plants, according to federal officials, who say the EPA
first made its discovery by comparing computerized databases
assembled for other purposes. One database, created for the control
of the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain, shows power
generation and coal consumption. Another shows investments in new
equipment. Matching the two, investigators said they found evidence
of major improvements, the kind that should have required stricter
pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry V. Nickel, a lawyer who represents the Utility Air
Regulatory Group, an industry coalition, said, ``They're looking at
things that everyone in industry has had to do, to keep their
plants running.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickel said that in some cases the EPA had looked at production
in the year that work was done on a plant, and production in the
year after, and found an increase. But that, he said, was ``a
perfectly fulfilling prophecy,'' because, he said, ``when you shut
down a facility to do a repair project, it's going to operate less
in that year than in next year, when you don't have to shut down
for repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickel said improvements that allowed a plant to produce more
kilowatt-hours from a fixed amount of fuel would not require better
pollution controls, because by definition, such improvements meant
a decline in pollution per unit of electricity produced.
</P>
<P>
   At American Electric Power, a coal-based utility that generates
and distributes power in seven states, Pat Hemlepp, a spokesman,
said, ``We've known for a long time that EPA has wanted to pursue
an emissions reduction strategy through enforcement initiatives.''
Hemlepp said his company's investments in its plants had been
obvious over the years. ``There's not much that electric utilities
do that's private,'' he said, because of regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this
spring, American Electric Power said the EPA had requested
documents from the company related to its coal plant investments
and power output.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 16:
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Americans tend to be sympathetic to wildlife. They
have supported the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone National
Park, for example, as well as efforts by environmental groups and
the federal government to protect other endangered species. But the
issue gets more complicated when animals camp on their doorsteps.
Suburban sprawl has created competition for space between humans
and wildlife, and while nobody much likes it when deer and
waterfowl are edged out of their natural habitat, there are times
when the creatures rebound in such numbers that they compromise the
quality of community life. Such is the case with Canada geese in
Kent, N.Y., a town that encompasses Lake Carmel in Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   Kent has decided that the geese are winning, and has launched a
program to round them up and process them as meals for the needy.
Other programs of this kind have failed, most recently in
Clarkstown, N.Y., where a similar plan crumbled after protests from
animal rights activists. In addition, beneficiaries of Clarkstown's
goose meat pronounced it a bit tough. But with an exploding goose
population, Kent officials are standing firm against the animal
rights activists. Other goose-control options, like border collies
and noise devices, were carefully weighed and judged ineffective
and costly.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated communities have dubbed Canada geese ``feathered
rats.'' They soil city parks and raise fears of disease when their
waste fouls reservoirs and recreational waters. The manicured lawns
of suburbia provide an Eden for these birds. Communities like Kent
are so appealing that geese often forgo the migratory trip to North
Carolina and settle in as year-round squatters, reproducing in
great numbers. Several years ago, members of the Goosepond Colony
Golf Course in Scottsboro, Ala., got so fed up that they considered
inviting hunters to bring their shotguns and clear out the course.
</P>
<P>
   Kent's officials have no intention of eradicating all the geese.
Their aim, rather, is to create a smaller, sustainable population
on Lake Carmel over several years. Their program seems a sensible
compromise between the needs of nature and, in this case, the
rather more urgent needs of the community. The fact that the doomed
geese will be used for food helps soothe the conscience.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Elite swimmers from around the country are
competing this weekend at the Janet Evans Invitational at USC's
McDonald's Swim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top competitors is USC alumnus Lenny Krayzelburg, the
reigning world backstroke champion and American record-holder in
the 200-meter event.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Krayzelburg, 23, is
setting his sights on besting his own meet record of 1:59.82 in the
200 backstroke set in 1997. The race starts at 5 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am used to training in this stadium and this weather,''
Krayzelburg said. ``I know what I need to do and have my own
strategy. I don't expect anyone else to be faster than two minutes,
and I think I can do a legitimate 1:58. On the other hand, I can't
control what other competitors do.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg is making a charge at the world record in the 200
backstroke. He has broken the American record three times in the
past two years, most recently lowering it to 1:56.95 at the U.S.
Swimming Championships at Long Island, N.Y., earlier this year. The
time was just 0.38 seconds off the world record set in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Others are eager for a chance to see Krayzelburg further his
assault on the world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the swimming community are excited to see
what Lenny will do at the Janet Evans Invitational after his
showing in the past year,'' said Paul Davidson, a coach for the
Conejo/Simi Aquatics Club who has swimmers competing at the meet.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg doesn't expect to break the world record this
weekend, but it is definitely among his goals for the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't train as hard prior to this event as we do for the
top events in the world,'' Krayzelburg said. ``The big competition
I am shooting for is the Pan Pacific Games in five weeks at Sydney,
Australia, the site of next year's Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg burst into national prominence by winning three gold
medals at the '97 Pan Pacifics. He went on to become the first man
in 10 years to sweep the 100- and 200-meter backstroke at the '98
World Championships in Perth, Australia, where he also won a silver
medal in the 400-meter medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ukraine, Krayzelburg moved to the United States with his
family in 1989 in order to have a better life and more
opportunities. He became a U.S. citizen in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg finished his stellar career at USC with the
fourth-fastest time in history in 200-yard backstroke at the NCAA
Championships in 1997. He graduated from USC last December with a
degree in finance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 200-meter backstroke, Krayzelburg will
compete in four more events at the Janet Evans Invitational, today
in the 100 freestyle, Saturday in the 200 and 50 freestyle, and
Sunday in the 100 backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   The event also includes competition for juniors.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets can be purchased at McDonald's Swim Stadium. Prices
range from $2 to $5.

EDITORIAL: PATIENT RIGHTS AND WRONGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af) 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, July 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With impressive but wrongheaded discipline, Senate Republicans
have rejected a series of attempts to protect the rights of
patients enrolled in managed-care health programs. Despite reams of
opinion surveys suggesting that the public wants reform in this
area, the Republicans chose to protect insurers, health maintenance
organizations and businesses at the expense of patients.
</P>
<P>
   After sweeping health-care legislation failed in 1994, the word
in Washington was that incremental reform might be possible. The
Clinton administration had some success with smaller steps. But
this week the Senate effortlessly swatted down a series of
incremental measures to prevent abuses by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday it rejected the right of patients to redress
grievances in court for denial of care. Earlier it rejected greater
access to specialists for patients and the right of doctors to
determine what is ``medically necessary'' for their patients. The
Senate could not even bring itself to expand basic protections from
the 48 million Americans in fancy ``self-insured'' health plans to
more than 100 million in employer-provided plans, state and local
government plans and plans for people who buy their own insurance.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mystery here. Campaign money is dictating medical
policy in the Senate. The political system, and especially the
Republican Party, is awash in money from the health-care industry.
As President Clinton said Thursday, GOP senators could not support
the patients' bill of rights because ``the health insurers won't
let them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, legitimate concerns about the costs of
reform. But these basic protections can be enacted without pushing
up health insurance premiums, as opponents charge. Another empty
Republican point is the insistence that these protections are best
regulated by the states. Health care _ like civil rights and
environmental protection _ is one of those areas where Americans
want broad, consistent national policy.
</P>
<P>
   What the Senate did this week was weaken legislation even beyond
what is being considered in the House, where many Republican
members say they plan to support some patient protections,
including the right to sue health maintenance organizations. Those
in the health-care industry who support these protections should
now speak up, especially the doctors in the American Medical
Association, who have already begun lobbying for some of these
provisions and who recently announced plans to form unions to
counterbalance the power of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House seem to understand better than their
Senate colleagues that the issue of health care will be hot in
2000. By then, campaign money from the industry may not be enough
to protect Republicans from the public desire for relief from HMO
abuses. &QL;

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BOSTON _ It was conceived in the United States in 1900 as a way to
bring together countries to enjoy the sport. Now, the Davis Cup is
being credited with the resurgence of interest in men's tennis in
this country.
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Davis Cup ace Jim Courier breathed life into a competition
that no longer held the interest of many of the top Americans. Pete
Sampras had opted out for personal reasons. Andre Agassi denounced
the team for political reasons. And Michael Chang had played
sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   But Courier, a member of 13 teams, all victorious, scratched and
clawed for more than eight hours to help lead a second-tier U.S.
squad past Britain's best to force a quarterfinal showdown against
Australia. Courier outlasted Tim Henman, then Greg Rusedski to keep
alive the U.S. team's hopes of returning the Cup to its native
shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best Davis Cup moments I've seen in a long
time,'' said Cup veteran John McEnroe. ``When I saw Jim win the
fifth match and he nodded for his teammates to come out and they
got in that circle and started dancing, that's when I really missed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That likely was what Dwight Filley Davis envisioned when he
created the competition in 1900. A 21-year-old recent Harvard
graduate and a leading American player who later would become
President Calvin Coolidge's secretary of war, Davis envisioned a
yearly tournament that would advance friendship and good will
internationally as the men traveled to one another's countries for
matches.
</P>
<P>
   That first tournament, which consisted solely of the United
States and Great Britain, was held at the Longwood Cricket Club in
Boston, site of today's Davis Cup quarterfinal between the United
States and Australia. The U.S. won that first Davis Cup 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would go on to win 30 more Davis Cups, more
than any other nation. Australia is second with 26. In all, 100
countries have participated but only nine have won.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis Cup competition included only the two countries until
1904, when Belgium, Austria and France joined. Great Britain
emerged victorious, sweeping Belgium 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The United States played its first Davis Cup matches on foreign
soil the following year, defeating France and Australasia
(Australia and New Zealand) at Queen's Club in London. The United
States won the right to play Britain in the challenge round but
lost 5-0 at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1913 that the trophy returned to America for the
first time since 1902. Richard Norris Williams, a survivor of the
sinking of the Titanic the year before, was the star of the U.S.
team that beat Britain 3-2. Williams, whose father died in the
disaster, registered a 6-1 record in singles in the four victories
by the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, the event had become so popular that 12,000
fans poured into the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, N.Y.,
to watch the final between the United States and Australasia.The
United States was narrowly defeated 3-2. It would be the last Davis
Cup match until 1919 because of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Tilden of the United States popularized the competition in
the 1920s. With a flashy style and solid results, Tilden helped
lead his team to victories over France, Britain and Australasia
with a 7-0 mark in 1920. He played another 10 years, accumulating
25 singles wins. The United States won seven consecutive trophies
beginning with his rookie campaign. He holds the U.S. record for
most appearances in a final with a 21-7 record.
</P>
<P>
   That streak was halted in 1927 by the Four Musketeers _ the
French team of Rene Lacoste, Jean Borotra, Henri Cochet and Jacques
Brugnon. The United States and France forged a rivalry through six
consecutive challenge rounds, which they split.
</P>
<P>
   The next great U.S. Davis Cup figure was Don Budge, who in 1937
helped lead the United States to its first Davis Cup victory since
1926. Budge and Gottfried von Cramm of Germany played one of the
most dramatic matches in the event's history. According to legend,
the phone rang in the locker room before the match. Von Cramm was
called to find Adolf Hitler on the other end offering words of
encouragement. And though he led Budge 4-1 in a decisive fifth set,
the American pulled it out.
</P>
<P>
   Budge played Davis Cup for only four years but achieved a 25-4
record in 11 ties and twice helped lead the United States to the
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every great player has participated at one time. Nikki
Pietrangeli of Italy holds the honor of being the most prolific
player of all time, having participated in the most Davis Cup
matches (164) and the most Cup ties (66). He led Italy to its only
Davis Cup (over Chile) in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s and '60s belonged to Australia, which won the Davis
Cup 15 times between 1950 and 1967 with such talented players as
Frank Sedgman, Ken McGregor, Mervyn Rose, Neale Fraser, Mal
Anderson, Ashley Cooper, Rod Laver, John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Fred
Stolle and John Alexander. Newcombe has remained involved as the
current captain for Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Davis Cup opened itself to registered professionals but
not contract pros, who signed guaranteed contracts with independent
promoters. The competition was opened to everyone in 1973, which
became the decade that McEnroe began asserting his Davis Cup
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   As a 19-year-old rookie in 1978, McEnroe helped the United
States to its 25th Davis Cup title. McEnroe lost only 10 games in
his two singles matches over John Lloyd and Chris Mottram as the
U.S. team beat Britain 4-1 in the final.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe didn't lose a set in Davis Cup singles or doubles until
1980 and went on to become the most successful American Davis Cup
player ever, setting U.S. records for years on the team (12), team
matches (30), singles matches (49), singles victories (41), total
matches (69) and total wins (59).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of being a team,'' McEnroe said. ``It's the only
chance, aside from doubles, when we have the chance to root for the
other guy and be part of a team. It's important in different ways.
You can't compare it. It's an honor and responsibility to play
Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Connors in 1984, a pairing that gave the
Americans the Nos. 1 and 2 players in the world. But the United
States was shocked by Sweden 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played under a lot of circumstances,'' Connors said.
``You play for yourself, but you've got 200 million people behind
you when the United States creeps into it.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe has been involved in some of the Cup's most memorable
matches. He and Mats Wilander were locked in a 6-hour, 32-minute
quarterfinal duel in 1982, the longest in Davis Cup history.
McEnroe emerged victorious 9-7, 6-2, 15-17, 3-6, 8-6 to clinch the
3-2 win over Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best U.S. victories of recent Davis Cup action was in
1992 when the United States fielded its ``Dream Team'' of then-No.
1 Courier, Wimbledon champion Agassi, Sampras and McEnroe. Together
they knocked off Sweden 4-1 in the semis, then defeated Switzerland
3-1 in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis Cup is the perfect platform for the better competitors
to shine,'' Agassi said. ``The intensity is there, so in-your-face.
I go in like it's the end of the world. It's a lot more dramatic
winning or losing when your country is counting on you than when
the fans are counting on you and yourself is counting on you. What
a platform that is to show what you're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his great moments, which include five of the United
States' 31 victories, that 1992 tie is the one McEnroe is most
proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '92 tie where I played just doubles,'' he said. ``Being
part of what I consider to be a legendary team with Pete, Andre and
Jim, and going through the divorce (from former wife Tatum O'Neal),
I was feeling emotionally not really capable of playing. I think
perhaps that that could be maybe my greatest emotional moment, to
be able to be part of that squad.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has won only once since (1995), edging Russia
3-2 in an emotional final in which Sampras was dramatically dragged
off the court after beating Andrei Chesnokov, suffering severe
cramps. He returned the next day to play doubles and won a second
singles match.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Americans have struggled. A team of Todd Martin,
MaliVai Washington and Chang lost to the Czechs in '96. Sampras
tore a calf muscle, then watched his teammates get swept by Sweden
in '97. Last year, it was Italy pulling off the stunner, beating
the Americans 4-1 in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotional roller coaster we ride during Davis Cup is a
little bigger than the average roller coaster,'' Martin said. ``I
realize now how much more important the Davis Cup is than the other
tournaments we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras hasn't played Davis Cup since '97. Agassi split from the
team this year. And there have been rumblings the event would be
more attractive if played only every two years, a recommendation
recently vetoed by the International Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But just when attitudes seemingly were at an all-time low,
Courier's actions sparked patriotism and the Americans are ready to
wave their flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think from my perspective as Davis Cup captain and director
of coaching for the USTA, we have to keep the momentum going,''
American captain Tom Gullikson said. ``I think it's important for
us to win this tie and keep the tennis momentum in this country
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the quarterfinal tie sold out a record 81 minutes
after going on sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the thing that's kind of gratifying is that you
guys (the media) are here, and it's Monday. And that hasn't
happened in a Davis Cup tie in America that I've ever been a part
of,'' Courier said. ``So that, for me, is a gratifying part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Davis Cup is getting back to being a front-page story. I
think that's what makes it gratifying to me _ an event of this
stature is trying to get a little more recognition in America. I
played a small part in that, and that makes me sleep better.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier has played a big part in America's quest to return the
Davis Cup to its soil 99 years after Davis' dream became a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Davis Cup and Grand Slams are the two reasons I get up
every morning and strap on my shoes and practice,'' Courier said.

 &HT;    Collecting Kubrick
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Stanley Kubrick made only 13 films over the
course of his 46-year career, capped by the opening today of ``Eyes
Wide Shut,'' which Time magazine calls his ``haunting final
masterpiece.'' The legendary director died March 7 at age 70.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's films range from historical epics to futuristic
fantasies, yet they are united by their visual brilliance and a
shared theme of man's efforts being thwarted by human or system
error. Many are literary adaptations; most are considered to be
cinematic classics.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the director's most influential films were released last
month in a boxed set entitled ``The Stanley Kubrick Collection.''
The collection contains ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``Lolita,'' ``A
Clockwork Orange,'' ``Barry Lyndon,'' ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``Paths
of Glory,'' ``The Killing,'' ``Full Metal Jacket'' and ``The
Shining.'' The list price is $149.92 DVD and $124.92 VHS. All
titles are also available separately.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of ``The Shining'' and ``Full Metal Jacket,''
which are in standard format, all DVDs are widescreen editions.
With the exception of ``Lolita,'' all DVDs contain the theatrical
trailers. ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' includes an interview with
author Arthur C. Clarke. ``The Shining'' includes a 30-minute
documentary, ``The Making of the Shining,'' by Kubrick's daughter,
Vivian.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Kubrick's earlier films, ``Spartacus'' and ``Killer's
Kiss,'' are also out on home video. His 1953 feature debut, ``Fear
and Desire,'' is currently unavailable, as are several early
documentary shorts.

JAZZ MUSEUM TURNS TO INTERNET FOR PROMOTION AND SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 18th and Vine Authority plans to use the Internet to
generate cash for the American Jazz Museum and spread the word
about Kansas City jazz worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The authority has hired an Overland Park, Kan., Internet company
to build an online storefront for the Jazz Museum's Swing Shop,
which sells jazz posters, museum souvenirs, and music by current
and past Kansas City jazz artists.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales, which operates online storefronts for more than 1,500
businesses worldwide, will design an e-commerce Web site for the
museum and handle transactions and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The authority's board hopes the online store will be the first
step in establishing the museum's Web site as a central site for
jazz online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the biggest, most enduring names in jazz got their
start or made their mark in Kansas City, and the American Jazz
Museum highlights our area's illustrious contributions to the art
form,'' said Emanuel Cleaver, chairman of the 18th and Vine
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The authority approved the contract with NetSales this week. The
store will be up and running within 90 days, said James E. Coleman,
the authority's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales will design and serve as host for the commerce site for
a percentage of the sales. The museum's Web site can be reached
through www.kcmo.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the board was so excited by this is that it's not
costing us anything,'' Coleman said. ``This gives us a chance to
get into e-commerce for effectively no cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said the deal would help the museum pay for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a significant step toward self-sufficiency
while also helping to promote the historic 18th and Vine District
to an international audience of jazz aficionados,'' Cleaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the store will sell CDs of current Kansas City jazz
musicians and of past jazz masters, Coleman said. It also will sell
T-shirts, caps, jackets and other museum souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Coleman said, the online store may be expanded to
include videos from past jazz performances and other jazz
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The American Jazz Museum hopes to broadcast live performances
over the Internet from the museum's Blue Room.
</P>
<P>
   The museum and Swing Shop opened in September 1997, part of a
50,000-square-foot complex that features Kansas City jazz and
baseball heritage.

CHILD ABUSE INVESTIGATOR IN SLAVERY CASE FACED COMPLAINT IN 1988
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York City child-abuse investigator accused of
forcing a Nigerian girl into servitude and repeatedly beating her
was the subject of a 1988 complaint that she had neglected another
Nigerian girl living in her home, officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Ifeoma Ezeonu Udogwu, and her husband, Prosper
Udogwu, were charged on Wednesday with keeping Beatrice Okezie, a
native of Nigeria who is now 23, in forced servitude in their Bronx
home for nine years and beating her. During most of that time, Ms.
Udogwu was a caseworker for the city's Administration for
Children's Services; she became a supervisor with the agency last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But as far back as August 1988 _ just a month after she began
working for the city _ Ms. Udogwu was named in a complaint for a
case of possible child abuse in her home, law enforcement officials
said. That complaint was phoned to a state child abuse line by fire
marshals who were investigating a fire believed to have been set in
her home by another Nigerian girl, said Chief Brian Dixon, a Fire
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The marshals were concerned that the girl, who was not charged
because she was a juvenile, was not properly supervised and had not
been enrolled in school, Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had said on Wednesday that the girl, who they said
was 11 or 12, had returned to Africa after being sexually assaulted
by Ms. Udogwu's brother, but they said Thursday that that account
is now unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Administration for Children's Services said
Thursday that they were going through old paperwork in warehouses
to see if the neglect complaint against Ms. Udogwu was ever
forwarded to them and, if so, whether any action was taken on it.
The agency, which suspended Ms. Udogwu without pay after she was
indicted this week, is also preparing disciplinary proceedings
against her and is auditing the cases she handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these charges are true, it is about as outrageous a piece
of alleged conduct against any of our people as I've heard,'' said
Nicholas Scoppetta, the agency's Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The Udogwus are accused of luring Miss Okezie into the country
from Nigeria in 1989, when she was 13, by promising to send her to
trade school, only to force her to work as their unpaid, live-in
maid, according to a complaint filed on Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan. Miss Okezie was beaten into submission and was
unable to leave because the Udogwus confiscated her passport and
other identification papers, the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Udogwus deny the charges. Jerry Tritz, a lawyer
for Udogwu, said that his client brought Miss Okezie to America
because he was tricked into believing that she was his daughter by
a woman he had had an affair with. ``He found out that this was a
lie and terminated the relationship,'' he said. ``This is
payback.''
</P>
<P>
   During the time she is said to have lived with the Udogwus as an
indentured servant, Miss Okezie attended Evander Childs High School
in the Bronx. Margie Feinberg, a Board of Education spokeswoman,
said that her records indicate that Miss Okezie graduated in 1994
with an attendance record of better than 90 percent and grade
average of 81.5.
</P>
<P>
   Joel S. Cohen, a lawyer for Ms. Udogwu, said that Miss Okezie's
record at Evander Childs undermines some of the accusations against
his client. ``I think it completely belies the accusation in the
complaint,'' he said. ``You certainly don't get the impression that
she had enough freedom of movement to attend high school in the
complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan M. Beschta of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of
New York, who is one of several lawyers from a number of groups
representing Miss Okezie in a civil suit she had filed against the
Udogwus, said that the girl was simply too frightened to ask school
officials for help. ``She was too intimidated to talk to anybody,''
Ms. Beschta said. ``And as far as I know, nobody at the school
noticed anything.''

DURWOOD'S STOCK IN AMC EVENTUALLY WILL BENEFIT CHARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any income from movie theater magnate Stan Durwood's stock in
AMC Entertainment Inc. will be used to fund charitable causes.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood, who died Wednesday at age 78, was co-chairman and chief
executive officer of the fourth-largest movie exhibition company in
the world. He owned a large majority of AMC's class B stock, which
has 10 votes for every one vote of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Through his supervoting stock, Durwood controlled almost 70
percent of Kansas City-based AMC. The value of that stock is
unclear because the class B shares are not publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   The stock will soon be transferred to a trust controlled by two
longtime lawyer friends, with the eventual beneficiary being the
Stanley H. Durwood Foundation, a charitable trust.
</P>
<P>
   While speculation has swirled for months that the company would
be sold upon Durwood's death, the way his estate is set up makes
that less likely, or at least much more difficult than previously
expected.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the company's succession plan, Peter Brown,
previously co-chairman of AMC with Durwood, on Thursday became
chairman and chief executive officer. Philip M. Singleton continues
as president and chief operating officer of American Multi-Cinema
Inc., a subsidiary that has responsibility for all AMC operations
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan's vision created the pre-eminent company in our
industry,'' Brown said. ``He prepared the company well for its
future, leaving a strong foundation for continued growth and
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not the largest movie exhibition company in the world,
AMC is one of the most highly regarded, mostly because of its large
number of megaplexes, which account for more than half of its 2,729
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond F. Beagle Jr., one of the two trustees, said Durwood's
estate and succession plan had two purposes _ to create stability
for the company and its employees and to create stability for the
holders of 19.4 million shares of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want the wonderful management team and the employees
to feel like the company was going to be sold out from under
them,'' said Beagle, a longtime friend of Durwood's.
</P>
<P>
   The other trustee is Charles J. Egan Jr., who is also a director
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   When it was disclosed in January 1997 that Durwood had cancer,
Wall Street started speculating that the company would be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Those rumored to be interested in the company are the investment
firms of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. and Hicks Muse Tate &AMP; Furst,
which owns Regal Cinemas Inc. Another name that's been mentioned is
Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp., which is largely owned by the
Sony Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Wang, an analyst with Solomon Smith Barney in New York,
said several factors would make AMC an attractive takeover
candidate, including its large concentration of megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   Wang also said Durwood had long been reluctant to raise ticket
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``So somebody could come in and buy the company and immediately
jack up the ticket prices, and a lot of that flows to the bottom
line,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's cost structure also is a bit bloated, he said, so
an acquirer ``could immediately cut costs to improve financial
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang estimates the company's current buyout value to be between
$28 and $30 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility, according to some analysts, would be
obtaining financing and taking the company private.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Beagle said any income generated by the stock in the
trust, whether from dividends or the sale of some or all of the
stock, would be disbursed to various charities through the Kansas
City Community Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said anyone could approach the company with an offer to
buy AMC.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any public company, that could happen at any given
time, but that doesn't mean it would be a credible offer,'' Brown
said. ``Besides, the one place that we're different is that there
is tight control over the B shares.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the trustees, Brown and Singleton, control AMC
as tightly as Durwood did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan always viewed the company as family, and he was a loving,
family-oriented person and would like to see the family stay
together,'' Brown said.

 &HT;    Film sketches paint portrait of Saigon
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Vietnam. For years, the name was
synonymous with an unwinnable war on the other side of the world.
Now, with ``Three Seasons,'' Tony Bui's delicate series of parallel
character sketches, we glimpse the natural beauty, urban squalor
and have-and-have-nots economy that is modern-day Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   This Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner, the first American
production shot in post-war Vietnam, looks likely to have a
substantial art house life if viewers can accept its elliptical,
enigmatic stories for their fragile merits.
</P>
<P>
   Director-writer Bui shows Saigon through the yearnings of three
groups of desperate searchers and peddlers. We first meet Kien An,
who toils in exquisitely photographed ponds of white lotuses, which
she and others then harvest and hawk on the street. One day she is
summoned to the adjacent house of Teacher Dao, a leprosy-ravaged
man who asks her to transcribe his poems before he dies. They forge
an ephemeral bond.
</P>
<P>
   Next is cyclo-taxi driver Hai, who becomes obsessed with a call
girl servicing the tourists in the upscale hotels most Vietnamese
never see inside. With a windfall, Hai buys a night with Lan, whom
he watches as she sleeps, untouched. Their union is both moving and
sad, and their story narrowly escapes its inherent cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Three Seasons'' is Vietnamese, except for
executive producer Harvey Keitel, who plays a war veteran named
James Hager in search of the love child he never met. He encounters
a street urchin peddling trinkets and gum from a wooden case, which
he loses in one of the city's frequent blackouts. The urchin scours
the city for Hager, suspecting him of stealing the case, while
Hager searches for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Each story is a variation on attempts at making connections. The
film's lack of traditional structure or dramatic resolution can be
frustrating, but that should not get in the way of appreciating its
delicate texture and intriguing visuals.

WOMEN PLEAD GUILTY IN BABY SMUGGLING CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two Long Island women accused of being part of an
adoption ring that smuggled babies from Mexico pleaded guilty
Thursday to conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   The women, Arlene Lieberman and Arlene Reingold, who federal
prosecutors said had worked with an Arizona lawyer to sell at least
17 children to unwitting adoptive parents in the New York area,
pleaded guilty to conspiring to transport illegal immigrants _ the
children _ within the United States and conceal them from detection
after they were smuggled into Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children were infants, some only a few days old, but
one child was 9, according to a prosecutor in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn, where the women entered their pleas Thursday, seven
weeks after they were arrested. Under federal sentencing
guidelines, they could each receive terms of 21 to 27 months in
prison. The women, who will be sentenced at a date that hasn't been
set, remained free on $150,000 bail each.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the prison terms, the women face fines of up to
$250,000 each and, under their plea agreements, each is to pay
$43,500 in restitution to the adoptive parents involved.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Macht, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined
to say how much each set of parents would receive.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the pleas, federal prosecutors agreed to dismiss
seven other charges against the women, including conspiring to
defraud adoptive parents, who prosecutors said had been falsely
assured that the children were legitimately in the United States
and that it was legal to take custody of them.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said that the parents, who generally paid fees
of $20,000 or more for the adoptions, did not know that the lawyer
with whom the women worked _ Mario Manuel Reyes Burgueno, who lives
in Douglas, Ariz., and practices law just across the border, in
Agua Prieta, Mexico _ had used faked birth certificates and
adoption-consent forms, had bribed Mexican officials and had
arranged for the children to be brought across the border by women
posing as their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Once the 17 children were in the New York area, prosecutors
said, they were turned over to the adoptive parents without the
visas, passports or required documents from the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service. The two women's clients, who were often
desperate to adopt children, were falsely told that they could
apply for the necessary approvals from immigration officials later.
</P>
<P>
   All the charges that Ms. Lieberman and Ms. Reingold had
originally faced are still pending against Reyes, who, his lawyer
said Thursday, ``wants to go to trial'' because he believes he has
committed no crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Stephen P. Scaring, said he was surprised that Ms.
Lieberman, 48, and Ms. Reingold, 46, who live near each other in
Medford, had pleaded guilty. ``We haven't approached the U.S.
Attorney at all,'' Scaring said of possible plea negotiations for
his client, who is free on $1 million bond and is due to return to
court on Aug. 13.

STAN DURWOOD, INVENTOR OF MULTIPLEX MOVIE THEATER, DIES AT 78 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley H. Durwood, inventor of the multiplex movie theater and
head of AMC Entertainment Inc., died Wednesday night after a long
battle with esophageal cancer. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood opened the nation's first multiplex theater in 1962 at
Kansas City's Ward Parkway Shopping Center. Later, he doggedly
pushed various plans to revitalize downtown, his most recent vision
being the proposed $454 million Power &AMP; Light District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan Durwood was a true legend of the theatrical exhibition
industry as well as one of the great entrepreneurs of all time,''
said AMC executive Peter Brown, who became chairman and chief
executive officer of the Kansas City-based company upon Durwood's
death.
</P>
<P>
   AMC officials said Thursday that the succession plan ensured
that the nation's fourth-largest movie exhibition company could
remain independent, even as the stock surged amid renewed takeover
speculation. Backers of the Power &AMP; Light District said the project
would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood was described by one Hollywood executive as being to the
exhibition side of the movie industry what Louis B. Mayer, Jack
Warner and Darryl F. Zanuck were to the production side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to look at it is that the industry has lost a
mogul,'' said Tom Sherak, chairman of 20th Century Fox Domestic
Film Group. ``He was an icon to those of us growing up in the
business. To us he was a legend, and his legend will not stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was in Durwood's blood. His father, Edward Dubinsky,
and an uncle, Maurice Dubinsky, crisscrossed the Midwest near the
turn of the century performing melodramas in tent shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Dubinsky brothers eventually settled in Kansas City and
bought a movie theater. Within a decade, they owned more than a
dozen theaters.
</P>
<P>
   When his father died in 1960, Stan Durwood took over the
business and continued running the theaters, all located downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood invented the multiplex when he hung a velvet curtain to
divide a movie theater and played two movies on the same screen.
</P>
<P>
   His first deliberate multiscreen theater was created at Ward
Parkway in 1962 when the mall's owner, John Kroh, decided to
enclose it and add a second level.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood wanted to build a movie house there, which would have
been one of the first suburban theaters in the area. But Kroh said
because of the support beams, it couldn't be done. It then dawned
on Durwood to create two smaller theaters, and the multiplex was
born.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have the multiplex appeal quite figured out. Both new
theaters at Ward Parkway opened with the same movie, ``The Great
Escape.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon, Durwood figured out the formula, and the company
opened its first four-plex in 1966. In 1969, AMC opened a six-plex,
with each screen playing a different movie.
</P>
<P>
   The complexes kept getting bigger. The Grand 24 opened in Dallas
in 1995 to rave reviews and huge crowds. Later, AMC built
megaplexes with as many as 30 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood always was an innovator, said Sherak, who teaches a
graduate class at the University of California-Los Angeles on film
exhibition and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things I teach my students about is
Stan Durwood and how he changed this industry,'' Sherak said. ``He
always put his money and expertise where he believed the industry
was going, and he was right many more times than he was wrong. But
he wasn't afraid to admit when he was wrong, and that's just part
of what made him a very special man.''
</P>
<P>
   Durwood reveled in some of his quirky traits, such as his
uncanny ability to remember the birth dates of virtually everyone
he ever met and his ability, even in his 70s, to do one-handed
push-ups, a la Jack Palance at the 1992 Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood propelled what eventually became AMC Entertainment Inc.
into one of the largest movie exhibition companies in the world.
Today it has 218 movie theater complexes with 2,729 screens in 23
states and Washington D.C. AMC also has complexes in Japan, Hong
Kong, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Besides building movie houses packed with amenities, including
high-back tilting chairs, retractable armrests with built-in cup
holders and tiered stadium seating, Durwood also had a passion for
saving urban areas. The one closest to his heart was the heart of
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for that effort came from Ruben Bergendoff of the
architectural firm Howard Needles Tammen &AMP; Bergendoff. Bergendoff
gathered a group of businessmen in the early 1960s, put them on a
bus and gave them a tour of the soon-to-open highway system in and
around Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood was impressed. But later, in a private conversation,
Bergendoff pointed out to Durwood that the highway system ran both
ways _ if downtown was allowed to deteriorate, people would quit
coming, and the heart of the city would die.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Durwood pushed to try to revitalize the core
of Kansas City. His efforts weren't always successful.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview, he said: ``The heart of the city is losing
blood; it's losing function and is just down to a handful of office
buildings. It can function as a much bigger thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time of his death, the dream of the Power &AMP; Light
District was closer to becoming a reality. On Wednesday, project
leaders announced some changes to the plans, including constructing
more of it during the first phase and turning the Power &AMP; Light
Building, where AMC has headquarters, into apartments.
</P>
<P>
   City officials mourned Durwood's death but were confident the
project would continue in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood was born Aug. 5, 1920, in Kansas City. He was a graduate
of Harvard University, where he competed on the football and
wrestling teams, and was a former U.S. Air Force lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood received many civic and industry awards, including the
1994 University of Missouri-Kansas City Chancellor's Medal, the
1995 Foundation of the Motion Picture Pioneers ``Pioneer of the
Year'' award and the 1996 National Association of Theater Owners
Robert W. Selig ``ShoWester of the Year'' award.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood is survived by his wife, Pamela Durwood; six children by
his first wife; and 13 grandchildren. Services are pending.

EDITORIAL: IRELAND'S PRECARIOUS PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, July 16: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's main Protestant Unionist party took only 15
minutes on Wednesday to reject London's latest compromise plan for
peace. The rejection effectively shuts down the major aspects of
the peace agreement signed on Good Friday of last year. For now,
there will be no transfer of governing power from London to a local
assembly in Belfast with all parties represented. There will be no
gradual disarmament by the Irish Republican Army. Instead, Northern
Ireland enters a dangerous period when terrorism on both sides
could make future compromise even stickier.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a future for peace, and the current setback should
not obscure how much progress has been made. The British prime
minister, Tony Blair, was able to turn London away from
partisanship and make it a tireless and fair mediator. Gerry Adams
and Martin McGuinness pushed Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
into ``a seismic shift,'' as Blair put it. Sinn Fein agreed to
pursue a united Ireland through politics alone. After years of
claims that the IRA would never disarm, Sinn Fein signaled that the
IRA would do so. And the Unionists and their leader, David Trimble,
stopped demanding that the IRA disarm even before talks began.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, the IRA failed to promise disarmament, as
the Unionists sought. More important, the Unionist rejection
reveals a failure of imagination by the party and especially
Trimble. While the IRA's defiance is disappointing, the peace
agreement does not require it to disarm before Sinn Fein joins
Northern Ireland's government, as Unionists now want. The issue is
also largely symbolic, as most parties in Northern Ireland began as
armed groups. None ever disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The hope for peace now lies in new talks that the British
government wants to start in the fall, after all sides cool down.
It would help, too, if grass-roots organizations on both sides
pressed the politicians to respect the endorsement that voters of
both religions gave to the peace agreement last year. The restraint
shown so far by Catholics and especially Protestants during this
year's summer parade season offers reason for optimism. The people
of Northern Ireland still want peace. The politicians should not
stand in their way.

 &HT;    SouthTrust pays for annoying you
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bank customers love to hate fees.
</P>
<P>
   But one bank that does business in South Florida is turning the
tables. SouthTrust of Birmingham, Ala., is coughing up cash when it
annoys customers.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards include $10 for a mistake or misspelling on a statement,
$5 if the bank doesn't return a customer's phone call by the end of
the day and $1 if a customer has to wait in line for a teller for
more than 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, I don't think anyone is standing there with a
stopwatch,'' said Eris Sandler, senior vice president of
SouthTrust's South Florida operations. ``It's our way of saying we
care about quality service.''
</P>
<P>
   SouthTrust also reimburses customers who find a SouthTrust ATM
isn't working and are forced to pay fees when they use other banks'
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler said she isn't sure how much the bank has paid out in
South Florida, but she said the number is in ``the thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it costs a lot more money to attract a new customer
than to retain existing customers,'' she said.

JUDGMENT AGAINST GM DESERVES A REASSESSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most striking aspect of last week's $4.9 billion judgment
against General Motors was the jurors' apparent failure to consider
the millions of blameless individuals who depend on GM for their
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that the plaintiffs' suffering has been
horrific beyond imagining. Could any juror hear the details of
their story and not be moved to a sympathetic response? Probably
not, but it also goes without saying that those charged with making
judgments about economic justice should do so with a sense of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were said to have reacted to allegations that GM cut
corners on safety to save a few dollars. The result was what is
considered the largest personal-injury award in history: $107.6
million in compensatory damages and $4.8 billion in punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   In making such an award, the jury essentially reduced the entire
GM operation to a relative few company executives it thought should
be taught a lesson no business manager would ever forget. If the
judgment is allowed to stand, which most legal analysts doubt, it
would amount to far more than GM's earnings last year.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone says it serves them right, however, General Motors
should be evaluated in its context as a source of economic
sustenance for millions of people not only in America but also
throughout the world. These are the employees, retirees, those
supplying GM with myriad goods and services, those with nest eggs
invested in GM stock, and all their families.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate entity known as General Motors and a small coterie
of its executives may be blameworthy in this case. The jury in Los
Angeles certainly thought so, but whether those charged with
reviewing the case on appeal will agree with the jury remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens, however, where is the justice of a
penalty that would severely cripple an enterprise on which millions
have an economic dependency ranging from significant to critical?
</P>
<P>
   Does a juror making such a judgment ever think beyond the narrow
confines in which the case is presented? Certainly the jurors in
this case share economic dependencies similar to those whose
fortunes are tied to General Motors. Did they ever stop to think
how they might be affected if another jury made a judgment that
jeopardized their economic survival?
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though the plaintiffs didn't deserve relief. The
most obvious liability, it seems, should have been borne by the
drunken driver who rear-ended the plaintiffs at a speed estimated
at 50 to 70 mph. Reasonable minds may disagree on the structural
integrity of the GM car that became an inferno in the crash.
Nevertheless, it's asking a lot to build a vehicle that provides
reasonable protection when it's hit while standing still by another
vehicle hurtling forward at 50 to 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   A main point of contention in the recent debate over tightening
medical-coverage regulation has been whether to make it easier to
sue managed-care plans and expand the liability parameters.
Proponents say it would make the plans more responsive.
</P>
<P>
   Many damage awards in recent years, however, indicate that such
a move would do more to spur lotterylike lawsuits than enhance the
quality of health care.

REPUBLICANS SEEK PROBE OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid growing evidence that public television
stations in several cities have shared their donor lists with both
political parties, House Republicans Thursday night considered
holding hearings to determine whether any wrongdoing had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   As disclosures that Boston's WGBH-TV shared donors' names with
the Democratic Party touched off a furor on Capitol Hill, two major
public stations, WNET in New York and WETA in Washington, D.C.,
admitted to a similar practice.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Republicans said they suspect numerous other
stations were involved, although at least two members said the WGBH
controversy was reason enough for an ``oversight'' hearing, the
congressional equivalent of an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican, said
the ``proper response to the WGBH illegal activity is oversight
hearings,'' although he could not say which laws might have been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   And Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, the Louisiana
Republican who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees funding
for public broadcasting nationwide, was convinced the three
incidents were ``just the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to call the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
on the carpet and grill them about the process,'' said Ken Johnson,
a spokesman for Tauzin.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee had planned to call WGBH officials to a hearing
Tuesday to question them on the list swap. But  &UR; last night &LR; , on a
lawyer's advice, Tauzin changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be facing some legal consequences as a result of
their actions, and so we've decided not to call them,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting under scrutiny,
the revelation that both parties might have benefited from list
swaps will probably not defuse the issue among Republicans, who
traditionally have been hostile to public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The admission by two more stations that they were involved in
list-swapping with political parties rocked the national
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the umbrella organization that
receives and distributes federal funding for the country's public
television and radio stations, including the Public Broadcasting
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier, public broadcasting had been optimistic about
receiving a significant increase in federal funds, but that now
appears to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coonrod, president of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, condemned even the appearance of wrongdoing among
member stations, saying he was committed to ferreting out the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't condone this practice,'' Coonrod said Thursday. ``We
will work with the Congress as appropriate to make sure it doesn't
continue. Even if stations are in compliance with IRS regulations,
if they are swapping lists with partisan institutions, that could
reasonably be perceived by their viewers as having a partisan slant
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether any of the stations had violated the
law. According to Internal Revenue Service regulations, tax-exempt
organizations _ otherwise known as 501(c)(3)s _ are allowed to sell
or rent their mailing lists to a political organization or
candidate as long as the lists are ``available to all other
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But the definition of ``available'' is undefined. According to
an IRS guide, tax-exempt groups must prove ``that all candidates
were afforded a reasonable opportunity to acquire the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey of Malden, the top Democrat on
the telecommunications subcommittee, insisted the list-sharing was
nonpartisan. ``Across the PBS system many stations viewed Democrats
and Republicans as being potentially valuable sources of income,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the corporation launched its own investigation
after learning the list-sharing was not an isolated incident as it
first seemed.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH had initially said its swap with the Democratic Party was a
onetime occurrence and a mistake, before the Democratic National
Committee revealed the sharing involved thousands of donor names
and had gone on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Cecily Van Praagh, a spokeswoman for WETA-TV in Washington,
acknowledged that the station also traded donor lists with the DNC
and other political organizations, ``both conservative and
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Praagh said the station had not considered that practice a
problem, but will now reevaluate it ``in view of the concern that's
come up with WGBH.''
</P>
<P>
   At a third television station, WNET in New York, dismayed
executives said they discovered Thursday that a ``list broker''
working for the station had shared the names of donors with the
Democratic and Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said the broker had acted without the station's
knowledge and in violation of company policy against making mailing
lists available to political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very upsetting,'' said Paula Kerger, WNET vice
president of development. She said the station launched an internal
examination in response to the WGBH controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Coonrod, learning of the additional stations engaged in the
practice, said: ``I guess this is especially disappointing because
it came as such a surprise. Until today, this seemed like an
isolated incident that happened some time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Committee, spokesman Michael Collins
said, ``To the best of our knowledge, we have never leased any
public TV station donor list.'' He said he could not rule out the
possibility that the RNC leased a tax-deductible organization's
list, but said the party always used ``a list broker and paid
market price for the lists.''
</P>
<P>
   All three stations and the DNC also said they used outside list
brokers for their transactions, reducing their knowledge of which
organizations they were dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH was scrambling to contain the damage. The station contacted
all 350 PBS stations across the country via e-mail, explaining how
the snafu occurred and expressed regret. Station officials also
fielded scores of calls and e-mails from donors and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   At the station's headquarters on Western Avenue in Allston, WGBH
general manager Jonathan Abbott insisted it ``was not a political
conspiracy, not a political collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the errors, he said, was that the station gave what
the DNC says were 12,000 names to the party in 1996. That was a
full two years after the station had prohibited exchanges with
political organizations after discovering a previous arrangement
with the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott and Jeanne M. Hopkins, vice president for communications,
said the 1994 and 1996 violations were committed by staffers within
the development, or fund-raising, office. They said the lists of
donors' names were supplied to the DNC without the knowledge of
senior management.
</P>
<P>
   David Liroff, who was WGBH station manager in 1994, and Steven
Bass, who was station manager in 1996, told the Globe they were not
aware of the sharing of mailing lists with the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh spotlight on WGBH's fund-raising practices falls at an
awkward time for station, which recently launched a $33 million
capital campaign. Part of that would help with the costly
transition to digital broadcasting mandated by the federal
government. Now WGBH has to explain to donors why some of their
names were supplied to a political party for fund-raising purposes.

DEAL SUGGESTED FOR TRADE GROUP POST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ A solution to end the deadlock over the
next head of the World Trade Organization appeared closer Thursday
when a compromise proposal was introduced that would allow the two
contenders to split one term.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, circulated at a meeting of the trade group's
decision-making General Assembly, came two weeks before it adjourns
for August, and there were widespread expectations that the 134
member nations would try to reach a final decision before then.
</P>
<P>
   The divisive process of choosing between Mike Moore, a former
New Zealand prime minister, and Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's
deputy prime minister, has undermined trust among the member
nations of the Geneva-based group, which sets the rules of global
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to divide the director-general's tenure into two
equal parts was introduced by Bangladesh and Australia.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would allow one person to serve as director-general for three
years, from Sept. 1, 1999, to the end of August 2002. The second
three-year term would run from Sept. 1, 2002, to the end of August
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Both Moore and Supachai have indicated publicly that they would
accept such an arrangement. However, some members have criticized
the proposal and it remains unclear how the members would decide
which contender serves first.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization has been leaderless since Renato Ruggiero
left when his four-year term expired at the end of April.

<P>
   Thursday night, Springsteen opened with ``My Love Will Not Let
You Down'' and ``Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, people had been gearing up for the return of
Springsteen, E Street band in tow, giving the event all the
attention worthy of a Super Bowl. There were scads of Internet
sites; detailed reports about dress rehearsals in small New Jersey
clubs, and preparations for the boardwalk-like festival of food
concessions and a beach volleyball court complete with sand hauled
in from, yes, the Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a full-page advertisement Thursday in The
Star-Ledger newspaper, of Newark, N.J., from New Jersey Online,
which said in part: ``We partied to you. We danced in the dark to
you. We hit the parkway to you,'' and ended, ``We have a local hero
thanks to you. Welcome home.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in dozens of interviews in the Meadowlands parking lot
Thursday, many people seemed, for a day at least, to exult in the
fact that they, too, were from New Jersey, and could readily
identify with Springsteen and his songs about working-class life,
yearning and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glory Days'' played to the left. ``Thunder Road,'' coming from
a sports-utility vehicle, played to the right. ``Jungleland,'' all
around.
</P>
<P>
   In the section of the parking lot coded C23, Keith Wells was
sipping a drink with his friend Pete Mooney. Two decades ago, Wells
spent hour after ear-pounding hour worshiping Bruce Springsteen and
the E Street Band on the radio, at his home by the Jersey shore or,
as often as possible, in concert. And when he became an adult, he
said, he took his son Greg, then 9, to his first concert: Bruce, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it was Greg's turn: He had bought a ticket for his
dad as a Father's Day gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to his songs is like talking to an old friend,''
beamed Wells, 51, a computer consultant who lives in Little Silver,
N.J. He was blasting what he said confidently was ``the best
bootleg collection'' of Springsteen songs _ ever _ from the windows
of his green BMW.
</P>
<P>
   A few rows away, Mary Anne Gross was proudly displaying her
``Jersey Girl'' T-shirt, which she said she bought about a dozen
years ago, as a reminder of her devotion to that song and to
Springsteen. Three years ago, she married Alex Tannucilli, who was
her equal as a Springsteen fanatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks for the entire Jersey experience. The entire
experience of being born between two megalopolises,'' said
Tannucilli, who, like his wife, is 56. ``He's the poet king, and he
gives back to his fans.''

REPUBLICANS SEEK PROBE OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid growing evidence that public television
stations in several cities have shared their donor lists with both
political parties, House Republicans Thursday night considered
holding hearings to determine whether any wrongdoing had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   As disclosures that Boston's WGBH-TV shared donors' names with
the Democratic Party touched off a furor on Capitol Hill, two major
public stations, WNET in New York and WETA in Washington, D.C.,
admitted to a similar practice.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Republicans said they suspect numerous other
stations were involved, although at least two members said the WGBH
controversy was reason enough for an ``oversight'' hearing, the
congressional equivalent of an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican, said
the ``proper response to the WGBH illegal activity is oversight
hearings,'' although he could not say which laws might have been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   And Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, the Louisiana
Republican who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees funding
for public broadcasting nationwide, was convinced the three
incidents were ``just the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to call the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
on the carpet and grill them about the process,'' said Ken Johnson,
a spokesman for Tauzin.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee had planned to call WGBH officials to a hearing
Tuesday to question them on the list swap. But  &UR; last night &LR; , on a
lawyer's advice, Tauzin changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be facing some legal consequences as a result of
their actions, and so we've decided not to call them,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting under scrutiny,
the revelation that both parties might have benefited from list
swaps will probably not defuse the issue among Republicans, who
traditionally have been hostile to public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The admission by two more stations that they were involved in
list-swapping with political parties rocked the national
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the umbrella organization that
receives and distributes federal funding for the country's public
television and radio stations, including the Public Broadcasting
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier, public broadcasting had been optimistic about
receiving a significant increase in federal funds, but that now
appears to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coonrod, president of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, condemned even the appearance of wrongdoing among
member stations, saying he was committed to ferreting out the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't condone this practice,'' Coonrod said Thursday. ``We
will work with the Congress as appropriate to make sure it doesn't
continue. Even if stations are in compliance with IRS regulations,
if they are swapping lists with partisan institutions, that could
reasonably be perceived by their viewers as having a partisan slant
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether any of the stations had violated the
law. According to Internal Revenue Service regulations, tax-exempt
organizations _ otherwise known as 501(c)(3)s _ are allowed to sell
or rent their mailing lists to a political organization or
candidate as long as the lists are ``available to all other
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   But the definition of ``available'' is undefined. According to
an IRS guide, tax-exempt groups must prove ``that all candidates
were afforded a reasonable opportunity to acquire the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey of Malden, the top Democrat on
the telecommunications subcommittee, insisted the list-sharing was
nonpartisan. ``Across the PBS system many stations viewed Democrats
and Republicans as being potentially valuable sources of income,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the corporation launched its own investigation
after learning the list-sharing was not an isolated incident as it
first seemed.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH had initially said its swap with the Democratic Party was a
onetime occurrence and a mistake, before the Democratic National
Committee revealed the sharing involved thousands of donor names
and had gone on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Cecily Van Praagh, a spokeswoman for WETA-TV in Washington,
acknowledged that the station also traded donor lists with the DNC
and other political organizations, ``both conservative and
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Praagh said the station had not considered that practice a
problem, but will now reevaluate it ``in view of the concern that's
come up with WGBH.''
</P>
<P>
   At a third television station, WNET in New York, dismayed
executives said they discovered Thursday that a ``list broker''
working for the station had shared the names of donors with the
Democratic and Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said the broker had acted without the station's
knowledge and in violation of company policy against making mailing
lists available to political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very upsetting,'' said Paula Kerger, WNET vice
president of development. She said the station launched an internal
examination in response to the WGBH controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Coonrod, learning of the additional stations engaged in the
practice, said: ``I guess this is especially disappointing because
it came as such a surprise. Until today, this seemed like an
isolated incident that happened some time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican National Committee, spokesman Michael Collins
said, ``To the best of our knowledge, we have never leased any
public TV station donor list.'' He said he could not rule out the
possibility that the RNC leased a tax-deductible organization's
list, but said the party always used ``a list broker and paid
market price for the lists.''
</P>
<P>
   All three stations and the DNC also said they used outside list
brokers for their transactions, reducing their knowledge of which
organizations they were dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH was scrambling to contain the damage. The station contacted
all 350 PBS stations across the country via e-mail, explaining how
the snafu occurred and expressed regret. Station officials also
fielded scores of calls and e-mails from donors and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   At the station's headquarters on Western Avenue in Allston, WGBH
general manager Jonathan Abbott insisted it ``was not a political
conspiracy, not a political collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the errors, he said, was that the station gave what
the DNC says were 12,000 names to the party in 1996. That was a
full two years after the station had prohibited exchanges with
political organizations after discovering a previous arrangement
with the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott and Jeanne M. Hopkins, vice president for communications,
said the 1994 and 1996 violations were committed by staffers within
the development, or fund-raising, office. They said the lists of
donors' names were supplied to the DNC without the knowledge of
senior management.
</P>
<P>
   David Liroff, who was WGBH station manager in 1994, and Steven
Bass, who was station manager in 1996, told the Globe they were not
aware of the sharing of mailing lists with the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh spotlight on WGBH's fund-raising practices falls at an
awkward time for station, which recently launched a $33 million
capital campaign. Part of that would help with the costly
transition to digital broadcasting mandated by the federal
government. Now WGBH has to explain to donors why some of their
names were supplied to a political party for fund-raising purposes.

FIRST LADY IS PLEDGED $25 MILLION FOR RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Settling in for what is shaping up to be the
costliest congressional contest in the nation's history, 75 New
York Democrats sat down for breakfast with Hillary Rodham Clinton
Thursday and pledged to raise $25 million to finance her expected
race for senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed, the Clinton campaign would set a new record:
raising more from contributors than any other non-incumbent Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As the lawyers, media executives and business leaders made their
pledges at a midtown law office, the first lady also mailed more
than 1 million appeals to prospective Democratic contributors
across the nation, her associates said. The size of the mailing
dwarfed anything attempted in any congressional campaign in recent
memory, Democrats said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years I have written to you on behalf of Democratic
candidates and causes,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in her two-page letter.
``Today, I am writing to make a more personal request.'' She went
on to say, ``For three decades I have been a strong advocate for
the causes I believe in, and I believe I can be a strong advocate
for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the letter and the fund-raising plan leave
little doubt that the race to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan could
shatter campaign financing records.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton meets the $25 million goal _ and Democrats and
Republicans Thursday predicted that she would _ her campaign would
surpass the record set by Oliver L. North in 1994, when he raised
$20.7 million for his unsuccessful Senate bid in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   And if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City or another
Republican candidate comes close to matching Mrs. Clinton's success
in raising funds _ and Democrats and Republicans Thursday predicted
that some Republican would _ the race could break the $44 million
spending record set in the California Senate race of 1994, when
Michael Huffington spent $30 million, most of it out of his own
pocket, in his unsuccessful campaign against Sen. Diane Feinstein.
The second most-expensive race was in New York last year, when
Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, defeated Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, a
Republican. Spending in that contest reached about $40.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most first-time candidates, Mrs. Clinton will not have to
spend any money to introduce herself to voters. However, her
supporters said Thursday, the first lady expects to spend large
sums to address, presumably with television advertisements,
unfavorable perceptions among a good portion of the New York
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans across the nation have begun making
their own requests for money to help finance an effort to defeat
Mrs. Clinton, adding to the pressure Mrs. Clinton's supporters said
they felt to raise money in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Giuliani said they were unconcerned about Mrs.
Clinton's fund-raising intentions. ``We will match the Democratic
candidate for the Senate in fund raising,'' said John H. Gross, the
mayor's treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, before Giuliani reaches the point of matching Mrs.
Clinton, he has to get past a well-financed challenge to the
nomination within his own party. Giuliani now has less money on
hand for a Senate run than Rep. Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, his
relatively unknown rival for the Republican nomination, aides to
both men said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In federal campaign filings to be released at the end of the
month, Giuliani is expected to report having about $2.6 million on
hand, compared with more than $3 million for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   However, Giuliani has been raising money in recent months at a
far faster clip than Lazio, whose total is bolstered by more than
$1.8 million carried over from his Congressional campaign
committees in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's fund-raising meeting was held in a conference
room at the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP;
Flom, at the invitation of a partner, Morris N. Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   The session was led by Alan J. Patricof, the New York venture
capitalist who has been one of the president's most loyal
supporters, and by Terence McAuliffe, a close friend of Clinton who
raised $27 million for the Clinton-Gore campaign in just seven
months in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to participants, it was Patricof who set the $25
million goal. That figure was embraced by the participants, who
agreed to meet monthly.

SENATE CLEARS GOP'S SCALED-DOWN HEALTH BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's Republican majority Thursday night
approved new protections for 48 million members of employer-run
health plans after defeating Democratic efforts to guarantee far
broader rights to 161 million health-care consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the final act of a four-day drama whose epilogue will
probably include a presidential veto and political skirmishes in
the 2000 elections, Senate Republicans passed their scaled-down
version of The Patients' Bill of Rights Act, 53-47. Only two GOP
members, Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Peter G.
Fitzgerald of Illinois, joined the unified Democratic minority in
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans never sustained more than three defections as they
narrowly prevailed in more than a dozen votes over four days of a
wide range of patient protection issues. They effectively gutted
and cast aside the Democratic package before adopting their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up with a very good package, a very defensible
package, one that's proven not only to have the votes but one that
I think will make positive contributions for making affordable
quality health care for all Americans,'' said the assistant
majority leader, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, who spearheaded the
Republican initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, consumer groups, and medical organizations
assailed the GOP measure as a passel of meager regulations crafted
to appease the health insurance industry, which spent millions of
dollars fighting the Democratic proposal with lobbyists and
advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is poised to exert similar pressure as the
legislation moves to the Republican-controlled House, where its
passage is less certain than it was in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day for health care in America,'' Clinton said
before the final vote. ``But we're not done yet and this won't
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in a last-minute plea for the Democratic
plan in a news conference outside the Senate chamber, reiterated
Clinton's threat to veto the GOP measure and keep the issue alive
for the coming elections. ``It has zero chance of going past his
desk because it's a fraud,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the chief architect of the Democratic
plan, held out hope that Senate Democrats had cast the debate
favorably enough to create momentum for broader health insurance
regulations in the House. ``This is a Pyrrhic victory for the
Republicans,'' Kennedy said. ``If they keep taking marching orders
from the HMOs, they'll keep losing public support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan provides greater access to emergency rooms,
specialists, medications, and clinical trials for cancer patients.
The measure requires health insurers to provide inpatient treatment
for mastectomy patients if their doctors deem it necessary,
effectively preventing ``drive-by mastectomies'' that are peformed
on an outpatient basis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the GOP bill provides an array of tax provisions
aimed at increasing access to health coverage for 43 million
uninsured consumers. The provisions include permitting the
self-employed to fully deduct their health insurance and allowing
company employees to fully deduct long-term care insurance that is
not subsidized by their employers.
</P>
<P>
   The measures would reduce federal tax revenues by $3.5 billion
over five years, and Republican leaders were not clear about how
they would offset the loss.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of the GOP bill would permit patients to appeal
decisions by their insurance companies to review boards staffed by
physicians. The appeals process contrasts with the Democratic
proposal to permit patients to sue their insurers in federal or
state courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe 10 years from now, when our proposal is in effect,
that the American people are going to believe that this was a very
important bill we adopted in the Senate tonight,'' said Senator
Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican and leading foe of the Democratic
plan. ``It is going to mean better health care, it's going to mean
greater access to health care, it's going to mean more freedom. And
it's going to mean that when you're sick, you're going to get an
opportunity to see a doctor, not an opportunity to suffer some
permanent injury and then get to see a lawyer and file a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, citing myriad horror stories involving patients who
had suffered dire consequences, including deaths, because of
alleged abuses by their insurers, decried the GOP move to prevent
patients from suing their insurers. ``Patients should not have to
play a game of Russian roulette to the health care they need and
deserve,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also criticized the Republican plan for generally
protecting only the 48 million members of self-funded health plans
that are run by the employees's companies rather than the insurance
industry. The Democratic plan would have extended federal
protections to 75 million consumers whose employers pay an
insurance company or HMO to provide coverage, 23 million state and
local employees, and 15 million individuals who pay for insurance
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate has missed a golden opportunity to pass a real
Patients' Bill of Rights,'' said the minority leader, Thomas A.
Daschle. ``Instead, the Republican majority is handing the
insurance industry its version of HMO reform: Half Measures Only.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that the Democratic plan would have raised
insurance premiums 6 percent over five years, forcing 1.8 million
individuals off the insurance rolls. The GOP plan would increase
premiums an estimated 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt by Chafee to broker a last-minute, bipartisan
compromise failed when he was unable to secure the 51 votes he
needed to force a vote on the measure. One of Chafee's top
Democratic allies, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, said the
bipartisan measure's death ``doomed 161 million Americans to yet
another year of inadequate managed care coverage.''

55 PERCENT RISE IN BOEING PROFITS FAR EXCEEDS PREDICTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. delivered stronger-than-expected earnings for the
second consecutive quarter Thursday and raised its estimates of
future profits, giving its beleaguered investors new hope after two
years of disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company and the nation's
largest exporter, said its profits rose 55 percent during the
quarter, easily surpassing Wall Street's estimates. Executives
attributed the strong results to the improved efficiency of
Boeing's commercial airplane business and a reduction in research
and development costs.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing earned $701 million, or 75 cents a diluted share,
compared with $258 million, or 26 cents a share, in the quarter a
year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $15.1 billion from $13.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a $181 million gain from a tax settlement, Boeing
earned 56 cents a share during the quarter. Analysts had expected
the company to earn 48 cents a share, according to the First Call
Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Boeing, which had risen sharply this week, fell 87.5
cents, to $46.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very positive news,'' said Joseph F. Campbell, a
managing director at Lehman Brothers, ``but it does need to be kept
in the context of where we are coming from and where we need to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Boeing had racked up record sales of its
jetliners. Analysts predicted that the company would earn as much
as $5 a share in 2000. But production difficulties and other
setbacks forced the company to take $4 billion in charges, causing
its stock price to plunge. The consensus profit estimate for 2000
compiled by First Call was $1.81 a share Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Boeing installed new management to run its
commercial airplane division and began improving its performance.
Led largely by a turnaround in the commercial airplane unit, net
profit margins for the company during the second quarter were 4.6
percent, up from 1.9 percent the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said Thursday that it had raised its estimates of profit
margins for the full year to between 5 percent and 5.5 percent from
a previous estimate of 4 percent to 5 percent. Next year's estimate
was also raised to between 5 percent and 6 percent, up from 4
percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the company still faces a decline in earnings next year when
revenue is expected to fall by $10 billion as deliveries of
jetliners decline to 480 from a record 620 this year. Deborah
Hopkins, Boeing's new chief financial officer, said Thursday that
the company would try to cushion investors by maintaining flat
earnings in 2000 despite the big drop in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aggressive but it is not a goal we shouldn't go for,''
she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday, the company also released four measures _ what it
called a ``value scorecard'' _ as part of its effort to regain
credibility with investors.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are part of a broader, company-wide effort led by
Ms. Hopkins to get all of Boeing's disparate operations to focus on
improving their financial performance. The four measures that will
be provided to the public each quarter include annual inventory
turnover, the size of Boeing's real estate, its number of suppliers
and the amount by which it has reduced its expenses.
</P>
<P>
   To give investors a way to measure the company's progress, Ms.
Hopkins Thursday revealed both short-term and long-term goals in
each category. She also said that the company intended to achieve
double-digit profit margins in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to operational improvements, Boeing also seems to be
encouraged by a faster than expected turnaround in Asia, where some
of its most important customers were forced to retrench after the
severe economic downturn in the region in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am slightly more optimistic about Asia today than I was
three months ago,'' said Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and
chief executive, speaking to reporters. He cited improvements in
Korea as well as ``some positive signs'' in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing said that it would decrease production of its
747 jumbo jet to one a month next year because of declining demand
in Asia. Now, the company is hinting that it may be able to sustain
production of the 747, which is its most profitable airplane, at
two a month. A final decision will be made in August.

LESLIE ALEXIS MARCHAND, LEADING BIOGRAPHER OF BYRON, DIES AT 99  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla., Wash.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leslie Alexis Marchand, considered the leading authority on the
poet Lord Byron, died on Sunday at his home in Englewood, Fla. He
was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand's lifelong pursuit of Byron, an elusive figure who
described himself as ``being everything by turns and nothing
long,'' began in 1935 while he researched his dissertation, ``The
Athenaeum: A Mirror of Victorian Culture,'' a historical study of
the British independent literary magazine for which he received a
doctorate from Columbia University in 1940.

   While teaching a course in Romanticism at Rutgers University,
whose faculty he had joined in 1937, Marchand recognized the need
for a first-rate biography of Byron. In 1947, he embarked on what
he called his ``Byron pilgrimage,'' journeying from the London
offices of Sir John Murray, a descendant of Byron's publisher to
Missolonghi in Greece, where Byron died in 1824, to Jannina, on the
Albanian frontier, where Byron and his friend J.C. Hobhouse had
visited the Turkish ruler Ali Pasha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron: A Biography'' was published in three volumes by Alfred
A. Knopf in 1957. The result of more than a decade of research, the
work totaled 1,264 pages, exclusive of notes and index.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Simpson of the Hudson Review called the work ``a triumph
of scholarship, thorough, intelligent and impartial.'' W.H. Auden
also praised it, writing in The New Yorker, ``the meticulous
scholarship is there, all right, but Marchand has digested it, and
despite an occasional ponderous phrase like ``his natatorial
skill,'' his three volumes . . . are as fascinating to read as they
are informative, and, as a biography of the poet, as nearly
definitive as any such book can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a French-speaking homesteader and his wife, Marchand
was born in the small town of Bridgeport, Wash., near the Columbia
River. He attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where
he studied journalism. He enrolled at Columbia University in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from Rutgers in 1966, Marchand set out to create
a comprehensive collection of Byron's personal writings, to
``reproduce Byron's letters as they were written,'' he later wrote.
This endeavor occupied him from 1968 to 1982 and resulted in the
12-volume ``Byron's Letters and Journals.''
</P>
<P>
   His collection included about 1,700 previously unpublished
letters by Byron _ some 100 of which Marchand discovered _ and
whenever possible supplied the passages that previous collections
had deleted and corrected countless errors in dating. Moreover,
after comparing more than 80 percent of the letters against their
original manuscript versions, Marchand restored Byron's often
idiosyncratic punctuation, spelling and capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand received two significant awards for his work, the James
Russell Lowell Prize of the Modern Language Association in 1973 and
the Ivan Sandrof Award of the National Book Critics Circle in 1982.
The latter had been awarded only once before, to Flannery O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Marchand published ``What Comes Uppermost,'' a
supplemental volume of ``Byron's Letters and Journals'' that
contained letters discovered since the completion of the original
12 volumes in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marion, of Englewood, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the 1980s what had aroused his interest in Byron and
sustained his studies for more than 40 years, Marchand replied:
``Byron is a fascinating character and I have never found him dull.
I can read over his `Don Juan' and his letters dozens of times
without yawning. He was a superb letter writer, spontaneous, frank,
self-honest and witty, and his sane and humane and tolerant view of
the world is refreshing, when contrasted with so much cant and
dishonesty and pretension. Byron speaks with the voice of the
disillusioned modern world more than with that of the 19th
century.''

GRAF, FEELING ILL, BOWS OUT OF THIRD SET WITH CAPRIATI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHWAH, N.J. _ Steffi Graf had moved Jennifer Capriati all over
the court Thursday night at the A.&AMP;P. Tennis Classic, her wicked
backhands delivered with the crushing swing of a samurai sword.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, at match point, leading by 40-0 and 5-3 in the
second set, it unraveled for Graf, the defending champion and a
six-time winner of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, on the comeback trail in more ways than one, went on
to win the second set and take the first game of the third set. She
had lost the opening set by 7-5 and had survived five match points.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, which had rooted for Graf, then turned to Capriati,
who has not won this tournament since 1993, when personal and legal
problems began for her.
</P>
<P>
   But after losing that first game of the final set, Graf went to
the sideline and told the umpire that she could not continue. She
``retired'' in tennis parlance. But just for the night, presumably.
</P>
<P>
   An official said later that Graf had told him she became ill
from a medication she was taking for the bronchitis. It caused her
to bow out of her scheduled semifinal mixed doubles match with John
McEnroe at Wimbledon earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Graf went on to play in the singles championship and lost to
Lindsay Davenport. This was her first match since Wimbledon. In
subsequent interviews, she has sent mixed signals about her plans
to retire completely sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   For Capriati, who appeared to be overmatched midway through
Thursday night's second set, this was the first time she had
defeated Graf since the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati advanced to Saturday's semifinals, where she will face
the winner of Friday's match between Nicole Pratt and Erica deLone.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, it was a thrill-a-minute for 95 minutes of
action before Graf quit. Capriati vainly tried to bring her newly
acquired style of rushing the net into the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's very hard against Steffi Graf,'' Capriati said later.
</P>
<P>
   She is barely ranked in the top 50 and in Graf she was facing a
player ranked third in the world. Capriati valiantly returned shot
after shot from between the baselines, but the pounding forced her
into too many errors.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed a goner, in fact, as Graf, winning seven of the last
nine games, surged to the 5-3 lead and match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the match went on I got a little loose,'' Capriati said.
</P>
<P>
   At age 23, once a famous teen-age pro, she is now a year into
her comeback. ``All the players are younger now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament organizers presented the 30-year-old Graf with
several gifts before the match, which presumably is leading to her
permanent retirement, perhaps after the U.S. Open in September. The
gifts included a rocking chair inscribed with her major victories.
</P>
<P>
   She could watch next year's French Open, which she won in June,
sitting in the chair, she was told. &QL;

VARGAS RAISES PROFILE

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ You know you've made it when your likeness covers
the side of a six-story building.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas, the IBF junior middleweight champion from
Oxnard, has signed a three-year promotional contract with Miller
Brewing Co. He's part of its ``Think When You Drink'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to paint a much-larger-than-life image of him on a
building near the intersection of the 10 and 110 freeways in
downtown Los Angeles as part of the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also be depicted in point-of-sale displays and make
personal appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, at only 21 and with 16 professional fights behind him,
is one of the few members of the boxing community to enter the
lucrative world of product endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' he said. ``I know not every fighter gets
these type of endorsements. I just thank God I'm able to provide
for my family. That's what I strive for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I want to be great in this sport, but I care about
my family a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Vargas?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an up-and-coming fighter and he has strong ties to the
Southern California area. We're looking to do some important things
in that market,'' Miller spokesman Marc Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And outside the ring he handles himself well. He's the whole
package.''

STANLEY DURWOOD, INVENTOR OF MULTIPLEX, DIES AT 78  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Conn., Mass., Calif.)   By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley H. Durwood, an entertainment industry executive who is
credited with inventing the multiplex movie theater, died Wednesday
night at his Kansas City, Mo., home after a two-year illness. He
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was esophageal cancer, according to a statement from
AMC Entertainment, the international movie theater chain Durwood
built from a family business founded in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood's version of how he first got the notion of combining
multiple screening rooms into a single theater has entered into
Hollywood folklore. The inspiration first hit in the early 1950s,
after his family theater chain had acquired the 600-seat Roxy
Theater in downtown Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing in the lobby the third week after we took over
the theater, and we were running an Abbott and Costello picture,''
he recalled in a 1998 profile for Variety. The film was doing so
poorly that he had closed the balcony to avoid having to place an
usher there. ``I thought, `If we could just run another so-so
picture up in the balcony, we'd double our gross.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, with television emptying out the grand movie
palaces that had sprung up in the 1930s, he had acquired several
giant Kansas City theaters and cut them into several small movie
theaters. Then, in 1963, he built the first theater originally
designed as a multiplex, in the Ward Parkway shopping center in
south Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Durwood's company built its first four-screen complex;
a six-screen complex followed in 1969. The rest, as they say in
Hollywood, was history. The concept ``echoes all around the
world,'' a Metro-Golden-Mayer executive told Daily Variety in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like punching a hole in the floor of your living room
and oil coming out,'' Durwood later recalled. ``I figured I had
about five years to run with the ball before the big guys would
overtake me.''
</P>
<P>
   His innovations have been widely credited by the motion picture
industry with helping to rescue the business from the onslaughts of
both television and the videocassette recorder. In 1993, the
Foundation of Motion Picture Pioneers honored him as Pioneer of the
Year, an honor which had previously gone to such household names as
Darryl F. Zanuck and Cecil B. De Mille.
</P>
<P>
   The multiplex was not Durwood's only innovative contribution to
the moviegoing public: he also is credited with inventing the
arm-rest cup holder, whose introduction reflected his determination
to make a night at the movies so pleasant it would pull people away
from their television sets and into his theaters.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he began to see his multiple-screen theater
concept as a magnet that could also pull people out of the suburbs
and into the center cities. Under his guidance as chief executive,
AMC has begun to develop huge theater entertainment centers in
once-rundown urban neighborhoods, from Times Square in New York
City to ``beautiful downtown Burbank'' in California, once the butt
of television talk-show jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood was born Aug. 5, 1920, in Kansas City. He was the son of
Edward Dubinsky, a silver-haired actor-turned-entrepreneur who
built a small chain of about a dozen movie houses and drive-in
theaters. The business prospered, as did the family, which later
changed its name to Durwood.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood was educated at Harvard. After serving as a navigator in
the Army Air Forces during World War II, he returned to his
birthplace in 1945 and joined the family business. After his
father's death in 1960, he began to steer the company toward the
pursuit of worldwide growth. In 1968 he changed the company's name
to American Multi-Cinema, which has become today's AMC
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood is survived by his wife, Pamela Yax Durwood of Kansas
City; a sister, Marjorie Durwood Grant, also of Kansas City; a
brother, Richard Durwood, of Mission Hills, Kan.; and six children,
Carol Journagan, of Blue Springs, Mo.; Edward D. Durwood, of
Shawnee Mission, Kan.; Thomas A. Durwood, of Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif.; Brian D. Durwood, of Corte Madera, Calif.; Elissa Grodin,
of Wilton, Conn., and Peter J. Durwood, of New York City. He is
also survived by 13 grandchildren.

EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE ON LAWSUITS OVER HEALTH CARE  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from remarks by Democratic
Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and
Republicans Slade Gorton of Washington and Rick Santorum of
Pennsylvania in Thursday's debate on a patients' bill of rights as
transcribed by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Reid: There are basically two groups of people who can't be
sued: foreign diplomats and HMOs. That isn't the way it should be.
...
</P>
<P>
   And HMOs ... if they've been involved directly in dictating,
denying or delaying care for a patient, it can use a loophole in
what we call Erisa, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, to
avoid any responsibility for the consequences of its actions. The
American people simply do not support that.
</P>
<P>
   Erisa was designed to protect employees when they lose pension
benefits due to fraud, mismanagement and employer bankruptcies,
which occurred so often during the '60s. The law now has the effect
of allowing an HMO to deny or delay care with no effective remedy
for patients. What they're trying to do is strike a provision from
our bill which simply insures that HMOs can be held accountable for
their actions, a responsibility owed by every other industry to
consumers. ...
</P>
<P>
   All we wanted to do is make the law apply to HMOs like everyone
else. ...
</P>
<P>
   Durbin:
</P>
<P>
   This is the heart of the debate. This is what the patients' bill
of rights is all about. The insurance companies hate the idea of
being sued in court like the devil hates holy water. They don't
want to be held accountable for their actions. They want to be
protected so that they can make the wrong decision when it comes to
medical care for American families and never, never be held
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment being offered on the Republican side is an effort
to take away from 123 million Americans the right to hold
health-insurance companies accountable. That is the bottom line,
123 million Americans will be denied an opportunity to go to court
when the health-insurance company makes a decision which costs them
their health or their life. Most people are stunned to know that
you can't take a health-insurance company to court.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, a federal law has protected health-insurance
companies from being sued. And what does that mean? When your
doctor wants a certain procedure, a certain medicine, a certain
specialist for your good or the good of your family, and that
doctor is overruled by a health company, health-insurance company
bureaucrat, the doctor is the only one who will be taken to court,
not the health-insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   If we pass nothing else in this patients' bill of rights but
this section which said that health-insurance companies will be
held accountable in court, I would tell you it will be a major
victory for America. I trust the judgment of 12 citizens of this
country in a jury box to decide the fairness and legality of an
issue. ...
</P>
<P>
   For the last two days Senator Kennedy, Senator Reid and all of
my colleagues have brought stories to the floor, chilling,
heart-breaking stories. Here's one: Florence Corcoran. Let me quote
Florence Corcoran. ``They let a clerk thousands of miles away make
a life-threatening decision about my life and my baby's life
without even seeing me and overruled five of my doctors. They don't
get held accountable, and that's what appalls me. I relive that all
the time. Insurance companies don't answer to nobody,'' Florence
Corcoran says. ...
</P>
<P>
   Well if you're listening to this debate you think, well surely
there must be a long roster of companies in America that receive
the same kind of immunity from liability, that can't be brought to
court. No. This is it, folks. This is the only sector of the
American economy, maybe the only sector in America that is going to
be allowed to be held above the law. The Republican majority and
the health-insurance industry is determined to protect their
immunity from a lawsuit so that Florence Corcoran whose life and
the life of her baby was threatened by a decision by a
health-insurance company cannot even take that health-insurance
company to court. ...
</P>
<P>
   The state of Texas passed a patients' bill of rights. Said you
could take the health-insurance company in court for certain
insured people in Texas. Well you would think from the arguments
from the Republican side that the sky fell on Texas two years ago.
It didn't happen. You know how many lawsuits have been filed since
this law was enacted? A law which Governor Bush vetoed and the
legislature overrode his veto on? Three lawsuits. Three lawsuits in
two years. Does that sound like we're flooding the courts? But I'll
tell you something, in that state for those who are protected by
that law, I'll bet you there's been a change in the way that they
do business.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton:
</P>
<P>
   President, nothing could more dramatically illustrate the
difference in general attitudes and attitudes toward health care
between the senator from Massachusetts and the members on this side
than his statement that his bill was preferable to ours because it
would only cost the American people $7 billion while ours would
cost the American people $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of course, overwhelmingly, the costs of his bill will
be evidenced in higher taxes on the American people. His so-called
costs of our bill are in fact the reduction of taxes on the
American people so that they can use their own money to make more
of their own health-care costs. But to the senator from
Massachusetts, it's the same thing. More taxes or less taxes. We do
not think that that is the same thing by any stretch of the
imagination. In addition, of course, he ignores entirely as costs
the costs imposed on the American people by paying higher
health-insurance premiums. Those, presumably, are irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But the subject before us primarily is lawsuits. There is
widespread agreement, even in this body and across the United
States, that the medical malpractice system is simply broken; that
it comes too late, that it costs so much, that less than half of
the dollars that it costs ever get to victims and the rest are
consumed by lawyers and by the administration of the system itself.
The problem is, of course, we have never come up with a majority
for a way in which to fix that medical malpractice system. But the
proposition that it is broken is very, very widely held.
</P>
<P>
   It is into that broken system that the Democrats' plan pours
another element of our health-care system and says, oh, the system
may be broken but the only solution is to make it worse, is to make
it more widespread, pouring good wine into a broken bottle. With
what impact? Better health care? No. We know that the medical
malpractice system doesn't create more and better health care. More
lawsuits? Clearly, yes. One aspect of that broken system, of
course, is that the cost gets not into providing better health care
for the people of the country but into the system itself. But the
patients, ultimately, the people who buy insurance, the people who
consume health care, pay the entire bill, including all of the
bills for the lawyers. What impact? Higher costs for everyone who
is insured. And therefore fewer insured.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum: A lot has been said about you can't sue your HMO. Here
are three Federal Circuit Court cases and 12 Federal District Court
cases who said that Erisa does not pre-empt state law when you want
to sue your HMO for malpractice. ...
</P>
<P>
   So the issue is not whether you can sue your HMO. That's not why
we're so adamantly against the provision in the Kennedy bill. It is
not to be able to sue your HMO. I don't have any problem with you
being able to sue your HMO. What I do have a problem with is what
this bill does is allow you to sue your employer ... for a decision
made by an HMO, by an insurance company. What will that mean? ...
</P>
<P>
   I've talked to dozens, dozens of employers who said if you are
going to open up the books of my corporation, and I make widgets,
or I make steel, or I make desks, or I make pencils, and you're
going to open up my books for my employees to sue me for a decision
my insurance company that I hired made, I can't afford, I'm not in
the business of health care. I'm not managing these health-care
decisions. I hired someone to do that, but I'm going to get sued
for their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, as much as I'd love to provide group health insurance to
you, I can't allow our corporation, our effort to be jeopardized by
a decision that someone outside of what I do made. I can't let it
happen. ...
</P>
<P>
   Who would be the first person, once these employers drop their
insurance as a result of this bill, who would be the first person
to run to the Senate floor and say these nasty employers, look at
them they're dropping their insurance. We need the government to
take over the health-care system. Yes, the senator from
Massachusetts would be the first person here on the Senate floor
calling for a government health-care system.

CONGRESSMAN DEMANDS INQUIRY OF PIPELINE SAFETY AFTER ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pointing to the deaths of three people when an oil
pipeline exploded in Bellingham last month, a top member of
Congress on Thursday demanded a wide-ranging congressional
investigation into the federal government's regulation of pipeline
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The demand by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., came on the same day
that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., summoned Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater to her office seeking stepped-up inspections of
pipelines in Washington state and assurances that there would be no
rush to reopen the Bellingham pipeline, about 90 miles north of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, whose department is responsible for pipeline safety,
pledged not to allow Olympic Pipe Line to reopen the pipe until he
can guarantee its safety, and promised to consider Murray's request
that he permanently station a federal pipeline inspector in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   But Slater also defended the administration's handling of
pipeline safety, and rejected suggestions that his department's
Office of Pipeline Safety is too close to the oil and gas industry
it is supposed to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an administration guided by a president and a vice
president that say we're going to put the American people first,''
Slater said after meeting with Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that we're not going to work in partnership
with industry and with safety advocates, but I can assure you that
our meeting today has been focused on the people who are involved
here, and that's what our commitment is. We will work with
industry; we will regulate industry in a way that protects the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The actions by Dingell and Murray mark the first public steps
members of Congress have taken in response to the June 10 explosion
in Bellingham, when Olympic's 16-inch pipeline ruptured, sending
hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline into Whatcom Creek.
Gasoline vapor ignited, burning two 10-year-old boys to death. A
teenager died after he was overcome by fumes, fell in the creek and
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion is likely to be explored in depth by Congress,
which has just begun debating the renewal of the nation's pipeline
safety laws, which expire next year.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who toured the Bellingham site last Friday, pledged to
play an active role in the debate over renewal of pipeline safety
laws, even though she does not sit on a committee with jurisdiction
over the office. She said she pushed Slater not to reopen the
Olympic pipeline too quickly, to station an inspector permanently
in Washington state and to support right-to-know actions that would
alert communities to potential pipeline safety problems.
</P>

   ``I expressed to him my desire to work with him to make sure
that we do everything we can to make sure this community is safe
before the pipeline reopens, and also to prospectively do
everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen anywhere
again,'' Murray said. ``I intend to be working on the pipeline
reauthorization bill to make sure we are doing everything we can
... and I will be looking at whether or not we should improve the
standards, or the reporting requirements, or the community's right
to know about any anomalies that exist in the pipeline or any
safety conditions that exist in their neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater said Olympic Pipe Line will have to take numerous
corrective actions before being allowed to reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not plan to reopen this pipeline until the standards
have been met, until we can ensure the safety of the pipeline for
the people there in Bellingham,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Murray's request that he station an inspector in
Washington, Slater said, ``we will consider that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 55 federal inspectors responsible for inspecting all
interstate pipelines in the United States, and states employ
another 250 inspectors to handle intrastate pipelines. Of the 55
federal inspectors, 10 are responsible for the Western United
States, including eight in Denver and two in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell, the longest-serving member of the House, is a longtime
critic of pipeline safety and the top Democrat on the House
Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Office of
Pipeline Safety. Late Thursday he sent a detailed letter to the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
seeking a broad investigation of the Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell cited not only the June 10 Bellingham accident, but also
a 1994 pipeline explosion in New Jersey that destroyed an apartment
complex and a 1993 leak in Virginia that caused environmental and
property damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the effectiveness of current law remains unclear, so too
does the effectiveness of the agency charged with administering
that law, the Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline
Safety,'' Dingell wrote. ``Congress, for its part, must try to
ensure that our pipeline safety laws and the agency charged with
enforcing those laws are working in a manner that protects the
public and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell asked the GAO to review virtually every allegation made
by the numerous critics of the Office of Pipeline Safety. He also
asked the GAO to determine the validity of accusations that the
Office of Pipeline Safety has ignored directives from Congress and
recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell also called upon the GAO to determine whether there were
actions the Office of Pipeline Safety could have taken to prevent
the Bellingham accident, and to supply a list of all key
recommendations to strengthen pipeline safety efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dingell cannot order the GAO to conduct an
investigation, the agency is certain to do so in response to a
request from such a senior member of Congress.

 &HT;    Tempest in a B cup?
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Raise your hand if you were truly upset by the sight
of Brandi Chastain's sports bra.
</P>
<P>
   Thought so.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who you listen to, Chastain's act of whipping off
her soccer jersey at the World Cup, thereby uncovering her black
Nike sports bra, was everything from brazen exhibitionism, to a
calculated ploy for an endorsement contract with Nike, to an
Amazonian roar of female athletic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   People. Isn't this a sports bra we're talking about?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see what the big deal is at all,'' said Lynn Leonard,
34, who wore a navy Adidas sports top while running along the
Chattahoochee River on a recent afternoon. ``It's really a matter
of comfort. Especially in Atlanta, where it's so hot all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good for her,'' cheered 54-year-old Cheryl May as she pushed a
jogging stroller containing her granddaughter. ``I thought it was
terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people seem to share Leonard's indifference or May's
enthusiasm. But a vocal minority, many of whom apparently belong to
the media, seemed to read more into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, her name is Chastain, not Chaste,'' quipped Time
magazine. The Atlanta Journal's editorial board scolded Chastain
for scoring ``no points as a role model and hero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was tacky and cheesy, another example of the
masculinization of women,'' said WGST radio host Kim Peterson, who
devoted most of his Monday call-in show to the Brandi Bra Moment.
``If it's OK for women to rip off their shirts and walk around in
their sports bras, men should be able to rip off their pants and
walk around in their jockstraps.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, not really, says Rose Getch, spokeswoman for Champion
JogBra, which leads the $415 million sports bra industry.
(Ironically, the first sports bra consisted of two jockstraps
stitched together _ and was an undergarment.)
</P>
<P>
   See, most modern sports bras are designed to be worn as
outerwear. They come in solids and patterns, sometimes with
matching shorts. In addition to traditional athletic wear
manufacturers such as Champion, Danskin and Nike, couturiers
including Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Donna Karan now make
them.
</P>
<P>
   Jockstraps, by contrast, do not come in designer prints and are
never meant to see the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Brandi was wearing was an outerwear sports bra,'' Getch
said. ``It is perfectly acceptable to wear those outside. People do
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   On a summer day in Atlanta, chances are that one in every two or
three women exercising outdoors is wearing a sports bra without a
T-shirt or other cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   But those disturbed by the Bra Moment say they aren't generally
offended by the sight of women wearing sports bras in public. The
problem apparently is a temporal one: Chastain spent the whole game
in a shirt, then took it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet it was the act of taking off her shirt that bothered
people,'' Leonard mused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the act of doing it itself that really bothered me,''
Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who didn't mind said they initially were
startled when Chastain tore off her shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked just at first,'' said Atlantan Jay Lown, 29,
clad in a rainbow-hued biking jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain's champions point out that male soccer players
regularly strip off their jerseys in victorious glee. They
challenge her detractors to go outside at lunchtime and jog for,
say, 90 minutes, the duration of a soccer game, and then see how
they feel about layered clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would have said anything if a man had done it,'' said
Barbara Harris, editor in chief of Shape, a leading women's fitness
magazine, which first featured a model in a sports bra on its cover
in November 1992. ``I just couldn't even believe there were
negative comments made. Women are being held to a different
standard of behavior than male athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson puts it slightly differently: ``Just because men are
pigs doesn't mean women have to be,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That's a common bias, says Sarah Mahoney, editor in chief of
Fitness magazine, another popular women's fitness periodical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are against women being flamboyant in sports,''
said Mahoney, who watched the World Cup with her 7-year-old
soccer-playing daughter. ``Men have their whole little dances. They
even have names for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirty Bird, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Nike did pay Chastain for helping design the bra
over a year ago but says it won't be giving her any ``additional
compensation'' for the, uh, product exposure. The model will arrive
in stores July 25, with a price tag of $40.
</P>
<P>
   All this fuss over a basic item of sports equipment. In
Chastain's case, a sweaty one. Not sexy. Not titillating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Freud said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar,'' Mahoney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not these days, it isn't.

 Intel to Sell Devices Giving Speedy Access to the Internet  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In the latest move to diversify its business, Intel yesterday
announced plans to sell devices that give home and small-business
users high-speed access to the Internet.
<P>
   The first of the new products will be modems for use on DSL
(Digital Subscriber Line) connections, which provide speedy access
to the Net over standard phone wires. The move is part of Intel's
effort to expand beyond its role as the dominant supplier of chips
for personal computers. The Santa Clara company, spokesman Michael
Sullivan said, aims to be a ``building-block supplier to the
Internet economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Intel has acquired several networking
companies and announced plans to set up ``server farms'' hosting
Web sites for other businesses. Just yesterday, the company
announced a reorganization of its growing portfolio of networking
initiatives, including creation of a new Communications Products
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The new Intel modems, which are slated to begin shipping this
fall, initially will be distributed by the telecommunications
companies that provide DSL service. But in a few years, once
standards have matured, the company expects to sell them through PC
manufacturers and even retail outlets, according to Mark
Christensen, vice president and general manager of the company's
Network Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new product plan, Intel's Broadband Access
Operation signed a technology agreement with Cisco Systems, the
leader in the Internet networking equipment market. Cisco already
offers DSL modems. The deal will help Intel get its version to
market quickly and ensure its compatibility with the Cisco DSL
equipment used in many telecommunications switching offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel modems will be based on two new international
standards, G.lite and G.DMT, that are intended to simplify DSL
setup and ensure that products from different vendors work smoothly
together.
</P>
<P>
   Current DSL products, however, don't always work together, and
even though the new standards were ratified last month by the
International Telecommunications Union, industry observers expect
it could be several years before all systems are fully compatible.
</P>
<P>
   DSL runs over the same copper phone lines used for voice
traffic. G.lite, the standard intended for consumers, provides
speeds of 1.5 megabits per second, more than 25 times the speed of
the fastest analog modems.
</P>
<P>
   Regional phone companies as well as several startups
specializing in the technology are promoting it as their high-speed
Internet access solution for home users and small businesses. In
the United States, the number of DSL lines installed lags far
behind the total for cable modems, an alternative technology for
high-speed Net access promoted by cable TV providers and now by
telecom giant AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, however, DSL is off to an early lead. The
service is offered by Pacific Bell and through many Internet
service providers. By contrast, TCI, the region's dominant cable
provider, has stumbled repeatedly in its efforts to deploy cable
modems here.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, there are currently fewer than 900,000 DSL lines
installed, according to Cahners In-Stat Group, a technology
research group. But next year, In-Stat predicts, the total will
climb by more than 150 percent, passing the 2 million mark, and by
2003 it is expected to exceed 8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has been active in development and standardization of
several broadband technologies, including cable modems and
satellite data transmission as well as DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan refused to say whether the company will eventually
supplement its DSL modem line with cable or satellite products, but
he noted that the Intel group in charge has the generic term
``broadband,'' not ``DSL,'' in its names. ``It was chosen very
deliberately,'' he said.

 _ SF CHRON   Mouthing Off Can Get You Fired 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: Yesterday, I was fired from my job as a classified ad taker at a
nonunion newspaper. The official reason was ``insubordination.''
Here's what happened: The company suddenly cut our monthly
commission rates in half.
<P>
   My boss wouldn't give me a clear reason why, so I started
talking to the other sales reps about our pay. My boss then
demanded to know what I had been talking to them about. I said it
was none of his business, and when he insisted that it was, I told
him that was bull_. He then informed me that I was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   As I got up to leave, I said, ``Heil Hitler.'' (I thought it was
amusing.) The next day, I was fired for reasons that included
``using Nazi references, which creates a hostile work
environment.'' At no time did anyone ask for my side of the story.
Do I have any legal recourse?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's more than enough blame to go around on both sides
here. This company sounds like it does a crummy job of
communicating with its employees. Your boss should realize he's not
going to inspire loyalty by ordering people to disclose their
private conversations; if anything, he'll just make them more
defensive or angry.
</P>
<P>
   But using profanity with your boss is no way to respond to bad
management.
</P>
<P>
   And comments like ``Heil Hitler'' may sound witty when recounted
in a bar at 2 a.m., but they don't belong in a workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot? The company probably had the right to fire you
unless you were covered by a union contract guaranteeing you
additional warnings before termination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person acted unprofessionally and was insubordinate and
fresh,'' said Barbara Lawless, a San Francisco lawyer who
represents workers in employment disputes. ``I wouldn't take that
case, not with a 10-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   This company should take a hard look at its management policies
and figure out a way to inspire more trust and open communication.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, you need to figure out whether you want to
succeed in future jobs _ and if so, adjust your attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere you work, you'll find occasional dumb policies,
irritating co-workers or bad bosses. Mouthing off isn't the answer.
Instead, try keeping your cool, doing your job and offering
criticism in a level-headed manner.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be able to solve the problems of truly dysfunctional
workplaces, but you can at least emerge with a reputation as a
professional and dependable team player.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Retrieving Personal Items
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have worked for a company for 18 years. I had a lot of
personal items on my computer at the time. Is there any way I can
get copies of the items on my computer so that I can transfer them
to my computer at home?
</P>
<P>
   A: From the wording of your question, I'm assuming that you no
longer work for the company _ or no longer use the particular PC
where your personal documents were stored.
</P>
<P>
   You really have no legal right to those documents. The computer
and all the files stored on it are property of the company.
</P>
<P>
   So your only choice is simply to ask the company for permission
to retrieve your personal files.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies wouldn't have a problem with such a request from
a longtime employee who left on good terms. However, managers may
be worried about your taking confidential business files off their
computer. If so, you could offer to let someone from the firm look
over your shoulder while you copy your files to a floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Short Notice
</P>
<P>
   Q: A co-worker gave two weeks' notice. Our boss then informed
him that he would only need to work one week. Is he eligible to be
paid for the entire two weeks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope. Unless your colleague was covered by a union contract
or individual employment contract, he most likely was an at-will
employee.
</P>
<P>
   And at-will employment means that either the worker or the
company can terminate the relationship at any time, for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   Your colleague did the ethical, courteous thing by giving two
weeks' notice before leaving. It would have been nice if the
company had thanked him for the advance notice rather than
terminating him even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But nice or not, his dismissal is still probably legal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Car-Phone Quandry
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I wrote that injuries from car crashes while
commuting to work generally are not covered by workers'
compensation. One reader posed an interesting question: What if the
accident occurs while you're holding a work-related conversation on
your car phone?
</P>
<P>
   Ron Christensen, spokesman for the State Compensation Insurance
Fund, said there's not yet any clear legal precedent that would
cover all such cases. ``If work conversations on the car phone were
a normal part of the employee's routine, they could probably file a
claim,'' said Christensen. ``Judges would probably decide it on a
case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Farewell Note
</P>
<P>
   After two years writing Workways, I'm moving on to a new
challenge _ writing a book and being a visiting scholar at Mills
College. Many thanks to all my expert sources for sharing their
knowledge of human resources and employment law. And thanks to you,
readers, for sharing your questions and conundrums about the work
world. I've learned a lot and hope I've managed to help some of
you, too.

BAR CLARIFIES CONDUCT RULES FOR LAWYERS IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York State Bar Association Thursday announced
changes in its code of conduct, clarifying rules on how
aggressively lawyers can solicit clients, barring lawyers from
coercing sex from clients, and liberalizing the restrictions on
when lawyers can talk to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Roy D. Simon, who teaches legal ethics at Hofstra University
School of Law, said the changes were important, as they made
explicit what was once assumed. ``The new rules say that
transactions between lawyers and clients have to be fair and
reasonable to the client,'' he said. ``The old rules did not
specifically demand fairness or reasonableness.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary C. Daly, who teaches legal ethics at Fordham University
School of Law, said the revisions ``bring New York into the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Violations of the 70-page Lawyer's Code of Professional
Responsibility can lead to censure, suspension or loss of license
to practice. New York has 120,000 lawyers, second only to
California, said Steven C. Krane, chairman of an eight-member state
bar committee that revised the rules. In 1997, the latest year for
which data is available, 231 New York lawyers were disciplined,
including 79 who were disbarred.
</P>
<P>
   The code was last revised in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot issues were mainly advertising and solicitation,''
said Krane, a lawyer who represents the NBA and the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The previous code barred all forms of solicitation by lawyers,
but recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions allow virtually all forms
of advertising and solicitation as long as they are not false and
misleading. Under the new state rules, lawyers can send
solicitations, but not to victims of disasters like plane crashes.
``Sending letters to hospitals or to people who are bereaved means
that they cannot make an informed judgment,'' Krane said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers can also claim in advertisements that they specialize in
a particular form of law, like immigration, but only if they are
certified by a group approved by the American Bar Association.
``They also have to put in a disclaimer that this doesn't
necessarily mean that they are better lawyers than anyone else,''
Krane said.
</P>
<P>
   There has always been an almost complete ban on divorce lawyers
having sex with their clients, said Krane, but the new rules expand
the prohibition to all lawyers. The new rules apply only to lawyers
who ``enter into'' sexual relations with clients, Krane said. They
do not apply to previous, continuing sexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules ban the coercion of sexual favors from a client or
``a third party,'' like a relative. Previous versions of the code
alluded only to ``conduct prejudicial to the administration of
justice'' and did not define sexual relations, which the revised
code does.
</P>
<P>
   The old code discouraged most lawyers' statements to the press,
but now allows a right of rebuttal if opposing counsel states
something that may prejudice the trial. The new rules say a lawyer
may make a press statement if it is ``necessary to mitigate the
recent adverse publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daly, the Fordham professor, said: ``It's an eye-for-an-eye
and a tooth-for-a-tooth proposition. If the prosecution says your
client flunked a lie-detector test, which isn't admissible in
court, you can answer back.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Tech Temp Unions Spread to Silicon Valley  &HT;     Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Seattle isn't the only area where labor unions are trying to
organize high-tech temporary workers.
<P>
   Silicon Valley unions are trying to improve the lot of high-tech
temps in a novel way: They've set up a labor-run temporary staffing
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The South Bay Labor Council of the AFL-CIO launched a nonprofit
staffing firm last winter called Solutions at Work that aims to
provide temporary clerical workers to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Solutions at Work so far has placed about 75 workers at 60
firms.
</P>
<P>
   The staffing firm is part of the Labor Council's efforts to
respond to the rise of contingent workers _ temporary, contract or
part-time workers who often have little job security and few
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our judgment, the expansion of temporary employment is not
a passing phase, but a long-term part of the new economy,'' said
Bob Brownstein, policy director of Working Partnerships USA, a
research group affiliated with the South Bay Labor Council that is
overseeing the temp initiative. ``It doesn't do any good to try and
make it go away. So we need to be as creative as possible in
developing policies that will ... meet the needs of working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Council _ which hopes eventually to expand Solutions
at Work to include light-industrial and technical workers _ hopes
the firm will be a model for how to treat temporary employees. No
worker is paid less than $10 an hour; workers will have access to
health insurance, sick leave and holidays; and they will be given
advance notice if assignments are shortened or changed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the council is launching an advocacy group
that will pressure large Silicon Valley employers to impose an
industrywide ``code of conduct'' on the temp agencies they use.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose business leaders said the Labor Council's efforts
hadn't yet produced any noticeable changes in the area's staffing
industry. One major local temp firm hadn't even heard of the Labor
Council's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an employer's perspective, this is just another agency
they can go to for temporary help,'' said Jim Tucker, spokesman for
the San Jose Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But Tucker added that it still is too early to see how the
effort will pan out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit unusual for a union-based organization to get into
the staffing business,'' Tucker said. ``But we've discovered that
Working Partnerships is an innovative kind of group. They sometimes
think out of the box. We'll have to see how it works out.''

 _ SF CHRON   Labor Group Wants to Organize Tech Temp Workers 
 &HT;     By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Mark Turner is a lifelong Republican who used to have nothing but
contempt for labor unions, including the teachers union and
machinists union that counted his parents as members.
<P>
   ``I have browbeat my parents my whole life because I thought
unions were a thing of the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Turner, 39, is the most unlikely of union supporters. The
$31-per-hour computer programmer signed a petition last month
asking Microsoft Corp. to bargain collectively with his 20-person
work group. ``Now I'm unable to go to my parents' house,'' Turner
joked.
</P>
<P>
   Turner and his colleagues at Microsoft _ long-term temporary
workers who have become known as ``permatemps'' _ are on the
cutting edge of a new effort by organized labor to penetrate the
world of high tech.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle tech workers have formed a group called WashTech that
has affiliated with the Communication Workers of America and is
trying to organize skilled computer professionals like Turner.
</P>
<P>
   They clearly have got an uphill battle. High-tech employees not
only are independent minded, but they also often are well paid.
Traditional union elections and contracts can't be applied easily
to temporary employees, who make up a growing share of the tech
workforce. And the entrepreneurial culture of the tech industry
means that many workers see stock options rather than union cards
as the ticket to financial security.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some growing murmurs of discontent within the
ranks of tech workers that could create opportunities for unions.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers and engineers in their 40s and 50s commonly voice
complaints about age discrimination. And as companies rely
increasingly on contractors and temporary workers, some high-tech
temps are starting to rebel against what they see as second-class
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read about everyone being a millionaire and ready to cash
in big,'' said Marcus Courtney, a former temp at Microsoft who
helped found WashTech. ``But my own experience after four years in
the industry was that I had no health benefits, no retirement plan,
no job security. Every day, I worried about whether it would be my
last day on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   WashTech so far is focusing on contingent workers _ people
employed on a temporary or contract basis.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such workers has grown dramatically both inside
and outside the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The portion of the U.S. workforce employed by temporary agencies
rose from 0.5 percent in 1982 to 2.2 percent in 1997, according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Together with independent
contractors and employees of contracting firms, temps now account
for one of every 10 workers _ more than 13 million people.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere has this growth gotten more attention than at
Microsoft, which for several years has been fighting a class-action
lawsuit by temps seeking access to the same benefits as regular
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft counts 5,500 to 6,500 temporary employees in its
workforce of 30,000, or about 1 of every 5 staffers on its Redmond
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Many have long-term assignments: 63 percent of the Microsoft
temps surveyed by WashTech have been at the company for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Microsoft work groups are made up entirely of orange-badged
temps, with only the team's manager wearing the blue badge that
marks permanent employees.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it uses temps for reasons similar to other
high-tech firms _ to keep up with rapid product cycles and dramatic
swings in customer demands.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Microsoft might need hundreds of tech-support
people when it unveils a new version of Windows, but that need
quickly would die down as customers get used to the new product.
</P>
<P>
   And many of Microsoft's longtime temps are, in fact, satisfied
with their status. They note that temps typically receive a higher
hourly pay rate than permanent employees.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dixon, 46, has worked as a multimedia producer at Microsoft
on three different temporary assignments for a total of 51/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the flexibility and extra pay of being a contractor,
and the change of people and products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other longtime Microsoft temps feel exploited. They say
they're being unfairly deprived of benefits ranging from discounts
on Microsoft software to sick leave, lucrative stock options and
fully paid health care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, some disgruntled Microsoft contractors filed a
class-action lawsuit seeking benefits that continues wending its
way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   And in early 1998, a new generation of frustrated temps decided
to form WashTech and affiliate with the CWA.
</P>
<P>
   They face some daunting organizational challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional kind of union election and bargaining process
doesn't work well for temps. One problem is that contested union
elections can take years to resolve _ by which time temps may have
moved on to entirely new assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the National Labor Relations Board has
said you can't negotiate a contract for a group of temps unless all
the staffing agencies that employ them have agreed to take part in
the bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have to bargain with five different agencies, and if
one refused to give its consent, none of the other agencies would
be required to bargain,'' Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of a traditional focus on collective bargaining,
WashTech is instead trying what it calls ``collective action'' _
lobbying, letter writing, public pressure and employee-protest
actions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, WashTech has a dues-paying membership of 175 and an
e-mail mailing list of about 1,200 high-tech employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's made a name for itself promoting the rights of high-tech
temps in Washington's state Legislature and in the news media. But
its biggest actual organizing battle so far has involved a
relatively small group of 20 temporary programmers that included
Mark  &LR; Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's unit is made up of financial professionals _ CPAs and
business school graduates _ who are writing code for a new
financial software program.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to organize last month after Microsoft announced
that it was requiring all of its temporary staffing firms to offer
at least a minimal level of benefits to their workers _ things like
13 paid holidays or vacation days each year, health insurance with
premiums that are 50 percent paid by the agency, and a retirement
plan with an employer contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the financial software group said they were told that
they were ineligible for the improved benefits because of the way
their jobs were classified by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, parts of their benefit package were far below the new
standard put out by Microsoft. For instance, their retirement plan
didn't have any employer contribution. Their health plan capped the
amount of benefits they could receive at $7,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you broke a leg, you were done. And if you got cancer or a
heart attack _ forget it,'' said Nancy Martin, 38, a CPA who has
worked as a temporary programmer at Microsoft since November.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen out of the 20 financial software temps signed a
petition asking Microsoft to negotiate with them as a group over
their wages and benefits. Nearly all of them also signed up as
dues-paying members of WashTech.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft refused to negotiate, saying it wasn't the
programmers' employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues of collective bargaining are issues between employees
and their employer,'' said Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach. ``In this
case, the employers are the staffing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The four staffing agencies that employed the group also refused
to bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But then the agencies told the workers that they would in fact
upgrade the group's benefits to the Microsoft standard.
</P>
<P>
   Temp agency officials said they had planned the benefit
improvements long before the petition was drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were treating them fairly and working on some of these
matters long before (the petition),'' said Norma Kraus, vice
president of Volt Services Group, which employs about 14 of the 20
financial software people.
</P>
<P>
   But employees felt they had won an unofficial victory.
``Basically, they are not recognizing us as a bargaining unit, but
we are winning our points,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The group still has several unmet demands. For instance, they
want an end to broad pay disparities within their group that have
led to people earning anywhere from $18 to $35 per hour for similar
work.
</P>
<P>
   They also want the freedom to switch to a different temporary
agency while staying in their current assignments _ something
prohibited in their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   They're optimistic about their prospects for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft managers sooner or later will get real tired of
hearing about us in the press,'' Turner predicted. ``They'll
contact Volt and say, `Let my people go.'''
</P>
<P>
   On a broader level, WashTech hopes to parlay dozens of small
skirmishes like this one into better conditions for high-tech temps
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a significant step, since it was the first time that
high-tech workers tried to gain collective bargaining rights at
their job site,'' Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   Will WashTech succeed? Other labor unions and high-tech
companies are watching closely to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm skeptical because of how independent most contractors
are,'' said Jerry Erickson, publisher of Contract Employment Weekly
magazine. ``Most contractors have been pretty happy with what
they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, so many people have entered the contracting
industry recently who don't really want to be there,'' Erickson
continued. ``We've seen an influx of people who aren't doing it
because they want to, but because they've been downsized or can't
find a permanent opportunity.''

SETTLEMENT APPEARS NEAR IN MISSOURI LAWSUIT AGAINST HOG PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state of Missouri may be close to settling a pollution
lawsuit against Premium Standard Farms, the state's largest hog
producer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any settlement will require the company to install equipment to
treat large volumes of hog wastes, Attorney General Jay Nixon
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do settle,'' Nixon said, ``I would only do so if it
includes the company installing the next generation of waste
treatment technology.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, Nixon sued Kansas City-based Premium Standard Farms
in Jackson County Circuit Court, accusing the company of repeated
hog-waste spills, failure to report past spills and excessive
spraying of wastes on farm fields. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The suit asked for $10,000 a day in fines for each violation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and Nixon want corporate hog farms to be
treated more like industries and cities, whose collected wastes
must be treated to reduce pollutants before being discharged onto
land or into streams and rivers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ozark chapter of the Sierra Club said Thursday that it had
obtained a copy of a draft settlement between Nixon's office and
Premium Standard Farms. The group declined to release a copy,
saying it might tip off the source of the draft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the group said the draft settlement included these terms: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company would pay $1 million in fines, $650,000 of it up
front. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company would install up to $25 million worth of equipment
in the next five years to treat its hog wastes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it installed that equipment and complied with other
requirements, the company could avoid paying the $350,000 balance
of the fine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In return, the company would be exempt from new lawsuits by
Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with the proposed settlement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call it a sellout of the environment and family farms,''
said Ken Midkiff, the Sierra Club's program director. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is too weak and doesn't require set limits for the
treated wastewater, Midkiff said. It also would seem to allow the
company to pay the balance of its fine _ the $350,000 _ rather than
install all of the treatment equipment, Midkiff said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of businessman wouldn't spend $350,000 to save $25
million?'' Midkiff said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Midkiff said, the settlement would preclude future
lawsuits against the company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The enforcement provisions are absent,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard Farms spokesman Charlie Arnot and Nixon
declined to say whether the settlement included a $1 million
penalty or requirements for $25 million in new treatment
equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment at all on anything that's part of the
settlement,'' Arnot said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he said his company hoped it could strike a deal that would
benefit it and the state of Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arnot declined to say how much such equipment would cost for an
operation as large as Premium Standard's in north Missouri, where
the company produces more than 2 million hogs a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club contends that north Missouri has the nation's
largest concentration of hogs and hog wastes, although a newer
operation in Utah may rival it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said he thought a settlement could be completed in a week
to 10 days. He said he had been involved in the negotiations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was in Kansas City on Thursday to address a workshop on
regulating concentrated animal feeding operations for the National
Association of Attorneys General. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon urged attorneys general in other states to regulate the
large farms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri family farms have a system of accountability in
place,'' Nixon said. ``It's called being a good neighbor. These new
neighbors, the large pork factories, do not have a good neighbor
policy. Their policy is the bottom line.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of north Missouri residents were expected to meet
Thursday night in Trenton to address Premium Standard Farms' newest
plans. The company has asked for new permits to spray hog wastes on
nearly 25,000 acres in north Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club contends that although the terms of the permits
have been strengthened since last year, they are not tough enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Current state permits allow the company to spray about 750
million gallons of hog wastes over 45,000 acres of north Missouri.
The company has said it isn't expanding operations, but gaining
permission to spray wastes on new lands. &QL;

JEWISH SETTLEMENTS IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES QUICKLY RULED ILLEGAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ Less than one hour after it began, a
conference on whether Jewish settlements in territories occupied by
Israel violate international law adjourned Thursday after declaring
that the settlements are illegal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The closed session, ordered by the U.N. General Assembly last
February, was held over objections by both Israel and the United
States. The Palestinians, who had been pressing for the gathering,
said they were satisfied with the conference. They said they had
wanted to send a message but not disrupt the peace efforts of
Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our drive to get the conference coincided with a total change
in Israeli politics,'' said Nabil Shaath, the top Palestinian
official at the meeting. ``We hope that there won't be a need for
another conference like this,'' he added.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noting the ``improved atmosphere in the Middle East as a
whole,'' the resolution approved by the conference stated that it
had adjourned ``on the understanding that it will convene again in
the light of consultations on the development of the humanitarian
situation in the field.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the settlements violate the Fourth Geneva
Convention, which forbids transferring populations in occupied
territories.  &QL;

GOP PULLS PLUG ON DEMOCRATS' HEALTH BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican senators delivered a death blow to the
Democrats' managed care bill Thursday by defeating a crucial
amendment that would have allowed people to sue their health
maintenance organizations and by passing their own more moderate
patients' protection measure that would cover fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit amendment, which was modeled after laws in Georgia
and Texas, was rejected along party lines by a vote of 53-47, with
only two Republicans _ Sens. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and John
Chaffee of Rhode Island _ joining all 45 Senate Democrats to
support it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, offered by Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., was at the
heart of the Democrats' so-called patients' bill-of-rights plan,
which was aimed at strengthening regulations governing the managed
care systems. The proposed legislation was prompted by a
proliferation of complaints in recent years against HMOs as they
have grown to become the only choice available to many employers
and Americans in search of affordable health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said most
Republicans rejected the Durbin measure because it would place
``the scalpels of litigation in trial lawyers' hands and invite
them to carve up the nation's health care system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also ensured the death of the Democratic bill by
killing two other key amendments that would have expanded access to
specialists and emergency services for all 161 million of the
nation's privately insured, and which would have allowed doctors
instead of insurers to make final decisions on the medical
necessity of treatments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest complaints against HMOs has come from doctors
and patients who believe that insurers, motivated by cost concerns,
often deny treatments or other services that may be medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the politically-charged and often rancorous four-day
debate, Republicans repeatedly accused the Democrats of trying to
revive President Clinton's universal health care proposal, which
failed in 1994, and which they referred to as ``socialized''
medicine. They said the Democratic patients' protection bill would
have amounted to new government mandates on states and would have
drastically increased the costs of average health care plans for
most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After dismantling the Democratic plan piece by piece, the
Republicans voted 53-47 late Thursday to pass their own, less
expansive managed care proposal, which would cover about one-third
of the 161 million privately insured Americans who would have
benefited from the Democrats' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans insisted that some provisions in their bill
_ such as providing longer hospital stays for women who have
mastectomies _ would apply to a larger number of insured women, the
GOP alternative was crafted primarily to address the 48 million
Americans who are covered through large employer self-funded health
care plans that do not fall under state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats charged that most of the provisions in the GOP
bill do not address HMO problems at all and are weighted in favor
of the insurer over the patient.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance at the White House, Clinton denounced the
Republican plan as short-sighted and suggested that it was designed
to protect the profits of the nation's huge $320 billion health
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day for health care in America,'' Clinton said of
the Republicans' rejection of the broader Democratic proposal
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not done yet and this won't die,'' he added,
suggesting that the issue of patient protections would likely play
a prominent role in next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Vice President Al Gore
took Clinton's comments one step further. He called the GOP
alternative ``a fraud'' and declared that Clinton would veto it
``in a minute'' if it reaches his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin went even further. In a floor speech after Republicans
rejected his amendment to allow lawsuits against HMOs, he accused
them of working with the insurance industry to reject any
Democrat-sponsored plan designed to put patient interests ahead of
the insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican-adopted measure, the health insurance
companies ``won't be answerable to the law and they won't have to
provide the kind of health care that every American counts on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing their two-year battle to pass a managed care
bill, the Democrats did at least succeed in putting Republicans on
the record in opposing some popular initiatives aimed at giving
Americans more control over coverage decisions made by their health
plans, particularly HMOs. This, they said, could help Democratic
candidates in close elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said they were confident that passage of their
own bill, even if it never becomes law, will help deflect
Democratic criticism in races next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's been a political downside for us passing
this legislation,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged Clinton to accept the Republican bill and work to
ensure its passage in the House, which may consider several managed
care proposals later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the president decides not to play politics. I hope that
he will work with us to pass legislation that improves health care
quality for all Americans,'' Nickles said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Republicans insisted that their version of a
patients protection bill strikes a ``critical balance'' in holding
down costs and holding the nation's health care system accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting quality and access, that's what its all about,''
said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who offered a number of
amendments during the debate that were similar to Democratic
proposals, but which did not cover as many people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least one Republican disagreed, admonishing his
colleagues that despite their claims to the contrary, the
GOP-sponsored legislation will not cover ``all insured Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican legislation will not do that,'' said Chaffee,
one of three Republicans to vote against the GOP bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to give patients the right to sue and we will
not do that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Chaffee joined with Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., in scolding his
colleagues for letting the American people down, as he put it, by
not considering compromise legislation the two had tried to offer
that would have combined some of the best provisions of both bills.
</P>
<P>
   Chaffee said that once again Republicans and Democrats had
allowed politics to drive the debate ``to the benefit of no one.''

   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Even in a nightmare, Sergio Garcia would
probably not have imagined Thursday's events. Garcia entered the
British Open as a 19-year-old sensation, coming off his first
professional victory earlier this month, and he was expected to
play well.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday he was humbled by a score of 18-over-par 89 on the
demonic Carnoustie layout, and he will remember his first round as
a professional at the British Open for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia came ready to battle Carnoustie, but the course easily
won. Garcia started with a triple-bogey on No. 1, and his day kept
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do anything,'' said Garcia, who returned to answer
questions several hours after he dejectedly left the course. ``The
wind wasn't as hard in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't put pressure on myself or set my goals too high. It's
part of the learning experience. Every single Open has been
difficult, but this year is too tough. But I am young. I will start
again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia will almost surely miss the cut Friday, no matter how
high it is. But he was glad that he did not quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does cross your mind at times that you'd like to walk
off,'' Garcia said. ``At the end, I left because I wanted to be
alone with my family after the day I had. I think it's better to
speak now that I'm calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara will need a miracle to repeat as the British Open
champion after his opening-round 83. And he admitted that
Thursday's round hurt his pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional golfer,'' said O'Meara, who had three
double-bogeys and one triple-bogey. ``I'm not looking forward to
shooting in the 80s, but I felt I got the score I deserved. I drove
the ball pretty badly. I just didn't do very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make a lot of putts. I've seen the weather more
trying, but I've never seen a more difficult or demanding golf
course. Tomorrow, all I can do is try to play better and restore
some of my pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson was the last person to win consecutive British Opens,
in 1982 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The championship committee of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
took plenty of criticism from players about the course setup at
Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfair golf course from the standpoint that the
fairways are too narrow,'' said Watson, who has won five British
Opens. ``But Bobby Jones said it wasn't meant to be a fair game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, who was only three strokes off the lead after his 74,
was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to do the best in a bad situation,'' he said. ``I
don't think anybody has played a golf course like this. Sure they
wanted us to play on a challenging course. I think we've all agreed
they've gone over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Lyle who shot an 85, said he could see trouble coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fertilizing the rough and watering it when I was
here playing about two weeks ago,'' Lyle said. ``I think it's just
a joke now.'' &QL;

MIDDLEWEIGHT VARGAS ISN'T LOOKING FOR FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Get to know IBF junior middleweight champion
Fernando Vargas and you'll probably like him. He's warm, gracious
and his love for his family _ especially his toddler son, Fernando
Jr. _ is touching.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is few become acquainted with a man in his position.
</P>
<P>
   All but those close to the Oxnard, Calif., resident are left to
judge him primarily on sound bites, which more often than not
reveal a brashness that is reminiscent of Muhammad Ali but much
less playful.
</P>
<P>
   Big talent, big mouth.
</P>
<P>
   That about covers Vargas in the opinion of even casual boxing
fans, many of whom are turned on by his immense ability and turned
off by what they perceive to be his arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I'd like to see him lose,'' one disgusted fan said.
</P>
<P>
   Most celebrated of his running commentary is his baiting of
Oscar De La Hoya, the WBC welterweight champion. Vargas doesn't
like his rival and hasn't hesitated to say so.
</P>
<P>
   He has been almost cruel in his analysis of Raul Marquez, a
former Olympian against whom he defends his title on Saturday in
Lake Tahoe: ``Usually, (left-handers) are intelligent, hard to hit.
Raul isn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, when De La Hoya and Marquez _ who are friends _ dared to
show up at a promotional event near his Big Bear training camp at
which he was the featured guest, he challenged Marquez to take his
championship belt then and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being kind of childish, really,'' said Marquez, 27.
``He's a kid; he talks a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That might explain part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas !ital!is only 21, an age when most young men are far from
mature. Add to that the fact he's a sudden millionaire and the
focus of immense attention and you get a precarious situation.
</P>
<P>
   His manager and close friend, Rolando Arellano, also admits the
fighter comes from a ``dysfunctional environment'' _ his father
abandoned the family when he was a child _ that has left him with
an aggressive personality.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ``cocky'' label doesn't sit well with Arellano, who
typically jumps in to defend his fighter when that word comes up
during interviews or casual conversations.
</P>
<P>
   To him, Vargas is merely expressing confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe you're the best and believe you'll beat
the best. If you don't, you're not going to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Brewing Co., which recently signed Vargas to a
promotional contract in its ``Think When You Drink'' campaign,
isn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Marc Spiegel, whose company was enamored with Vargas'
boxing ability, name-recognition in Southern California and the
fact he's Latino, is aware of his reputation for brashness but
dismisses it as typical boxing hype.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Main Events, Vargas' promotional firm, !ital!embraces
its client's proclivity to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer/manager Lou Duva, the patriarch of Main Events, has been
known to be chatty himself. He understands the value of
self-promotion. Positive or negative, it doesn't matter: The idea
is to get people talking about you.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Arellano, he sees it as an expression of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a little cockiness in a fighter,'' Duva said.
``Sometimes, fighters who are laid back make the wrong moves
because they're uncertain of themselves. Fernando's certain of
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' interpretation? He makes no apologies or excuses.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't believe the criticism is fair. Those who don't know
him, he said, have no right to judge him.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said he'll continue to speak his mind.
</P>
<P>
   For Vargas, it all comes down to respect, a philosophy born of
his experience on Oxnard's tough streets. That, and the lingering
animosity over the fact his father abandoned the family, has left
him with an indelible don't-mess-with-me mentality.
</P>
<P>
   His motto: You can love me or hate me but never disrespect me.
</P>
<P>
   The De La Hoya situation? When he was 14, Vargas and other
teen-age amateurs visited De La Hoya _ whom he idolized _ at his
Big Bear training camp. Apparently, Vargas slipped and fell during
a training run and De La Hoya laughed at him.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas has never forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   The Marquez situation? Vargas was on a conference call with
reporters when Marquez broke in and questioned Vargas' choice of
opponents _ in hopes of luring him into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   That, as well as the incident at the Big Bear promotional event,
led to Vargas' nasty comments.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is also feuding with Spanish-language Telemundo. As the
story goes, the television network nicknamed Vargas ``Chico Fresa''
_ Strawberry Kid _ a reference to the abundance of strawberry
fields in Oxnard, according to broadcaster Mario Solis.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas took offense, failed to show up for a scheduled interview
and now refuses to do business with Telemundo.
</P>
<P>
   The point is this: Disrespect me and I'll disrespect you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I've been since I was a kid,'' Vargas said.
``Growing up, I was always in the streets, always in trouble. If
anybody said anything about me, I never said nothing. I would just
start fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like me, fine. But respect me. If you grew up the
way I did, you'd understand.''

 &HT;    Umps demand baseball's respect
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With play resuming Thursday, baseball has 48 days
before when the umpires say they'll resign over a series of
dissatisfactions with Major League Baseball. As of now, the
questions outnumber the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is this situation headed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apparently Armageddon. Major League Baseball is determined to
take more control of its umpires, from scheduling to strike-zone
definition to job perfomance. The Major League Umpires Association
is seeking more autonomy. Both sides have a miserable record at the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the big issue? No one has mentioned money or working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A: Money is not a primary concern. The issue is the resistance
of the umpires to yielding any control to MLB. They correctly see
any change as a threat to their jobs. But deeper, this is also
about respect. Although the umps are far from blameless, relations
between players and managers and the umpires cannot get much worse.
The umpires have felt slighted since Roberto Alomar received just a
five-day suspension for spitting on John Hirschbeck in 1996. Tom
Hallion's suspension for bumping a player apparently was the last
straw. The umps think their support from the presidents' and
commissioner's offices has weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why not give them that ``respect?''
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not that simple. The umps' basic work agreement expires
at the end of this season. MLB has been on record all year as
wanting more authority over the umpires to demand better job
performance. The ground hardly is solid for compromise, much less
for making a bunch of crusty men feel loved.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the umps, as they have stated, start their own new
corporation, which would contract with MLB for future services,
what's so bad about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing, except little indicates that the level of umpiring
has improved in baseball this year. If anything, it has declined,
and with an ironclad work agreement that makes the umpires
essentially immune to firing, granting them even stronger job
security seems a strange way to improve on-field performance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who will call the games if they walk off the job?
</P>
<P>
   A: If union chief Richie Phillips succeeds in his efforts to
gain the support of minor-league umpires, replacement umpires
probably would come from colleges and amateur associations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Usually, those guys are down the totem pole because they're
not suited for the big leagues. Short memories neglect the 1995
umpire lockout, in which replacements worked the season's first 86
games. It was near calamity. When the ML umpires made it back to
the field, ovations came from both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is this going to cost baseball?
</P>
<P>
   A: In dignity, plenty. From the pocketbook, Phillips says, the
total in severance payments will come to $15 million, to cover all
68 full-time umpires. It sounds like a lot, but when divided among
30 major-league teams, it comes down to $500,000. That's the
equivalent of the contract for an experienced reserve infielder.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the umpires having that bad a year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably no better or worse than usual, with a few
exceptions. Hallion's clash with the San Diego Padres was an
embarrassment. And the idea that Frank Pulli, completely on his
own, went against written regulations to use a video replay to make
a home-run call boggles the mind. But given the strife over the
bogus new strike zone, it also has been a difficult season to be an
ump.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is Richie Phillips?
</P>
<P>
   A: A tough-guy lawyer from Philadelphia _ and a former agent _
who took a powerless group of umpires and made them just as
formidable a labor organization as the player association. He is
bombastic and confrontational and can be a disruptive presence at
the negotiating table. He also is testing his allegiances within
his union. The umps voted unanimously to resign, but all of them
can't be as sure about where their action is headed as Phillips
seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where has commissioner Bud Selig been? And who is Sandy
Alderson?
</P>
<P>
   A: Selig hired Alderson last year for just such issues.
Alderson, Princeton-educated with a military background, was
general manager of the Oakland A's dating back to the Bash Brothers
clubs and has seen baseball's ugly underbelly. It was Alderson, at
Selig's bidding, who wrote the new strike-zone ultimatum, and it
was Alderson who requested that clubs monitor the performance of
plate umps and send the written reports to him. He is shrewd and
capable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the timing work?
</P>
<P>
   A: By walking out in early September, the union hopes its
replacements will make such a mess of the games in the ensuing
weeks that management will be ready to give in to get the real umps
back for the postseason. Severance pay would not be due until
winter.

TEST ALOFT GIVES PILOTS GLIMPSE OF TOMORROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Ohio _ Five thousand feet over the rolling farm
country of southern Ohio, it was obvious to the test pilot of the
Federal Aviation Administration's biggest research plane that the
airborne experiment under way could change the nature of air
traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen planes from around the nation swarmed through the air,
each carrying a new technology that could replace radar and give
pilots aloft detailed information that is now available only to the
controller on the ground: the precise location and identity of
other planes, their speed, direction and altitude, their rate of
climb or descent, even their planned route.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, called ADS-B, is a radical new approach to tasks
that have been done for almost 60 years with radar, and it has a
radical pedigree: its development was sponsored in partnership with
the airlines rather than by the F.A.A. alone. (The government and
the private sector each put up about $25 million.) It also promises
to reduce the risk of collision, both in the air and on the ground.
And while many of its component parts are not yet commercially
available, nothing less than adoption by the entire aviation
industry is envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   In the first few minutes of the experiment performed here
Saturday, it was clear that all the new information was making the
participating pilots act differently.
</P>
<P>
   As Larry Van Hoy, captain of the F.A.A. research plane, listened
from the cockpit of his Boeing 727, a controller in Dayton issued a
standard order to a plane approaching the Wilmington airport,
telling its crew to follow a United Parcel Service 727 to the
runway.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilot, answering the controller, did not give the
standard response, ``Traffic in sight.'' Instead, he included a
jaw-dropping fact, the flight number of the plane he had been told
to follow. ``I have U.P.S. 550 in sight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool,'' said Van Hoy. His first officer, Fred Karl, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cheating already,'' Karl observed. Pilots are supposed
to give the standard response, but the rules do not mention citing
the plane's call sign. (The people who wrote the rules surely never
contemplated that it would be possible.) The next step could be
air-to-air traffic negotiations among planes.
</P>
<P>
   The F.A.A. plane and 24 others here, including several 727's and
DC-9's from Federal Express, U.P.S. and Airborne Express, a Boeing
757 belonging to NASA, a P-3 submarine hunter sent by the Navy and
several smaller craft, were part of the first large-scale test of a
program that combines several innovations to pinpoint everything in
the sky, and on the ground, too. In the airport's vicinity
Saturday, an on-board screen on every plane equipped with the new
system showed where every other plane was. With a little more work,
experts say, the planes will soon be able to see fuel trucks,
tractors, other equipment, even people.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason the cargo airlines are so interested in the
system. The Wilmington airport, formerly a base for the Strategic
Air Command, is a busy center for cargo planes, and at night the
bustling apron here is covered with vehicles and planes ``like
ants,'' said David A. Marcontell, director of engineering at
Airborne Express, which owns the airport and was host to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have vehicles that have run into airplanes, we have
airplanes that have run into airplanes,'' Marcontell said.
</P>
<P>
   The system has other benefits as well. Sitting in the cockpit of
his parked 727, Tom Ewing, a U.P.S. captain, watched two freighters
descend toward the runway closer together than standard technology
would permit. A U.P.S. 727 was coming in at 140 knots, and behind
it was an Airborne DC-9 at 226 knots, closing the gap rapidly. If
quick-sequence landings like Ewing was witnessing could be made
routine, they would increase the runway's capacity and cut delays
during an airport's busiest hours.
</P>
<P>
   But a pilot with only the human eye to estimate distances would
not be able to bring his plane that close to the craft he was
following. Often, Ewing said, he is instructed by a controller to
follow another plane to the ground. He tries to maintain a safe
distance, but even in daylight the task is difficult, and ``at
night, if you're cleared for a visual approach and all you see is a
blinking light out there, well, you do the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new system, in contrast, the pilot always knows the
range to the plane ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo airlines hope the new system will be ready for wide
use early next year. Passenger airlines, too, are interested in it.
When the cloud layer descends to 3,000 feet in San Francisco,
hardly ``bad weather'' for that area, planes cannot conduct
simultaneous landings on the airport's two runways, which are just
750 feet apart. If ADS-B gave each pilot a clear picture of where
the other plane was while both were still in the clouds, such
landings might be possible, said Rocky Stone, a captain for United
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, flight routes over the Atlantic, far from radar,
are separated by 60 miles laterally because no one can be quite
sure exactly where the planes are, and experts say ADS-B could cut
that distance.
</P>
<P>
   ADS-B could someday be an inexpensive replacement for radar,
which works by bouncing radio waves off passing objects to
calculate their position.
</P>
<P>
   Radar is ``independent surveillance'' _ that is, it does not
rely on action by the plane. Over the oceans, in contrast, where
there is no radar, planes are equipped with automatic dependent
surveillance, or ADS. In ADS, the plane automatically radios its
position, and the receiving station, often a satellite, is
``dependent'' on the plane to send the data.
</P>
<P>
   In the new technology, the addition to ADS is the ``B,'' for
broadcast, in which the planes send their information directly to
other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   There are some problems, participants in the experiment here
agreed. ADS-B would take over navigation, surveillance and
communications functions now spread among four separate sets of
equipment, thus raising the stakes if the system failed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blackmer, the director for safety and technology at the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said ADS-B could be
very useful but was not ``a miracle cure.'' Humans on the ground,
not the pilots of competing airlines in the sky, will still have to
decide who goes first, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief,'' Blackmer said, ``is that we cannot be automated
out of existence, although I don't put it past anybody to try.''
</P>
<P>
   The system outperforms radar in several ways. The planes know
their own positions by use of the satellite-based Global
Positioning System, which is more accurate than radar. And the
on-board computer on which the whole system depends combines the
data and recalculates once a second; radar, in contrast, updates
the screen only as often as the radar dish completes a sweep, often
once every six seconds. And while planes can be below the radar,
they are never below GPS and ADS-B.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the system has an effective range of 160 miles, and
sometimes picks up targets much farther away. The conventional
anticollision system now on all passenger airliners is always
accurate only to 14 miles, though sometimes to 40 _ distances that
are not large when two planes are converging head on at 16 miles a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sold,'' Ewing, a nine-year veteran of U.P.S., said of the
new system. ``I'm absolutely convinced.''

 &HT;    Lopez is DH, catches Saturday
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Javy Lopez returned to action Thursday night as the
Braves' designated hitter for the opener of this three-game series
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   He singled in his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who missed 20 games with a sprained right knee, was
activated from the disabled list and Pascual Matos was optioned
back to AAA Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox is planning to use Lopez as the designated
hitter for the first two games and then have him catch for the
first time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they gave me a few more days it would be less pressure on
my knee, but if they need me I'm ready to catch,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said before the game he had no fears about being limited
in any way when he's hitting. He's wearing a brace on his right
knee but said it's mainly for support when he catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting-wise I don't have to wear the brace on my knee,''
Lopez said. ``I don't even have to put pressure on my knee when I'm
hitting. Hitting is not the problem, catching is. It's just going
to be uncomfortable. ...The way I'm going to go up there is like I
haven't missed any games, just like I did when my mom died. I came
to Chicago and started, went along like nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiet about umpires
</P>
<P>
   The Braves reacted quietly to the surprise news that
major-league umpires had resigned effective Sept. 2..
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not commenting on the situation,'' said Tom Glavine, the
Braves' player representative. ``We don't stand to gain much by
commenting. We wouldn't talk about (the strike-zone change) in
spring training, why would we talk about it now?''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said he was shocked by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught me off guard,'' Cox said, adding he would like to
see Major League Baseball and the umpires union work out their
differences quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(September) is when pennant races really get going,'' Cox
said. ``You don't want them to be breaking in new umpires then.
Smoltz outing in AA
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz returned to the mound to test out his elbow Thursday
night for the AA Greenville Braves. He pitched two scoreless
innings in Jacksonville, throwing 27 pitches and striking out the
side in the third inning. He finished with four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went all right,'' Smoltz said. ``I don't know how it's
going to be the next day or so, but it went as good as it could.
I'm sure it'll be a little sore tomorrow. Saturday will be a big
day. I'll take the day off (today), see how it feels and try to do
the same thing again Saturday. I've got a few more hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox is hoping to use Smoltz in one game of the doubleheader on
Friday, July 23 in Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   Millwood's big night out
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood's scoreless inning in his first All-Star Game was
a nice touch in what he said was an overall great experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' Millwood said. ``Probably one of the best
times I've ever had in baseball, getting to hang out with all the
guys. ``Sitting in the bullpen I was a little nervous,'' Millwood
said. ``Once I got on the field it felt like it was just another
game. Rotation adjustment
</P>
<P>
   Cox shifted Millwood's next start from Saturday to Sunday, the
first game of the series in Toronto, and will have rookie Odalis
Perez start on Saturday. Bruce Chen will pitch Monday.

LOOKING BACK AT AN UNPARALLELED ADVENTURE, 30 YEARS AGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Florida day dawned hot and humid.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Kennedy Space Center, more than a million people crowded
roads, parks and beaches to witness the start of a great adventure,
a perilous journey of exploration unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   July 16, 1969. Thirty years ago Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of millions followed anxiously on television. Three
minutes and 10 seconds before the scheduled launch of Apollo 11, a
30-year-old Boeing engineer named Charles Lehtinen pressed a button
that began the firing sequence.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:32 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the monster Saturn 5 rocket,
carrying astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and
Michael Collins, roared away into the heavens from Launch Pad 39A,
leaving an 800-foot-long trail of flame.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, America's decade-long quest was realized. Man
had landed on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13,000 Boeing employees were among the tens of thousands
from NASA, McDonnell Douglas, North American, Grumman and hundreds
of smaller companies who made it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all just a bunch of kids,'' recalled John Winch, who
was in his late 20s when he went to work for Boeing in 1966 in
Huntsville, Ala., as chief engineer for Saturn 5 booster
integration. He was responsible for making sure the first, second
and third stages of the rocket went together and worked the way
they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did it,'' Winch said. ``We didn't know we couldn't.
...''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy set the nation on a trail
Boeing workers would eventually help to blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' Kennedy said, ``that this nation should commit
itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing
a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA selected Boeing that December to build the first stage of
the moon rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Work already was under way in Huntsville on the design of a
super rocket that could launch astronauts to the moon. The Saturn
5, as it became known, was the brainchild of Wernher von Braun and
his team of German scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of the hardware was mind boggling,'' said Denton
Hanford, 24, and just out of college when he joined Boeing in
Seattle in 1961. A year later, he and his wife moved to Huntsville.
His job was to make propulsion performance predictions for the
Saturn 5 first stage.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Tilden also arrived in Huntsville, with his wife and three
children, in 1962. It was his first job with Boeing. He was working
in Houston, as a structural analysis engineer for an oil company,
when he was recruited by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. He chose
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Tilden initially helped on a NASA project to develop the giant
crawler that would transport the 364-foot-tall Saturn 5 from the
Vehicle Assembly Building to its launch pad some three miles away.
He later worked on Saturn 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what I was getting into,'' Tilden said. ``I was
challenged every day for the next 10 or 12 years. It was a great
experience. People were working together for a purpose, for
something they believed it. It was a unique effort. I've never seen
that same kind of atmosphere since.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing built 15 of the first-stage booster rockets, but only the
first two in Huntsville. The manufacturing operation was moved to
the Michoud Ordinance plant in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, in a swamp, had not been occupied since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford and other members of Boeing's first-stage team in
Huntsville, along with about 1,500 Boeing engineers from Seattle,
were sent to the Michoud plant once it had been refurbished. Few
welcomed the forced relocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hot, it was humid,'' Winch said.
</P>
<P>
   They prevailed, though. And the giant Saturn rocket would be
ready for its first test flight in 1967, a year that began with
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Jan. 27, 1967, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed
White and Roger Chaffee died when an electrical fire swept through
their Apollo spacecraft during a launch pad test.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the investigation, NASA handed Boeing a
bigger role: Overall responsibility for Apollo and Saturn 5
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to have some new faces in there in order to convince
Congress we were doing something different,'' said George Mueller,
NASA's chief of manned spaceflight for most of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, who turns 81 this month, still has his sights on the
moon and beyond. He is chief executive officer of Kistler Aerospace
in Kirkland, Wash., where he leads a team, many of them veterans of
NASA, who next year plan to launch the world's first reusable
rocket. On the wall of Mueller's office at Carillon Point, next to
a photo of a Saturn 5 being transported to the launch pad, is the
original NASA schedule that Mueller, von Braun and others signed
off on back in 1963. It charts various program milestones that had
to be met to land a man on the moon before the end of the decade.
The schedule, dated Dec. 17, 1963, set the first moon landing in
April 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Key to meeting Kennedy's challenge, Mueller said, was creating
an organization with a can-do team spirit that could overcome any
obstacles. On Nov. 1, 1963, Mueller ordered that instead of testing
each stage of the Saturn 5 individually, all three stages would be
connected for the first flight. The ``all-up testing'' edict proved
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, on Nov. 9, 1967, the Saturn 5 was ready for
that maiden flight.
</P>
<P>
   Winch was standing outside the Vehicle Assembly Building. His
chest shook from the low frequency assault of noise. But Winch was
absolutely certain the rocket would work.
</P>
<P>
   A second unmanned Saturn 5 test flight a few months later did
not go as well. Boeing's first stage developed what became known as
the ``pogo effect,'' a dangerous modulation that caused the booster
to violently shake up and down for a full half minute after
liftoff. Next, two of the five second-stage engines quit. Had this
Saturn 5 carried astronauts, they would have had to abort the moon
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time on pogo, trying to figure out how to
correct it before the next flight,'' Tilden said. They did.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of Apollo 8 orbited the moon on Christmas Eve 1968.
Apollo 9 soon followed. Then Apollo 10's lunar module came within
50,000 feet of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for Apollo 11.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1969, at 4:17 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, four days
after the spectacular Saturn 5 liftoff from Kennedy Space Center,
the lunar lander Eagle with Armstrong and Aldrin, 15 seconds from
running out of fuel, its on-board computer overloaded with data and
sounding alarms, gently touched down on the Sea of Tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   History held its breath.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Armstrong's first words: ``Houston, Tranquility base
here. The Eagle has landed.''
</P>
<P>
   As he watched on television those first steps on the moon,
Hanford remembered the visit that Neil Armstrong made to the
Michoud plant a couple years earlier. Hanford had briefed and
escorted the astronaut who would become the first man to set foot
on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Aldrin spent more than two hours hopping over the
moon's surface in bulky space suits.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing engineers were then at work designing a unique vehicle
that could carry future astronauts across the moon miles from their
landing site. Three months after Apollo 11, Boeing signed a
contract with NASA to develop what would be called the Lunar Roving
Vehicle. Within 17 months, Boeing delivered four flight-ready
rovers and several more for test and training.
</P>
<P>
   Winch was program manager for the Boeing moon buggy team in
Huntsville. Final assembly was in Kent. The Boeing plant south of
Seattle had manufacturing capability that Huntsville lacked.
</P>
<P>
   Tilden also worked on the project, and manned one of the mission
control consoles in Huntsville in August 1971 when Apollo 15
astronauts Dave Scott and Jim Irwin spent three days exploring the
Alpennine Mountains in the first moon buggy.
</P>
<P>
   After the rover project ended, Tilden was transferred to
Seattle. After retiring in 1994, he helped restore one of the
original rover test vehicles for Boeing's Museum of Flight.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford had returned to Seattle at the end of 1969, but later
became general manager of Boeing's helicopter division in
Philadelphia. He retired last year.
</P>
<P>
   Winch would spent 13 years in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all his engineering skills are being put to the test on
the National Missile Defense project, for which Boeing is prime
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing can compare with the moon program, Winch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things we were doing for the very first time then,''
he said. ``We went at it with enthusiasm, with excitement, with a
spirit of working together. You could meet with your friends, talk
with anyone about it. It wasn't classified. It was inspirational.
Supply any adjective you want. That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hanford feels disappointment on the 30th anniversary of the
moon landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me is how difficult it would be today to go back
to the moon,'' he said. ``It's very disappointing that we could do
it then, but we could not do it today. ... The commitment just
isn't there. We could never find the motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, the ex-NASA boss for manned spaceflight, echoes him.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1969, the day Apollo 11 splashed down in the Pacific
Ocean, Mueller issued a statement that read, in part:
</P>
<P>
   `` ... These trips are only the first step. There remains for
mankind the task of deciding the next step: Will we press forward
to explore other planets, or will we deny the opportunities of the
future. ... The organization that brought men to the moon stands
ready for that next step.''
</P>
<P>
   That next step never came, Mueller said Wednesday as he sat in
his Kirkland office looking distantly at the space photos on his
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most disappointing thing is that having landed on
the moon a few times, we essentially retreated. ... If we had
focused our efforts, if someone had the vision, like President
Kennedy, to say `This is what we are going to do,' we would by now
have a colony on Mars. We would have taken the first couple of
steps in the exploration of the solar system.''

<P>
   ``It was hot, it was humid,'' Winch said.
</P>
<P>
   They prevailed, though. And the giant Saturn rocket would be
ready for its first test flight in 1967, a year that began with
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Jan. 27, 1967, astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed
White and Roger Chaffee died when an electrical fire swept through
their Apollo spacecraft during a launch pad test.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the investigation, NASA handed Boeing a
bigger role: Overall responsibility for Apollo and Saturn 5
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to have some new faces in there in order to convince
Congress we were doing something different,'' said George Mueller,
NASA's chief of manned spaceflight for most of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, who turns 81 this month, still has his sights on the
moon and beyond. He is chief executive officer of Kistler Aerospace
in Kirkland, Wash., where he leads a team, many of them veterans of
NASA, who next year plan to launch the world's first reusable
rocket. On the wall of Mueller's office at Carillon Point, next to
a photo of a Saturn 5 being transported to the launch pad, is the
original NASA schedule that Mueller, von Braun and others signed
off on back in 1963. It charts various program milestones that had
to be met to land a man on the moon before the end of the decade.
The schedule, dated Dec. 17, 1963, set the first moon landing in
April 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Key to meeting Kennedy's challenge, Mueller said, was creating
an organization with a can-do team spirit that could overcome any
obstacles. On Nov. 1, 1963, Mueller ordered that instead of testing
each stage of the Saturn 5 individually, all three stages would be
connected for the first flight. The ``all-up testing'' edict proved
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, on Nov. 9, 1967, the Saturn 5 was ready for
that maiden flight.
</P>
<P>
   Winch was standing outside the Vehicle Assembly Building. His
chest shook from the low frequency assault of noise. But Winch was
absolutely certain the rocket would work.
</P>
<P>
   A second unmanned Saturn 5 test flight a few months later did
not go as well. Boeing's first stage developed what became known as
the ``pogo effect,'' a dangerous modulation that caused the booster
to violently shake up and down for a full half minute after
liftoff. Next, two of the five second-stage engines quit. Had this
Saturn 5 carried astronauts, they would have had to abort the moon
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time on pogo, trying to figure out how to
correct it before the next flight,'' Tilden said. They did.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of Apollo 8 orbited the moon on Christmas Eve 1968.
Apollo 9 soon followed. Then Apollo 10's lunar module came within
50,000 feet of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for Apollo 11.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1969, at 4:17 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, four days
after the spectacular Saturn 5 liftoff from Kennedy Space Center,
the lunar lander Eagle with Armstrong and Aldrin, 15 seconds from
running out of fuel, its on-board computer overloaded with data and
sounding alarms, gently touched down on the Sea of Tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   History held its breath.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Armstrong's first words: ``Houston, Tranquility base
here. The Eagle has landed.''
</P>
<P>
   As he watched on television those first steps on the moon,
Hanford remembered the visit that Neil Armstrong made to the
Michoud plant a couple years earlier. Hanford had briefed and
escorted the astronaut who would become the first man to set foot
on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Aldrin spent more than two hours hopping over the
moon's surface in bulky space suits.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing engineers were then at work designing a unique vehicle
that could carry future astronauts across the moon miles from their
landing site. Three months after Apollo 11, Boeing signed a
contract with NASA to develop what would be called the Lunar Roving
Vehicle. Within 17 months, Boeing delivered four flight-ready
rovers and several more for test and training.
</P>
<P>
   Winch was program manager for the Boeing moon buggy team in
Huntsville. Final assembly was in Kent. The Boeing plant south of
Seattle had manufacturing capability that Huntsville lacked.
</P>
<P>
   Tilden also worked on the project, and manned one of the mission
control consoles in Huntsville in August 1971 when Apollo 15
astronauts Dave Scott and Jim Irwin spent three days exploring the
Alpennine Mountains in the first moon buggy.
</P>
<P>
   After the rover project ended, Tilden was transferred to
Seattle. After retiring in 1994, he helped restore one of the
original rover test vehicles for Boeing's Museum of Flight.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford had returned to Seattle at the end of 1969, but later
became general manager of Boeing's helicopter division in
Philadelphia. He retired last year.
</P>
<P>
   Winch would spent 13 years in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all his engineering skills are being put to the test on
the National Missile Defense project, for which Boeing is prime
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing can compare with the moon program, Winch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things we were doing for the very first time then,''
he said. ``We went at it with enthusiasm, with excitement, with a
spirit of working together. You could meet with your friends, talk
with anyone about it. It wasn't classified. It was inspirational.
Supply any adjective you want. That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hanford feels disappointment on the 30th anniversary of the
moon landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me is how difficult it would be today to go back
to the moon,'' he said. ``It's very disappointing that we could do
it then, but we could not do it today. ... The commitment just
isn't there. We could never find the motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller, the ex-NASA boss for manned spaceflight, echoes him.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1969, the day Apollo 11 splashed down in the Pacific
Ocean, Mueller issued a statement that read, in part:
</P>
<P>
   `` ... These trips are only the first step. There remains for
mankind the task of deciding the next step: Will we press forward
to explore other planets, or will we deny the opportunities of the
future. ... The organization that brought men to the moon stands
ready for that next step.''
</P>
<P>
   That next step never came, Mueller said Wednesday as he sat in
his Kirkland office looking distantly at the space photos on his
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most disappointing thing is that having landed on
the moon a few times, we essentially retreated. ... If we had
focused our efforts, if someone had the vision, like President
Kennedy, to say `This is what we are going to do,' we would by now
have a colony on Mars. We would have taken the first couple of
steps in the exploration of the solar system.''

CONGRESSMAN DEMANDS INQUIRY OF PIPELINE SAFETY AFTER ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pointing to the deaths of three people when an oil
pipeline exploded in Bellingham last month, a top member of
Congress on Thursday demanded a wide-ranging congressional
investigation into the federal government's regulation of pipeline
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The demand by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., came on the same day
that Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., summoned Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater to her office seeking stepped-up inspections of
pipelines in Washington state and assurances that there would be no
rush to reopen the Bellingham pipeline, about 90 miles north of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Slater, whose department is responsible for pipeline safety,
pledged not to allow Olympic Pipe Line to reopen the pipe until he
can guarantee its safety, and promised to consider Murray's request
that he permanently station a federal pipeline inspector in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   But Slater also defended the administration's handling of
pipeline safety, and rejected suggestions that his department's
Office of Pipeline Safety is too close to the oil and gas industry
it is supposed to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an administration guided by a president and a vice
president that say we're going to put the American people first,''
Slater said after meeting with Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that we're not going to work in partnership
with industry and with safety advocates, but I can assure you that
our meeting today has been focused on the people who are involved
here, and that's what our commitment is. We will work with
industry; we will regulate industry in a way that protects the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The actions by Dingell and Murray mark the first public steps
members of Congress have taken in response to the June 10 explosion
in Bellingham, when Olympic's 16-inch pipeline ruptured, sending
hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline into Whatcom Creek.
Gasoline vapor ignited, burning two 10-year-old boys to death. A
teenager died after he was overcome by fumes, fell in the creek and
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion is likely to be explored in depth by Congress,
which has just begun debating the renewal of the nation's pipeline
safety laws, which expire next year.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who toured the Bellingham site last Friday, pledged to
play an active role in the debate over renewal of pipeline safety
laws, even though she does not sit on a committee with jurisdiction
over the office. She said she pushed Slater not to reopen the
Olympic pipeline too quickly, to station an inspector permanently
in Washington state and to support right-to-know actions that would
alert communities to potential pipeline safety problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expressed to him my desire to work with him to make sure
that we do everything we can to make sure this community is safe
before the pipeline reopens, and also to prospectively do
everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen anywhere
again,'' Murray said. ``I intend to be working on the pipeline
reauthorization bill to make sure we are doing everything we can
... and I will be looking at whether or not we should improve the
standards, or the reporting requirements, or the community's right
to know about any anomalies that exist in the pipeline or any
safety conditions that exist in their neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater said Olympic Pipe Line will have to take numerous
corrective actions before being allowed to reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not plan to reopen this pipeline until the standards
have been met, until we can ensure the safety of the pipeline for
the people there in Bellingham,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Murray's request that he station an inspector in
Washington, Slater said, ``we will consider that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 55 federal inspectors responsible for inspecting all
interstate pipelines in the United States, and states employ
another 250 inspectors to handle intrastate pipelines. Of the 55
federal inspectors, 10 are responsible for the Western United
States, including eight in Denver and two in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell, the longest-serving member of the House, is a longtime
critic of pipeline safety and the top Democrat on the House
Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Office of
Pipeline Safety. Late Thursday he sent a detailed letter to the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
seeking a broad investigation of the Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell cited not only the June 10 Bellingham accident, but also
a 1994 pipeline explosion in New Jersey that destroyed an apartment
complex and a 1993 leak in Virginia that caused environmental and
property damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the effectiveness of current law remains unclear, so too
does the effectiveness of the agency charged with administering
that law, the Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline
Safety,'' Dingell wrote. ``Congress, for its part, must try to
ensure that our pipeline safety laws and the agency charged with
enforcing those laws are working in a manner that protects the
public and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell asked the GAO to review virtually every allegation made
by the numerous critics of the Office of Pipeline Safety. He also
asked the GAO to determine the validity of accusations that the
Office of Pipeline Safety has ignored directives from Congress and
recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell also called upon the GAO to determine whether there were
actions the Office of Pipeline Safety could have taken to prevent
the Bellingham accident, and to supply a list of all key
recommendations to strengthen pipeline safety efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dingell cannot order the GAO to conduct an
investigation, the agency is certain to do so in response to a
request from such a senior member of Congress.

SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS A GOOD SIGN FOR RESURGENT BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. painted a picture of a resurgent
company Thursday, reporting a jump in earnings in the second
quarter fueled in part by a more productive and efficient
commercial airplane division.
</P>
<P>
   The increase represents another step in Boeing's effort to
improve operations and restore investors' confidence. The company
drove profits up partially by squeezing more work out of its
commercial airlines group with fewer workers and lower expenses.
That group recorded $435 million in second-quarter operating
earnings, compared with a loss of a year ago, with 17 percent fewer
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Boeing posted $701 million in net income in the second
quarter, including a one-time windfall of $181 million tied to a
federal tax settlement. The company earned $258 million a year ago,
although that number was cut by $78 million in one-time costs.
Overall, the report represents the fourth consecutive quarterly
increase in earnings from the aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is a turnaround story, (it's) a very good
indication it's on track,'' said Bill Fiala, an analyst at
Missouri-based Edward Jones Investments.
</P>
<P>
   The profits also translate into 75 cents earnings per share
including the tax payment, in the second quarter, compared with 26
cents a share in the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also rolled out a new measurement tool Thursday. The
so-called value scorecard includes targets and goals designed to
give investors, executives and employees a clearer picture of the
company's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The scorecard also sets financial targets for executives at the
world's largest airplane manufacturer. For example, Boeing hopes to
cut $1.6 billion in overhead by the end of 2000, while trimming its
base of suppliers from 31,000 to 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The scorecard is part of a broader effort to review the
company's operations, services and products. While Boeing has shed
some divisions, it plans to focus more of its time on improving
lines that merit repair, according to Chief Executive Officer Phil
Condit.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that's good news for Boeing's new 717 airplane
that the company is hawking to airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that (they) are committing to the 717,'' Fiala
said.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts hailed the company's profits, they added that
investors shouldn't expect Boeing to continue to report dramatic
increases in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that Boeing is facing an environment of declining
revenue, this kind of profitability level probably remains somewhat
flat over the next year or two,'' said Peter Jacobs, a
Seattle-based analyst for Ragen MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers warned that Boeing will also be challenged to
boost growth in the face of fierce price competition from rival
Airbus Industrie and a downturn in airplane orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more challenging work is in front of them,'' said
James Kawai, an analyst who tracks Boeing for Neuberger &AMP; Berman.
</P>
<P>
   The company admits the second quarter likely represents the high
mark for revenue in 1999. Overall, the company expects to have
revenues of $58 billion this year, while delivering 620 airplanes.
So far, it's on track to meet the target; the company delivered 313
airplanes in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, revenue is projected to drop $10 billion to $48
billion, the result of a downturn in demand and the impact of
Asia's economic troubles moving from Boeing's order book to
production, according to Boeing executives.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company expects to squeeze even more out of its
commercial airplane wing next year. The company expects operating
margins of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent from the group this year and
4.5 to 5.5. percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take several years for Boeing to achieve its goal of
joining the top quartile of companies in the S&AMP;P 500, Jacobs said.
Those companies routinely produce 10 percent margins, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Condit said he was ``a little more optimistic'' about
prospects in Asia. The Asian economies are key elements in
establishing production goals for the 747 airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Condit noted recent positive developments in Japan and said the
company plans to review the production targets for the 747.
</P>
<P>
   Condit added that Boeing has no current plans to announce
additional layoffs beyond the target already announced of trimming
between 48,000 and 53,000 jobs through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The company had little choice but to announce some job cuts as
part of its effort to become more efficient and to attract capital
from the financial markets, according to Condit.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is also embroiled in negotiations with 49,000 Machinists
over a new contract. Condit said he was optimistic of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing shares actually fell seven-eighths to close at 46 and
three-quarters in trading Thursday. However, the stock price has
been rising in recent days in anticipation of a healthy financial
report. Overall, Boeing's stock price is up 43 percent since the
end of last year.

CITY HALL SUES UTILITY OVER 18-HOUR BLACKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Accusing Consolidated Edison of gross negligence, the
administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sued the utility on
Thursday, contending that blackouts in upper Manhattan last week
were caused by Con Edison's failure to properly design and maintain
its network of cables that distribute electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The city did not ask for a specific amount in damages in the
lawsuit, which Giuliani had been threatening to file starting late
last week. But the mayor said in a news conference that he hoped to
recoup ``multiple millions of dollars'' for the extra cost of
police officers, firefighters, emergency medical workers and other
city employees during the power failures that crippled the
Manhattan neighborhoods of Washington Heights and Inwood for 18
hours on July 6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, also
sought several unusual remedies that city officials said would make
it less likely that New Yorkers would have to endure similar
blackouts in the future. The city asked the courts to order Con
Edison to develop a new plan for the design, installation and
maintenance of its power distribution system to prevent blackouts.
It also asked the courts to appoint a special master who would
oversee Con Edison's new plan.
</P>
<P>
   The city also asked the courts to establish a special procedure
to enable city residents, along with government officials and the
city's Board of Education, to present their claims against Con
Edison and be compensated quickly for losses caused by the
blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Con Edison, Eugene McGrath, declined to speak
about the suit Thursday. ``I've never dealt with a lawsuit from the
city, so I can't comment,'' McGrath said, shortly after he had
finished testifying before a State Assembly hearing in Manhattan on
the power failures.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people in the Washington Heights and Inwood
sections of upper Manhattan lost power at the height of an intense
heat wave last week, when underground power lines from substations
to the neighborhoods failed and then several power lines caught
fire. Con Edison said that it was forced to shut off all
electricity north of 155th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the state Public Service Commission, which
regulates utilities, have said that in studies of rates of power
failures, Con Edison's performance has been the best among New York
state's power companies. But Giuliani contends that Con Edison must
upgrade its distribution system so that there are never any
blackouts, and he has repeatedly accused the company's executives
of setting low expectations by trying to explain away power
failures as all but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the power failures last week, which
also affected the Lower East Side, were caused by the huge demand
for power because of record-setting temperatures and humidity, or
whether they reflected more fundamental problems with the design
and condition of Con Edison's vast network of cables that transmit
electricity from generating stations to homes and offices.

   Defying a ruling by the Andean customs union, President Hugo
Chavez of Venezuela has closed his country's border to all
commercial vehicles from Colombia. He took the action, reportedly
causing chaos at border crossings, after complaining that
Venezuelan truckers are unable to travel safely in Colombia because
of guerrilla activity there and recalling his ambassador to Bogota
in retaliation for remarks a Colombian Cabinet member made
criticizing Venezuela's position on the issue.

<P>
   With voters set to pick a constitutional assembly on July 25,
the National Electoral Council has ordered President Hugo Chavez to
stop attending rallies of candidates he favors and to suspend his
weekly radio and television programs on state-run channels, saying
those activities violate the nonpartisan character of the election.
Chavez, who was also fined $10,000, said ``they'll have to put me

 &HT;    British scores soar
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Day 2 of the Carnage at Carnoustie is
scheduled to begin this morning _ if golfers in the British Open
decide to return. It has become the Brutish Open, where the world's
greatest players are starting to feel as though they've been
dragged for five hours tied to the bumper of a rental car.
</P>
<P>
   With shin-high rough, the 128th British Open promised to be no
picnic in calm conditions. Add 25-mph winds, and the first round of
the tournament evolved into an epic that could have drawn an R
rating for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Strange things happened Thursday, when winds allowed players to
smack 200-yard 9-irons with it or beat drivers 220 yards against
it. The leader is a 30-year-old Australian named Rodney Pampling,
whose previous claim to fame was a victory in the Canon Challenge
on the Australasian Tour. Pampling was the only player to match par
71.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind the wind,'' said Pampling, who eagled the par-5
14th hole with a 1-iron, 6-iron and a 25-foot putt. ``It's a
challenge. It makes you think a lot harder out on the golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking isn't what hurt. The real pain came in the scoring
tent, where the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club officials might have been
wise to dispense calculators. Germany's Bernhard Langer and
Alpharetta's Scott Dunlap are one shot back, and Americans Steve
Pate, Justin Leonard, Hal Sutton and Len Mattiace are at 2-over 73.
But most of the scores were much higher.
</P>
<P>
   With fairways tighter than the hallway of a Scottish boarding
house, the scoring average for the first round was 78.31 strokes.
Of the 155 players, 57 shot 80 or worse. Spain's Sergio Garcia shot
an 89. Defending champion Mark O'Meara shot 83. U.S. Open champion
Payne Stewart and runner-up Phil Mickelson recorded matching 79s.
</P>
<P>
   While pre-tournament favorite Tiger Woods is in fine shape at
3-over 74, even he could not emerge without a bizarre event. A
scantily clad woman appeared on the 18th green and planted a kiss
on him. On a day this bizarre, the incident was like an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if the average player had to get out here and play,
he'd probably quit,'' said David Duval after recording his 79,
``and I think a lot of the pros are pretty close to that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a 15-handicapper came out and played here today,'' said Hal
Sutton, who had a 73, ``a good number would be 120.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Cooper, who owns a sandwich shop in Warrington, England,
spent most of the day atop the leaderboard with Pampling, but he
triple-bogeyed the 17th to finish at 74.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III also had a 74, undone by a
double-bogey at the 12th hole, where he drove into the high grass
and moved his second shot about two feet with a sand wedge. Also
among those at 74 are Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, 10 shots over
his course-record score, and Ernie Els of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just let it get away from me a little,'' Love said. ``I
didn't get what I wanted, but I survived. Everyone's got to play
the golf course. They're not going to call the tournament off
because it's too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   After complaints during practice rounds about narrow fairways
and high rough, the whining heightened when winds made both facets
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The R&AMP;A said it's not the way they wanted to set it up,''
Duval said, ``but that it was some out-of-control greens-keeper,
and you know that's not the case. Let them go play it and see how
many of them start crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Billy Andrade, four shots off the lead, called his 75
``my par.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Andrade said. ``I'm very happy with 75....
We were walking down the 18th fairway and (playing partner) Miguel
Angel Jimenez saw Sergio Garcia and said, `This is ridiculous. This
is a young man who won the Irish Open and almost won Loch Lomond,
and he's going down the 17th hole 15-over par.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing when you have bad shots that turn out really
bad,'' said Atlanta's Stewart Cink after an 82. ``It's another
thing when you have dang good shots that turn out really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think your (pride is hurt) a little bit when you shoot in
the 80s,'' O'Meara said. ``I mean, I'm a professional golfer _ but
I tried on every shot.

 &HT;    Gordon, Stewart apologize for incidents at Loudon
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This weekend's off-date should give NASCAR drivers a
chance to cool down after last week's emotional race at New
Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who bumped
and passed points leader Dale Jarrett in the final lap of the Jiffy
Lube 300, apologized to Jarrett this week. Rookie Tony Stewart, who
lost the event when he ran out of fuel with fewer than three laps
left, also apologized for his behavior in Loudon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 28, led 100 of the final 103 laps before his No. 20
Pontiac stalled on lap 297. After refueling, Stewart tangled with
the No. 36 Pontiac of Ernie Irvan. Stewart then stormed away from
the garage area, refusing to answer reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so consumed with emotion,'' Stewart said, ``(but) there
was a lack of maturity there. It's not going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the 1997 Indy Racing League champion, says he spoke to
owner Joe Gibbs about his post-race behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was inexcusable,'' Stewart said. ``Hopefully, people will
forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gordon and Jarrett were involved in a heated
post-race confrontation in the garage. The pair stood toe-to-toe
and exchanged heated words. As Jarrett walked back to his No. 88
Ford, he screamed at Gordon, ``If you want to turn this into a war,
it's on. We can make it one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who finished third in the race, seemed diplomatic in his
post-race news conference, but Jarrett says Gordon apologized
before leaving the speedway. At this week's Ford testing at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Jarrett said he isn't angry with
Gordon, who trails Jarrett by 389 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot for (Gordon) to walk over to someone who is a
lot bigger than he is,'' Jarrett told the Indianapolis
Star-Tribune. ``I don't regret anything. It was racing and, as far
as I'm concerned, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Driver change
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen races remain on this year's Winston Cup schedule, but
the sport's ``Silly Season'' apparently already has started. Jerry
Nadeau, a second-year driver in Melling Racing's No. 9 Ford, will
replace Wally Dallenbach next season in the No. 25 Chevrolet of
Hendrick Motorsports, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   The change and a sponsorship announcement for Hendrick's third
car is expected Monday at the team's headquarters in Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach, 36, a road-course specialist, has only two top-10
finishes in 18 starts this season and is 20th in points. Nadeau's
finishes are actually worse, as he's 33rd in points with only one
top-10 effort.
</P>
<P>
   Melling Racing is expected to continue its Winston Cup
operation, and the search for Nadeau's replacement is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Indy testing
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett had the fastest lap in Ford's two-day testing at
Indianapolis, covering the 2.5-mile oval in 50.236 seconds, an
average speed of 179.154 mph. He was followed by Jeff Burton
(178.260), Mark Martin (178.218), Jeremy Mayfield (177.925) and
Kenny Irwin Jr. (177.736).
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolets and Pontiacs are scheduled to test at Indy on Monday
and Tuesday for the Aug. 7 Brickyard 400.

 &HT;    Garcia can't get going, shoots 89
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ In retrospect, Sergio Garcia probably
should have waited a day for his declaration of terms. On
Wednesday, Garcia announced to the media a preference to be called
``Sergio.'' On Thursday, in the first round of the 128th British
Open, Garcia shot an 18-over-par 89.
</P>
<P>
   True, everyone fought for their professional lives Thursday in
the 25-mph winds, but only two players on the board posted higher
numbers than the 19-year-old Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps another day,'' Garcia said to a mob of reporters,
moving to the clubhouse. ``I'm not in the mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after cooling off, he said, ``It does cross your mind
sometimes that you'd like to walk off, but my caddie said, `Come
on, let's go and see if I could shoot 80.' But I had two doubles in
a row (on 9 and 10), and it was an impossibility of getting it
going.... It's part of the learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Higginbotham, Garcia's talkative caddie, said, ``Well, at
least we broke 90.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in his third British Open, Garcia started with a
triple-bogey on the first hole and began a nightmare that never
ended. He made a birdie, six bogeys, five double-bogeys and a
triple-bogey. It was a brutal contrast to the last two weeks, when
Garcia won the Irish Open and finished second at Loch Lomond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was suffering,'' he said. ``I couldn't do anything....
I don't see this test as very fair. It's too difficult.... I left
(earlier) because I wanted to be alone for two hours with my family
after the day I had. I wanted to take a little time out, because I
think it's better to speak now that I am calm.... Today is
forgotten. I will try again to play well tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods stunned at the 18th
</P>
<P>
   A woman wearing a thong and bikini top appeared on the 18th
green to plant a kiss on Tiger Woods. ``When she first came up, I
was kind of surprised by that,'' Woods said. ``I wondered what Ian
(Woosnam, his playing partner), was laughing at. She came up as I
was walking up toward my ball. I had spikes on, so I didn't want to
step on her feet because she was barefoot. After she did what she
did, she ran off. I tried to get my focus back, focus on the job at
hand, and that was to bury that putt. Unfortunately, I just left it
right in the middle of the hole short.''... Leader Rodney Pampling
was using an 18-degree driving iron, hitting it about 180 yards
into the wind and 290 downwind.
</P>
<P>
   Open-ing the menu
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant in Monifeith just down the road is advertising
appropriate lunch specials for the week _ the Seve Salad, the Greg
Egg, the Tiger Burger and the Full Monty.... Asked what the hardest
thing was to accomplish in Thursday's first round, Payne Stewart,
the U.S. Open champion, said, ``Trying not to injure yourself out
there.... Seventy-nine? Well, it beats 80. I was really working
hard to break the `snowman.'''... Scot Colin Montgomerie on the
windy conditions: ``This is a breezy summer's day here, nothing
more than that.''... On the toughness of Carnoustie, Monty
reminded, ``Thirty days ago, we were saying Pinehurst was the
hardest course we've ever played. We're all changing our opinion
coming here. There's a lot of good players that have been blown
away today. They will be tomorrow, too, and they will be Saturday
and Sunday, if it remains this way.''... There were 23
double-bogeys made on the 412-yard 7th hole.... Len Mattiace, two
shots back with a 73, made birdies on the two toughest holes
Thursday _ the 9th and the 17th.... Sam Torrance of Scotland
withdrew because of a shoulder injury.

 &HT;    Thrashers acquire Botterill, Prochazka; trade Pushor
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Thrashers finally have a coach and a
schedule. But the roster, just like Philips Arena, is still under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Don Waddell made two trades Thursday, the most
significant of which was the acquisition of left wing Jason
Botterill, a former first-round draft pick, from Dallas for
defenseman Jamie Pushor.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers also obtained right wing Martin Prochazka from
Toronto for a sixth-round draft pick in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Botterill, 23, was the 20th overall selection in 1994 and scored
104 goals in four years at the University of Michigan. He split
last season between Dallas and the IHL Michigan K-Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased to add a forward of Jason's caliber,''
Waddell said. ``He is young, talented and physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Botterill, who is 6 feet 4, 220 pounds, had no points and 23
penalty minutes in 17 games with Dallas last year. He had 13 goals
and 25 assists in 56 games in the IHL.
</P>
<P>
   Pushor, 26, was expected to be used in a trade when he was
selected by the Thrashers from Anaheim in the expansion draft, but
a deal with Phoenix fell through. The rugged defenseman started his
career with Detroit and was traded to the Mighty Ducks during the
1997-98 season. He had three points and 112 penalty minutes in 70
games last season. Prochazka, 27, played for the Czech Republic
when it won the Olympic gold medal in 1998. He played in his native
country last season after being with the Maple Leafs in 1997. A
restricted free agent, Prochazka reached contract terms with the
Thrashers after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Karlsson signs contract
</P>
<P>
   Center Andreas Karlsson, 23, signed his first NHL contract after
playing in his native Sweden. The Thrashers obtained the rights to
Karlsson from Calgary on the day of the expansion draft. He was
drafted in 1993 but never signed with the Flames. In 49 games last
season, Karlsson had 18 goals and 15 assists in the Swedish Elite
League.
</P>
<P>
   Preseason schedule
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' eight-game preseason schedule will begin
Saturday, Sept. 11 in Columbus with a 7:30 p.m. game against
Nashville. Training camp will be in Orlando, with players reporting
Sept. 4. The Thrashers will play Carolina in Greenville, S.C., on
Sept. 15, and in Charleston, S.C., on Sept. 24. Atlanta will play
the Blues in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Sept. 12, and St. Louis on
Sept. 14. Two games will be at Philips Arena _ the New York Rangers
7 p.m. Sept. 18 and the New Jersey Devils 3 p.m. Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   National TV exposure
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' second game of the season, Oct. 7 against Detroit
at Philips Arena, will be televised by ESPN2 at 8 p.m. Thrashers
weeknight games normally will begin at 7:30 p.m. ESPN2 will carry
102 games this season, up from 75. ESPN will show 27, beginning
with Pittsburgh at Dallas on Oct. 1. ABC, which takes over hockey
from Fox this season under a five-year, $600 million deal, will
show regional telecasts the last four weeks of the season, along
with the NHL All-Star Game on Feb. 6 in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   The Flames, the South's first NHL team, return to Atlanta on
Oct. 26. The Flames played eight years in Atlanta before being sold
and moved to Calgary in western Canada after the 1979-80 season.
... Atlanta will face its Southeast Division rivals _ Carolina,
Florida, Tampa Bay and Washington _ five times each. The Thrashers
have four games against each of the remaining Eastern Conference
teams, except Toronto, which they will face three times. ...
Carolina will play its first nine games on the road because of
construction delays on its new arena in Raleigh. ... The Thrashers
have two games against Western Conference teams, except for
Anaheim, Chicago and Vancouver, which they are set to meet only one
time each. The Mighty Ducks are the only team that won't visit
Atlanta.

 &HT;    Courier's job: U.S. team's closer
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Jim Courier, who knocked out England with a
five-set triumph of will over Greg Rusedski in the first round of
Davis Cup in April, is situated to deliver again Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Courier will play world No. 2 Patrick Rafter in today's second
match, but he is paired to play Australian teenager Lleyton Hewitt
for the fifth point Sunday if this Davis Cup quarterfinal is still
at issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Courier wasn't always this cool. Though now regarded as one
of the best Davis Cup closers, he remembers what nerves are. Making
his debut in 1991 in Mexico City, Courier was the lead singles
player in the United States' 3-2 victory, thanks mostly to two wins
by Brad Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, it was a nightmare,'' said Courier, who was
trounced twice, by jouneymen Luis Herrera and Leonardo Lavalle. ``I
couldn't handle the altitude, the way the balls flew and the rookie
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up 2-1, and there I was choking in the dressing room as
Brad struggled against Herrera. He came through, finally, in five
sets. I was a nervous wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, the U.S. Davis Cup team is 13-0 when Courier
plays, and he has won the clinching point in five of them. Rod
Laver's presence in 11 consecutive Australian victories, 1959-73,
is the next-best recent feat of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Courier has toiled in the heat of a fifth match for the deciding
point three times, winning them all, including the 6-4, 6-7, 6-3,
1-6, 8-6 triumph over Rusedski, which came two days after another
five-set win, over Tim Henman. The effort did more to rekindle U.S.
Davis Cup pride than any match this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted the ball at the end
of the game,'' Courier said. ``If it was kickball or baseball or
whatever, I always wanted to be involved at the end. Tennis is no
different. I enjoy being out there when the stakes are high.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier's loyalty to the Davis Cup and his history of performing
under duress assured his place on this team, despite his world
ranking, still foundering at No. 41, fifth among American players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rankings don't mean anything in Davis Cup,'' Gullikson said.
``Jim has been a champion. He's been No. 1, he's a Grand Slam
winner. ... And the one thing that's impressive about Jim is his
preparation for Davis Cup. The week before the match, I can count
on the fact he's hitting twice a day. He's prepared for battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier has been the modern-day warrior for U.S. Davis Cup
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he won two matches each in India and the Netherlands
and clinched against Holland in the fifth match, beating Jacco
Eltingh. Two days before, he had upset the Dutch No. 1, Richard
Krajicek. But when the semifinals came, Courier was passed over for
Sampras and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Courier went to Brazil for a first-round match and
survived Fernando Meligeni in five sets in front of the most vile
crowd he had ever seen. Later, he clinched the match by beating
Gustavo Kuerten, on clay. Yet when the semifinals came, Gullikson
passed the baton to Sampras and Michael Chang to play the
Australians in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with his victory over Russia's Marat Safin at Stone
Mountain Park, after trailing 6-0, 4-1, Courier became only the
fourth American in a century of the Davis Cup to win the fifth set
of a meaningful fifth match. Against Rusedski this year, Courier
became the first American to do it twice.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he won't be passed over. Although not revered on tour
as the same player who won four Grand Slam titles and rose to No. 1
in the early '90s, Courier has become America's closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys deal with the pressure of Davis Cup consistently
very well, and Jim is one of those,'' Rafter said. ``He loves the
whole thing of Davis Cup, and he's someone who's been able to
handle that better than anyone else.''

   THOUSAND OAKS _ Halfway through his round of golf at Sherwood
Country Club on Wednesday, Al Michaels was asked how his first nine
holes went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four under,'' the ABC sportscaster said with that resonance in
his voice we've all come to take as one of the most credible in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez. No kidding?
</P>

   ``Four under a rock, three in the water. . .'' Michaels said
without breaking a smile, showing he could not only handle the
sticks but the shtick that goes with serious playing.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe in mulligans? Michaels doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Brentwood resident took up the game four years ago and
subsequently landed a membership at the Bel Air County Club _ and
he's broken 90 a couple of times, too _ Michaels wants to be more
than a weekend hacker as a player. And, as it turns out, more than
another hack golf broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels shot several arrow-perfect drives at Sherwood as
homework after drawing his first real golf assignment. He'll host
the ``Shootout at Sherwood'' match-play event two weeks from
Monday, which gives Tiger Woods and David Duval the honor of being
in the first prime-time golf event to be shown live on network
television.
</P>
<P>
   A made-for-TV gimmick? No one disputes it. Not even Michaels,
known more for his coverage of high-profile events rather than
frivolous sports fodder. Although the truth comes out _ the first
ABC event he did as a broadcaster for ``Wide World of Sports'' was
barrel jumping, from some remote spot in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will cover the gimmick with more than twice as many
announcers as participants when you throw Mike Tirico, Jimmy
Roberts, Judy Rankin and Curtis Strange into the mix. And Michaels
claims his reputation will be untarnished by his doing the ``Monday
Night Golf'' broadcast that'll go live to the East Coast at 8 p.m.
(5 p.m. in the West) on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this devaluates the game at all,'' said
Michaels, who starts his 13th season on ``Monday Night Football''
with the NFL Hall of Fame game between Cleveland and Dallas a week
after the golf event. He will run with the ball all the way to the
network's Super Bowl coverage from Atlanta in late January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the criticism since the event was announced, but
does the Home Run Derby we all watched this week really devaluate
baseball? Everyone wants to see Ken Griffey Jr. hit shots out of
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this event, it's the two golfers with the most cachet
going head-to-head and providing entertainment. TV is an
entertainment business. Every golfer I know said it sounds like a
pretty neat event and they're asking me to get them passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Woods and Duval end up in the same twosome playing for
the British Open title Sunday in front of ABC's cameras in
Scotland, the Sherwood event won't be anticlimactic, Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might even be enhanced,'' he said. ``No one is saying this
event is going to prove who's the best golfer in the world. I know
this course will play very well on television. We just hope it's
close and there's some drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Note to Duval: You might want to have a pregnant wife standing
by a la Phil Mickelson, in case the match gets away from you.
</P>
<P>
   __ More stars on parade: The surprise isn't that Fox's coverage
of Tuesday's Major League Baseball All-Star Game drew ratings that
were nine percent lower than last year's contest carried by NBC.
It's that anyone stayed around to watch the anticlimactic
exhibition at all after the emotional pregame Ted Williams
lovefest.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did stick around were treated by the usual Fox fare of
catcher-cam moments, Joe Buck barbs and Bob Brenly bushwhacking
that made it worth not giving into the temptation to flip over to
ESPN's replay of the Women's World Cup finale. (It's no wonder ESPN
and MLB are in a dispute when the cable network goes to such
measures to try to lure viewers from the Midsummer Classic with
more feminine flagwaving).
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, All-Star the game did a 12.0 national rating and
22 share (L.A. was right on that mark at 11.8/21). The pregame show
(locally from 5 p.m. to 5:51 p.m.) actually had a lower mark
nationally than the game (10.5), but it was the highest-rated
pregame in five years. L.A., however, was less impressed; the
8.8/19 mark was a drop from NBC's pregame of '98 (9.0/22).
</P>
<P>
   As usual, ratings might measure quantity but will forever fail
to indicate quality.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league props must go to pregame-show producer Gary Lang,
game producer Michael Weismann and director Bill Webb for making
the viewer feel as if he were a member of the inner circle
listening to Williams greet players like Mark McGwire (``Let me ask
you: Do you smell the wood burn from your bat when you hit a foul
ball?'') and Tony Gwynn as they came by to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Lang with the montage of morphing player faces during the
``Field of Dreams'' segment and Webb for having the dumb luck to go
live with catcher-cam on Jim Thome's at-bat when he lined a single
to center to drive in the game's first run. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
The third and final rounds this weekend of the Ameritech Senior
Open will be worth gazing at on CBS after the British Open on ABC
if only to see what kind of coverage the Big Eye network gives its
own famed course analyst Gary McCord as he plays the event. Says
broadcast pal David Feherty: ``It's going to be somewhat difficult
commenting on his game because it will be unprofessional to laugh
and unprofessional to root for him, in which I will probably both
be doing. . . . If Gary plays well on our broadcast and happens to
win, forget about the other major being played this weekend. It
will be a major for him.'' McCord's response: ``Every fat iron
shot, pulled hooked drive and whiffed putt will be chronicled by my
colleagues. Let hell week begin.'' &QL; 
__ Isn't that ducky? Mighty West Coasters skate away as the
greatest benefactors from year one of the new ABC/ESPN/ESPN2
television contract with the NHL. Specifically, ESPN2's schedule is
expanded to 102 regular-season games _ four a week _ and there are
26 West Coast prime-time games added. &QL; 
__ Surfer magazine's 40th-anniversary collector's issue (Oct. '99),
which focuses on the 25 most influential wave crashers of all
time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Media criticism that ABC's coverage of the Women's World Cup
final was too processed American cheesy. Could we have seen more
shots of the Chinese players agonizing during the penalty kicks?
Wouldn't have hurt. But were the broadcasters (particularly J.P.
Dellacamera) too rah-rah for the U.S.? That hardly came across on
our TV audio. If you want a real gauge of media boosterism
disguised as giving readers what they wanted, every Sunday
newspaper in America was guilty. Although, maybe not as much as the
latest cover of Sports Illustrated. &QL; 
__ ESPN Classic shows the WWC final one more time Sunday at 2 p.m. &QL; 
__ Is there a doctor in the house? Former journalist Barbara
Walters has wrestled for the first network TV interview with
Wimbledon semifinalist Alexandra Stevenson and mommy dearest
Samantha, which will err during a very special edition of ``20/20
Friday'' next week. Babs' babbling was done Wednesday and the
network will release transcripts next week when it comes closer to
promoting the nonevent. Stay tuned to ``Dateline NBC'' for
supplemental Julius Erving reaction. &QL; 
__ AM-1150's next act of desperation will be attempting to lure
Fox's Terry Bradshaw to host a show this fall. Here's a title idea
that's available: ``Home Team with Terry Bradshaw.''

STOCK EXCHANGES ABANDON PLANS TO RELOCATE TO TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly a year after Nasdaq and the American Stock
Exchange created a stir in New York with grand plans to move to a
new 40-story skyscraper near Times Square, the two financial
markets have reversed course and now appear ready to stay in lower
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The decision amounts to a retreat for Frank G. Zarb, the
chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which
owns both Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange. Zarb had planned
to move to Times Square, a telegenic international crossroads, as a
step in building a world financial market to rival the New York
Stock Exchange. But Zarb has since discovered that building a new
headquarters in midtown, or even in lower Manhattan, can be
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to city officials Thursday, Nasdaq said the two
stock markets were now considering an expanded trading floor at the
American Stock Exchange, at 86 Trinity Pl., and leasing 290,000
square feet at either 1 Liberty Plaza or 1 World Financial Center
for Nasdaq. City officials and real estate executives say they
still expect the NASD to move to New York from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Nasdaq resurrected a threat to move its
operations to Jersey City, N.J., if it does not get large tax
breaks from New York, though real estate executives on both sides
of the Hudson River say they doubt that the exchanges would leave
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's goal was to bring Nasdaq to New York,'' said Randy
L. Levine, deputy mayor for economic development. ``We always left
the exact location up to them. We'll continue to work with them to
try and find a suitable home.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Nasdaq signed an agreement with the state and the
city to build a new headquarters at 42nd Street and the Avenue of
the Americas, or a similar site, with a $200 million package of tax
breaks and cash. Levine said Thursday that it was unlikely that
Nasdaq would get that amount now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $200 million deal was for a new building,'' Levine said.
``We usually grant a lower level of incentives when you're only
leasing space.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite signing the agreement with New York on Nov. 3, Michael
Jones, chief administrative officer for the NASD, said the
association had made it clear that the exchanges were still
examining their options. Because of several expiring leases, he
said the association could not wait five years for a building to be
constructed.

<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS _ Halfway through his round of golf at Sherwood
Country Club on Wednesday, Al Michaels was asked how his first nine
holes went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four under,'' the ABC sportscaster said with that resonance in
his voice we've all come to take as one of the most credible in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez. No kidding?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four under a rock, three in the water. . .'' Michaels said

 &HT;    Funeral filled with prayers for surviving boy
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta wrapped compassionate arms around a grieving
family Thursday night and, with gospel music, prayers and poems,
said goodbye to six murder victims.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 attended the emotional, standing-room-only
memorial for Deleane Briskey; four of her children, Torsha and
Craig DeCarlo Briskey; and David Antonio and Antione DeAndre Lucas;
and her sister Essie Jo Huguley.
</P>
<P>
   Inside St. Paul AME Church, along with thoughts of the dead,
were special prayers for survivor Santonio Lucas, 11, the boy who
witnessed the massacre of his family at dawn Monday. Many inside
the sanctuary and outside on the lawn of the church spoke of
Santonio as a child who may be more wounded in his psyche than in
his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, thank you for leaving him behind to tell the story,''
prayed the Rev. A.W. Motley. ``Lord, settle his mind. Don't let him
suffer psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   Others voiced their hope that Santonio, still hospitalized
Thursday night, will recover with the help of his remaining family.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell took up that refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited young Tony Lucas in the hospital. We've got to pray
for this boy and ... bind his wounds,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children should be swimming and playing and going to
movies, having boyfriends and girlfriends,'' he said. ''Instead, we
are burying them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the four children's teachers, Atlanta Public
Schools Superintendent Beverly Hall described their memories of
Deleane Briskey's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antione, a sweet boy. David, an affectionate boy who would hug
the principal in the cafeteria. Carlos, outgoing and full of life.
Torsha, an outstanding honor student,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please also remember Jalisa (Lucas) and Santonio, the
survivors. They have been victimized, but it need not be
lifelong,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   A special poem for Torsha by ``best friend'' Alicia Copeland
painted a picture of a girl on the brink of life with tremendous
intellectual promise.
</P>
<P>
   And Antonio Bailey, an uncle of Santonio and Jalisa, sent out
this reminder: ``Get together with your loved ones when you get
home tonight. Tell them you love them, because when you go out the
door, you don't know if you'll see them again.''

ESPN's replay of the Women's World Cup finale. (It's no wonder ESPN
and MLB are in a dispute when the cable network goes to such
measures to try to lure viewers from the Midsummer Classic with
more feminine flagwaving).
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, All-Star the game did a 12.0 national rating and
22 share (L.A. was right on that mark at 11.8/21). The pregame show
(locally from 5 p.m. to 5:51 p.m.) actually had a lower mark
nationally than the game (10.5), but it was the highest-rated
pregame in five years. L.A., however, was less impressed; the
8.8/19 mark was a drop from NBC's pregame of '98 (9.0/22).
</P>
<P>
   As usual, ratings might measure quantity but will forever fail
to indicate quality.
</P>
<P>
   Major-league props must go to pregame-show producer Gary Lang,
game producer Michael Weismann and director Bill Webb for making
the viewer feel as if he were a member of the inner circle
listening to Williams greet players like Mark McGwire (``Let me ask
you: Do you smell the wood burn from your bat when you hit a foul
ball?'') and Tony Gwynn as they came by to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Lang with the montage of morphing player faces during the
``Field of Dreams'' segment and Webb for having the dumb luck to go
live with catcher-cam on Jim Thome's at-bat when he lined a single
to center to drive in the game's first run. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
The third and final rounds this weekend of the Ameritech Senior
Open will be worth gazing at on CBS after the British Open on ABC
if only to see what kind of coverage the Big Eye network gives its
own famed course analyst Gary McCord as he plays the event. Says
broadcast pal David Feherty: ``It's going to be somewhat difficult
commenting on his game because it will be unprofessional to laugh
and unprofessional to root for him, in which I will probably both
be doing. . . . If Gary plays well on our broadcast and happens to
win, forget about the other major being played this weekend. It
will be a major for him.'' McCord's response: ``Every fat iron
shot, pulled hooked drive and whiffed putt will be chronicled by my
colleagues. Let hell week begin.'' &QL; 
__ Isn't that ducky? Mighty West Coasters skate away as the
greatest benefactors from year one of the new ABC/ESPN/ESPN2
television contract with the NHL. Specifically, ESPN2's schedule is
expanded to 102 regular-season games _ four a week _ and there are
26 West Coast prime-time games added. &QL; 
__ Surfer magazine's 40th-anniversary collector's issue (Oct. '99),
which focuses on the 25 most influential wave crashers of all
time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Media criticism that ABC's coverage of the Women's World Cup
final was too processed American cheesy. Could we have seen more
shots of the Chinese players agonizing during the penalty kicks?
Wouldn't have hurt. But were the broadcasters (particularly J.P.
Dellacamera) too rah-rah for the U.S.? That hardly came across on
our TV audio. If you want a real gauge of media boosterism
disguised as giving readers what they wanted, every Sunday
newspaper in America was guilty. Although, maybe not as much as the
latest cover of Sports Illustrated. &QL; 
__ ESPN Classic shows the WWC final one more time Sunday at 2 p.m. &QL; 
__ Is there a doctor in the house? Former journalist Barbara
Walters has wrestled for the first network TV interview with
Wimbledon semifinalist Alexandra Stevenson and mommy dearest
Samantha, which will err during a very special edition of ``20/20
Friday'' next week. Babs' babbling was done Wednesday and the
network will release transcripts next week when it comes closer to
promoting the nonevent. Stay tuned to ``Dateline NBC'' for
supplemental Julius Erving reaction. &QL; 
__ AM-1150's next act of desperation will be attempting to lure
Fox's Terry Bradshaw to host a show this fall. Here's a title idea
that's available: ``Home Team with Terry Bradshaw.''

FREAK NATURE OF YOUNG OFFICER'S DEATH STUNS DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. _ The rituals are unfamiliar at the somber police
department offices here: The flag at half-staff for one of their
own, the bagpipers preparing to pay tribute to a fallen officer,
the counselors trying to ease the pain of a colleague's death.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Brian M. Dibucci, who suffered a fatal fall after a high
speed chase Thursday, was the first person to die in the line of
duty in the Everett department in 79 years.
</P>
<P>
   The freak nature of his death _ falling 100 feet from a trestle
as he tried to assist his fellow officers _ made the shock even
worse, said Deputy Chief Pat Slack. Police are conscious that they
risk their lives every day, Slack said, but they fear shootings or
stabbings _ ``not something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dibucci's death, the department lost a man who had ``a
wonderful future to look forward to,'' Chief Jim Scharf said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Dibucci considered an up-and-coming patrolman, but
he had just announced his engagement to Margaret Erb, a fellow
Everett officer. The couple, who started dating shortly after
Dibucci joined the department in January of 1998, was planning a
February wedding.
</P>
<P>
   After Dibucci and Erb were to finish working their 5 p.m. to 5
a.m. shift Thursday, they had planned to visit Erb's mother and let
her know the good news.
</P>
<P>
   They were a ``wonderful'' couple, said Dibucci's stepfather,
Thurston County Commissioner Kevin O'Sullivan, who had welcomed
their engagement along with Dibucci's mother, Donna O'Sullivan.
``They loved each other with sincerity and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car involved in the traffic stop is being
investigated for suspicion of second-degree murder, possession of
stolen property _ the car was stolen _ and felony eluding. A
district court judge Thursday set his bail at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors couldn't be immediately reached Thursday, but
Woodall said he expected they would file murder charges against the
driver rather than a lesser charge such as manslaughter. He said
the man was not being treated any more harshly because an officer
had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elements are very clear on murder two,'' Woodall said.
``He committed a felony, and someone died as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibucci's stepfather, himself a former police officer, said he
considered murder charges ``absolutely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibucci was a backup policeman in Thursday's pursuit, one of at
least three officers chasing a driver who had tried to outrun
police after he was spotted driving erratically. The pursuit
proceeded from the downtown streets to the trestle on state Route 2
heading out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Officers had slowed as they approached a sharp S-curve at the
east end of the trestle, Woodall said, but the driver sped on, lost
control, and crashed. The officers ran to the car, guns drawn, and
arrested the unharmed man and his passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The case seemed to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Then they noticed the empty patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   The officers tried to raise Dibucci on his radio, then saw that
he had fallen over the thigh-high barrier to the grass and brush
100 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   The road split into three ramps at that spot of the accident,
and Dibucci had parked at an adjacent overpass about 15 feet from
the stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to figure out what happened.
Everett police said Dibucci was apparently trying to cover the
other officers as they made the arrest, and likely either slipped
or leaned too far as he rushed from his car to the barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death
an accident.
</P>
<P>
   For Dibucci's stepfather, the way Dibucci died was in line with
the way he served his community every day. ``He fell to his death
running to help another officer,'' O'Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dibucci, 30, was ``a great kid,'' said Scharf, sad and weary as
he spoke in the same office where he had interviewed the young man
with glowing references a year and a half before.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, dedicated, professional and compassionate, Dibucci had
wanted to be a police officer from the time he was a boy, family
and friends said.
</P>
<P>
   He was inspired by the example set by his stepfather, who was
the latest in a family line of police officers, and by the
opportunity to serve the public.
</P>
<P>
   Dibucci saw ``the excitement of being on the road, being a part
of the community, seeing what you can do as an individual to
improve the community,'' said former Tenino (Wash.) Police Chief
Derek Stansbury, who worked with Dibucci as a 911 dispatcher in
Thurston County and recruited him as a Tenino officer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the biggest smile and just the biggest heart ... I
don't think I've ever seen Brian have a harsh word for anybody,
ever,'' said dispatcher Gay Nell Bare.
</P>
<P>
   At Tenino ``his mind was always going 120 miles an hour,''
Stansbury said, establishing an especially close rapport with
children, starting up a bicycle cop patrol, and always thinking
about how to improve the department.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his mother and stepfather, of West Olympia, Dibucci is
survived by his father, John Dibucci of Pennsylvania, and his
grandmother, Mary Hill of Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   The last time an Everett officer died was in 1920, when
Detective John Fox was shot by a robber.

GILLETTE REPORTS 19 PERCENT DROP IN NET INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gillette Co., reeling from weakness in its international
business and the dismal performance of some product lines, reported
second-quarter earnings on Thursday that matched Wall Street's
previously lowered expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, the maker of razors and blades, posted a 19 percent
decline in net income to $300 million, or 26 cents a share, from
$372 million, or 33 cents a year earlier. Gillette's revenue rose
3.8 percent to $2.41 billion. Analysts polled by First Call had
initially expected Gillette to earn 29 cents a share, but after an
earnings warning from the company, the estimate was lowered to 26
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Although earnings were announced after the market closed,
investors anticipated the company would hit the revised estimates
and its stock rose $1.25, to $44.75.
</P>
<P>
   The company, though, has only recently begun to get back on
investors' good side. The stock is far off its 52-week high of
$64.375, reached on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   While Gillette's overall business is stumbling, the core
business has never been stronger. The company's Mach3
premium-priced, three-blade shaving system has snagged a 17 percent
share of the market since it was introduced in April 1998. At the
same time, Gillette continues to pick up share in the $7 billion
worldwide razor and blade business, which it dominates with 72
percent of the market. The company's Duracell battery business also
remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said its results were also hurt by increased marketing
and advertising spending and divestiture of a cosmetics unit.

SENATE APPROVES REPUBLICAN PLAN TO REGULATE HEALTH INSURERS

 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the final hours of a bitter and sharply partisan
debate over health care, the Senate killed a Democratic effort to
expand the ability of patients to sue managed care providers and
then, in a near party-line vote Thursday night, approved a
Republican plan to regulate the companies that provide health
insurance for most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, designed to grapple with the health care revolution
that has shifted most Americans into managed care, passed by a
53-47 vote. Two Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island and Peter
Fitzgerald of Illinois, broke ranks with their party to oppose the
bill. The measure would provide $13 billion in new tax breaks for
health care and give an array of rights to consumers, most
significantly creating an appeal process for 124 million Americans
in employer-sponsored health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the other new protections _ including consumer
information, the right to a hospital stay after a mastectomy if
recommended by a doctor and access to an emergency room outside a
managed care network _ would vary according to the nature and
source of a person's insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new rights would apply only to the 48 million people
in self-funded plans offered by large companies. In many cases
these are not the more restrictive insurance plans that have caused
the most consumer concern because they channel access to care
through a ``gatekeeper'' physician.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats had tried unsuccessfully across four days of
impassioned debate to push through a more comprehensive plan that
would have applied to all 161 million Americans with private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, President Clinton vowed to veto any bill that
resembled the Senate's plan. ``If Congress insists on passing such
an empty promise to the American people, I will not sign the
bill,'' he said. ``Passing a strong, enforceable patients' bill of
rights should not be a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As the marathon Senate struggle over the issue drew to a close
Thursday night, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
espoused the Republican philosophy of regulation in moderation and
criticized the Democrats' efforts to expand the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should not imperil the continuing transformation of
American medicine,'' he said. ``It's not our job to dictate or
control that transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the Senate minority leader, harshly
criticized the Republican bill as a fraud. ``The Senate has missed
a golden opportunity to pass a real Patient's Bill of Rights,'' he
said. ``Instead the Republican majority is handing the insurance
industry its version of HMO reform _ half measures only.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans and Democrats sharply divided over an issue
they expect to resonate with the public, Vice President Al Gore
also attacked the Republican bill, another indication that the
parties' different approaches to health care will become an issue
in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be under any illusions,'' said Gore, who came to
the Senate in the late afternoon in the unlikely event that he
would be called upon to cast a tie-breaking vote. He branded the
Republican bill ``a charade'' and a ``bill of goods they've been
trying to promote.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who favored less federal regulation than the
Democrats charged that the Democrats' rival plan would raise
premiums and force more Americans into the ranks of the uninsured.
Of the veto threat, Sen. Don Nickles, the majority whip from
Oklahoma, said, ``We are going to find out if the White House is
interested in increasing quality health care or just wants to make
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Democrats and Republicans tried but failed in the
final hours of debate to find common ground in an attempt to head
off the impasse. ``If this gamesmanship continues the only winner
will be the status quo,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan would have implications for doctors, insurers,
businesses and consumers. The American Medical Association on
Thursday night sharply condemned the final bill, saying, ``In a
highly regrettable action, the Senate has bowed to the insurance
industry dictate that says their profits come first and patients
come last.''
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry by contrast praised the outcome. ``I
think it means that all patients will have a guarantee of
independent review that's a very important aspect of providing
trust and confidence,'' said Karen M. Ignagni, the president of the
American Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant provision of the Republican bill would
allow people in employer-sponsored health plans to appeal decisions
denying them coverage for a specific treatment or type of care.
Patients could appeal to an independent medical reviewer if a
health plan refused to pay for care.
</P>
<P>
   The bill enforces a decision against a health plan by allowing a
patient to obtain treatment outside a health network if treatment
does not begin in the time frame recommended by the reviewer. The
plan would be held liable for the charges and for a $10,000 fine.
And the plan may be assessed another fine of up to $10,000 if it
fails to comply with time frames for review.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the two years that managed care has been a major issue in
Congress, the most hard-fought question has been whether to go
further and expand a patient's right to sue in cases of
malpractice. Currently most patients suing over decisions in
managed care must do so in federal court, where they can typically
collect the value of the care denied but not punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again Thursday afternoon, Republicans charged that the
Democrats' proposal to give consumers the right to sue for punitive
damages in state court would drive up health care costs and serve
as a boon to trial lawyers, an important Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., called it ``lunacy'' to expect the
courts to solve health care problems. ``I am convinced that if you
let the trial lawyers solve a medical problem it is borderline
useless,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats countered that they were trying to insure that the
insurance companies that deny certain health care treatments can be
held to account through the courts in the same way other businesses
are.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting a Republican amendment to strip the right to sue out
of the Democratic plan, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said, ``If
this amendment passes and the HMOs cannot be held accountable in
court of law, what it means is if they kill you, if they maim you,
if they hurt you or your family or your children due to callous or
uncaring bureaucrats they cannot be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   By a 53-47 vote, the Senate went on to kill the Democrats'
liability provision before beginning the final debate.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the grievance procedures the Republican plan provides
certain protections available to different groups of people
depending on the source of their health care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan all women with private health insurance would be
able to stay in a hospital after a mastectomy if their doctor
recommends it. The measure was a response to the emotional issue of
so-called ``drive-by mastectomies in which some insurance companies
had required the operation for breast cancer to be handled as an
out-patient procedure.
</P>
<P>
   An array of other protections were granted to 48 million people
covered by self-funded employer plans, which encompass both
old-style fee-for-service programs and managed care, but are
frequently no the kinds of restrictive HMO plans that have drawn
the most consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   These protections include access to emergency rooms outside a
provider network for services related to stabilizing an emergency
condition. It requires health plans to coordinate transfers or
discharges within an hour after being contacted by the
out-of-service hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The bill grants women in these kinds of health plans direct
access to an obstetrician for pregnancy and child delivery but
direct access to a gynecologist for ``routine'' care.
</P>
<P>
   And for these 48 million people the bill requires ``timely''
access to medical specialists, but only those inside a health
plan's network. For patients, among the 48 million, with cancers
best treated through clinical trials, the plan would require
payment of routine patient costs associated with approved cancer
clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the
department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these areas the Democrats had argued for protections
that were often broader and that would apply to all 161 million
Americans with private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would create $13 billion in new tax breaks,
allowing full deduction of health insurance premiums, the full
deduction of long-term care insurance that is not subsidized by an
employer and an expansion of medical savings accounts, _ tax-free
savings accounts for health care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats object to the medical savings accounts because they
say the accounts provide an incentive for the healthy and the
affluent to drop out of the general insurance pool.

MAN GETS `HARD 40' LIFE SENTENCE IN KILLING OF PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If he ever gets out of prison, Rodney Wayne Henry will be a very
old man.
</P>
<P>
   A judge on Thursday imposed maximum, consecutive sentences for
Henry's role in the rape and murder of a Pennsylvania woman last
year in Lenexa, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County District Judge Peter Ruddick granted the request
of Claire-Marie Monti's parents and prosecutors in imposing a
``hard 40'' life sentence for the first-degree murder charge that a
jury convicted Henry of last May.
</P>
<P>
   Ruddick then ordered consecutive sentences of 16 years and 12
years on rape and aggravated sodomy convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, 25, must serve about 64 years before he can seek parole.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had lost confidence in the lawyer who defended him at
trial, Henry acted as his own attorney Thursday. He said
prosecutors had falsely portrayed his character and role in the
crime. He also said he was extremely remorseful for what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Henry maintained, as he did during the trial, that he was frozen
into inaction by fear when his co-worker, Carl Dean Rails, savagely
beat and strangled Monti.
</P>
<P>
   His defense at trial relied on testimony about his mental
condition and the physical and sexual abuse he had suffered when
younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who would do this should be put away,'' Henry
said Thursday. ``But I did not do this.''
</P>
<P>
   But by his own admission, Henry helped restrain Monti while
Rails strangled her and helped clean up the crime scene and dispose
of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Rails, who is facing capital murder, rape and aggravated sodomy
charges, could go to trial in January.
</P>
<P>
   Monti, 32, a resident of suburban Philadelphia, was in the
Kansas City area in April 1998 to train employees of a Lenexa
company on a new computer system.
</P>
<P>
   She met Henry and Rails in at an area bar one night and,
according to them, returned with them willingly to her Lenexa hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   But District Attorney Paul Morrison argued at trial that there
was evidence that Monti returned to her room alone and that Rails
and Henry followed her and forced their way in. Morrison said they
were angry because she had rebuffed their advances.
</P>
<P>
   Henry denied that, saying Thursday that his version was the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   A witness testified that the day after Monti was killed, Rails
and Henry were laughing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was, sad as it sounds, fun for them,'' Morrison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison also said that he was tired of hearing Henry's
recurring theme that someone else was to blame _ Rails, the men who
abused him and, on Thursday, his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Monti's parents, Victor and Claire Monti, both told Henry on
Thursday that he was responsible for his own actions.
</P>
<P>
   In May, they sat through more than a week of sometimes grisly
testimony about their daughter's murder, and on Thursday they asked
the judge to impose the maximum possible sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodney Wayne Henry is a cold-hearted, dangerous predator
caring only for himself,'' Victor Monti said.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Monti talked about the kind of person her daughter was
and the void left by her death. She said Henry and Rails
``exemplified sub-human behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry ridiculed her daughter's death and smeared her good name
after she was killed, Claire Monti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a cruel and vicious criminal that should never be
allowed the freedom to walk the streets again to prey upon another
innocent victim,'' she said.

NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - I saw that something was wrong when my
cousin Anthony and his wife, Linda, arrived at my sister's house
just as we were turning on the grill for our 4th of July barbecue.
I gasped when I saw him. Even though he and Linda had moved from
New York earlier this year, his ``new resident'' status could not
excuse what I saw. He had a tan. Not just any tan but a deep,
bronze, tan like he was the sun child of George Hamilton and Jackie
Stallone. ``Are you crazy?'' I yelled to him. ``I told you not to
go outside!'' By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COX (Phoenix) - Cox Communications has severely reduced the upload
speed of its high-speed Internet service in the Phoenix metro area
in an effort to thwart the abuse of an estimated 1 percent of its
subscribers. The slowdown is aimed at preventing subscribers from
using the $44.95-per-month service to host pornographic Web sites
and Web/mail servers, The company discovered the abuses during
routine monitoring of the network to make sure people aren't using
the residential service for business purposes, a company spokesman
said. By MAX JARMAN. Story will move in the ``A`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOON (Undated) - It's regarded as the defining moment of the
century, perhaps of all history. It's the moment human beings
shucked their Earthbound destiny, rocketed into the black vastness
of the cosmos and set foot upon another celestial body. The Apollo
moon landing 30 years ago this Monday lasted just under 22 hours.
And although public fascination with space has waned, it remains a
technological feat that altered forever the way humans view the
universe and their place in it. By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER. Story will
move in the ``A`` category.

FANS BOO CLEMENS AS YANKEES FALL TO BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Yankees fans have waited a half season for
Roger Clemens to pitch like someone destined for the Hall of Fame.
They have waited for Clemens to respond to big moments, in the way
David Wells responded before being traded for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens has been as maddeningly erratic as the subways, and
it appears as if he is officially on probation with fans at Yankee
Stadium, who booed Clemens Thursday night for the first time after
was knocked out and lost, 6-2, to the Tom Glavine and the Atlanta
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (8-4) was charged with six runs on six hits and five
walks. Although questionable umpiring calls cost him a couple of
runs, he pitched far below his own standards. When Clemens is at
his best, he has great stuff and command, but once again, Clemens
lacked command. Of the 116 pitches he threw, only 63 were for
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has not had a good season with Toronto, either, and there
is probably not a member of the Yankees front office who would
second-guess the decision to swap the petulant Wells for a
five-time Cy Young Award winner dedicated to excellence.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells almost always pitched well in games particularly
important to the Yankees _ games against rivals, games against
contenders. Clemens has had two starts against Baltimore, two
against the Mets, three versus Texas, one each against Cleveland
and Boston, and Thursday night, he faced the Braves in what was
viewed as a possible World Series preview. Clemens' record in those
10 starts is 3-4, with a 7.33 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   His lack of control haunted him Thursday night. A two-out walk
in the first inning led to a run. He allowed back-to-back walks to
open the fifth inning, in which the Braves scored a run and assumed
a 4-1 lead. The five walks matched his season high.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the umpires announced their intention to resign
Sept. 2 as part of their labor battle with baseball, first base
umpire Jim Evans made two arguable calls that cost the Yankees one
run and led to another.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones, the Braves' speedy center fielder, pulled a
two-out double to left off Clemens in the fourth inning. Randall
Simon then smacked a grounder up the middle, where second baseman
Chuck Knoblauch intercepted the ball and made an off-balance throw
to first base, the ball reaching Tino Martinez on a bounce. Clemens
pumped a fist, signaling for an out. Evans waved two hands, palms
down, parallel to the ground: Safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, taken aback by Evans' call, reacted slowly after
realizing Jones had rounded third and was sprinting home. Martinez
hesitated ever-so-briefly before throwing home, and catcher Jorge
Posada was not in position to block the plate or to receive the
throw. In any event, Martinez's relay was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, bounced out of the dugout and
questioned Evans. Replays appeared to show that Simon was out by a
half-step.
</P>
<P>
   The call probably would not have drawn so much attention if
Evans had not made another controversial one the next inning. With
Atlanta runners on first and second and nobody out, Chipper Jones
hit a grounder to the right field side of second base. Knoblauch
made a diving stop, flipped the ball to Derek Jeter for the
forceout and Jeter threw to first for an apparent double play. But
Evans ruled Jones safe at first, and Martinez and the other Yankee
infielders were incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   Torre argued, to no avail, and replays again indicated that the
call was wrong. Subsequently, Scott Brosius rushed to turn a
grounder to third into a double play and kicked the ball as another
Atlanta run crossed.
</P>
<P>
   But Evans' calls would not have mattered much if Clemens had
pitched more effectively. When Bret Boone singled sharply to start
the seventh, then Andruw Jones walked and Brian Jordan grounded a
hit through the left side, scoring Boone, Clemens was finished.
</P>
<P>
   As he handed the ball to Torre and walked off the mound, he was
met by booing from the crowd of 49,087 _ mild nastiness by Yankee
Stadium standards, but the first real booing Clemens has heard at
Yankee Stadium.

FIRST MOON LANDING MARKING 30TH ANNIVERSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) It's regarded as the defining moment of the century,
perhaps of all history.
</P>
<P>
   It's the moment human beings shucked their Earthbound destiny,
rocketed into the black vastness of the cosmos and set foot upon
another celestial body.
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo moon landing 30 years ago this Monday lasted just
under 22 hours. And although public fascination with space has
waned, it remains a technological feat that altered forever the way
humans view the universe and their place in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apollo changed the world. Anybody that doesn't understand that
doesn't have a clue,'' said James Schefter, a veteran space
reporter and author who covered the Apollo program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed how people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing on the moon altered how we viewed the Earth (fragile),
what America can do when it sets its mind to it (beat the
Russians), and where it ultimately sees itself headed (distant
planets).
</P>
<P>
   ``The really important thing is that it reminds us that, as a
species, we're explorers,'' Schefter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the earliest days as cavemen to the opening of the West,
we have always wanted to know what's over the next hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo 11 moonwalk mission was the outcome of the Cold War
challenge issued by President Kennedy in May 1961, four years after
the Russians launched Sputnik I.
</P>
<P>
   But it was by no means a fait accompli. It required coordination
by thousands of scientists and the creation of a host of new
technologies, including those that developed fire-retardant
clothing and heart-monitoring equipment now routinely used in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were just going to prove America's technical
superiority, there's no question that we did that,'' said Claude
Canizares, director of the Center for Space Research at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unbelievable technical triumph to put people on the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona played a significant role in the mission. The U.S.
Geological Survey, headed by the late Gene Shoemaker, trained these
and later astronauts in the new field of ``astrogeology'' at Meteor
Crater, a geological cousin to the moon, as well as at Sunset
Crater and the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The USGS also helped map the moon and pick landing sites, and it
monitored the astronauts' geological work as they explored the Sea
of Tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Lab also helped
map geological sites, determine exactly where the astronauts were
and advise where to place various instruments and where to collect
lunar rock samples.
</P>
<P>
   At Arizona State University, a geologist analyzed moon rocks for
carbon content, a key ingredient for life. The samples were so
valuable that they were kept in a locked safe and checked nightly
by campus security.
</P>
<P>
   Private industry in Arizona was also involved. Motorola designed
and manufactured communications equipment, including the radio
``transponder'' Neil Armstrong used to speak his memorable ``one
giant step for mankind'' line.
</P>
<P>
   But the public's fascination with this unprecedented
breakthrough was short-lived. By the time Apollo 12 took off four
months later, considerably fewer Americans were watching. Interest
in manned spaceflight continued to wane until John Glenn's recent
return to space, and even that was considered a gimmick by many.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Apollo 11, the missions piled on, and the public lost
interest,'' MIT's Canizares said. ``It's like an Olympic athlete
winning a gold medal the first year out; what do you do after
that?''
</P>
<P>
   The loss in interest was reflected in the popular lament: ``If
they can send a man to the moon, why can't they (fill in the
blank)?''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say NASA became a victim of its own success. In
an effort to bring space to the people, NASA may have made
spaceflight look too easy and, therefore, not worthy of the
public's short attention span.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American psyche, unfortunately, has gotten saturated with
the 24-hour news cycle,'' space reporter Schefter said. ``There's
always something new. It's hard to get excited for more than 15
minutes about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It would take an outside threat, Schefter said, to rally support
for another manned space mission of Apollos' magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Although a manned trip to Mars is on the horizon, experts say
the rocket-fuel technology needed to get there is still far away.
Without the pressure of the Cold War, such a mission is remote.
</P>
<P>
   Even if landing on Mars is attainable, there was something
uniquely American about the race to the moon. In 1969, the country
was torn apart by the Vietnam War, yet it rallied around the goal
of being first to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   And because Apollo 11 was mostly about flexing America's
technological muscles, science was secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy didn't say go to the moon for the sake of science,''
said Andrew Chaikin, author of ``A Man on the Moon,'' an account of
the Apollo program. ``He (wanted) to show the world that the free
(market) system is better than the communist way.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Kennedy spoke to Rice University students a
little more than a year after his 1961 challenge, Chaikin notes in
his book, ``Kennedy was already widening his view from simply a
Cold War chess move to something that would have great impact on a
number of fronts, including scientific fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them was learning something about the makeup of the
moon, how it was formed and whether it eventually could be
colonized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew that even if they (the astronauts) came back
with one bag of moon dirt, it would be priceless,'' Chaikin said.
``Even if they had just gotten out of the lander and scooped up
some dirt and gotten back, they would have made a huge advance in
the terms of science and astronomy.''
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists, including the prominent Flagstaff
astrogeologist Shoemaker, pushed for more. They wanted the
astronauts to venture farther from the lunar rover and to explore
the geology of the moon. But NASA was insistent that the astronauts
focus on getting to the moon and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure to just accomplish the landing and
get back safely in front of the eyes of the world and not screw
up,'' Chaikin said.
</P>
<P>
   Although today marks the 30th anniversary of the launch, the
Apollo 11 moonwalk cannot be viewed in a vacuum. It was, of course,
preceded by the Mercury, Gemini and other Apollo missions, which
included both tragedy and triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The darkest hour came in 1967 when three astronauts were killed
in a fire on the launch pad during a training session for Apollo 1.
One of the brightest moments came with Apollo 8, which gave the
world the famous photographs of the Earth as a blue-and-white gem
rising beyond the moon in a sea of blackness on Christmas Eve 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 11 was followed by Missions 12 through 17. The
white-knuckle mission was Apollo 13, when a ruptured oxygen tank
crippled the astronauts' spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the Apollo missions represented the highest
achievement of mankind's ingenuity only decades after it developed
atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 20th century, human beings developed the means to
destroy themselves and the planet,'' Chaikin said. ``In the same
century, they also developed the means to leave their planet and
become immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony isn't lost on Chaikin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans, in particular, believed that they could do
anything,'' he said. ``That's part of the nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's about a moment of human achievement, human evolution,
and that has to have philosophical, spiritual implications,'' he
added. ``To look at the moon and say, wow, people have walked
there.'' &QL;

COX SLOWS INTERNET SERVICE TO THWART BUSINESS USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cox Communications has severely reduced the upload
speed of its high-speed Internet service in the Valley in an effort
to thwart the abuse of an estimated 1 percent of its subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent subscribers from using the $44.95-per-month service
to host pornographic Web sites and Web/mail servers, Cox has
slashed the upload speed of the product to 128 kilobits per second,
or kbps, from 3 to 5 megabits per second, or mbps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it about eight times slower than before,'' Cox
sales manager Dennis Kienlen said.
</P>
<P>
   The download speed is unaffected and still runs 3 to 5 mbps, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company discovered the abuses during routine monitoring of
the network to make sure people aren't using the residential
service for business purposes, company spokesman Andy Horwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, although hosting pornography sites is not
permitted on either its residential or business systems, many of
the residential abuses, such as Web site hosting, is allowed with
the business service.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people think they can save $55 per month by signing up
for residential service and using it for business purposes,''
Horwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses pay over twice the residential fee, at least $100 per
month, for Cox(at)Work, which is essentially the same product,
Kienlen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox officials say their company's monitoring of subscribers is
not an invasion of privacy because of contractual arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Kienlen explained that when customers sign up for the service,
they agree to Cox's ``appropriate use'' policy, which prohibits
using the system for commercial purposes such as hosting Web sites
and servers.
</P>
<P>
   The policy gives Cox the authority to monitor the network for
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scan the network looking for Internet protocol addresses
that have server ports open,'' Kienlen said. ``When we find one, we
log on and see what they are doing. If they are posting
inappropriate materials, it's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Kienlen acknowledged the slowdown has angered some of the
service subscribers. But he noted that most of those people
affected by the change were abusing the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a very inexpensive business connection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kienlen said that avid players of Internet computer games will
have their fun curtailed as a consequence of other users'
inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Cox would not say how many people have signed up for the
Cox(at)Home service, but noted it will be available to 580,000
Phoenix-area homes by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The company estimates that only about 1 percent of the
subscribers were abusing the service, but that their inappropriate
use was threatening to slow the entire network down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were constantly working on the network to keep it moving at
an even level,'' Kienlen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the pornography sites were particularly troublesome
because they upload pictures which takes up a lot of bandwidth on
the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you upload pictures, you're sending very large data files
that take up a lot of the system's capacity,'' he said. &QL;

METS DEFEAT DEVIL RAYS, 8-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Armando Benitez, it turns out, is not the
perfect closer.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-throwing Benitez blew a save opportunity on Thursday
night for the first time in four outings since inheriting the
closer's role from the injured John Franco. But he got the victory
as the New York Mets edged the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 8-7, in 10
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez entered in the ninth inning with the Mets leading by
7-4, but squandered all of the lead, yielding two runs on Fred
McGriff's single and the tying run on a single by Bubba Trammell.
He then struck out Paul Sorrento on a full-count slider with the
winning run on third base.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno, who earlier had driven in a pair of runs in a
four-run seventh-inning rally, doubled home Benny Agbayani with the
tie-breaking run off Norm Charlton in the top of the 10th inning.
And then Benitez (1-2) redeemed himself by pitching a perfect 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Bobby I want to go back out,'' Benitez said,
relaying what he told Manager Bobby Valentine after the ninth
inning. ``I said, `Don't take me out. If I have to lose, I have to
lose, but I want to win. I had to show I can come back when I make
a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me a lot with that,'' Valentine said. ``It was
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked as if Matt Franco would be the Mets' hero
for the second time in the last three games. But Franco could also
have been the goat because of a baserunning gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the go-ahead run at second base in the seventh
inning of a sloppy contest that the Mets were trailing, 3-2, Franco
ran through the third-base coach Cookie Rojas' stop sign on
Cedeno's single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno's line drive easily scored Brian McRae from third with
the tying run. The slow-footed Franco was going to need a break to
score from second, however.
</P>
<P>
   When McGriff, the Tampa Bay first baseman, cut off center
fielder Randy Winn's off-line throw, Franco found himself in
no-man's land, halfway down the third-base line. But McGriff
inexplicably did not throw home from the left of the pitcher's
mound. And to complete the bizarre sequence, Franco slid home even
though Rickey Henderson was motioning for him to stand up, giving
Cedeno a gift run batted in and the Mets the lead in their
game-winning four-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   With the designated-hitter rule in effect in the American League
park, Franco, the Mets' No. 1 pinch-hitter, was being rewarded with
a rare start. He had provided the most dramatic moment of the
season's first half last Saturday at Shea Stadium when his
bases-loaded, two-out, two-strike, two-run single off Mariano
Rivera gave the Mets a wild 9-8 victory over the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Franco went 0 for 1. But he walked twice and
scored both times. And the Mets (51-39) improved to a major
league-best 24-11 since June 6, the day they ended an eight-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, McRae and Franco had both drawn full-count walks
off Esteban Yan to open the inning, before they were sacrificed to
second and third by Rey Ordonez. Cedeno followed with his two-run
single, the Mets' first hit in six at-bats with runners in scoring
position. Cedeno stole second, his second swipe of the game and
major-league leading 48th of the season. Henderson drew a walk
against Albie Lopez. Edgardo Alfonzo then singled in a run and John
Olerud hit a sacrifice fly to make it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter rebounded from a shaky start and looked like a winner
until Benitez blew the save.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay right-hander Rolando Arrojo, who made his first
start since May 24, had struggled to a 2-5 record and a 7.32 earned
run average before going on the disabled list with shoulder
inflammation. But on Thursday night, the Cuban-born Arrojo
displayed the form that enabled him to win 14 games for an
expansion club last season and be selected to the American League
All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo allowed just a pair of bloop singles in his five-inning
outing. He left after 78 pitches with a 3-2 lead, both runs
unearned, as the Mets scored twice in the fifth without a hit.
</P>
<P>
   When Jose Canseco, who had 31 home runs, went on the disabled
list last week, deciding to have back surgery, it seemed that the
Devil Rays were going to have to find ways to score runs other than
via the home run.
</P>
<P>
   Not on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not with Leiter struggling with full-count pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Trammell deposited one of them over the left-field fence
leading off the second for a 1-0 Tampa Bay lead. And when Paul
Sorrento drilled a full-count offering off the right-field foul
pole, two batters after John Flaherty had walked on a 3-2 pitch to
open the fourth, the Devil Rays were up by 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scratched back against Arrojo, who hurt his own cause
by walking two of the first three batters he faced in the fifth.
McGriff made a nice play at first, going down on his knee for the
second out to prevent a Franco grounder from scoring a run.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno then beat what looked like a harmless grounder into the
Tropicana Field carpet. The former Mets infielder Aaron Ledesma
easily fielded the two-hopper in front of third, but
double-clutched and threw off the wrong foot. Cedeno beat the
throw, Robin Ventura scored from third and it was 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and third, Cedeno took off for second on a
2-0 pitch. Now it was the catcher Flaherty's turn for a gaffe.
Instead of conceding second to the fleet Cedeno, he rushed his
throw from behind the plate. It sailed to the right of second and
into the outfield. Franco scored, Cedeno scampered to third and it
was 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, though, grounded out to leave Cedeno on third, and
Arrojo, in his first start in nearly two months, departed with the
lead.

REUTERS SAYS IT WON'T FACE FEDERAL CHARGES

   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors will not charge Reuters Holdings
PLC with improperly obtaining information from a big competitor,
Bloomberg LP, Reuters said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in New York has been investigating the
relationship between a Reuters subsidiary, Reuters Analytics, and
Cyberspace Research Associates Inc., a New York company set up by a
former Bloomberg employee.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were looking into whether Cyberspace Research
assisted Reuters Analytics Inc. in obtaining information about
Bloomberg's operating code.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters said the U.S. attorney told the company that prosecutors
had closed the investigation. The U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the relationship between Reuters Analytics and
Cyberspace Research _ for example, whether it served as an
independent contractor or had a closer affiliation with the unit.
The government wanted to know whether Reuters Analytics
commissioned Cyberspace Research to steal Bloomberg data.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace Research, a Bloomberg customer, obtained the data
directly from a computer terminal Bloomberg distributes to its
clients. People close to the investigation have said prosecutors
obtained written communications between Reuters Analytics and
Cyberspace Research requesting that Cyberspace Research obtain
detailed information about technical programs, these people have
said.
</P>
<P>
   The data was passed to Reuters, these people said. Prosecutors
were said to have also obtained those responses. Turning the data
over to Reuters would have violated Cyberspace Research's agreement
with Bloomberg and could have constituted criminal fraud, lawyers
said.

RIVAL GROUPS BACK NEW COLISEUM PLAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The compromise Coliseum design-and-site plan has
been agreed upon by the two groups competing for an NFL franchise
and is scheduled to be revealed at a press conference July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chadwick _ whom Gov. Gray Davis asked last month to bring
the franchise rivals, Michael Ovitz/Ron Burkle and Eli Broad/Ed
Roski Jr., together _said Thursday he hopes to present the plan to
the various groups involved in the Exposition Park site over the
next week. Its public unveiling comes before the latest Coliseum
plans are presented to NFL owners in Chicago on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll have a whole bunch of changes here and there
between now and the end of next week. I just hope they're not so
fundamental I have to go back to the drawing board,'' Chadwick
said. ``I mean, nobody is going to look at it and say, `Perfect,
Bill, you're wonderful.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got something. Everybody's got a different venue
to protect or interest to protect or vision of their own. It's not
like everybody in L.A. has the same dream. What we're trying to do
here is come up with something that works pretty well for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick, a lawyer and investment banker, has quickly been able
to unify the separate stadium and site designs, though only one
group is ultimately expected to be selected the franchise owner.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Coliseum design is expected to be modeled more
closely to the Ovitz plan, which included a large multideck parking
garage with a park on top, but Chadwick would not reveal details on
the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick returned Wednesday from two days of meetings with NFL
executives in New York, which included a video conference call that
previewed the new plans with the rival groups, league officials and
Carolina owner Jerry Richardson, co-chairman of the expansion
committee.
</P>
<P>
   A key area of concern for the NFL has been the parking around
the Coliseum. The league originally asked for 25,000 spaces, which
the Ovitz plan provided with five garages. The Broad proposal made
to owners in Atlanta last May called for one 7,000-space garage.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick denied a report that the compromise parking plan
required 20,000 spaces, although the final design is expected to be
much closer to the Ovitz scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be determined, however, is how the garages will be
financed. Davis has already voiced opposition to public funding,
although if Chadwick can demonstrate benefit to the various other
groups at the state-owned park, the league and prospective owners
are hopeful some public assistance can be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick said he is finalizing the unified plan's financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my weekend piece,'' he said. ``I have a meeting (this)
afternoon with all my various financial consultants and advisors _
and I certainly have a lot of them _ to try and pull that
together.''
