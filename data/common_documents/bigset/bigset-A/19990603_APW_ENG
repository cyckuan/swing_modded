<HEADLINE> Litton To Buy Rival Shipbuilder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Litton Industries Inc. will buy Avondale  
Industries for $529 million after Newport News Shipbuilding 
declined to raise its offer for the shipbuilder. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton also indicated Thursday it plans to re-examine its offer  
to buy Newport News in light of potential government opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans-based Avondale had agreed earlier to merge with  
Newport News for $470 million in stock. But Litton offered more in 
cash, ultimately enticing Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale had given Newport News until Thursday to improve its  
bid, but the Virginia-based company decided against such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thoroughly reviewed the issues and determined that it was  
not in the best business interests of our shareholders to raise our 
offer for Avondale,'' said William P. Fricks, the chairman of 
Newport News. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Litton rose on the news, increasing $2.12 1/2 to close at  
$69.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Newport News were 
down 62 1/2 cents to $28.25 on the Big Board, while shares of Avondale 
fell 12 1/2 cents to $38.18 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newport News-Avondale combination was apparently doomed last  
Friday when Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon would 
probably tell the Justice Department to reject the Woodland Hills, 
Calif.-based Litton's $1.3 billion bid for Newport News for 
anti-competitive reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Cohen said the Navy had determined it would  
not oppose Litton's offer for Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton-Newport News deal would have reduced the number of  
companies competing to build most classes of Navy warships from 
three to two. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton said Thursday it hasn't given up on acquiring Newport  
News, even with the statements by Cohen. The company did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton, which owns Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss.,  
made its bids for Avondale and Newport News earlier in May after 
Cohen rejected an attempt by General Dynamics Corp. to acquire 
Newport News. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton had originally bid $38 a share, or about $500 million for  
Avondale, but later sweetened its offer to $39.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Kitchen, Avondale's chief financial officer, said no layoffs  
were planned and the company was optimistic that more jobs could 
result from the merger. The two companies expect it will take about 
90 days to finish the merger, which must be approved by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about evaluating the resources and capacity of  
both Ingalls and Avondale and putting them together in a way to 
expand in both locations,'' Kitchen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls employs about 11,000 workers, while Avondale has about  
6,000. The combined Litton-Avondale company would employ 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale, a non-union yard, has been engaged in a six-year fight  
to avoid having to recognize the Metal Trades Council of the 
AFL-CIO. The company, which is challenging a union representation 
vote held in 1993, has taken the case to a federal appeals court. A 
decision is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody buying Avondale would be an improvement potential for  
the workers,'' said Jim Evans, a union organizer. ``But we're just 
in a wait-and-see position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Ingalls, two unions on strike were scheduled to vote Thursday  
and Friday on contract offers. If the contracts are approved, 
workers will return to work Monday after three weeks off the job.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 85.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks closed higher Thursday as  
strong sales at the nation's largest retailers reminded investors 
that economic growth isn't necessarily bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.80 to close at  
10,663.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index rose 4.73 to 1,299.54, but the technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite fell 29.09 to close at 2,403.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock trading has been especially volatile since May 18, when  
the Federal Reserve warned it would raise interest rates if it 
determined that inflation is creeping into the booming U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that warning, the market has turned on every new sign of  
inflationary pressures. Continued signs of growth -- ordinarily a 
boon to stocks -- have spooked investors who fear higher interest 
rates will cut into the profits of major U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, investors welcomed good news from the  
nation's biggest retailers. Most reported stronger-than-expected 
sales in May, with specialty retailers and discounters leading the 
sector. Wal-Mart rose 1 1/8 to 45 1/2, and Gap Inc. gained 3 1/4 to 65 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also gained support from a Commerce Department report  
that showed orders to American factories for manufactured goods 
fell 1.2 percent. The decline suggested that if the Fed does raise 
rates, the increase will be a modest quarter of a percentage point, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Madden, chief investment officer for domestic equities at  
Federated Investors of Pittsburgh, said many market players have 
begun moving money under the assumption that rates will rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a growing consensus that the Fed will  
tighten rates in June,'' he said. ``Maybe that is helping calm the 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders remain focused on the Friday morning release of the  
Labor Department's unemployment data. The wage component of the 
report was expected to offer a more pointed indication of whether 
inflation has returned to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also expected to be moved by the surprise  
resignation of Alice Rivlin, the No. 2 official at the Fed. Rivlin 
announced after the close of the market Thursday that she is 
stepping down after three years as the Fed's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The volatile Internet companies that helped the Nasdaq Stock  
Market rally Wednesday headed lower again. Amazon.com led the 
decliners, and is now worth less than half its value in late April. 
It fell 7 1/16 to 105 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, investors turned to a broad-based range of  
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure looks like rapid sector rotation,'' said Madden. ``The  
market's tone is better, but there's no strong conviction for any 
sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies as diverse as American Express, up 2 15/16 to 121 3/8,  
Hewlett Packard, up 1 11/16 to 91 7/16, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 2 
to 93 11/16, led the Dow stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron fell 7/16 to 91 9/16 and Texaco dropped 2 3/16 to 62  
5/16 after the companies called off merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a perception that this might be the end of the giant  
oil merger talks,'' said Robert Stovall, president of 
Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. ``There aren't many other potential 
partners for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Market indexes held steady after the New York Stock Exchange  
announced it will not adopt extended trading hours until at least 
2000. The board that governs the Nasdaq Stock Market expects to 
start an extended schedule as soon as September. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume totaled 868.80 
million shares, compared to 877.17 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.70 to 624.20, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.71 to 775.94. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.76 to 435.98.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.16 percent.  
Britain's FT-SE 100 gained 1.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 
0.9 percent higher. German markets were closed for a religious 
holiday.

<HEADLINE> Path Cleared for Mrs. Clinton Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Rep. Nita Lowey told Hillary Rodham Clinton  
today that she planned to seek re-election to the House, leaving 
the Democratic field clear for the first lady to run for a Senate 
seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nita called the first lady, told the first lady that it was  
clear to her that the first lady was going to run for the Senate 
and that therefore Nita was going to run for the House,'' Lowey 
spokesman Howard Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first lady thanked Nita for her friendship, said that she  
had been wonderful and looked forward to working with her,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfson said Mrs. Clinton did not tell Lowey she was definitely  
running for the Senate seat and that the congresswoman from 
Westchester County did not ask. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowey had earlier said she would not run for the Senate seat if  
Mrs. Clinton did so. 
</P>
<P>
	Her call came one day after Mrs. Clinton was in New York City,  
looking like a candidate and sounding like a candidate as she shook 
hands, hugged strangers and made a rousing speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first lady again stopped short of saying the magic words  
her supporters have been waiting for -- that she is a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Run, Hillary, run!'' students chanted at City College, where  
Mrs. Clinton began her day-long visit to Manhattan on Wednesday by 
giving the commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
	As she walked through the crowd of 3,000 graduates, she shook  
dozens and dozens of hands thrust out by cheering students. One man 
put his arms out for a hug, and she returned his embrace after a 
moment's hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The content of Mrs. Clinton's speech to the college -- calling  
for more resources and support for public schools -- was similar to 
others she has made in a half-dozen recent appearances in New York. 
But this time her every sentence was met with a roar from the 
students, most of them black, Hispanic and from working-class 
backgrounds. And like a candidate on the campaign trail, Mrs. 
Clinton's cadences grew stronger with every cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never lift up our public schools and the students they  
serve by tearing them down,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``We can never 
ensure the future of this city or state or our nation by 
undermining the public education system that is at the very 
foundation of the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City's public schools have been criticized frequently  
by Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is also a likely Senate 
candidate. And City University, of which City College is part, has 
also been under attack, accused of lowering standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a fund-raiser at Tavern on the Green for the state  
Democratic Party, Mrs. Clinton was given a New York Yankees 
baseball cap by United Federation of Teachers President Randi 
Weingarten, the luncheon's guest of honor. Afterwards, the first 
lady shook hands with patrons at the restaurant and waved to a 
small cheering crowd of joggers and mothers with strollers waiting 
near her limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not refer to her potential candidacy in any of  
her speeches, but others did. At the luncheon, Sen. Charles 
Schumer, D-N.Y., said: ``There's no candidacy yet. But Hillary 
Clinton gets closer and closer and closer and we get more and more 
excited about the prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the first lady have said she's on the verge of  
declaring herself a candidate after several months of deliberations 
and consultations with experts. 
</P>
<P>
	At an evening fund-raiser for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the  
congresswoman defended Mrs. Clinton against accusations of 
carpetbagging. The first lady has never lived in New York, and 
earlier Wednesday, Republican Gov. George Pataki had said, ``I 
don't think we need somebody from Washington or Arkansas moving to 
New York to represent us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We New Yorkers don't care where you're from,'' Ms. Maloney  
said. ``We New Yorkers care about what you can do to continue to 
build the greatest city, state and country in the world.''

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton will form an  
exploratory committee in early July preparing her for a potential 
Senate campaign in New York, a top adviser said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, who is heading up Mrs. Clinton's political  
operation, disclosed the first lady's plans after it was reported 
that Rep. Nita Lowey had decided to seek re-election. Lowey's move 
leaves the Democratic field clear for Mrs. Clinton to run for the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nita called the first lady, told the first lady that it was  
clear to her that the first lady was going to run for the Senate 
and that therefore Nita was going to run for the House,'' Lowey 
spokesman Howard Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton described the call in a statement: ``Today Nita  
Lowey called me to say that she would be running for re-election to 
the House. I thank Nita for her support and I look forward to 
working with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes, a former deputy White House chief of staff, said Mrs.  
Clinton listened to Lowey but did not go into detail about her own 
political plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can discern (from the conversation) that Hillary  
is going to press forward and she will be forming an exploratory 
committee in early July and just keep moving forward,'' Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Ickes said he meant to say that Mrs. Clinton intends to  
form a committee in July. 
</P>
<P>
	He said forming the committee does not necessarily mean Mrs.  
Clinton will seek the seat. ``This is one step at a time,'' Ickes 
said. ``The initial step forward is to form the exploratory 
committee and continue to talk to the people of New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers have said for days that Mrs. Clinton intended to form  
the committee, but Ickes was the first to say it on the record. 
Advisers say it would require a major change of heart for Mrs. 
Clinton to not launch a campaign after deciding to form the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowey had earlier said she would not run for the Senate seat if  
Mrs. Clinton did so. 
</P>
<P>
	Her call to Mrs. Clinton came one day after the first lady was

<HEADLINE> Calif. To Sell Confidential Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California will begin selling confidential  
wage data it collects on 14 million people statewide to private 
information companies, car dealers and creditors wanting to check 
an individual's annual income. 
</P>
<P>
	A law that passed last summer allows the state's Employment  
Development Department to disclose the salary information. 
Previously, the data was available only to other government 
agencies. The program, which could bring the state $15 million over 
the next decade, could start later this year or in early 2000, the 
Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	No data would be shared without the written permission of the  
individual, state officials said. However, private companies that 
are deemed qualified to access the data would operate on an honor 
system and would not be required to show proof of each individual's 
written permission before accessing the information. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters, including banks and lenders who championed the  
legislation, contend the data will allow them to process loan 
applications faster and cut back on fraud. But consumer groups say 
the electronic disclosure of someone's salary could fall into the 
wrong hands -- including debt collectors or marketing firms wanting 
to woo wealthy customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This violates a basic principle of privacy,'' said Robert  
Ellis Smith, publisher of Privacy Journal, a monthly newsletter 
covering technology's effect on personal privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the state wage data was originally collected to  
figure out unemployment taxes and benefits, not to help aid 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials said the information would be given only to  
qualified creditors, primarily mortgage lenders. The department's 
salary information dates back about four years and covers about 85 
percent of all California residents. Federal employees and the 
self-employed are not included. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key issue is how do we implement this program while giving  
a priority to privacy rights,'' said Michael Bernick, the director 
of the Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego County-based Verification of Income and  
Employment, a joint venture between Santa Ana-based First American 
Financial Corp. and Norwest Mortgage, is helping start the program. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which worked with the state Legislature for three  
years to get the law passed, also runs programs in Iowa, Minnesota, 
North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said qualifying private companies must promise  
to use the wage information only as part of a credit application 
and to obtain the borrower's permission in advance. Users would 
then get access to an online database after paying a $5 to $10 fee 
per request. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it conducts random audits and hires and  
accounting firm to make sure there is written permission. To keep 
the system from being abused, users also can only request one to 
five names at a time and can't download the information to their 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to decide whether  
states can sell personal information from driver's license records 
such as people's addresses and Social Security numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	States have routinely sold such information to businesses,  
charities and political candidates, earning millions of dollars in 
revenue each year.

	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panama expects to earn $30 million  
from operation of the Panama Canal during its first year of local 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will receive the sum from the new Panama Canal  
authority and use it for social projects, says the 2000 budget 
approved Wednesday by Panama's Legislative Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal authority, which has a $605 million budget, replaces  
the U.S.-led Panama Canal Commission on Dec. 31, 1999 in accordance 
with a 1979 U.S.-Panama treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly set aside $489.5 million for administration of the  
85-year-old canal and another $100 million for infrastructure 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The canal generated $546 million in tolls in fiscal year 1998.  
An average of 33 to 35 ships cross the Atlantic-Pacific link each

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The chairman of Mexico's ruling party  
admitted Thursday that a fugitive banker contributed to the party's 
election coffers several years ago but said the donations broke no 
laws at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez, of the Institutional  
Revolutionary Party, said Carlos Cabal Peniche contributed about 
$285,000 to President Ernesto Zedillo's 1994 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters that the bulk of the contributions were made  
before Mexico reformed its election laws in September 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition lawmakers have asked Congress to appoint a special  
prosecutor to investigate the contributions to the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabal Peniche, wanted in Mexico for an alleged $700 million  
fraud against two banks he owned, said last week that he donated 
$25 million to the party. He said some $5 million went to Zedillo's 
campaign. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Warn of Mad Cow Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Some frequent American travelers to  
Britain should be prohibited from donating blood as an extra safety 
precaution against the possible spread of a fatal brain illness 
linked to mad cow disease, a Food and Drug Administration advisory 
panel says. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel made its decision in a 12-9 vote Wednesday, even  
though it had no evidence that the deadly illness, a new variant of 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, could spread through blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel members stressed that the precaution doesn't mean frequent  
tourists are at risk of getting the illness just because they ate 
British beef, where mad cow disease resides. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists simply don't know enough about this new illness  
that has struck at least 39 Britons who apparently ate beef 
contaminated with mad cow disease to say for sure that it could 
never be transmitted through blood. Some experiments have allowed 
scientists to transmit similar illnesses to animals through blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day you find out there is (human) transmission, you're  
years too late'' to protect the blood supply, warned Dr. Linda 
Detwiler of the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	If the FDA follows its advisers' recommendation, the next  
question is how long someone had to visit Britain to be deemed 
enough of a risk to refuse their blood. 
</P>
<P>
	That's crucial because an American Red Cross study found almost  
23 percent of recent blood donors had traveled to Britain at least 
once between 1980 and 1996. From the late 1980s through 1996, 
Britain battled a mad cow disease epidemic in its cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory panel said the concern is not a typical week-long  
tourist trip. A majority of panelists said Americans who spent a 
total of more than six months in Britain between 1980 and 1996 
should be blocked from donating blood -- a recommendation that, if 
followed, could cut the U.S. blood supply by 2.2 percent, the Red 
Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mad cow disease is an infection that kills by literally eating  
holes in the brain tissue of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in 1 million people around the world gets a similar  
brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. Although 
CJD sometimes is hereditary, usually its cause is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry about blood stems from Britain's discovery in the  
mid-1990s that some people caught a new strain of the disease 
called ``new variant CJD'' apparently by eating beef infected with 
mad cow disease. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known mad cow disease in U.S. cattle, and the United  
States has not allowed importation of British beef for over a 
decade. No American has caught new variant CJD. 
</P>
<P>
	But because these brain diseases can incubate for years without  
causing symptoms, some scientists say the possibility exists that 
years from now they will discover a link between blood transfusions 
and infection. Doctors are closely watching Britain to see if that 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian health officials last month decided they too would  
determine how to block blood donations from certain Canadian 
travelers.

	Yugoslavia Accepts Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic, giving in to Western demands, today accepted a peace 
plan for Kosovo. The deal is designed to end mass expulsions of 
ethnic Albanians by Serb forces and 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes. 
But President Clinton and U.S. officials reacted cautiously, 
waiting for signs that Milosevic would begin pulling his troops out 
of Kosovo and allow the return of more than 855,000 refugees forced 
out of the province.

	Clinton Welcomes Kosovo Agreement

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today airstrikes in  
Kosovo would continue until Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic produced 
``real results.'' Clinton welcomed Yugoslavia's acceptance of 
NATO's peace terms for Kosovo as encouraging news, but he said NATO 
must have clear proof that Milosevic fully accepts all conditions 
for peace and intends to implement them completely -- as he pledged 
to Russian mediator Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President 
Martti Ahtisaari.

Senate campaign in New York next year, a top adviser said today. 
She would be the first sitting first lady to run for public office. 
Harold Ickes, who is heading up Mrs. Clinton's political operation, 
disclosed the plans after Rep. Nita Lowey said, in a telephone call 
to the first lady, that she would seek re-election to the House. 
That move leaves the Democratic Senate field clear for Mrs.

<P>
	More stormy weather soaked the Plains today, with hail in the  
north, thunder in the south and high winds in between. The West had 
rain, too, and unseasonably cool weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Severe weather was hitting the northern Plains this morning  
ahead of a warm front stretching from Montana to the Dakotas. Hail 
struck parts of South Dakota and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	In the central Plains, storms were expected to be severe  
particularly in Kansas, with winds up to 60 mph and small hail. In 
the southern Plains, storms concentrated in the Texas panhandle and 
central Oklahoma were expected to move east through the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front from the northern Rockies to southern California  
was pushing temperatures in the West to below-normal levels. 
</P>
<P>
	A low-pressure center in Montana was bringing clouds to the  
Pacific Northwest, and an upper level low was bringing ocean 
moisture and partly cloudy skies to the desert Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-tenths of an inch of rain were reported Wednesday in  
Flagstaff, Ariz., the greatest 24-hour amount recorded for the date 
in 100 years. Record rainfall was also reported in Los Angeles, 
Long Beach and Pasadena, Calif., in what is supposed to be the dry 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Light rain in the Northeast this morning was expected to  
continue thanks to a stationary front. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers in the Ohio and Tennessee river valleys, caused by a  
cold front from Kentucky to New York state, were expected to 
slacken and move east into the mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers in Georgia were also expected to shift east as the  
morning progressed, as was rain near Miami, leaving the Southeast 
with a typically muggy, partly cloudy June day. Afternoon 
thunderstorms were possible today on the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms hit parts of the Southeast hard Wednesday, bringing wind  
gusts up to 87 mph in Little Rock, Ark., and close to 4 inches of 
rain in Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were forecast mainly in the 50s and 60s over most of  
the West; the 70s from the northern Plains to the inland Northeast; 
the 90s from the extreme southwestern desert across the southern 
Plains to the Southeast; and the 80s elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Vegas Store Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A camouflage-clad man roamed through a  
supermarket blasting workers with a shotgun today, killing four and 
critically wounding a fifth before being arrested by officers who 
talked him out of taking his own life. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-year-old man with a shotgun was taken into custody without  
incident outside the store. All of the dead and wounded were 
employees of the Albertsons supermarket, police said. The motive 
for the shooting was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers who arrived as shots were still being fired confronted  
a shaven-headed man with a goatee who walked out the front door 
toting a pump-action shotgun, officer Steve Meriwether said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put the gun to his head and the officers talked him out of  
it,'' the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was identified as Zane Floyd. A neighbor Cathy  
Downey, said Floyd got out of the Marines recently and moved into a 
guest house behind his parents' home not far from the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all they talked about is when he would be coming home  
from leave. They did everything they could for him. He didn't want 
for anything,'' Ms. Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how they can get through this, not with their  
pride and joy,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd served four years in the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton,  
Calif., and was honorably discharged in July 1998, said base 
spokesman Lt. Jeff Landis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Rick Alba said police do not believe robbery was a motive  
and they have not determined any connection between Floyd and the 
three men and one woman who died. Police received word of the 
shooting around 5:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found at different places in the store, which is  
about two miles west of the casinos on the Las Vegas strip, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just horrified by this. This is tragic, inexplicable and  
we are sickened by it,'' said Michael Read, vice president of 
public affairs at Albertsons' headquarters in Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has 995 stores in 25 states, sent a  
counseling team to help console surviving employees. 
</P>
<P>
	After the man began firing, two women employees, age 20 and 34,  
hid for three hours in a produce cooler, where they were discovered 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very upset from the whole incident. They were very  
cold, they were inside the cooler. We are trying to get them 
warm,'' said Kathi Rice, a spokeswoman for American Medical 
Response, an ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The supermarket is located at a shopping mall at one of the  
city's busiest intersections. Police cordoned off the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Across from the store's parking lot, Albertsons employees and  
family members gathered at Carl's Jr. restaurant, surrounded by 
police and store officials. Some were crying as they embraced each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the Marines, Floyd briefly attended college, Ms.  
Downey said. More recently, he has worked as a bouncer at Sneakers, 
a local sports bar, said Tony Marquez, a fellow bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
	Marquez said that over the weekend, he helped Floyd move out of  
an apartment he shared with a roommate and into the parents' 
guesthouse. Floyd had a girlfriend and was popular at the bar, his 
buddy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a regular 23-year-old guy who likes to party and hang  
out, just like me,'' Marquez said. ``I don't understand what 
happened, I just don't understand it.''

<HEADLINE> Fans Will See A Lot of McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Even though Mark McGwire has at least 10 fewer home runs than  
last year, there will still be plenty of Big Mac on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	When the network picked up its coverage last season on May 30,  
McGwire already had hit 25 homers. He'll be well short of that when 
the network makes its season debut Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't matter.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox will still give viewers live look-ins to as many of  
McGwire's at-bats as possible in 1999 -- as well as those of Sammy 
Sosa, Ken Griffey Jr., Jose Canseco -- and anyone else in pursuit of 
breaking McGwire's home run mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very fortunate last year to go live many times and be  
able to capture many of McGwire, Sosa and Junior's home runs,'' 
said Fox executive producer Ed Goren. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's schedule couldn't begin any better. The first two weekends  
feature interleague play, including the Yankees-Mets at 1 p.m. EDT 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is, by far, the best schedule we've had in the four years  
since I've been here,'' said Tim McCarver, Fox's top analyst who 
will work the New York game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees-Mets matchup will hold a special meaning for  
McCarver. It will be his first Mets game since the team fired him 
before the start of this season after 16 years as the club's 
broadcaster. McCarver was picked up by George Steinbrenner and the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take a near-miracle to duplicate the fan interest last  
season when McGwire and Sosa made their assaults on Roger Maris' 
home run mark and Fox's ratings jumped a record 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was the largest jump for baseball's game of the  
week television package in more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with all the home runs being hit this season, ESPN's  
ratings are the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did baseball exhaust its fans last year?'' McCarver said. ``I  
don't think so. ... If I were going to say anybody who may break 
McGwire's record, I'd have to say (Griffey) Junior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver, who has never been afraid to express his opinions said  
the mound should be raised to give pitchers an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ought to raise it five inches,'' McCarver said, ``like  
they did after the 1968 season when Carl Yastrzemski was the only 
.300 hitter in all of baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Fox's coverage won't alter much from last year -- it  
will keep ``Catcher-Cam'' and microphones on managers and in bases 
-- its pregame will have a different look. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Olbermann will join Steve Lyons for ``In the Zone,'' the  
30-minute feature show that targets the young male audience. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *REPLAY:* As usual, Fox's top broadcasting team of McCarver and  
Joe Buck are on the same page about keeping instant replay as far 
away from baseball as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second it happened, the game came to a screeching halt,  
became sloppy and took forever,'' said Buck, who worked the radio 
broadcast for Monday's Florida-St. Louis game in which umpire Frank 
Pulli decided to view a videotape replay and change a home run to a 
double. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine having every ball and strike argued and go  
into instant replay?'' McCarver said. ``It would be muddled. My 
vote is a very convincing no.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> 18th Hole Lost in Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. (AP) -- A landslide knocked the 18th  
hole of a new golf course off an ocean bluff Wednesday and onto the 
beach below. 
</P>
<P>
	An employee of the unopened, $80 million Ocean Trails  
development rode the 150-foot slide down to the beach on a grass 
island and was lifted to safety by a Los Angeles County fire 
helicopter, fire Inspector Dennis Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
	The landslide came after unusually heavy rains overnight that  
set records in Los Angeles, 30 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	The slide took an area about 600 feet long and 220 feet wide,  
including fairway and green, said Michael Hoye, a spokesman for the 
Ocean Trails development. 
</P>
<P>
	The public course, a centerpiece of a development including 75  
custom home sites, park areas and trails, was scheduled to open 
July 16.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Was Told About Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The pilot of the American Airlines jet  
that crashed was getting a ``play by play'' about the deteriorating 
weather in the minutes before the accident, a federal safety 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they  
have to base that on the information they have,'' said George 
Black, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that this was a very dynamic situation,'' Black said  
this morning on NBC's ``Today.'' ``The weather was changing 
rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's even indications the tower controller was providing  
sort of a play-by-play wind direction and velocity sequence of 
radio transmissions during the approach,'' he told ``Good Morning 
America.'' He didn't give specifics such as what precise wind speed 
the pilot was told about. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 145 people on board, including the pilot, were  
killed when Flight 1420 crashed while landing Little Rock National 
Airport during a violent storm just before midnight Tuesday. The 
plane caught fire after it rolled off the runway and down an 
embankment, striking steel supports for approach lights and 
breaking apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combination of weather and pilot error. He should  
have gone to another airport,'' said Richard Klamm, 49, of Pine 
Bluff, who was in the first-class section of the plane as part of 
its metal skin was sheared off by a light tower. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm unleashed hail, lightning and wind gusts to 75 mph at  
the airport. The National Weather Service reported a gust of 87 mph 
nearby, shortly after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said he would not  
have attempted to land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 50 knots, 
or 57.5 mph. He oversees all of American Airlines' pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Buschmann, who was killed, was a veteran American  
pilot with 5,500 hours of flight time in the MD-80 series of 
aircraft, which includes the MD-82. As a chief pilot in American's 
Chicago operation, he supervised other pilots and flew passenger 
planes for two months each year. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB investigators hoped to talk to the crew's first officer,  
Michael Origel, today to see what he remembers about the minutes 
before the crash. They were waiting for a doctor's authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, investigators stressed that many factors were  
being looked at, in addition to the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators will also examine whether the pilots' long day and  
their desire to get the plane to its intended airport for the night 
-- to prevent delays the next morning -- played a role in the 
decision to land. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew had been on duty for 13 1/2 hours, just short of the  
airline's maximum of 14. FAA spokesman William Shumann said the 
federal maximum is 16 hours on duty a day, including a maximum of 
eight hours in flight. The crew was on the last leg of a flight 
schedule that started in Chicago and stopped in Salt Lake City and 
Dallas before ending in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said investigators also are looking at the groovings  
across the runway, designed mainly to prevent a plane from 
hydroplaning, as well as the runway drainage system. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said it felt like the aircraft never got a grip on  
the rain-slickened runway. Braking seemed useless. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no traction,'' said Carla Koen of Little Rock. ``We  
started sliding sideways and the next thing I knew there were 
flames in the back of the plane and there was a pole in the side of 
the plane and people were jumping out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB recovered the flight recorder and data box from the  
wreckage and was looking for clues for any mechanical problems. The 
Federal Aviation Administration said there was no distress call 
before the landing. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-level NTSB official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said today that both recorders were in good condition, with the 
flight recorder scarred by fire but the data inside apparently 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators gave the cockpit voice recorder a ``quick  
play-through,'' the official said, but planned a more detailed 
listening today. They also were preparing the flight data recorder 
for analysis today. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said investigators were pleased the plane had a  
modern flight data recorder, which he said could yield up to 100 
different pieces of information about the plane's operation and 
performance. The NTSB has repeatedly asked for flight recorder 
upgrades, saying some existing models that provide only 11 pieces 
of information leave investigators with too much guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're quite pleased with what we've got now,'' said the  
official. 
</P>
<P>
	A check of the plane's maintenance records revealed no major  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft wound up 150 yards from the Arkansas River, where  
passengers, some drenched in aviation fuel, slogged through mud and 
weeds to safety as the storm raged around them. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact on the left side of the cockpit killed Buschmann at  
the controls, then peeled away the airplane's metal skin down the 
left side of the first-class section. The back section of the plane 
whipped around and broke away from the front half as the plane went 
over a levee and struck the light rigging. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel spilling from the broken fuselage ignited a fire that  
burned about a third of the jet. Hospitals said they treated 83 
people for injuries. Seven people were in critical condition 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first aboard a U.S. carrier in nearly 1 1/2  
years. They also were the first in a commercial carrier at Little 
Rock's airport in its 82-year history. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Panel Questions Judge's Use of Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A judge who fought to preserve a display  
of the Ten Commandments in his courtroom may have violated ethics 
laws in using a fund set up to finance the court battle, a state 
panel found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama Ethics Commission voted 5-0 Wednesday to send the  
case of Etowah County Circuit Judge Roy Moore to prosecutors for 
possible criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said he had no improper dealings with the fund, created  
during a highly publicized fight over his courtroom prayers and Ten 
Commandments display. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethics Commission Director Jim Sumner said the panel believes  
Moore spent money on things other than his legal expenses and used 
the ``mantle of his office'' to help raise the funds. Sumner would 
not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office is not required to take any  
action on the referral. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an attempt to stop the message about God,'' Moore said of  
the ruling. ``It's no great surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A religious-freedom lawsuit filed by state officials who  
supported Moore eventually reached the Alabama Supreme Court last 
year. By dismissing the suit on technical grounds, the court 
effectively allowed his religious activities to continue.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Police Sued for Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Attorney Curtis Rodriguez was driving home  
one afternoon when he saw a sight that disturbed him: Hispanic 
motorists standing by their cars, all pulled over by the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	As his passenger, attorney Arturo Hernandez, snapped pictures of  
the last two of five traffic stops, a CHP cruiser sped up behind 
Rodriguez and ordered him to the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, Rodriguez said, searched his car without permission  
and detained him for almost an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, a San Jose resident, decided not to let it pass. On  
Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union, on his behalf, sued 
the CHP and the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement 
</P>
<P>
	The federal civil rights suit claims that on that day -- June 6,  
1998 -- Rodriguez was a victim of ``racial profiling'' -- the use of 
race or color to decide who is stopped by officers on the highway, 
a tactic that is drawing attention and criticism across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened that day was illegal, it was immoral, it was  
racist, and it's high time these practices stop,'' Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit asks for monetary damages and an injunction forbidding  
racial profiling in traffic stops. It also asks that the agencies 
be ordered to collect data on the race and ethnic background of 
motorists stopped for traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter who you are ... if you are a person of color and  
you're on the road, you are often viewed as a target by the 
police,'' said attorney Michelle Alexander, director of the 
Northern California ACLU's Racial Justice Project. ``This is true 
nationwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Barankin, spokesman for the state Attorney General's  
office, declined to comment. CHP Commissioner Dwight Helmick said 
that his department ``does not accept or condone or allow our 
people to stop people on the basis of race or gender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed a day after the ACLU released a study in New  
York on racial profiling which said the war on drugs has resulted 
in a sharp increase in profiling. The group said at least 27,000 
officers nationwide learned the technique from the Drug Enforcement 
Administration as part of ``Operation Pipeline,'' a federally 
funded drug interdiction campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, North Carolina became the first state to require data  
collection on traffic stops. Similar bills have been introduced in 
Congress and in California, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
Texas and Virginia.

<HEADLINE>  Hasek Has Everything But a Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hockey has thrown more than pucks at  
Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek. He's gotten adoration, millions 
of dollars, an Olympic gold medal, recognition as the league's MVP 
the past two years, even criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing eludes him: The Stanley Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has a place set aside in his heart for hockey's biggest  
prize. ``Right next to the gold medal,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres won the Eastern Conference championship and await the  
winner of Friday's Game 7 of the Western Conference final between 
the Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, almost recovered from the chronic groin injury that  
sidelined him for the first two games against Toronto in the 
conference final, is determined to scoop the only thing that's 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hungrier than ever,'' Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley  
said. ``Nothing would compare to winning this thing and it's nice 
to have him in there with that drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is the only goaltender in NHL history to twice be selected  
the league's MVP. He did so in each of the last two seasons and is 
a candidate for a third in a row. Last year he was voted top goalie 
for the fourth time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	His greatest achievement was leading the Czech Republic to its  
first gold medal in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He earned 
the right to be called the world's best goalie after beating 
Patrick Roy and Canada 2-1 in the semifinal and shutting out Russia 
1-0 for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he runs out of things to win, it seems Hasek never runs  
out of things to prove. The Stanley Cup might quiet critics who 
question his heart and pain threshhold, not to mention filling a 
void in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us feel that there's always a little hole if you  
don't get it,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``He's going to feel 
that way if we don't accomplish what we set out to accomplish. You 
can't say it doesn't bother you if you don't win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy is the winningest goaltender in playoff history. Hasek rode  
the bench behind the other goalie he could face in the Stanley Cup 
final, Dallas' Ed Belfour, when both played for Chicago. Hasek had 
spent two seasons in Chicago when the Blackhawks traded him to 
Buffalo in August 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Belfour is a great goaltender and Patrick has won three  
Stanley Cups,'' Hasek said. ``But it doesn't matter to me if we 
play Dallas or Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the Sabres' three playoff series have pitted Hasek  
against another good goalie. Ottawa's Ron Tugnutt led the league's 
starters with a 1.79 goals-against average. Hasek, second with a 
1.87 GAA, made 40 saves in a 2-1 victory in the opener of 
quarterfinal series against Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dom won that first game on his own and since then has just  
made the key save,'' Buffalo's Joe Juneau said. ``We don't need a 
guy who's going to steal a game every night. We just need key saves 
at the right time, and that's what Dom gives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Byron Dafoe ranks third among playoff goalies with a  
2.03 GAA but couldn't beat Hasek's Sabres in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dafoe was in the running for the Vezina (trophy as top goalie)  
and really issued a personal challenge,'' Ruff said. ``He thought 
he could outplay Dom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anticipated duel between Hasek and Toronto's Curtis Joseph  
in the conference final fizzled due to a groin injury that kept 
Hasek out for two games and Joseph's own shaky play. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek bristles at the suggestion that he was tanking it.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough to go to the coach and tell him that I could not  
play, but I'm glad I made the decision,'' he said. ``I could play 
hurt and maybe give up some bad goals and we could lose. I feel 
good about the decision I made.''

<HEADLINE> Automaker Advises on Child Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you get your car brakes checked or an oil  
change at a DaimlerChrysler dealership next year, you also may be 
able to get expert advice on whether a child seat is being used 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new service at about 20  
percent of its dealerships to advise parents on how to install car 
seats to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal  
agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using 
trained personnel to help customers fit child seats. The company 
will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be 
available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in  
autos. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in 
half, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents need help to make sure their children are properly  
secured in those seats,'' Robert Eaton, DaimlerChrysler 
co-chairman, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Also involved in the initiative, which will start in several  
pilot cities this year and be fully in place next year, are 
child-seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National 
Safety Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct  
800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled 
properly and that child seats are properly installed in both new 
and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates about  
30,000 child seats a year are being inspected now at community 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 16 months, DaimlerChrysler will be training 2,000  
certified child-seat technicians in a 32-hour course -- doubling the 
current number in the United States. There will be two per 
participating dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's move follows a recommendation by the National  
Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of 
``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the 
deaths of children in automobile accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70  
models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with 
different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially 
100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB 
Chairman Jim Hall says. 
</P>
<P>
	This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic  
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them  
across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle 
administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships. 
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government 
transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses 
to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said at the press conference that DaimlerChrysler's effort  
went beyond what he suggested for the fitting stations. ``I am 
confident the other automobile manufacturers in our country will 
step forward now with their own programs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. also is considering some type of permanent  
fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,  
a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or 
daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's 
dealerships.

play, but I'm glad I made the decision,'' he said. ``I could play 
hurt and maybe give up some bad goals and we could lose. I feel 
good about the decision I made.''

<HEADLINE> Texaco Rejects Chevron Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merger talks between energy companies Chevron  
Corp. and Texaco Inc. were halted Wednesday amid disagreements over 
price and the complexity of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday after the markets had closed, Texaco  
said that Chevron's proposal to buy Texaco was ``unacceptable for 
several reasons, including complexity, feasibility, risk and 
price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron confirmed separately in a short statement that  
negotiations between the two had been called off. Both companies 
declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would have resulted in the world's fourth-largest  
energy company with nearly $60 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chevron-Texaco deal was seen by analysts as an important step  
for both companies to compete effectively in the rapidly 
consolidating energy market, which is now dominated by three 
giants: Royal Dutch/Shell, BP Amoco and the soon-to-be combined 
Exxon-Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil industry has seen a series of mergers of late, touched  
off by historically low prices that have crimped profits and 
necessitated deep cost cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Texaco-Chevron merger likely would have faced  
several regulatory hurdles because of overlapping operations. Adam 
Sieminski, an analyst with the Baltimore-based BT Alex. Brown Inc., 
said the companies likely would have had to sell off a number of 
their combined assets, including service stations and refineries, 
in order to receive approval from the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron was offering $70 a share, or roughly $37 billion, for  
Texaco, according to a source familiar with the negotiations -- well 
below the rumored price of $80 a share, or $42 billion. That 
represented a premium of only 9 percent above Texaco's closing 
stock price Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who would only speak on condition of anonymity, said  
the low price was a key reason why the Texaco board rejected 
Chevron's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chevron spokesman declined to comment on the negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Chevron chairman and CEO Kenneth Derr said he  
was ``surprised that the Texaco board turned down a very 
competitive offer that included a significant price premium to 
Texaco shareholders and an opportunity to receive Chevron stock, 
with its acknowledged strong growth prospects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, the two companies would have controlled roughly 26  
percent of the refinery operations in the United States, said 
Sieminski, adding that it was likely the FTC would have made the 
companies reduce control to less than 20 percent before approving 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco already has an alliance with Shell, the U.S. subsidiary  
of Royal Dutch/Shell Group -- that venture has several overlapping 
operations with Chevron. Individually, Texaco and Chevron also 
overlap on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	While the companies were aware the deal faced regulatory  
hurdles, the source said Chevron wanted Texaco to sell off some of 
its assets, rather than vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	That proved unacceptable to Texaco.  
</P>
<P>
	Another sticking point apparently was control, as Chevron wanted  
to have its management team run the entire company, as opposed to a 
melding of the top company officials, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The management issue did not come up during board discussions  
Tuesday, the source said, but it could easily have proven to be a 
deal-killer as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chevron pretty clearly wanted (Texaco's) assets, not its  
management team,'' said Sieminski. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron, based in San Francisco, had revenue of $26 billion in  
1998 while Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., had revenue of 
$31.8 billion. The combined total of nearly $58 billion would still 
leave them well short of the world's top three energy companies, 
each of which will likely generate at least $80 billion in revenue 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron had pursued Texaco after it failed to win a bid for  
Atlantic Richfield Co. earlier this year. Chevron lost out to BP 
Amoco, which agreed in March to buy Arco for $26.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	If the $37 billion merger had been successfully completed, it  
would have ranked among the biggest mergers ever. It would have 
been dwarfed, however, by the recent merger of Exxon and Mobil, 
which is currently worth $82 billion. That deal still faces 
regulatory approval.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday's Entry Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Add Steve Cauthen, the last jockey to win  
the Triple Crown, to the list of those puzzled by the decision to 
run filly Silverbulletday in Saturday's Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that trainer Bob Baffert and owner Mike Pegram held  
Silverbulletday out of the 1 1/4-mile Kentucky Derby and 1 3/16-mile 
Preakness Stakes for fear of hurting her, Cauthen questioned why 
they would then start her in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``It surprises me,'' Cauthen said. ``This is the one that could  
actually damage her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Charismatic beats Silverbulletday and 10 other expected  
starters, he will be the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed 
turned the trick with Cauthen aboard in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last leg is always the toughest because it's the last  
one,'' Cauthen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's got a real legitimate chance of pulling it off.  
Now, with the filly running and everything, if he does it he'll be 
the best of his era. If he can do all that, he's a true, legitimate 
Triple Crown horse.''

<HEADLINE> Chaotic 'Beer Night' Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Billy Martin began the night blowing kisses to  
Indians fans. A few hours later, armed with a bat, he was running 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer and blood flowed 25 years ago Friday when Cleveland fans,  
many drunk on 10-cent beer, turned a seemingly harmless promotion 
into a night of violence that left players, fans and umpires 
bloodied. 
</P>
<P>
	Memories of ``10-cent Beer Night'' at Cleveland Stadium still  
shake Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of punches thrown,'' said the Toronto  
manager, who was playing first base for Martin's Texas Rangers that 
night. ``A lot of people got hurt. Players got hit with chairs over 
their heads. It was nasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans fought with fans; with police; with the Rangers and the  
Indians, many of whom ran onto the field to protect their Texas 
counterparts. Umpire Nestor Chylak and Indians reliever Tom 
Hilgendorf were both struck in the head with chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like we were in a battle zone,'' said umpire Joe  
Brinkman. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 25,134 showed up that warm Tuesday night enticed by  
the chance to drink as many beers as they could handle for 10 cents 
a piece. And by the end of the night, it was estimated that over 
60,000 cups were quaffed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble had been brewing between the teams after Rangers second  
baseman Lenny Randle intentionally ran over Cleveland pitcher Milt 
Wilcox a week earlier. Rangers fans doused the Indians with beer 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Texas arrived in Cleveland, Indians fans were ready and  
the cheap beer was additional fuel. When Martin delivered his 
lineup card before the game, he was booed. Never one to back down, 
he responded by tipping his cap and blowing kisses. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Indians manager Mike Hargrove, a rookie with the Rangers  
in 1974, said nothing prepared him for the violence he would later 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember a father and son going out to center field and  
mooning everybody,'' said Hargrove. ``Streakers were running across 
the field and I remember one woman coming out and running over to 
kiss an umpire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the sixth inning with the Rangers leading 5-1, the crowd had  
gotten drunker, rowdier and bolder. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups of fans began running onto the field. Initially, they  
dashed out between innings, then between outs and finally between 
pitches. Some stopped to shake hands with players before being 
escorted off the field by a badly outnumbered security force. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Indians rallied to within 5-3 in the sixth, fireworks and  
other projectiles were being launched toward the Texas dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember getting spit on a lot and having a lot of hot dogs  
thrown at me,'' said Hargrove, who has a photograph of the infamous 
night hanging in his Jacobs Field office. ``Somebody threw a gallon 
jug of Thunderbird wine at me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing things were getting worse in the seventh, the Rangers  
pitchers vacated their bullpen and headed to the relative safety of 
the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the ninth, and mayhem.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland scored two runs to tie it 5-5. More fans poured on the  
field in celebration and one threw a punch at Texas right fielder 
Jeff Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Burroughs punched back, and in an instant, he was surrounded by  
a dozen fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when Billy grabbed a bat,'' said photographer Ron  
Kuntz. ``I'll always remember this, he grabbed a bat and said, 
'Let's get 'em boys.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rangers started going after that guy and before you knew  
it, there were thousands of fans all over the field. I was scared. 
The only thing I can compare it to was when I was covering riots in 
Venezuela and there were guys with Uzis running around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once he knew all the players had escaped the field, Chylak gave  
the Rangers the 9-0 forfeit, one of only four forfeits in the last 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While wiping away blood, Chylak told the Lorain Journal, ``We  
went as far as we could go, but you can't pull back uncontrollable 
beasts. The last time I saw animals like that was in the zoo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grieve, now a broadcaster for the Rangers, said when he heard  
the game had been forfeited he was relieved for his safety and that 
the two homers he hit were safely in the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid they wouldn't count. Fortunately, they did. I  
didn't hit many so I needed those two,'' said Grieve, who hit 65 in 
a nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Hargrove, Brinkman still has a picture.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember holding on to a guy who had been kicked in the  
head. I'm holding him and blood is running down his face,'' 
Brinkman said. ``I think there were about 10,000 people on the 
field at one time. It was scary.''

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Pushes Plea for Turkey Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah  
Ocalan appealed to the Turkish government Thursday to accept his 
overtures for ending 15 years of fighting that has left 37,000 
people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about Turkey's future,'' Ocalan told the court on the  
prison island of Imrali, where he is being tried for treason. 
``Whatever our mistakes and our sins, give us a chance. Let's 
unite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel chief, who could be sentenced to hang, has asked the  
court to spare his life so he could work to stop fighting between 
the Turkish military and his Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not saying this to save myself,'' Ocalan insisted. ``I  
want to prevent the death of a single soldier, a single PKK 
member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court session was boycotted by Ocalan's defense lawyers, who  
complained that Turkey was not doing enough to protect them from an 
angry public. Crowds surrounded Ocalan's lawyers and relatives at a 
hotel Wednesday, pushing and jeering. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers agreed to attend Friday's hearing after authorities  
promised to move them to other accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have yet to ask for a sentence against Ocalan, who  
is widely expected to be convicted and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for the families of more than 2,500 Turkish victims  
who have appealed to the court as plaintiffs asked the court 
Thursday to condemn Ocalan to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He carried out a genocide. He caused hatred among the Turkish  
and Kurdish people. He made fear reign,'' said one of the lawyers, 
Cengiz Erkoyuncu. ``That's why he should be sentenced to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The families are represented by scores of lawyers, who rotate at  
each session. 
</P>
<P>
	As the lawyers accused him of inciting slaughter and ethnic  
hatred, Ocalan could be seen apparently falling asleep in his 
bulletproof, bombproof glass enclosure in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan also was questioned about his group's financial ties. He  
said most of the rebels' assets were deposited in several Swiss 
banks under the names of PKK sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan said the PKK gave the equivalent of $100,000 from its  
coffers to the People's Democracy Party (HADEP), which is already 
facing the possibility of being closed if found guilty of links to 
the rebels. HADEP is Turkey's only legal pro-Kurdish party, and two 
of its predecessors have been shut down for links to the PKK. 
</P>
<P>
	During previous hearings, Ocalan urged his fighters to lay down  
their arms, but they responded by saying it was up to Turkey to 
bring peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has ruled out any concessions to its minority Kurds in  
their drive for autonomy in the southeast, seeing it as a threat 
that would split the nation. The government also has rejected 
talking to the rebels, who it considers terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the rebels began their fight for autonomy in 1984, the  
majority of those killed have been Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are expected to make their closing arguments Monday.  
Defense lawyers then could ask for a recess of up to 15 days to 
prepare their final arguments.

<HEADLINE> Vote on Plan PacBell Backs Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- State regulators postponed for a week a  
vote on a rate shift in Internet telephone charges, a proposal that 
could lead to higher fees for some Internet users in California. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan pushed by Pacific Bell to shift connection fees for such  
calls to a smaller phone company, which could pass them along to 
Internet service providers, had been scheduled for a vote at 
today's Public Utilities Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sponsor, Josiah Neeper, changed his proposal before the  
meeting so that it would require a full review and public comment 
before final PUC action, said Pacific Bell spokesman Bill Mashek. 
</P>
<P>
	Some legislators had urged the commission to postpone action and  
allow more time for a full debate on the effects on Internet 
charges and access. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the meeting, Gov. Gray Davis named two of his staff  
members, Tal Finney and Loretta Lynch, to fill two vacancies on the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	At Finney's urging, both companies agreed to a one-week  
postponement in the PUC's vote. The delay revives the possibility 
that the newly constituted commission will reaffirm a vote last 
year that left Pacific Bell's connection fee intact and avoided 
possible Internet fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted 3-2 last October to maintain its current  
system, which treats Internet calls as local calls and requires 
Pacific Bell to pay a fee for their completion under its contracts 
with small phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the terms of two commissioners, also Wilson appointees, had  
since expired. Both voted with the majority in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The eventual decision could set a precedent for other carriers  
that serve 600 Internet service providers in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves Internet calls that start with the caller's  
local carrier, a field dominated by Pacific Bell. The call is 
passed along to the Internet service provider's carrier, typically 
a smaller company like Pac-West Telcomm, whose case was before the 
PUC today. 
</P>
<P>
	For handling the remainder of the call, Pacific Bell has been  
required, under past agreements, to pay a fee to Pac-West. 
</P>
<P>
	That arrangement was designed for the expected increase in  
competition among local carriers. When Internet traffic flourished 
among small phone companies, Pacific Bell protested that the fees 
were an improper subsidy and that the calls, often destined for 
remote Web sites, were long-distance calls for which no fee was 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Bell started withholding its fee from Pac-West two years  
ago and has built up $50 million in an escrow account while the PUC 
considers its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Bryson, chief financial officer of Stockton-based Pac-West,  
has said his company would have to increase rates to Internet 
service providers if it lost the Pacific Bell fees. 
</P>
<P>
	After last October's PUC vote to leave the interconnection fees  
intact, the Federal Communications Commission weighed in by 
declaring in January that Internet calls were long-distance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the FCC specified that Internet callers would not have  
to pay long-distance rates and that state regulatory agencies 
remained free to allocate costs between the companies.

<HEADLINE>  Negotiator: Deal Meets NATO Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Viktor Chernomyrdin said a peace plan approved by  
Yugoslavia on Thursday meets all the key Western demands and can be 
implemented soon in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is to stop (the conflict),'' the Russian envoy  
said upon arriving Thursday evening in Moscow. ``I think we have 
reached that stage and it will be stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari brought a  
peace plan to Belgrade and met with Yugoslav leader Slobodan 
Milosevic late Wednesday and Thursday morning; a short while later 
Yugoslavia gave its approval to the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin has often sounded upbeat after past meetings when  
there were no real breakthroughs. But this time, the main mediator 
between NATO and Milosevic said Yugoslavia agreed to the central 
demands made by the Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agreement could be implemented soon, and that the  
11-week-old NATO airstrikes could stop 2-3 days after Yugoslavia 
begins complying with the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Chernomyrdin's aide, Valentin Sergeyev, the peace  
proposal calls for NATO military representatives to head to 
Belgrade, possibly within days, to supervise the withdrawal of Serb 
forces from Kosovo and the return of ethnic Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NATO generals, who will arrive in Belgrade under the  
auspices of the United Nations, will have to start putting into 
practice the peace plan,'' Sergeyev said in Belgrade, according to 
the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Chernomyrdin said the United Nations will play a  
key role in approving and implementing any agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing we have succeeded in doing at this stage is to  
bring the situation into the legal field of the United Nations,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin developed close ties with Western leaders during  
the five years he was prime minister before being dismissed in 
March 1998. He has been meeting regularly with U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
	While NATO insists its forces will make up the core of any  
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, Chernomyrdin said Russian troops 
would also be present and under Russian command. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin has come under criticism from Russian hard-liners  
who say he has been too willing to bow to NATO demands, and has not 
done enough to defend Yugoslavia, Russia's ally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, the military, deep in our hearts are not happy about many  
provisions that have been reached during these talks, because a lot 
of things are left unclear,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, a 
Defense Ministry official and part of Chernomyrdin's delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not quite satisfied with the role of NATO that is  
being imposed and the diminished role of Russia,'' said Ivashov, 
who spoke at the airport after returning with Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, hard-line lawmakers accused Chernomyrdin of  
selling out Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chernomyrdin is surrendering Yugoslavia,'' said Vladimir  
Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist who heads the Liberal Democratic 
Party in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, had planned a  
non-binding, no-confidence vote on Chernomyrdin, President Boris 
Yeltsin's Balkans envoy. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers first wanted to hear from military and political  
figures so Parliament put off any vote until Friday at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin was to fly to Helsinki, Finland, on Friday for more  
consultations on the crisis.

</P>
<P>
	``We were not quite satisfied with the role of NATO that is  
being imposed and the diminished role of Russia,'' said Ivashov, 
who spoke at the airport after returning with Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, hard-line lawmakers accused Chernomyrdin of  
selling out Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chernomyrdin is surrendering Yugoslavia,'' said Vladimir  
Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist who heads the Liberal Democratic 
Party in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, had planned a  
non-binding, no-confidence vote on Chernomyrdin, President Boris 
Yeltsin's Balkans envoy. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers first wanted to hear from military and political  
figures so Parliament put off any vote until Friday at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin was to fly to Helsinki, Finland, on Friday for more  
consultations on the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Boys Charged in School Phone Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Two teen-agers have been charged with  
phoning in threats to public schools in cases unconnected to the 
murder-conspiracy case against four other teens in this city, 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a 15-year-old Port Huron South High School student  
called 911 and threatened ``a bloodbath'' at the city's high 
schools, police Capt. Brian Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy first called 911 about 5 a.m., then called again about  
20 minutes later, Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he would shoot as many students as possible,'' Moeller  
said. Police traced the call to a pay phone and arrested the boy 
while he was still on the line with 911. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old was arraigned Wednesday in juvenile court on a  
charge of making a false threat to 911. Had he been charged as an 
adult, he would face a felony punishable by up to four years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting on tips, police also arrested a 14-year-old eighth-grader  
on Wednesday in a May 10 telephone bomb threat at Holland Woods 
Middle School, Moeller said. The boy, who allegedly left the threat 
on the school's answering machine, was to be arraigned in family 
court this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb threat came two days before police discovered what they  
say was a plot by four Holland Woods students to steal guns and 
massacre students and teachers at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen-year-olds Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah ``David'' Zinzo  
and 13-year-olds Daniel Fick and Jonathan McDonald are charged with 
conspiracy to commit premeditated murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they foiled the plot after classmates reported  
it to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Moeller said there is no connection between the latest arrests  
and the murder-conspiracy case in this city of 34,000, about 60 
miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The May 10 phone threat led to a Holland Woods parent meeting  
May 12, during which a pipe bomb was left outside the school. That 
bomb, as well as the arrests of the four students, led to the 
cancellation of classes May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been arrested in the planting of the bomb.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Panel Finalizes Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal panel finalized a report that  
urges a go-slow approach to new casinos and lotteries nationwide 
and an increase to 21 in the minimum betting age. But members of 
the National Gambling Impact Study Commission were deeply split on 
what they believed their proposals could, or should, accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Richard Leone, the driving force behind the  
commission's most controversial ideas to limit or scale back 
gambling, said he believed the report would spur action by 
governments and civic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put four or five big issues on the table,'' Leone said as  
the commission wrapped up two years' work Thursday. ``We got the 
point across that we've come very far, very fast (on gambling 
expansion) without thinking about what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leone proposed language encouraging a moratorium on further  
expansion of gambling, a call for states to require ``gambling 
impact statements'' before approving new gambling and restrictions 
on political contributions by the gambling industry in state and 
local campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner William Bible, former chairman of the Nevada Gaming  
Control Board, said he believed suggestions like the moratorium and 
limits on campaign contributions would be ``discounted, blown off 
by the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted that all nine members of the commission found  
common ground on problem gambling and will issue a strong appeal 
for more research, education and treatment. That, he said, ``will 
probably be the legacy of this commission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concluding two days of meetings here, the nine commission  
members voted unanimously to adopt a report nearly 300 pages long. 
It contained more than 70 recommendations, including calls for an 
increase to 21 in the minimum betting age, more help for addicted 
gamblers and a curb on political contributions by the gambling 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The report will be presented to Congress, the White House, state  
governors and Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members ranged from casino industry figures to James  
Dobson, president of the conservative group Focus on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress created the commission in 1996 after opponents of the  
industry charged the spread of casinos and other forms of gambling 
was taking a social toll on the nation, including increased 
bankruptcies, suicides and crime. Clinton, along with the leaders 
of the House and Senate, selected the commission members. 
</P>
<P>
	On many key recommendations the panel was divided. It voted 5-4,  
for example, for language urging states to consider a moratorium on 
new expansions of lotteries and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the commission unanimously called on insurance  
companies and managed-care providers to cover treatment plans for 
pathological gamblers. And in a last-minute additional 
recommendation, the commission unanimously urged states to curtail 
the growth of new lottery games, reduce lottery advertising and 
limit locations of lottery machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners joked about their wide ideological  
differences, which sometimes rendered consensus elusive and turned 
their meetings testy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed on more than I ever imagined,'' said Leone, a former  
state treasurer in New Jersey. ``We finished with more respect for 
each other than when we started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission struggled to the end over Indian reservation  
casinos, which in the past decade have developed into the 
fastest-growing segment of the U.S. gambling boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The only American Indian on the panel, Alaska businessman Robert  
Loescher, said the draft report overstated the potential spread of 
Indian casinos and understated gambling's unique ability to help 
tribes make money. 
</P>
<P>
	Loescher did press successfully to add a sentence declaring that  
the commission found no evidence ``suggesting any viable approach 
to economic development across the broad spectrum of Indian 
country, in the absence of gaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the gambling industry, fearing the commission  
would become a runaway jury, worked to weaken its subpoena power in 
1996. Yet in the end, the commission never issued any subpoenas. 
Nor did the commission's anti-gambling members advocate an outright 
ban of gambling or a crippling federal tax on its proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner John Wilhelm, national president of the Hotel  
Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, said that despite ``some 
misguided, inaccurate or unrealistic'' elements, the report is good 
news for casino employees because it does not call for new federal 
taxes or regulation.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Study Knicks Without Ewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- They may be just trying a little reverse  
psychology, but the Indiana Pacers say the loss of Patrick Ewing 
makes the New York Knicks a quicker, more dangerous team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes our job a little more difficult. First, because of  
the simple fact they've been playing so much without him,'' said 
Reggie Miller, who made a snide remark to the New York center after 
Ewing missed a 15-footer at the buzzer in Game 2 Tuesday that would 
have sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you make the last shot, that's all that matters,''  
Miller said. ``Right, Pat?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had hit two free throws with two seconds to play in the  
game, giving the Pacers a split of the first two games. Game 3 is 
Saturday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing will watch the rest of the playoffs in a suit and a cast  
on his left foot. He learned Wednesday that he has a partial tear 
of his left Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was more contrite on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unfortunate. Looking at the game, I knew he was  
hobbling a little bit. But, looking at all the other playoff series 
I thought he was going to play through the pain,'' Miller said. 
``It's unfortunate he isn't there, but I think that makes them a 
more dangerous team. A wounded animal is more dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and his teammates believe the absence of the 36-year-old  
Ewing will mean more fast-break attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look for it to be more of a track meet. A lot of time ... he  
would wait at half court to see if they got the fast break and then 
he would run down and get in the post and they would throw it in,'' 
Miller said. ``Now they're going to put on track shoes and really 
try and get out and run, get as many easy baskets as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rik Smits, who is likely to be defended by Chris Dudley with  
Ewing gone, anticipates his task will be more challenging 
offensively and on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He works his butt off on defense. He's tough down there. He's  
a guy that doesn't let anything come easy,'' Smits said of Dudley. 
``Dudley is a great rebounder. He's a guy who really works hard to 
get into position, beat his man off the board. It's going to be 
tough. I don't see things getting any easier for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smits felt compassion for Ewing, who he has battled for much of  
his career -- including five playoff series in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect him as a fellow athlete, putting in this many years.  
He's got a lot of miles on him, a lot of hours. He's been trying to 
get that first championship,'' Smits said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt real bad for him, to play this far with this much pain  
and this much discomfort and now you've got to sit down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Dale Davis thought the loss of Ewing gave the Knicks a  
chance to show their character. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely going to be big,'' Davis said of Ewing's  
absence. '' Even though he was banged up he was in there giving 110 
percent. He's their leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at it one of two ways, either they're going to  
respond to him or it is going to hurt them badly. Knowing the 
character of that team, I think they'll respond positively,'' Davis 
said. ``I look for them to push the ball more. They're going to be 
home, so I look for them to be more of an up-tempo team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the things that he was doing when he was on  
the floor, while he was hurting, he still was rebounding,'' Antonio 
Davis said of Ewing. ``He still was trying his best to control the 
middle. I think if we're able to get guys in there attempting to 
rebound. Maybe that will be one stat that we'll have in our favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we need something in our favor in order to be  
successful.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa GOP Poll To Show Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Iowa straw poll this summer will give an  
early indication of the strength of the Republican presidential 
field in a state that launches the nominating season, the state's 
GOP leader said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 12,000 Iowa Republicans will cast straw votes Aug.  
14 in Ames, Iowa. A strong finish can bring some attention to a 
campaign and offer an early measure of various campaign 
organizations' ability to deliver backers to events. 
</P>
<P>
	That's important in a caucus state like Iowa, where  
organizations next Feb. 7 will try to deliver backers to thousands 
of precinct caucuses, which are essentially neighborhood meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The track record of straw polls predicting results is mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	Televangelist Pat Robertson won one in 1987, giving a signal of  
some early strength among religious conservatives that hadn't been 
apparent earlier. And Texas Sen. Phil Gramm tied for the win in one 
during the last presidential election cycle, then bombed badly when 
real votes were cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain to win this poll is the state Republican Party, which is  
collecting $25 for each ticket that allows an activist to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge benchmark test,'' said Kayne Robinson, the Iowa  
Republican Party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Every major GOP candidate will be on the mock ballots in August.  
All will have time to make a 10-minute speech during the four-hour 
voting period. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the GOP presidential hopefuls have field operations  
running in Iowa, and they are focusing heavily on turning out 
backers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner in early  
polls, has yet to campaign in the state, and he's only recently put 
a campaign staff in place. Bush has not yet decided whether he will 
actively compete in or even attend the straw poll, said campaign 
spokesman Dave Beckwith. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision has not been made, and won't be made, until  
Governor Bush visits Iowa and gets a feel for it,'' Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
	One major change to the straw poll this year is that will be  
open only to Iowa residents. Previously, anyone of voting age who 
attended could cast a ballot, regardless of residency. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception in 1988, the Iowa straw poll has been a  
harbinger of what to expect in the other national primary races, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is, for anyone who comes in the top three -- that is  
a good indicator of how they're doing in Iowa and across the 
country,'' he said. In addition, he said, ``This event will be a 
fantastic test of who has a good organization. In Iowa, you have to 
have an organization on the ground to turn people out on Feb. 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson declined to say which candidate has the best  
organization in Iowa, saying, ``Most of the campaigns have the 
leadership horsepower to do very, very well in the caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bush's prospects, Robinson said, ``There seems to be  
something about him that makes people think he's better able to 
connect with voters. People are interested in meeting him.''

<HEADLINE> Stars' Coach Ignores Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Eddie Belfour has been dreaming about Game 7s  
since he was a kid, and he always woke up a winner. The only time 
Patrick Roy enjoys a Game 7 is when his team wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Modano says every move made with or without the puck in a  
Game 7 is crucial. Theo Fleury says winning a Game 7 takes poise, 
patience and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	From goalies to goal scorers, the Dallas Stars and the Colorado  
Avalanche agree there's something special about Friday night's game 
to determine the Western Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference finals are tied at three games each, turning  
their next game into a winner-take-all meeting for the chance to 
play the Buffalo Sabres for the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't view the prize of going to the Stanley Cup as anything  
but a dream for everybody, and you know you can't have it unless 
you earn it,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always going to be something in your way, and I think  
our players recognize that. So you kind of temper your focus into 
just focusing on playing and coaching the game at hand rather than 
worrying about what can happen, good or bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock's point is not to think about playing for hockey's  
biggest prize. He wants his team to focus on each shift, each shot 
and each check and let everything else fall into place. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado coach Bob Hartley is giving his team a similar message.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to just open up the book we started writing since  
training camp,'' the rookie coach said. ``We've jumped many hurdles 
and we tripped on a couple of occasions. Every time we went down, 
we found ways to get back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche's latest slip was in Game 6 on Wednesday night. A  
win would've ended the series, and they led 1-0 late in the first 
period. The Stars tied it in the second period and scored three 
times in the third to win 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' reward for having the best regular-season record is  
getting to play host to Game 7. The Stars are 6-2 at Reunion Arena 
this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colorado handed Dallas both its home losses and is 8-1 on  
the road overall in the playoffs. The Avalanche are a measly 3-6 in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the guys would much rather play in Dallas than play at  
home,'' Colorado's Claude Lemieux said. ``That's easy to say 
because regardless of if we would rather play at home, we're going 
on the road. But no one's going to complain about going to 
Dallas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars like the fact they have 69 hours between games.  
Hitchcock blamed the 38-hour turnaround the last time the series 
shifted from Denver to Dallas as part of the reason for a sloppy 
7-5 loss in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teams will play all-out; you can't hold anything back,''  
said Stars forward Jamie Langenbrunner, who scored two of the 
Stars' third-period goals Tuesday including the game-winner. ``It 
will be the best game in the series for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock said experience has taught him that one team will  
dominate the game and clearly prove it is better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not left up to the seesaw battles that some of the others  
are,'' he said. ``It's the team that plays the best in every aspect 
that usually wins -- the best 5-on-5, has the better special teams 
and the best goaltender.''

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nathan S. Ancell, co-founder of the Ethan Allen  
furniture company and pioneer of the concept of selling furniture 
in room-style settings, died Monday. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancell and his brother-in-law, Theodore Baumritter, started  
their company in the 1930s in Beecher Falls, Vt., out of a bankrupt 
furniture factory. Its headquarters was eventually moved to 
Danbury, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking the tradition of displaying furniture in rows of  
chairs, tables and beds, Ancell applied the ``gallery concept'' of 
showing furniture in coordinated settings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancell succeed Baumritter as chairman in 1970, handing over  
management to Farooq Kathwari in 1985. The company was bought by 
Interco Inc. for $150 million in 1980, and was sold to a management 
group led by Kathwari in 1989.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Christopher Cockerell, inventor of the  
hovercraft, died Tuesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Cockerell studied engineering at Cambridge University and worked  
for the electrical company Marconi, helping develop a transmission 
antenna for the BBC's first TV station at Alexandra Palace, north 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1950s, he left Marconi and settled in Norfolk,  
eastern England, to build tourist boats, but he also began work on 
inventing his hovercraft, which could move across land or water on 
a cushion of air. 
</P>
<P>
	The first prototype hovercraft, the SR-N1, crossed the English  
Channel in June 1959. The first commercial service began in Britain 
in 1962 and across the English Channel in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	He was knighted in 1969, and in 1971 received $250,000 from the  
government for surrendering his patent rights to the hovercraft.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles Pierce, an actor and female  
impersonator famous for characterizations of Hollywood stars 
including Bette Davis, Mae West and Joan Crawford, died Monday of 
cancer. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce did monologues and stand-up comedy in 1952 at the Cabaret  
Concert on Sunset Boulevard. He first got paid for his impressions 
while performing at the Club LaVie in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
	He added women's clothing to his act in the 1960s, quickly  
gaining admiration for his uncanny ability to conjure up images of 
female celebrities by using subtle facial expressions and vocal 
inflections. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he returned to the stage after the death of Davis, his  
most famous character, revamping his one-man nightclub act of 
``legendary ladies of the silver screen.''

	POYNETTE, Wis. (AP) -- Robert M. Thompson, who oversaw law  
enforcement at Fort McCoy when it served as an internment camp for 
thousands of Cuban refugees in 1980, died Tuesday of a heart 
attack. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, a former U.S. marshal, served five terms in the  
Assembly as a Democrat but switched to the Republican Party in 1990 
in an unsuccessful bid for secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed by President Carter in 1978 as U.S. marshal for  
western Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	That made him the top law enforcement officer involved when the  
Army camp near Sparta became home to 15,000 Cuban refugees, 
including freed prisoners and mental patients, who were permitted 
by Fidel Castro to leave for the United States.

<HEADLINE> Charity Fires Staff Amid Theft Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- More than 200 aid agencies will be  
deprived of food as Feed the Children keeps its warehouse here 
closed amid allegations of employee theft, the organization's 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Jones, who is also the founder of Feed the Children, said  
the warehouse will be closed indefinitely while the group looks 
into reports that Nashville workers took home goods meant for the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency fired all 14 of its Nashville workers Tuesday after  
Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents found boxloads of 
donations in the homes of several upper-level employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Feed the Children closed the 274,000-square-foot warehouse so it  
could take inventory. Jones said the closure effected 201 aid 
agencies in 15 Eastern states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saddened for Feed The Children. I'm also saddened for the  
children who are hurt right now,'' Jones said Thursday. ``But you 
have to remember that every company in America has this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seizures followed a four-month investigation by Nashville  
television station WTVF, which secretly videotaped staff members 
carting boxes of clothes, food, toiletries and more into their cars 
and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were deciding whether to file charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Emilee Truelove of Feed The Children said the  
organization was not sure all of the employees were stealing. They 
were let go, she said, ``to restore the trust in our donors. We 
wanted to let them know that we were doing all that we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said some staffers could be rehired later.  
</P>
<P>
	Forklifts sat idle Thursday against the back wall behind row  
after row of boxes of pasta, fruit juices and packaged foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``For it to just sit here while agencies are really begging for  
it, that's really ... a sin,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he was considering installing surveillance cameras,  
although he did not like the idea, and he was meeting with 
consultants for other ways to prevent employee theft. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not think stealing had been a problem in Feed The  
Children's other warehouse in Oklahoma City, but ``we're going to 
look at all the operations, because we don't want it to happen 
again.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Police Sued for Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two state police agencies were named  
Thursday in a lawsuit demanding an end to ``racial profiling,'' the 
use of race or color to decide who is stopped by officers on the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union  
against the California Highway Patrol and the state Bureau of 
Narcotics Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU asks for unspecified damages and an injunction  
forbidding the practice. It also asks that the agencies collect 
data on the race and ethnic background of motorists stopped for 
traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit stems from an incident on June 6, 1998, when Curtis  
Rodriguez, a Hispanic attorney from San Jose, observed five traffic 
stops in a 10-mile stretch of Highway 152 near Pacheco Pass, about 
90 miles south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	All the drivers were Hispanic, the suit said.  
</P>
<P>
	As his passenger, attorney Arturo Hernandez, took pictures of  
the last two stops, Rodriguez was pulled over. He said the CHP 
officer told him he was stopped for having his headlights on and 
for ``touching the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriquez refused permission for the officer to search his car,  
but the officer searched it anyway, he said. He found nothing and, 
after a lengthy delay, let the men go without citing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened on Pacheco Pass that day was illegal, it was  
immoral, it was racist, and it's high time these practices stop,'' 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the ACLU released a study in New York on racial  
profiling that said the war on drugs has resulted in a sharp 
increase in the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, North Carolina became the first state to require data  
collection on traffic stops. Similar bills have been introduced in 
Congress and in California, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
Texas and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Gives Banks, Thrifts Y2K Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is  
requiring that banks and thrifts considered to be unprepared for 
the Year 2000 date change use a standard backup system for storing 
key deposit and loan data. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC's board of directors proposed the new requirement  
Thursday and opened it to public comment for 30 days, although it 
will take effect immediately. The rule is designed to ensure that 
bank customers will have quick access to their money in the event 
of Year 2000 problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule will apply to banks and thrifts with a  
less-than-satisfactory rating from the government for their Year 
2000 readiness as of July 31. The FDIC said that would be a small 
number of federally insured financial institutions, since more than 
98 percent of them have gotten satisfactory ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the end of March, according to the FDIC, the number of  
banks and thrifts with less-than-satisfactory ratings has fallen 
from 357 to 205 out of a total 10,400. The agency expects the 
number to continue to decline throughout the year as banks and 
thrifts get in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Birch, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers  
Association, said the new rule probably will apply to fewer than 
100 financial institutions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the FDIC action likely would spur those institutions  
``to accelerate their efforts to be ready for the Year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, FDIC Chairwoman Donna Tanoue said ``We expect  
virtually all financial institutions to be prepared for the 
transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks, thrifts and the companies that provide them with data  
processing services maintain backup copies of the deposit and loan 
data stored in their systems. The backup information is in many 
different formats, however, which means it takes a lot of time to 
convert data from one storage system to another. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC said the requirement for standardized systems would  
make it easier to retrieve and transfer the data if a bank or 
thrift needed the help of another data processing company or was 
placed in receivership due to financial failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Federal Reserve proposed a plan to make special  
loans to banks, thrifts and credit unions that might need emergency 
money because of consumers' fears about the Year 2000 date change. 
</P>
<P>
	And last year the Fed ordered an additional $50 billion of new  
currency to put into circulation in the event people make a run on 
banks and automated teller machines late in the year. By year's 
end, $200 billion in currency will be stored in government vaults, 
up from the $150 billion normally held in reserve. That's in 
addition to the $460 billion in notes circulating in the United 
States and abroad.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A consumer marketing survey showed that 54  
percent of Americans said ``religion plays an important part in my

``trend-setters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 5,916 Americans, 10 percent of them classed as

 *Petition supports bishop    	
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- More than 270 United Methodists in three states  
have shown support for their bishop, charged with disobeying church 
law by allowing a Denver minister to officiate at same-sex unions. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of ministers and lay people rallied around the bishop,  
Mary Ann Swenson, by approving a statement circulated on the 
Internet by the Rev. Donald Messer, president of Denver's Iliff 
School of Theology. 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson has ``faithfully executed the responsibilities of her  
office and upheld the laws with Christian grace,'' said the 
statement, which called the charges ``inappropriate and 
distressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were filed in church court by Mel Brown, a Methodist  
farm supply dealer in Johnstown who called for her resignation, 
claiming she violated church law. The charges center on the Rev. 
Toni Cook, pastor of St. Paul's United Methodist Church, who has 
performed several ceremonies for same-sex couples at the church. 
Other Methodist ministers in the area have performed such unions, 
but Cook is widely known for her stance. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's highest court, the Judicial Council, has ruled that  
performing a same-sex union could be a chargeable offense, and 
ministers have been charged for performing the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson is the first bishop charged. The charges will be  
investigated by church leaders and could lead to a trial and 
Swenson's dismissal. She has been bishop for seven years, leading 
more than 110,000 Methodists in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and 
Montana.

Southern Baptist Convention, announced membership had declined 1 
percent to 14.7 million, the first drop in 72 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics in the Catholic annual, issued by P.J. Kenedy &AMP; Sons,  
cover the 50 states and U.S. possessions. The church encompasses 
19,584 local parishes, 586 hospitals and 2,260 social service 
agencies.

 *'God Squad' keeps the peace    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A group of clergymen mobilized by a police  
chaplain helped keep the peace at Ohio State University's recent 
African-American Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The racially diverse group of 30 clergymen dubbed the God Squad  
was assembled by the Rev. Aaron Wheeler to patrol the giant street 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing their clerical collars and black baseball caps with  
``clergy'' printed in white, the ministers walked through the crowd 
carrying police radios. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were peaceful, we were humble, we showed humility and we  
asked for their cooperation,'' said Wheeler, who is also executive 
assistant to the Columbus safety director. ``The collar makes a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's festival, police used Mace and projectiles to  
break up crowds, and 28 people were arrested. This year, police 
responded with a ``low tolerance'' approach without force and made 
36 arrests, many on charges of disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said the clergymen were not afraid to get involved.  
</P>
<P>
	``A few bottles were thrown at police, and we went right up in  
the crowd and cooled everybody off,'' he said. ``We started 
grabbing them and hugging them and told them to cool off. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some angels working on that day.''  
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said he got the idea from a similar plan at the Black  
College Reunion in Daytona Beach, Fla., earlier this spring where 
about 100,000 people gathered to party on the beach.

 *$30 million for Catholic retirement    	
</P>
<P>
	SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- Some $30 million will be distributed  
this year to retirees of U.S. Catholic orders. The funds come from 
a special retirement collection taken in the nation's parishes each 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups representing the majority of men and women in U.S.  
Catholic religious orders said $27 million would be distributed in 
June, and $3 million later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders are caught in a financial squeeze because members' low  
pay means their Social Security benefits are minimal. In addition, 
the average ages and numbers of retirees continually increases. 
Nearly half of U.S. nuns and one-third of the men in religious 
orders are over 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the orders said their unfunded liability for present  
and future retirees is $7 billion, compared with $7.9 billion last 
year, the first decrease since the bishops organized the aid 
program a decade ago. To date, $280 million has been distributed.

<HEADLINE> New Campaign Targets Drowsy Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two government institutions are taking a swing  
at reducing the number of drowsy drivers, targeting teen-agers and 
people working night, split or rotating shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the  
National Center on Sleep Disorders Research were kicking off a 
campaign today aimed at educating the public about the problem and 
ways to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort will include distributing educational materials to  
shift workers and their employers, including advice about allowing 
nap breaks and providing proper air conditioning and access to 
proper food. 
</P>
<P>
	The institutions will also teach workers to adapt their sleeping  
environments by blocking out daylight and masking noise that can 
disturb them. Eighteen companies have recently been awarded 
$180,000 in grants to start and evaluate test programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleep disorders center, part of the National Institute of  
Health's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, is also teaching 
teen-agers and their teachers about the dangers of drowsy driving. 
</P>
<P>
	The average teen needs about nine hours of sleep per night, one  
or two more hours than younger or older people. 
</P>
<P>
	The institutions said that by conservative estimates, 40,000  
injuries and 1,550 fatalities annually are attributable to drowsy 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``As our culture moves to a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week operation  
and the number of shift workers and teens continues to climb, the 
problem could worsen if changes are not made now,'' said Dr. 
Ricardo Martinez, an emergency room physician and head of the 
safety administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the Heart, Lung and Blood  
Institute, said: ``People with insufficient sleep suffer 
impairments in performance, attention and reaction time, which 
leads to errors, including automobile crashes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report issued by the two institutions, the number  
of people working evening, night, rotating or split shifts rose 30 
percent between 1985 and 1997. According to the Department of 
Labor, 15 million workers now function in shift jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	While factory workers account for the largest percentage of  
shift workers, the largest percentage gains were in the service 
industry, such as for people staffing 24-hour computer support 
lines or mail-order catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau also predicts that the number of teens age 15  
to 19 will increase from 18.5 million in 1996 to 26.5 million by 
2050.

	U.S. Cautious on Belgrade Peace Move  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration reacted cautiously  
today to Yugoslavia's reported acceptance of a peace plan for 
Kosovo and said there is no immediate plan to halt the bombing 
campaign. ``It's a hopeful sign, but we need to see more'' details, 
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. Officials said they want to 
hear directly from Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who is 
representing the European Union in talks with Slobodan Milosevic's 
government. The plan involves the withdrawal of Serb forces from 
Kosovo and the deployment of an international force to supervise 
the return of the 850,000 ethnic Albanian refugees to the province.

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man armed with a shotgun opened fire today in  
a supermarket, killing four people. The 23-year-old man was 
arrested and taken into custody. Three of the dead were employees 
of the Albertsons supermarket and the fourth was a shopper, Lt. 
Wayne Petersen said. ``We're unsure why he chose this place to go 
on a rampage.'' Police first received word of the shooting around 
5:15 a.m. The supermarket is at a shopping mall at one of the

for aircraft and other transportation products. The Commerce 
Department reported today that the decrease in factory orders in 
April followed a 1.9 percent advance in March and was only the 
second decline in the past six months. However, the weakness was 
confined to the volatile transportation sector. Excluding 
transportation, factory orders would have risen by 0.5 percent, 
posting the fifth increase in the past six months.

<HEADLINE> Montoya-Franchitti Battle Moves On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- Even when he isn't winning, Juan Montoya  
shows off his phenomenal talent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Colombian went into last Saturday's Motorola 300  
in Madison, Ill., with three straight wins -- a rookie record. His 
Target-Chip Ganassi Racing team made an uncharacteristic mistake, 
running the youngster out of fuel before his first pit stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, for them, it not only took precious extra seconds  
to restart the engine, but an untimely caution flag caught Montoya 
on pit road and put him a lap down. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngster was never back in contention, but he still brought  
the crowd at Gateway International Raceway to its feet with some 
spectacular driving as he tried to regain that lost lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice, Montoya's Reynard-Honda slid precariously towards the  
concrete wall, and twice he was able to somehow gather it in as the 
crowd gasped and then cheered. It was an amazing show of car 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he did that,'' said Dario Franchitti, who  
trails Montoya in the CART FedEx Championship Series standings by 
four points (69-65) heading into Sunday's Miller Lite 225 at the 
Milwaukee Mile. ``Once these cars get away from you, usually it's 
just too late to do anything. He's pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who served his apprenticeship in Europe as a road  
racer, has made a fast transition to oval racing, attested to by 
his victories on the ovals in Nazareth, Pa. and Rio de Janeiro, 
Brazil. He also came back to finish 11th at Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
	He has tested on the flat, one-mile over in this Milwaukee  
suburb, but this will be his first race here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone asked me if I'm getting sick of the ovals,'' Montoya  
said. ``No way. We're doing pretty good on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Races like we had in Madison are very rough on me, but we did  
have success at Nazareth, so I'm ready for Milwaukee. Of course I'm 
looking forward to street courses, but I'm still learning a lot and 
I actually enjoy the ovals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not great news for Scotsman Franchitti, who has made also  
made a good transition from European road courses to the less 
familiar American ovals. He has yet to win on an oval, but 
Franchitti did finish fourth -- behind Moytona's teammate Jimmy 
Vasser -- here last year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, he's also finished third on the oval at  
Homestead, Fla., in the opener (where Montoya was 10th), second in 
Brazil and third in Madison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very strong on ovals, especially compared to this  
time last year,'' said Franchitti, who drives for Team Kool Green. 
``And we had a very productive test at Milwaukee, so we're happy 
with the baseline setup that we have. We did some long runs and 
we're reasonably confident that we know what the car is going to do 
during the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had one of my most enjoyable races last year at Milwaukee.  
Now, our goal is to score as many points as possible and to try to 
take over the championship lead.'' 
</P>

	Franchitti showed some sensational car control him last week  
when he got sideways midway through the race and slid for several 
hundred yards without making contact with the wall.

<P>
	``Sometimes, there's nothing you can do in that situation,'' he  
said. ``But I just tried to stay in the gas and keep the cars as 
straight as possible. I've thought about what to do in that 
situation and tried a few things before. Maybe it was just luck 
that we didn't hit anything, but maybe it helped.''

	With 14 of 20 races remaining, there remain at least 10 drivers

</P>
<P>
	``I've been saying all along that the most consistent team, the  
one that makes the fewest mistakes -- the one that can overcome some 
of the mistakes they do make -- will win it,'' Franchitti said. 
``Nothing I've seen so far has changed my mind.''

<HEADLINE> Insurance Co. Wins HIV Coverage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A federal appeals panel has ruled that an  
insurance company should have the option to limit HIV-related 
health-care coverage to a fraction of the $1 million cap placed on 
other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruling in the  
case of two HIV-positive Chicago-area men, found that a federal law 
barring discrimination against people with disabilities does not 
apply to the content of insurance policies. The decision overturned 
a ruling by a federal judge last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For people with AIDS, the decision ``legalizes irrational  
discrimination by health insurers,'' Ann Fisher, executive director 
of the AIDS Legal Council of Chicago, said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals panel ruled late Wednesday on a lawsuit that  
activists filed in 1997 against Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co. on 
behalf of the two men, whose names have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual of Omaha spokesman Jim Nolan said Thursday that the  
company was pleased with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the two men have not decided whether to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the men's policy capped his lifetime benefits for  
HIV-related conditions at $25,000 and the other man's policy capped 
such benefits at $100,000. They said this was in contrast to the $1 
million that Mutual of Omaha would provide them if they needed care 
for other medical conditions.

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Ups Thai Hotel Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A high-profile takeover battle for the  
owner of a top Bangkok luxury hotel appeared to be nearing an end 
Thursday as the U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs raised its offer 
and a rival bidder declined to match it. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs currently holds a 32.33 percent stake in holding  
company Rajadamri Hotel, which owns the five-star Regent 
HotelRegent. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been locked in a bidding battle with Thailand's Royal  
Garden Resorts -- which owns 24.7 percent of Rajadamri Hotel -- for 
control of the hotel company. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs' financial adviser on the deal, Asset Plus  
Securities, said Thursday that the U.S. investment bank will offer 
48 baht, or $1.29, a share for another 20 percent stake in 
Rajadamri. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Garden's chief executive, Bill Heinecke, said his company  
has made a final offer of 43 baht, or $1.16, for another 10 percent 
stake. He said Royal Garden increased its tender offer from 42 baht 
to match Goldman Sachs' previous offer but wasn't interested in a 
bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that even though Goldman Sachs' offer values Rajadamri  
Hotel at a higher price, major shareholders won't sell to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``My belief is that they won't be able to get majority  
control,'' said Heinecke. 
</P>
<P>
	Asset Plus president Kongkiat Opaswongkarn said Goldman Sachs  
will pay 48 baht for the first nine million shares tendered, and 38 
baht, or $1.02 a share, for any stock tendered after it gets the 
additional 20 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday was the deadline by which Goldman Sachs and Royal  
Garden Resorts had to submit final tender offers to Thailand's 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight began in April when Goldman Sachs outbid Heinecke's  
company for a 33 percent stake from a Japanese investor in 
Rajadamri Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman followed up the acquisition by making a tender offer for  
the rest of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major shareholders include the Crown Property Bureau -- the  
investment arm of Thailand's royal family -- and Thai Farmers Bank. 
About 10 percent of the company is traded on the Stock Exchange of 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs has other hotel holdings, including a 30.91  
percent stake in Dusit Thani Hotel, another luxury hotel in 
Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Livent OKs SFX's $115 Million Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Livent Inc., the Broadway producer of shows such  
as ``Ragtime'' and ``Fosse,'' has accepted a buyout offer of up to 
$115 million from SFX Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	SFX, the nation's leading producer of live music shows, agreed  
to buy most of Toronto-based Livent's assets with theaters in New 
York, Chicago and Toronto, according to court papers filed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian company's filing acknowledged it had aggressively  
tried to sell its business after learning of massive accounting 
irregularities a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the offer, other bids will be accepted according to a  
schedule set by the bankruptcy court, Livent said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez set a hearing for  
June 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent sought bankruptcy protection in November after a new  
management team headed by former Walt Disney Co. President Michael 
Ovitz said it uncovered fraud by the company's Canadian founders, 
Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb. 
</P>
<P>
	Drabinsky and Gottlieb were charged in January with fraud and  
conspiracy, accused of stealing $4.6 million from the company in 
the early 1990s and doctoring the books to hide it. Both have 
denied any wrongdoing and remain in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Puts Stern in His Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Finally, a man big enough to put Howard Stern in  
his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura did it at a New York book signing  
Wednesday, snubbing one of Stern's long-haired, T-shirt clad 
reporters by refusing to appear on the shock jock's radio program, 
and yanking the guy's chain a little in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you come on our show, Governor?'' the reporter  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time professional wrestler chastised Stern for once  
keeping him on hold for 20 minutes, then telling the campaigning 
candidate there just wasn't enough time left to put him on air. 
</P>
<P>
	``What goes around, comes around,'' Ventura said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stern's public relations agency had no comment on the incident.  
Ventura was in Manhattan autographing copies of his new book, ``I 
Ain't Got Time to Bleed.''

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson's Son Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Jackson's 2-year-old son is improving  
in a New York City hotel and not on the verge of death after 
suffering a seizure as has been reported, the child's Los Angeles 
doctor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many reports have circulated in Europe and the United States  
that are completely fictitious,'' said Dr. Allen L. Metzger, who 
has been consulting with Prince Michael Jackson Jr.'s New York 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The pop star was in New York with Prince, who ``continues to be  
under the watchful eye of his family and supportive medical team,'' 
the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Metzger last saw the child in Los Angeles about two weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no neurological disease. Such seizures can occur when  
a child's temperature is too high or goes up too quickly,'' Metzger 
said. ``He is showing slow and significant improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of the child's illness first developed during a benefit  
concert in Italy where Jackson had been scheduled to appear. Opera 
star Luciano Pavarotti choked back tears as he told the audience 
Tuesday that Jackson's son might be dying and asked people to send 
the child the prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Morrish, an executive with Sony Records, Jackson's  
label, also gave dire reports at the concert site in Modena, Italy, 
that Prince had ``lost consciousness, and his legs and arms were 
paralyzed because of a high viral fever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Multiple attempts to reach Jackson's spokesman by phone have  
been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's son was rushed to a hospital in January and treated  
for a viral infection accompanied by fever and dehydration. He 
reportedly was treated in Los Angeles for the same symptoms in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince was born Feb. 13, 1997. Jackson and his wife had a second  
child, Paris, in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Japan Auto Deal Falling Short </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 1995 agreement aimed at boosting sales  
opportunities for U.S. automakers in Japan is falling far short of 
its goals, with sales of American-made cars in Japan dropping by 35 
percent last year, the Clinton administration said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a plunge in sales of cars made by U.S.  
automakers, exports of U.S.-made automotive parts to Japan fell by 
7.4 percent last year, the first drop since the auto agreement went 
into effect, the administration said in releasing its latest 
assessment of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials blamed Japanese foot-dragging in implementing the  
deal and the severe recession in Japan for the declines in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said President Clinton had raised U.S.  
concerns about the widening imbalance in auto trade during a summit 
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly urge the Japanese government to further open and  
deregulate its auto and auto parts market to achieve the goals of 
the agreement and to help spur Japanese economic growth,'' U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Commerce Secretary 
William Daley said in a joint statement released with the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The two officials said the administration would continue pushing  
the Japanese government to adopt deregulation proposals made by 
U.S. negotiators to expand sales opportunities for U.S. automakers 
and parts suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said sales of U.S.-made cars fell by 35 percent in  
1998 and declined 29 percent during the first quarter of this year 
compared with the first quarter of 1998. The report said sales of 
U.S. auto parts fell by 7.4 percent in 1998 after having posted 
gains for the six previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 auto deal was negotiated for the administration by  
former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. Agreement was 
achieved only after the United States threatened to ban sales of 
Japanese luxury cars in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	However, before the ink was dry, the two countries fell to  
arguing over the details, with the Japanese maintaining they never 
promised to meet numerical targets for increased sales of autos and 
parts or for the expansion of dealerships in Japan carrying U.S. 
autos.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Japanese Stocks Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Renewed rumors that China may devalue the yuan  
pushed the dollar higher against the yen today. Tokyo share prices 
dropped on profit-taking after a three-day rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.54 yen at late afternoon, up 1.00 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.33 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 190.49 points,  
or 1.16 percent, closing the day's trading at 16,227.50 points. The 
index had gained 9.49 points, or 0.06 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's advance in Asia came after  
market rumors that China might devalue the yuan emerged once again. 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Bank of China, China's central bank, reaffirmed the  
government's commitment to a stable currency, with a spokesman 
dismissing market talk of plans to devalue the yuan as ``rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Beijing have repeatedly pledged not to devalue its  
currency, more than a year of market rumors to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor supporting the dollar was a report in the  
Japanese Nihon Keizai newspaper today that the Bank of Japan, 
Japan's central bank, will keep a zero interest-rate policy until 
clear signs of a broad rise in prices emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's strength also derived from a belief among  
investors that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
to cool the economy, traders said. Higher interest rates make a 
currency more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 121.55 yen and 121.99 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 125.95 yen, up from  
124.78 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei index dropped as investors took  
profits following three straight days of gains. There were few 
incentives to motivate buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 396  
million shares, down from Wednesday's turnover of 434 million 
shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers 794 to 373, with 128 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Some market players retreated to the sidelines waiting for U.S.  
employment data, due out Friday in Washington, for clues on the 
direction of U.S. interest rates and stock prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 9.08 points, or 0.68 percent, to 1,317.69. 
The TOPIX closed up 9.29 points, or 0.71 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.6100 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6700 
percent, driving its price up to 99.19 yen from 97.68 yen.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Says Doomed Jet Was Briefed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The pilot of the American Airlines jet  
that crashed in a thunderstorm was getting the ``play-by-play'' on 
the deteriorating weather as he brought the plane in for a landing, 
a federal investigator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are analyzing the conversation between the tower  
and the pilot, information from the plane's flight data recorder 
and evidence from the wreckage to try to determine why Flight 1420 
skidded off the runway at the Little Rock airport, killing nine 
people, including the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm with hail, lightning and gusts of 75 mph hit the area  
Tuesday night just minutes before the plane made a bouncy landing 
and struck a steel walkway and approach lights at the end of the 
runway. The plane tore open and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather was changing rapidly,'' said George Black, a  
spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. ``There's 
even indications the tower controller was providing sort of a 
play-by-play wind direction and velocity sequence of radio 
transmissions during the approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 1420 initially was directed to land from the north  
because the airport was reporting southerly winds as the plane 
neared Little Rock. When the winds shifted to the northwest, the 
pilot was ordered to approach from the south instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Black did not say specifically what wind speeds the pilot was  
told about. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety officials have said the decision of whether or not to  
land rests with the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the plane never seemed to get a grip on the  
rain-slickened runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got worried because I knew we should have been slowing down  
and we weren't,'' Dave Ozmun said. ``I could tell he was trying to 
work the brakes. ... Once we even left the runway, he was 
continuing to try to reverse the plane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors at the scene said Thursday that if the plane had not  
hit the steel structure at the end of the runway, it could have 
gone into the Arkansas River. The jet went down a rock embankment 
and stopped just short of the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, Capt. Richard Buschmann, was a veteran American pilot  
with 5,500 hours of flight time in the MD-80 series of aircraft, 
which includes the MD-82. As a chief pilot in American's Chicago 
operation, he helped supervise 1,800 pilots and flew planes for two 
months each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow pilots said Buschmann had an excellent record and was  
unlikely to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the crash site Thursday, investigators peered into the  
plane's broken nose, climbed into an engine that had broken away 
from the jet and walked through the burned, severed shell. Some 
investigators wore biohazard suits to protect them from blood and 
spilled fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	They also looked over a grassy field at the end of the runway  
where the plane broke through a metal fence and plowed into steel 
posts that hold runway approach lights. The left side of the plane 
was ripped wide open.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A dozen knee-slapping kids rap hip-hop  
style. Guitars, a bass and drums kick in. The young audience claps 
hands and swings to the pulsing beat. 
</P>
<P>
	A live concert? MTV? No, it's worship service at the Grapevine  
Church in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	While the melding of music and religion is nothing new, more and  
more churches are making an extra effort to draw young people by 
offering a mix of contemporary tunes, multimedia sermons and an 
informality they can relate to. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose is to reach out to GenXers who have left the  
church or haven't been to church at all,'' said Grapevine's Joseph 
Lee, who is known as Pastor Joe. ``We wanted our worship services 
to be appealing when they come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trend of changing their tune spans churches across the  
country -- from the Crossroads Community Church in Cincinnati and 
the Sorgho Baptist Church in Owensboro, Ky., to St. John the Divine 
Episcopal Church in River Oaks, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mixing entertaining and religion resonates with some.  
</P>
<P>
	Young Kim, 23, attending Sunday morning service at Grapevine,  
approvingly refers to the hip music as ``very different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the church were boring, I wouldn't come,'' Kim adds.  
</P>
<P>
	But the more contemporary approach also has its critics. Lee  
said some elders have called the music ``satanic'' because of its 
heavy beat and rock 'n' roll style. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Kwon, a first-year student at Tufts Medical School, gave  
the alternative service a try but was not sure he would return. 
</P>
<P>
	``To a younger audience it's very effective,'' said Kwon, 22.  
``To older, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastors say declining church attendance over the last two  
decades is partly responsible for the shifting focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Among people 18 to 35, attendance has fallen 5.6 percent over  
the last five years, according to the National Opinion Research 
Center at the University of Chicago. The center's Tom W. Smith 
cites several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Free from their parents for the first time, many young people  
stop practicing religion when they start college, Smith said. And 
in general people are waiting longer to marry or have children, 
both of which tend to bring people back to church, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaplain Claudia Highbaugh of Harvard Divinity School said fewer  
young people set aside time for church on Sunday. Worship often 
competes with other activities in their lives, including jobs and 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	After introducing hip services that include praise time with  
catchy melodies and Scripture-based lyrics, some churches have seen 
their congregation grow. 
</P>
<P>
	One of these is the First Baptist Church in Houston, which two  
years ago squeezed a new service between two traditional services. 
It expected 300 to 400 worshippers, but it now averages between 
1,500 and 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lord's Gathering in Woburn, Mass., Clayton Reed -- also known  
as Pastor C -- dishes up a service that includes multimedia and 
lighting effects, which he says many young people prefer. He uses a 
computer connected to a projector that throws video clips and Bible 
passages on a screen as songs play. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't go out of your way to speak to children and teens  
in a way they can hear, you're going to lose them,'' said Reed, who 
sported sunglasses on his head. ``Why can't church be so fun and 
cool that they just want to come?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another effort to make kids feel comfortable is the services'  
typically more relaxed, informal atmosphere, in which pastors are 
called by their first names and dress is casual. 
</P>
<P>
	The words ``Solid Rock Cafe'' are painted in large bold letters  
on the walls, and a table soccer game stands in the middle of the 
room at Lord's Gathering, making it feel more like a trendy club 
than a place of worship. 
</P>
<P>
	For Reed, youth service means connecting kids to an ``awesomely  
cool God.'' He said they can easily rattle off verses of Top 40 
songs but often not a verse of Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is I want the eternal truth of God to get into  
people's lives,'' he said. ``How do you do that? Through their 
culture.''

	Two teen-agers at the Littleton, Colo., school shot 12 students  
and a teacher to death before killing themselves April 20. Exactly 
a month later, a sophomore at Heritage High in Conyers opened fire 
and wounded six students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps a lot to know they care,'' said Heritage sophomore  
Zach Moore. ``They've been there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 students attended the cookout, which was held at a  
church about a mile from Heritage. Although the shootings were 
discussed, Staver described the atmosphere as light and happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to get on with our lives,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The students mainly talked about how the shooting affected them,  
how they are dealing with it and what they think can be done to 
prevent school violence. They said they hope the tragedies bring 
about better communication between teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reaching out to each other is one of the most important things  
we can do in our schools,'' said Columbine's Christine Bell. ``We 
need to unite schools in this nation and make sure people don't 
feel outcast to the point where they make this kind of tragedy 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heritage freshman Jaime Taylor, who is friends with two of the  
shooting victims, said she and her friends will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having the summer off will help give everybody a chance to get  
over it,'' she said, ``but it is always going to be in the back of 
our minds.''

<HEADLINE>  Milosevic Forced To Make Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The tones were defiant up to the last --  
no NATO presence in Kosovo, no mass withdrawals of Yugoslav forces 
from the violence-torn southern province. Yet the peace plan 
accepted today by Slobodan Milosevic imposes those conditions and 
others the Yugoslav president said he would never agree to. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan suddenly accepted by Milosevic is dressed up in  
language calculated to make it more digestible. It talks of U.N. 
involvement and the inviolability of Yugoslav borders. It avoids 
spelling out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will have 
command and control of any Kosovo peace keeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic made the most of that window dressing, saying the  
draft confirms the ``sovereignty and territorial integrity'' of 
Yugoslavia ``as well as the role of the United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But scratching the surface of the draft reveals a plan that is  
basically the same list of Western demands originally rejected by 
Milosevic, triggering the Western military air campaign on March 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the original NATO demands agreed to by Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	An end to the Kosovo fighting; a quick and verifiable withdrawal  
of Yugoslav army and Serb police troops; deployment of a security 
force ``with essential NATO participation'' -- shorthand for a 
NATO-dominated peacekeeping force; safe and free return of the 
800,000-plus refugees driven out over the past months, and autonomy 
for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond containing many conditions originally rejected by  
Milosevic's people at two sets of talks in France in February and 
March, the draft would leave Milosevic weaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rambouillet, France, for instance, talk was of up to 11,000  
Serb security forces remaining in Kosovo under any peace deal. The 
draft would limit forces to ``hundreds, not thousands'' and 
restrict them to guarding Serb churches and other cultural and 
religious sites under supervision of the Kosovo peace force. 
</P>
<P>
	So what happened? How did a plan that was unacceptable for so  
long suddenly become the formula for ``the establishment of 
peace,'' as stated by Milosevic's Socialist Party? 
</P>
<P>
	Russia was key. Over more than two months of NATO bombing,  
Moscow moved from an outspoken advocate of the Serb position to 
line up with the United States and the European Union on most 
demands. The Russians clearly did not want to risk their economic 
and other ties with the West by siding with Europe's renegade 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is necessary for the Yugoslav leadership to accept this  
document,'' Valentin Sergeyev, spokesman for Russian envoy Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, said Wednesday in language that could not have been a 
plainer signal to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its allies also compromised, but only in  
language not in substance. They agreed to let the United Nations 
play a role in the shape of a Kosovo peace plan and dropped 
explicit language -- but not their commitment -- to a NATO-controlled 
and dominated peace force. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, Milosevic likely realized something that  
NATO said from the beginning -- his small nation of 11 million was 
no match for the 19-nation alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	With his military and economic infrastructure destroyed, his  
soldiers hurting for lack of oil and other supplies and sentiment 
across Serbia building for peace, he was looking for a way out. The 
plan was the best way to end the crisis -- because it was the only 
offer on the table.

<HEADLINE> Hackett To Stay With Canadiens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Goaltender Jeff Hackett signed a three-year  
contract extension with the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett, who turned 31 on Tuesday, had one year remaining on his  
current contract, after which he could have become an unrestricted 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal Gazette reported that Hackett would honor the final  
year of his contract at $1 million, and add three years at what 
agent Rick Curren called, ``Guy Hebert money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hebert, Anaheim's goalie, has a three-year, $12 million  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett was the Canadiens' player of the year this season after  
being acquired last Nov. 16 in a six-player trade with the Chicago 
Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	With Montreal, he had a record of 24-20-9 with a 2.27  
goals-against average and .914 save percentage in 53 games.

<HEADLINE> Triple Crown at Stake in Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The way Bob Baffert sees it, there's more than  
the Triple Crown on the line in Saturday's $1 million Belmont 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	More than the Triple Crown?  
</P>
<P>
	``You've been missing the boat,'' said Baffert, who sends out  
his star filly Silverbulletday against Kentucky Derby and Preakness 
winner Charismatic as the colt tries to become racing's 12th Triple 
Crown winner. ``This is the best filly in the country against the 
best colt in the country. It's like a heavyweight fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of Silverbulletday adds a dimension to the race  
that didn't exist in any of the 25 Belmonts with a Triple Crown at 
stake. For the first time, a filly is in the field as a potential 
spoiler, and not only is she in, but she's the third choice at 4-1 
behind favored Charismatic at 2-1 and Derby and Preakness runner-up 
Menifee, 7-2 in the morning line. 
</P>
<P>
	But to Baffert's thinking, Menifee doesn't quite enter into the  
top-billing equation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had two chances already,'' Baffert said.  
</P>
<P>
	While Charismatic, who will be ridden by Chris Antley, attempts  
to become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978 and 
also earn a $5 million bonus from Visa, Silverbulletday looks to be 
a worthy opponent, having overwhelmed the filly ranks by winning 
her last eight races, including easy two-length victories in the 
Kentucky Oaks and the Black-Eyed Susan. Her times, notes Baffert, 
have routinely been faster than the colts'. 
</P>
<P>
	Is it the right move to challenge the boys in the Belmont, and  
try to foil a Triple Crown? 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 926 horses who have run in the Belmont, Silverbulletday  
will be just the 21st filly. Only two have won -- Ruthless in 1867 
and Tanya in 1905. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Kentucky Derby-winning Genuine Risk was second to  
Temperence Hill in 1980 and My Flag was third in 1996 to Editor's 
Note. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running in the Triple Crown races is a one shot deal, a filly  
cannot do the three races,'' said Baffert, who found out the hard 
way when his other filly, Excellent Meeting, came off a good effort 
in the Derby and then had to be pulled up in distress in the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Derby wasn't the right time for Silverbulletday; we wanted  
to run her in the Preakness, and we were really dejected when she 
drew the No. 14 post. The time is right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Silverbulletday, who will be ridden by Jerry Bailey, is  
putting her unbeaten-as-a-3-year-old streak on the line in the 
1 1/2-mile race, Baffert feels he has little to lose, and everything 
to gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about `my horse is better than your horse,' ''  
Baffert said Thursday morning outside Barn 50 at Belmont Park, 
several hours after Silverbulletday went for an early-morning jog. 
``It's the best 3-year-old filly against the best 3-year-old colt. 
This is so big, it ought to be on pay-per-view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, who replaced Gary Stevens as the filly's regular rider,  
was aboard Silverbulletday once before, winning the Ashland Stakes 
at Keeneland on April 3. It was Bailey, Baffert said, who helped 
convince him and owner Mike Pegram to enter the filly in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is just one tough filly, a model of consistency,'' Bailey  
said. ``I think she's a special individual, and I said, `What else 
is there for her to conquer?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Possessed of a quick turn of foot and extraordinary  
acceleration, her rivals have only managed to run with 
Silverbulletday for a few hundred yards before being left in the 
dust, a fact not lost on Charismatic's trainer, D. Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's had a cupcake schedule all spring,'' Lukas said. ``She's  
coming into it fresh and that's a huge advantage. The other side of 
the coin is that she hasn't been pressed. She will have to pass 
that test and she's in for a long hard one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Baffert views the Belmont as a showdown, he does admit  
there are others who could win, including Menifee and the Allen 
Jerkens-trained Best of Luck, recent winner of the Peter Pan at 
Belmont on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 12 horses were entered, making it the second largest  
Belmont field where a Triple Crown hung in the balance. In 1971, 13 
horses went to post as Pass Catcher upended Canonero II's Triple 
Crown run before a record crowd of 82,694. 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out, is: Teletable (John Velazquez,  
99-1); Vision and Verse (Herberto Castillo Jr., 20-1); 
Silverbulletday (Bailey, 4-1); Charismatic (Antley, 2-1); Pineaff 
(Sidney LeJune Jr., 30-1); Lemon Drop Kid (Jose Santos, 20-1); 
Patience Game (Kent Desormeaux, 20-1); Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 20-1); 
Prime Directive (Mike Smith, 30-1); Menifee (Pat Day, 7-2); Stephen 
Got Even (Shane Sellers, 10-1); and Best of Luck (Jean-Luc Samyn, 
6-1). 
</P>
<P>
	With sunny skies and warm temperatures forecast for Saturday,  
New York Racing Association officials are hoping -- and bracing -- 
for another huge crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Triple Crown will be at stake for the third straight year,  
with 70,682 turning out in 1997 to watch Touch Gold foil Silver 
Charm by three quarters of a length; and 80,162 at the '98 Belmont 
for Victory Gallop's dramatic nose win over Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert says he doesn't view Silverbulletday as a potential  
spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of comes after the race,'' he said. ``We're just  
trying to win the Belmont. ... And the mile-and-a-half? You never 
know. I just hope when she gets to the eighth poll, she doesn't 
pull a Robbie Gordon and run out of gas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The distance is a question mark with every horse in the field,  
from 99-1 shot Teletable to Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't train horses in this country to run 1 1/2 miles,'' Lukas  
said, ``but we've had two great legs over a five-week run that only 
happens in fairytales. If we can get it done, we're going to enjoy 
it, and if we don't we're still going to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Baffert, he remains confident his filly is ready for a  
``huge race. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people sit down to make their picks on Friday,'' he said,  
``and if they have to hesitate between the filly and him, then 
we've made the right choice in going in this race.''

	FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) -- An Air Force helicopter on a training  
mission crashed in a wooded area at Fort Bragg, killing one person 
and injuring five others, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials don't know what caused the MH-53J Pave Low aircraft to  
go down Wednesday night. Military police were guarding the crash 
site pending the arrival of investigators. 
</P>

	Five of the six crew members aboard received only minor  
injuries. The sixth died this morning at Womack Army Medical Center 
at Fort Bragg, said Capt. Tatiana Stead, a public affairs officers

<P>
	The helicopter was assigned to the 20th Special Operations  
Squadron, part of the 16th Special Operations Wing based at 
Hurlburt Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pave-Low can carry at least 38 troops and is equipped with

<HEADLINE> Jones Attys. Decry Clinton Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Lawyers for Paula Jones dismissed  
President Clinton's objections to their $438,000 fee request as 
``absurd'' and argued that his lies under oath about Monica 
Lewinsky led to the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke defended  
its request in court papers filed Thursday 
</P>
<P>
	``Had Mr. Clinton chosen not to lie about his illicit sexual  
activity with Ms. Lewinsky, we would not have needed to take the 
depositions of Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp, Betty Currie, Vernon 
Jordan and other related witnesses,'' the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright found Clinton  
in contempt for giving false testimony about his relationship with 
the former White House intern during his January 1998 deposition in 
Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge then ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones' lawyers any  
``reasonable'' expenses they incurred as a result of his false 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas firm submitted itemized bills for $437,825 and the  
Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, which helped in the case, 
asked for $53,333. Clinton's lawyers argued Mrs. Jones' attorneys 
deserved no more than $33,737. 
</P>
<P>
	Any money the judge eventually awards would be in addition to  
the $850,000 Clinton has paid Mrs. Jones to settle her case. He did 
not admit any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's deposition became the subject of the investigation by  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.

	The authority, known as the control board, was created by  
Congress when the District of Columbia was on the brink of 
financial collapse during the administration of former Mayor Marion 
Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years the city has regained its financial footing, and  
both Congress and the control board have relaxed their day-to-day 
supervision of local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin's departure means there will be two vacancies on the  
seven-member Fed board of governors. The administration has 
indicated that Carol J. Parry, an executive vice president of Chase 
Manhattan Bank, the country's third largest bank, is the 
front-runner for a vacancy that has existed since last June when 
Susan Phillips left the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin was nominated to be vice chairman of the Fed by Clinton  
in 1996. At the time, she was serving as head of the president's 
Office of Management and Budget, where she had the reputation as 
one of the administration's leading deficit hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	She and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin helped pushed the  
administration toward a more aggressive effort to eliminate the 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an enormous privilege to be part of the Clinton  
economic team and help put together the policies that turned that 
huge budget deficit into a surplus,'' Rivlin said in her letter to 
Clinton. ``We did the right thing and it worked!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin announced that in addition to devoting more time to her  
duties as chair of the control board, she will also return to the 
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivlin had also served as the first head of the Congressional  
Budget Office from 1975 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of her pending departure, the Fed announced that Rivlin  
would not participate in the next interest rate meeting of the 
central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, composed of Fed board 
members and presidents of the Fed's regional banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The FOMC next meets on June 29-30. At its meeting last month,  
the FOMC signaled that it was poised to begin raising interest 
rates if inflationary pressures get out of hand.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The greatest offensive performance in NCAA  
history didn't help Marshall McDougall on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida State second baseman, who hit an NCAA-record six  
consecutive home runs and drove in 16 runs on May 9, was taken in 
the 26th round Thursday by the Boston Red Sox.

<P>
	McDougall, drafted twice before -- in the 33rd round by the  
Chicago White Sox in 1996 and by the New York Yankees in the 37th 
round a year later -- was the ACC player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	McDougall, who went 7-for-7 and also set the NCAA mark with 25  
total bases in the record-breaking game at Maryland, is hitting 
.429 with 25 homers and 96 RBIs. He also had a 33-game hitting

<HEADLINE> Social Security Becoming Key Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Kasich says baby boomers need to ``take a  
hit'' to reform Social Security. Steve Forbes says politicians 
shouldn't ``put their paws on it.'' And Al Gore says it will be 
``never threatened, never taken away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the elderly vote more critical than ever, Republican and  
Democratic presidential candidates alike are promising, proposing 
and pontificating about the Depression-era retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we can win the presidency without seniors,''  
said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show that elderly voters are richer, better educated, more  
mobile, more likely to vote and increasingly more Republican than 
30 years ago. Though President Clinton won the over-60 vote in 1992 
and 1996, seniors voted Republican 54 percent to 43 percent in the 
1998 midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Male senior citizens voted Republican in 1994 and haven't  
stopped since, Lake said. Alarms sounded in Democratic quarters 
when Republicans picked up the elderly female vote in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Republicans are getting better at defending against  
Democratic attacks. GOP pollster Neil Newhouse offered another 
reason: So-called Reagan Republicans are growing older and 
Roosevelt-era ``dustbowl generation Democrats are dying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would explain why Social Security has found its way into  
the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are tired of talking about it,'' Republican  
hopeful Forbes said while campaigning Thursday in New Hampshire. 
``They want real solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Americans should be able to invest up to three-fourths  
of their Social Security taxes in private accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' multimillion-dollar advertising blitz, which began this  
week, includes a TV ad that says politicians will treat Social 
Security taxes the way a bear treats a pot of honey. ``Politicians 
are going to come along and put their paws on it,'' he warns. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic  
nomination, was in New Hampshire on Thursday, pledging his 
allegiance to both Social Security and Medicare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to stand by them and make sure they are never  
threatened, never taken away and never weakened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore backs the Clinton administration plan to use the $3  
trillion in surpluses over the next 15 years to pay down the 
national debt, boost economic growth and thus increase future tax 
revenues. He would earmark the money for Social Security and 
Medicare by placing IOUs from the general Treasury in the programs' 
trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would invest the rest, about $700 billion, in the  
stock market for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican candidates say voters don't trust the government to  
invest their savings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individuals, not the government, should be allowed to make  
their own decisions,'' former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander said 
recently. He wants 2 percent of Social Security taxes put in 
personal retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Separating himself from Democratic and GOP rivals, conservative  
activist Gary Bauer wants to give Americans a 20 percent cut in 
Social Security taxes. ``That way they can invest or spend the 
money any way they want,'' Bauer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle says Americans should be  
allowed to put up to 30 percent of their Social Security payroll 
taxes into what he calls a Freedom Account, similar to an 
Individual Retirement Account. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to strengthen it ... so we won't have all this  
political demagoguery,'' Quayle said Thursday from a campaign stop 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Wednesday that Social Security  
is little better than burying savings in a tin can. He wants to 
allow Americans to use part of their Social Security tax dollars to 
invest on their own in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush has had little to say about Social  
Security, other than that he approves of the GOP congressional 
``lock box'' legislation, designed to lock away Social Security 
funds to prevent them from being used for other than their intended 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I like the idea of individual retirement accounts,'' Bush  
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is the only  
candidate going out on a limb. 
</P>
<P>
	He is warning baby boomers that their actual Social Security  
benefits might have to be cut in exchange for letting them divert 
part of their Social Security taxes to potentially more lucrative 
but also riskier private retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do ... is to say to the baby boomers that now  
they have to sacrifice a little bit,'' Kasich said in a speech 
Thursday. ``They may not get all the government benefits and Social 
Security that they thought they would get, but in exchange for 
that, we're going to set people free.''

<HEADLINE> Lightning Strike Snarls Railroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A lightning strike Thursday at a railroad  
communications center slowed or halted rail traffic -- including 11 
Amtrak trains -- in parts of the East and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Also affected were radio communications between train crews and  
dispatchers, a CSX Transportation spokesman said. The lightning 
struck a CSX communications center in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The lightning strike at 5:30 p.m. knocked out the company's  
signal system between Chicago and Philadelphia, in portions of 
Michigan, and in the Kentucky-West Virginia coal region, said CSX 
spokesman Adam Hollingsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It slowed and, in some places, stopped rail traffic until the  
signal system could be restored,'' Hollingsworth said. ``In some 
areas, we were able to use portable signal equipment and cellular 
phones to safely keep the trains running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said about 200 trains were affected by the outage, including  
15 passenger trains operated by Amtrak and commuter lines Virginia 
Railway Express and Maryland Area Rail Commuter. CSX runs about 
1,300 trains daily through the affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak, VRE and MARC operate on CSX-maintained tracks.  
</P>
<P>
	Steven Taubenkibel, an Amtrak spokesman, said none of the 11  
affected Amtrak trains were delayed more than four hours. All of 
the delays occurred south or west of Washington, D.C., he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX restored its signal system about three hours after the  
lightning strike and expected to fully restore radio communications 
later in the evening, Hollingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX, whose corporate headquarters is in Richmond, operates about  
22,300 miles of railroad lines in 23 states, the District of 
Columbia, and Montreal and Ontario, Canada.

<HEADLINE>  Tears Shed for Fenway Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The late A. Bartlett Giamatti once compared Fenway  
Park to Mount Olympus, the pyramids at Giza and the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Except ... it was better than all those inconsequential  
places,'' wrote the scholar-turned-baseball commissioner who, like 
many American intellectuals, was given to poetry and hyperbole 
about Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway and Tiger Stadium are the oldest ballparks in the majors,  
having officially opened on the same day, April 20, 1912. Fenway is 
also the smallest, with 33,871 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Old and small, however, do not add up to major league profits.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox want a bigger park across Yawkey Way, inspiring an  
outpouring of opposition, nostalgia and, surprisingly, even support 
from some of Fenway's most faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever tears I've had for Fenway, I've long since shed,''  
said Roger Angell, an editor at the New Yorker who wrote the 
classic baseball book, ``The Summer Game.'' ``We can let some of 
these parks go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly the most treasured features of the park that writer  
John Updike once called a ``lyric little bandbox'' would be missed. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Boston Herald poll showed 49 percent of Massachusetts  
voters don't want to let go of Fenway's beloved nooks and crannies, 
its hand-operated scoreboard, the outfield bullpens where Ted 
Williams used to crack homers and the Green Monster, a 37-foot-high 
wall listed as only 315 tantalizing feet from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fenway's awesome,'' said David Doucette, a 28-year-old  
corporate banker during a cigarette break Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the old Fenway just like I liked the old Garden,'' he  
said, referring to the Boston Garden. The home of the Celtics and 
Bruins finally was torn down last year after a larger arena was 
built next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 31 percent of those polled supported tearing down the  
park, which was featured in the 1989 film, ``Field of Dreams.'' 
They'd like to get rid of the narrow seats, the obstructed views 
and the puddles of standing water when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time they did it,'' said Pedro Martinez, the team's  
Cy Young award winner. ``It's like an old man who passes away. You 
have to let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox say they need the revenue from a bigger park if  
they're ever to win a World Series, a prize that has eluded them 
since 1918. Boston, it is said, has been cursed ever since selling 
Babe Ruth to the hated New York Yankees after the 1919 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should, with that treacly `baseball is life' stuff,  
convince you otherwise,'' said filmmaker Ken Burns, a Fenway fan 
who chronicled baseball's history in a nine-part public TV series. 
``I believe baseball is life, but life is profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People actually opposed Fenway when it was built in 1912 because  
the flavor of the game would be lost without the old wooden 
grandstands, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox plan is to build a ballpark that's 35 percent bigger  
than the house that Ruth left, but -- like Baltimore's Camden Yards 
and Cleveland's Jacobs Field -- one that retains the intimacy and 
charm of older ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the Kenmore Square neighborhood that defines the  
park's quirky geometry also agree the Red Sox need a better home 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	But the neighbors, many of whom work or study at nearby colleges  
and hospitals, object mightily to the team's plans to move home 
plate 206 yards to the southwest, destroying 24 buildings in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that this new megaplex belongs in this area at  
all,'' said Stephen M. Mindich, chairman of the Phoenix Media Group 
and owner of several buildings the Red Sox want the city to take by 
eminent domain. ``It's just wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A neighborhood group called Save Fenway Park! hired an architect  
to draw up plans to renovate the ballpark by adding seats, luxury 
boxes and concession areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox officials, along with commissioner Bud Selig, have said  
saving the park is not feasible. The team has carefully cultivated 
the state's most powerful politicians, who may be asked for up to 
$200 million in assistance to buy land and build infrastructure to 
support the projected $350 million park. 
</P>
<P>
	But the preservationists are also wooing key lawmakers, who say  
they're open to saving Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate will likely intensify during the days leading up its  
starring role in the All-Star game on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox best-case scenario has a new park opening in 2003,  
but Dan Shaughnessy, The Boston Globe columnist who wrote two books 
about Fenway, thinks it will take at least five more years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like it to be forever, but I understand the reality,''  
Shaughnessy said. ``We could all be dead by the time this is 
done.''

<HEADLINE> Old Cuban Beer Brings Back Memories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Seventy-one-year-old Evaristo Junquera remembers  
nursing a glass of La Tropical beer and grooving to Cuban rhythms 
as a young man in Havana in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the life,'' he recalled fondly.  
</P>
<P>
	When Junquera was just barely out of his teens, people his age  
flocked to the gardens of La Tropical brewery every Sunday to drink 
the island-brewed lager and dance the rumba, danzon and paso doble 
to live band music. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban exiles like Junquera say taking a swig of the beer today  
unleashes the memories of the dances and romances of their youth. 
And that's exactly what Tropical's president Manny Portuondo wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an interest in all things Cuban -- that romantic,  
exotic, mystical feel,'' said Portuondo, who two years ago bought 
the trademark for La Tropical, Cuba's first and oldest beer, first 
brewed in 1888. 
</P>
<P>
	Portuondo, the son of Cuban immigrants, used the original  
formula to revive the famed and slightly bitter-tasting Cuban beer, 
and won backers that included Tropical's founding family. 
</P>
<P>
	La Tropical began appearing in U.S. stores in October 1998,  
about 40 years after Cuban President Fidel Castro's soldiers 
arrived on a Friday and commandeered the Havana brewery. 
</P>
<P>
	They ordered Cosme Blanco Herrera to relinquish ownership of the  
brewery, a thriving business that had built on its grounds along 
the banks of the Almendares River a professional baseball stadium, 
an elementary school and vast flower gardens. La Tropical was 
handed over to the brewery's gardener, who was deputized by 
Castro's government to take care of the business, which still 
produces a version of the beer. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanco-Herrera, vice president of the company and son of La  
Tropical's founder, moved to Miami with his wife, Chola, and 
children Ramon and Berta. He fully believed the Castro government 
would soon fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went to a motel on Miami Beach. We thought it was just for  
a few months,'' said Berta Blanco-Herrera-Bauchmann, who was about 
7 years old at the time. ``Then my father started working nights at 
a gas station. Then he went to work in the trust department at a 
bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they killed his hopes of ever producing the beer,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But decades later, Portuondo, a beer consultant and former  
director of marketing for St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Inc., 
stumbled upon Tropical's U.S. trademark in 1997 and felt there was 
a lucrative market for the beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of equity that it has in the Cuban community -- it's  
huge,'' he said. ``Tropical wasn't just a brewery. It was a part of 
the social culture in Cuba. La Tropical was always known for 
free-flowing beer and dances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portuondo paid $50,000 plus another $75,000 in royalties for the  
trademark. Then he scoured for investors among South Florida's 
Hispanic community, rich with Cubans who were forced to leave their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a year, Portuondo formed an ownership team that includes  
a Hispanic advertising and public relations firm and Ramon 
Blanco-Herrera, Cosme's son and the grandson of the La Tropical's 
founder. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike its predecessor, the revived La Tropical business is  
small. The company occupies a tiny office in Coral Gables and 
focuses its marketing efforts on South Florida Hispanics in their 
20s.

	Portuondo is gambling on second and third generation Cubans  
learning about the beer's rich history from their parents and 
great-grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	``You tell them La Tropical is a Cuban beer and the first thing  
they do is ask their father and their grandfather. And then papi or 
abuelo say, 'Ah Tropical, that's the beer I was drinking when I met 
your mother,''' Portuondo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portuondo says La Tropical will remain a regional beer and build  
a mystique much like Coors did by selling only in the western 
United States for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy is beginning to work. John Hastings can't get  
enough of La Tropical. In fact, he can't get it at all in St. 
Petersburg on Florida's west coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings makes the three-hour drive from St. Petersburg to Miami  
every few weeks to buy the Cuban beer -- 32 cases at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to have it,'' said Hastings, who owns Habana Cafe,  
the only business to stock the beer in the Tampa-St. Petersburg 
area. ``Customers want the beer to go. I have customers who ask to 
take a case back to Pittsburgh or New York.''

<HEADLINE>  NTSB Says Doomed Jet Was Briefed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The pilot of the American Airlines jet  
that crashed in a thunderstorm was warned twice about a dangerous 
wind shear and received more notice than usual of bad conditions 
while landing, a federal investigator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are analyzing the conversation between the tower  
and the pilot, as well as information from the plane's flight data 
recorder and evidence from the wreckage, to determine why Flight 
1420 skidded off the runway at the Little Rock airport, killing 
nine people, including the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm with hail, lightning and gusts of 75 mph hit the area  
Tuesday night just minutes before the plane made a bouncy landing 
and struck a steel walkway and approach lights at the end of the 
runway. The plane tore open and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet had been directed to land from the north because the  
airport was reporting southerly winds as the plane neared. But as 
the fierce storm moved in from the northwest, the pilot was ordered 
to approach from the southwest instead. 
</P>
<P>
	During the approach, air traffic controllers relayed regular  
updates, said George Black, a spokesman for the National 
Transportation Safety Board. Many came less than a minute apart -- 
Black also said the pilot was getting a ``play-by-play'' of the 
deteriorating conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings included word of wind up to 46 mph and two alarms  
for wind shears, sudden down bursts that can rob a plane of its 
lift, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe they got maybe even more than you would probably get  
at a busier airport, because they were getting periodic wind 
vectors,'' Black said. ``It appears they continued to get wind 
vectors after the airplane had already crashed. The level of care, 
we think, by the controller was pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black declined to say how a pilot should react to such  
information, stressing that the decision of whether or not to land 
rests with the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The captain of the jet, Richard Buschmann, had 5,500 hours of  
flight time in the MD-80 series of aircraft, which includes the 
MD-82. His colleagues said Buschmann, who helped supervise 1,800 
pilots in Chicago, had an excellent record and was unlikely to take 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	When the jet crashed, Buschmann and his crew had been on the job  
for 13 1/2 hours, having flown from Chicago to Salt Lake City and to 
Dallas before Little Rock. The airline's maximum is 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government does not specify a limit for duty time  
but caps pilots' actual flying time at eight hours in a day. They 
also must have eight hours of rest in a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators want to know whether the pilot's decision to land  
was influenced by a desire to end the long day and get the plane to 
its intended airport for the night, to prevent delays the next 
morning. Officials said the plane was not low on fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators planned to interview the injured co-pilot Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Skid marks indicate that the plane touched down 2,000 feet from  
the start of the 7,200-foot runway, which Black said was about the 
proper place to begin a landing. Investigators want to know whether 
the pilot used an anti-skidding mechanism while landing, and 
whether the runway was in good enough condition to reduce slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the plane never seemed to get a grip on the  
rain-slickened runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got worried because I knew we should have been slowing down  
and we weren't,'' Dave Ozmun said. ``I could tell he was trying to 
work the brakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors said that if the plane had not hit the steel  
structure at the end of the runway, it could have gone into the 
Arkansas River. The jet went down a rock embankment and stopped 
just short of the water. 
</P>
<P>
	At the crash site Thursday, investigators peered into the  
plane's broken nose, climbed into an engine that had broken away 
from the jet and walked through the burned, severed shell. Some 
investigators wore biohazard suits to protect them from blood and 
spilled fuel.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Orders Campaign Cutbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Strapped for cash and trailing in polls,  
Republican presidential candidate Lamar Alexander has ordered steep 
campaign cutbacks to focus his dwindling resources on Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Tennessee governor trimmed his press, legal and  
research operations to keep the campaign afloat in hopes that 
George W. Bush's front-running presidential bid falters and gives 
Alexander a surge in early voting states, advisers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their streamlining strategy requires that Alexander finish  
strong -- preferably first -- in an August straw vote in Ames, Iowa., 
and steal momentum from the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to adjust to reflect the difficulties in raising money  
in the wake of Bush mania,'' Tom Rath, a top Alexander consultant 
said in a telephone interview from New Hampshire. ``Until that 
subsides -- and it may subside when (Bush) gets out on the campaign 
trail and we see what kind of candidate he can be -- we need to do 
things to stay viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush characterized Alexander's move as one of those ``bumps in  
the road for a lot of campaigns'' and predicted that he'll have a 
few bumps of his own ``should I go for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The development underscores the potency of Bush's fledgling  
campaign. And it could foreshadow similar problems for his 10 
Republican rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough raising money for these candidates who are  
long-shots,'' said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute, a 
Washington think tank. ``Everybody is rushing to George W. Bush's 
side, hoping to coronate him. That means money is flowing in, 
endorsements are flowing in and his standing improves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before making his first campaign swing next week, the Texas  
governor leads every poll and has amassed endorsements from more 
than half the GOP governors and members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	He will raise at least $16 million in the first six months of  
1999, far more than any other GOP candidate, Bush allies say. Only 
Steve Forbes, who can dip into his family fortune, can compete with 
Bush dollar-for-dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say Alexander, a formidable fund-raiser in his failed 1996  
campaign, will raise about $2.5 million by June -- not even half of 
what he had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, a third moderate Republican competing with Bush  
and Alexander for the support of moderate donors, also has had 
money problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're having a strong second quarter, not as strong as  
Governor Bush but certainly it's going to be competitive with the 
rest of the pack,'' spokesman Ari Fleischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, one of the conservative  
candidates, has had to redirect some resources. Senior staff 
members voluntarily missed paychecks this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a plan to make sure we have adequate staffing and  
appropriate funds,'' Quayle said in a telephone interview from 
California. ``I've never known a campaign that has too much 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander began running for the presidency almost as soon as the  
1996 campaign ended. He began the year with high hopes, planning to 
raise at least $15 million to establish himself as the leading GOP 
moderate in the race. He established one of the strongest 
organizations in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bush bandwagon knocked him off track.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a very different environment that we thought we'd be  
in,'' said Rath, Alexander's top adviser. ``What will change the 
fund-raising environment is a change in the political 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rath did not provide details, but three officials familiar with  
the cutbacks said the payroll was being significantly reduced. 
Among those leaving the campaign are communications director Steve 
Schmidt and his deputy, Jeff Macedo, research director Brian Jones, 
legal counsel Kathryn Phillips and several support staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the departing staff will be retained as consultants, but  
at dramatically reduced pay rates, said the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Alexander will reduce his travel --focusing most of  
his attention on Iowa, the site of the first voting of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander is not reducing his fund-raising staff, and he  
recently added four staff members in Iowa, officials said. 
Alexander plans to use the 2000 caucuses as a springboard to the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-July, the Alexander staff will be down to 34 from a high  
of 38, according to political director Brian Kennedy. Although that 
represents a net loss of only four staffers, officials said the 
departure of press, legal and research staff involve higher-paid 
employees than those being added to beef up Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clearing, cutting back on our national campaign staff  
... to make the best use of our resources in Iowa and New 
Hampshire, where we believe this race is being run right now,'' 
Rath said. ``We're trying to be lean as we can be, putting our 
resources in those two states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks come just days after Alexander moved his  
communications staff from Nashville, Tenn., to Washington to be 
closer to the national political press corps.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Up on Weather Worry / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices advanced early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for weather 
conditions that could reduce crop production. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service's latest 10-day forecast calls for  
above-normal temperatures and normal to below-normal rainfall in 
Midwest growing regions. Hot, dry weather could hurt young crops, 
and market participants are beginning to worry a dry weather 
pattern could sharply reduce production on what is expected to be 
bumper acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also found continued support from delays in spring  
wheat plantings, which come as the window of opportunity for 
getting those crops into the ground comes to a close. Wheat also 
gained amid expectations heavy recent rainfall in the Plains may 
have reduced the quality of the winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.55 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.18 1/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.23 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 3 1/4 cents to $4.62 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .28 cent to 64.80 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .23 cent to 75.90 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .37 cent to 51.02 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .70 
cents to 53.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Ready for Triple Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In his Hall of Fame career, D. Wayne Lukas has  
trained 18 Eclipse Award winners, won 13 Breeders' Cup races and 
saddled the winners of four Kentucky Derbies and five Preakness 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won three Belmont Stakes in a row, from 1994-96, and  
that experience could work to his advantage on Saturday, when he 
sends out Charismatic in his bid to become only the 12th horse in 
history to sweep the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first couple of times I tried it, I came away very, very  
humbled and very, very distressed over the Belmont Stakes,'' said 
Lukas, whose first Belmont starter, Preakness winner Codex, 
finished seventh in the 1 1/2-mile race in 1980. ``And then we had a 
little bit of success with it, but ironically, the three times we 
won it, we won it with three different horses with three different 
characteristics. There's no how-to manual -- it's a constant 
learning process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same might be said of Lukas' handling of Charismatic, who  
along with the trainer arrived at Belmont Park on Wednesday from 
Louisville. Charismatic, who won the Derby at odds of 31-1 and the 
Preakness at 8-1, was made the 2-1 morning-line favorite and drew 
post No. 4 under Chris Antley for the $1 million Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	A winner of only one race in his first nine starts, the  
well-bred, high-priced Charismatic so befuddled Lukas that the 
trainer twice risked losing him by sending him out in claiming 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of February, Lukas changed tactics with the big  
colt and began working him hard and shortening up the time between 
his races. He finished second in an allowance on Feb. 19, second in 
the El Camino Real Derby two weeks later and then a respectable 
fourth in the Santa Anita Derby on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Santa Anita race was not conducive to Charismatic's  
success,'' said Lukas, who has saddled 14 starters in the Belmont 
since 1980. ``But the three he just won (the April 18 Coolmore 
Lexington, the Derby and the Preakness) and this one, the Belmont, 
are a much better fit. He's a horse that has responded at every 
turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a break of 21 days since the Preakness, it will be the  
first time since the Santa Anita Derby that Charismatic has not 
raced back in two weeks, but Lukas remained confident in the colt's 
ability to handle the final leg of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a very good work horse, but he responded well  
yesterday, so we're back in the race here,'' said Lukas, referring 
to Charismatic's 5-furlong work of 1:00 4-5 at Churchill Downs on 
Tuesday. ``One of the things you have to like about going into this 
race is that the horse would have the bounce-back ability -- go to 
the Derby, come back and run a big one in the Preakness, and 
hopefully have one more left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would give Lukas the one prize that has eluded him -- the  
Triple Crown, last won in 1978 by Affirmed. In all, 25 horses have 
headed into the Belmont with a chance to win racing's most coveted 
trophy, and only 11 have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic heads into the Belmont as the favorite in a 12-horse  
field that includes Derby and Preakness runner-up Menifee (7-2), 
the Bob Baffert-trained filly Silverbulletday (4-1), and Best of 
Luck (6-1), who won the Peter Pan Stakes for trainer Allen Jerkens 
with an impressive late rush in his last start. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered Wednesday were the Nick Zito-trained duo of Stephen  
Got Even (10-1) and Adonis (20-1), Lemon Drop Kid (20-1), Vision 
and Verse (20-1), Patience Game (20-1), Pineaff (30-1), Prime 
Directive (30-1) and Teletable (99-1). 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second biggest field in a Belmont with a Triple Crown  
on the line. In 1971, Pass Catcher denied Canonero II the Triple 
Crown in a 13-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lukas, along with owners Bob and Beverly Lewis, say they are  
delighted with a full field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not being cocky, but I hope everybody that has a Belmont  
horse is ready to run,'' Lukas, wearing his trademark white cowboy 
hat, said, ``so on Sunday morning, when they all talk about this, 
whether it's us, or somebody else (winning), we'll know who the 
best horse was on that day at a mile-and-a half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tabasco Cat gave Lukas his first Belmont win in 1994, and the  
trainer followed up wins from Thunder Gulch and Editor's Note. If 
Charismatic wins the Belmont and the Triple Crown, the Lewises 
would also get a $5 million bonus from series sponsor VISA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charismatic's had three great runs for us and we're delighted  
to get this far,'' Lukas said. ``If we can get one more, we'll be 
very happy, and if we don't we'll still be happy.''

	Clinton: Bombing Will Continue  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that Yugoslav  
steps to accept NATO-demanded peace terms for Kosovo are welcome, 
but are not firm enough to warrant an end to the bombing of Serbian 
targets. Clinton says until there's a ``verifiable withdrawal'' of 
Serb forces from Kosovo, the military effort will continue. The 
president says there needs to be ``clarity'' that the Serb leaders 
have accepted the international peace plan, and that it will be 
fully implemented.

	Yugoslavia Accepts Peace Plan

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic today  
accepted a peace plan for Kosovo designed to end mass expulsions of 
ethnic Albanians and 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. 
Though cloaked in language meant to make it palatable to the 
Belgrade government, the proposal contains tough conditions 
resisted up to now by the Yugoslav president. ``Yugoslavia accepts 
the document for peace brought by the highest representatives of 
the European Union and Russia,'' the official Tanjug news agency 
said. Even amid news of peace in the offing, NATO jets attacked 
communication facilities and fuel depots in Kosovo and elsewhere in 
Yugoslavia.

controversy over ``racial profiling'' by police. The biggest 
black-white difference in the survey of 12 cities: Knoxville, 
Tenn., where 37 percent of blacks said they were dissatisfied with 
police compared with 9 percent for whites. The release of the 
survey comes amid controversy that some police departments engage

from yesterday's election, the first since all-race voting in 1994

	Serbia Parliament OKs Kosovo Plan

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's parliament today approved  
an international peace plan for Kosovo, delegates said after a 
closed-door meeting. No vote totals in the 250-member assembly were 
released, but delegates said members of the second-largest Serb 
Radical Party voted against the plan. ``The Serbian parliament 
adopted conclusions accepting the G-8 principles because they 
present a basis for achieving peace and an end to the bombing,'' 
said Zarko Jokanovic of the small New Democracy party. He said the 
only dissenting votes came from the Serbian Radical Party of Deputy

arbitration panel to assess the amount due. The panel should report 
back by mid-July, delaying the implementation of any sanctions 
until then. The United States wants to impose retaliatory sanctions 
against $202 million of EU exports to compensate for lost trade. 
Canada has threatened sanctions on trade worth $51 million. The EU

	Astronauts Lock Up Space Station

<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Discovery's seven astronauts will  
bid a final farewell tonight to the international space station 
when the space shuttle pulls away from the outpost in preparation 
for Sunday's return to Earth. Discovery commander Kent Rominger and 
pilot Rick Husband planned to fire the shuttle's thrusters today to 
boost the station complex about 6 miles so it will be at the

	Mandela's Election Day Wishes Granted  
</P>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Voters gave outgoing President  
Nelson Mandela's African National Congress a decisive victory in 
South Africa's first election since the apartheid-ending vote of 
1994. Mandela, who will turn over the presidency to hand-picked 
successor Thabo Mbeki on June 16, saw his two election day wishes 
come true -- peaceful voting and an ANC victory. The South African 
Broadcasting Corp. projected the ANC would win at least a 
two-thirds majority, which would give the party unilateral power in 
Parliament to make constitutional changes. Complete results were 
not expected until late today at the earliest.

	Yeltsin Commutes Death Sentences

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree today  
commuting the death sentence for all of the convicts on death row, 
a news report said. Yeltsin had been planning to take the action 
for some time and is pushing the reluctant parliament to abolish 
the death penalty altogether. Yeltsin issued the decree today after 
the presidential commission for pardons reviewed the cases of all 
716 convicts on death row and recommended that they be given either 
life sentences or 25-year prison terms, the Interfax news agency 
said.

Solzhenitsyn spoke after being presented with the Lomonosov gold

<HEADLINE> Clippers Rookie Accused of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi is accused of raping  
a woman three weeks before the Los Angeles Clippers made him the 
NBA's No. 1 draft choice last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The former University of the Pacific student, identified only as  
``Jane Doe,'' alleges in a civil lawsuit that Olowokandi forced her 
to have sex on June 5, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, Olowokandi's agent said the player  
fathered a child with the woman while the two were ``in a college 
relationship'' and that the baby has been placed in a ``loving, 
caring and well-screened home with adoptive parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, seeks in excess of $25,000 for  
mental and physical suffering from the alleged sexual assault, 
which was not reported to police. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the adoption and for the first time, the birth mother is  
now claiming that the relations with Mr. Olowokandi were not 
consensual,'' agent Bill Duffy said in the statement reported today 
by The Record of Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffy said the woman made a ``multimillion dollar'' payment  
demand of Olowokandi. 
</P>
<P>
	``This attack on Michael Olowokandi's character is not being  
taken lightly,'' Duffy said. ``It will be handled in the proper 
legal forum, expeditiously and confidentially in order to protect 
the baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old woman opted to file a civil suit against  
Olowokandi after discovering she was pregnant, said her lawyer, 
Stewart Tabak. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was going to let it go. She had had a very long, trusting  
friendship with Mr. Olowokandi, and she didn't want these kinds of 
allegations to tarnish his future in the NBA,'' Tabak said. ``When 
she found out about the pregnancy, the situation changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tabak would only identify the woman as a recent Pacific graduate  
from Central California who is seeking work as an elementary school 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman gave up the child for adoption shortly after the baby  
was born Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In adoption papers filed with the court, Olowokandi admitted  
being the child's father, Tabak said. Olowokandi initially denied 
being the father until the mother consented to give up the baby, 
Tabak added. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi enrolled at Pacific in 1995 after picking the school  
at random from a list of U.S. colleges. Raised in London as the son 
of a Nigerian ambassador, the 7-foot-1 center became the school's 
first player to be chosen first in the NBA draft.

<HEADLINE> Jury Deadlocks on Genentech Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal jury has deadlocked on a lawsuit  
against biotech giant Genentech Inc., which was accused of stealing 
a patented DNA molecule and using it to develop a top-selling 
growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors voted 8-1 in favor of the University of California's  
claim of patent infringement, but were unable to resolve the 
impasse in six days of deliberations, jurors told reporters 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The university sought up to $400 million for lost license fees  
on Protropin, which had sales of more than $1.2 billion between 
1985 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, however, rejected Genentech's claim that the 1982  
patent was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kidd, a lawyer for Genentech, deferred comment to the  
company, which did not issue a statement. But he said the deadlock 
``shows that the university did not prove its case on 
infringement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The retrial will include claims of infringement against a second  
Genentech growth hormone, Nutropin, said Gerald Dodson, a lawyer 
for the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech, based in South San Francisco, has grabbed headlines  
recently for its research, including work on a drug that was once 
thought would allow patients with chest pain to grow tiny blood 
vessels in the heart and thus avoid surgery. It is also behind the 
pioneering breast-cancer drug Herceptin and Pulmozyme, a 
cystic-fibrosis therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's 1990 suit stems from the early years of  
Genentech. 
</P>
<P>
	UC San Francisco researchers identified a genetic pattern for  
human growth hormone in 1978. One of the researchers, Peter 
Seeburg, now a director of the Max Planck Institute for Medical 
Research in Heidelberg, Germany, testified that he quit his 
university job in November 1978, then made a midnight visit to his 
former lab and took cloned DNA samples to Genentech, where he had 
just gone to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeburg said he and another Genentech scientist tried for months  
to produce human growth hormone DNA on their own, then removed the 
cloned samples from a freezer and were able to isolate material 
that could be injected into bacteria and reproduced. He said he 
failed to disclose the source of the research in a 1979 article in 
a scientific journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech paid the university $2 million for the DNA in 1979.  
</P>
<P>
	The company attacked Seeburg as a liar and an admitted drug user  
who had told conflicting stories about the source of the product. 
His former research partner, David Goeddel, testified Genentech 
developed the hormone without using the university's DNA. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate action, Genentech agreed in April to plead guilty  
to a criminal charge and pay a $50 million fine for marketing 
Protropin for uses not approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, Switzerland's Roche Holding Ltd. announced it will  
allow Genentech Inc. to remain an independent company, agreeing to 
buy outstanding shares of the biotech giant and then make a public 
offering. Roche will remain the company's majority shareholder.

<HEADLINE> Religious Judge's Ethics Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GADSDEN, Ala. (AP) -- A judge who fought to keep a Ten  
Commandments plaque hanging in his courtroom may have violated 
ethics laws by soliciting donations from people who supported his 
crusade, a state panel has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama Ethics Commission voted 5-0 on Wednesday that there  
was probable cause to believe Roy Moore violated the state law 
prohibiting public officials from using their offices for private 
financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethics Commission Director Jim Sumner said Thursday that members  
believed Moore also spent money on more than legal expenses and 
used the ``mantle of his office'' to solicit funds. He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore denied personally raising money or receiving any money  
from the fund, which he said is maintained by his attorney. Moore 
said he is being persecuted for his defense of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Young, a former spokesman for Moore and founder of the  
``Judge Roy Moore Fund,'' said it had raised over $100,000 two 
years ago. Up-to-date figures were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission sent the case to Attorney General Bill  
Pryor, who must decide whether to take the case before a grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Pryor, a Republican who once spoke at a 1997 rally for Moore,  
said he had not seen the ethics referral and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	If charged with a crime and convicted, Moore could face removal  
from the bench, up to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's fight began in 1995 when the American Civil Liberties  
Union challenged his hand-carved courtroom display. The federal 
lawsuit eventually was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama Supreme Court in January dismissed on technical  
grounds a lawsuit filed by Pryor and former Gov. Fob James' legal 
adviser that sought to declare Moore's display legal. James had 
threatened to call out the National Guard if necessary to keep the 
plaque from being removed.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Helicopter Crash Probed </HEADLINE>

	FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) -- One crew member died Thursday after a  
crash of an Air Force special operations helicopter on a nighttime 
training mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The MH-53J Pave-Low, used to ferry troops behind enemy lines,

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Barely Mentions NASCAR Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Ask defending MBNA Platinum 400 champion Dale  
Jarrett about his best rides over The Monster Mile, and he mentions 
his victory last year only in passing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was anything but memorable because there were no patented  
Jarrett runs through the pack to the front. In fact, he won by 
default. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've run better in races than the one we won,'' said Jarrett,  
who on Sunday hopes to retain his lead in the NASCAR Winston Cup 
standings. ``We won that one on fuel mileage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it would be more accurate to say Jeff Gordon lost it for  
the same reason. The Kid wound up leading 375 of 400 laps, but had 
to stop under green for a splash of gas with eight laps remaining -- 
losing a high-percentage gamble that there would be a caution in 
the last 100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	A final gamble -- to stay out and try to stretch his fuel -- was  
not even considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the right decision last year when we pitted for  
fuel,'' Gordon said. ``We were leading the points at the time and 
couldn't take the chance of finishing toward the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when we calculated the fuel mileage, we figured we  
would fall about six laps short. That would have been too big of a 
gamble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative approach worked. Gordon wound up third,  
collected valuable points and went on to win his third series 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, beset by accidents and mechanical failures, he is  
eighth -- 354 points behind Jarrett after 12 of 34 races. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon, a three-time Dover winner who despite his troubles  
is tied with Jeff Burton for the series lead with three victories, 
won't flinch in the face of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until it's mathematically impossible for us to contend for the  
championship, then we're a contender,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's victory last year -- his first in 23 career starts at  
Dover Downs International Speedway -- is further proof that the most 
important factor on the high-banked concrete oval is to be close to 
the front in final laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, we've run well, and given ourselves a  
chance to win,'' he said. ``We feel we can go out and be 
competitive, and when we get down to the end try to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might sound like an extremely conservative approach for one  
of the hard chargers on the circuit, but Jarrett has been bitten in 
efforts far more impressive than that of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of years ago, we led a ton of laps and got down to  
the end and something happened,'' he said, alluding to an accident 
with Gordon that took both from the race ``It's just a tough race 
track. It's tough on equipment and it's tough on the driver, so you 
better be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to seeking a milestone 20th career victory, the  
42-year-old driver for Robert Yates Racing is trying to maintain a 
33-point lead over Jeff Burton, who last Sunday won the Coca-Cola 
600 in Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett is optimistic because the win last year came after  
several topnotch efforts at Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that we have something that's pretty close setup-wise  
and works well,'' he said of the chassis under his Ford. ``There 
are a number of other guys, though, mainly the ones we're racing in 
the points, who also race well here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are Gordon and Mark Martin, who last September had  
the most dominant performance in the history of the 30-year-old 
track. He led all but 20 of 400 laps while winning the MBNA Gold 
400 for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Jarrett, Martin thinks a lot about the ones that got away.  
</P>
<P>
	``There were many races at Dover that I felt we were good enough  
to win,'' said Martin, who also had an 0-for-22 start on the track. 
``We are usually very competitive there, but it's just one of those 
tracks where a win eluded us for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who set the track qualifying record of 155.966 mph last  
September, figures as the favorite to win his first pole of the 
year in qualifying today. Gordon, Jarrett, Burton, Bobby Labonte 
and Rusty Wallace probably will provide the bulk of the competition 
Sunday in the $2.3 million race.

<HEADLINE> Texaco Rejects Chevron Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merger talks between energy companies Chevron  
Corp. and Texaco Inc. were halted Wednesday amid disagreements over 
price and the complexity of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday after the markets had closed, Texaco  
said that Chevron's proposal to buy Texaco was ``unacceptable for 
several reasons, including complexity, feasibility, risk and 
price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron confirmed separately in a short statement that  
negotiations between the two had been called off. Both companies 
declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would have resulted in the world's fourth-largest  
energy company with nearly $60 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chevron-Texaco deal was seen by analysts as an important step  
for both companies to compete effectively in the rapidly 
consolidating energy market, which is now dominated by three 
giants: Royal Dutch/Shell, BP Amoco and the soon-to-be combined 
Exxon-Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil industry has seen a series of mergers of late, touched  
off by historically low prices that have crimped profits and 
necessitated deep cost cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Texaco-Chevron merger likely would have faced  
several regulatory hurdles because of overlapping operations. Adam 
Sieminski, an analyst with the Baltimore-based BT Alex. Brown Inc., 
said the companies likely would have had to sell off a number of 
their combined assets, including service stations and refineries, 
in order to receive approval from the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron was offering $70 a share, or roughly $37 billion, for  
Texaco, according to a source familiar with the negotiations -- well 
below the rumored price of $80 a share, or $42 billion. That 
represented a premium of only 9 percent above Texaco's closing 
stock price Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who would only speak on condition of anonymity, said  
the low price was a key reason why the Texaco board rejected 
Chevron's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In early afternoon trading today, Chevron was up $1.75 at $93.75  
a share on the New York Stock Exchange, where Texaco was down 
$1.06 1/4 at $63.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chevron spokesman declined to comment on the negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Chevron chairman and CEO Kenneth Derr said he  
was ``surprised that the Texaco board turned down a very 
competitive offer that included a significant price premium to 
Texaco shareholders and an opportunity to receive Chevron stock, 
with its acknowledged strong growth prospects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, the two companies would have controlled roughly 26  
percent of the refinery operations in the United States, said 
Sieminski, adding that it was likely the FTC would have made the 
companies reduce control to less than 20 percent before approving 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco already has an alliance with Shell, the U.S. subsidiary  
of Royal Dutch/Shell Group -- that venture has several overlapping 
operations with Chevron. Individually, Texaco and Chevron also 
overlap on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	While the companies were aware the deal faced regulatory  
hurdles, the source said Chevron wanted Texaco to sell off some of 
its assets, rather than vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	That proved unacceptable to Texaco.  
</P>
<P>
	Another sticking point apparently was control, as Chevron wanted  
to have its management team run the entire company, as opposed to a 
melding of the top company officials, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The management issue did not come up during board discussions  
Tuesday, the source said, but it could easily have proven to be a 
deal-killer as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chevron pretty clearly wanted (Texaco's) assets, not its  
management team,'' said Sieminski. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron, based in San Francisco, had revenue of $26 billion in  
1998 while Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., had revenue of 
$31.8 billion. The combined total of nearly $58 billion would still 
leave them well short of the world's top three energy companies, 
each of which will likely generate at least $80 billion in revenue 
this year. 
</P>

	Chevron had pursued Texaco after it failed to win a bid for  
Atlantic Richfield Co. earlier this year. Chevron lost out to BP 
Amoco, which agreed in March to buy Arco for $26.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	If the $37 billion merger had been successfully completed, it  
would have ranked among the biggest mergers ever. It would have 
been dwarfed, however, by the recent merger of Exxon and Mobil, 
which is currently worth $82 billion. That deal still faces 
regulatory approval.

<HEADLINE> Bernadette Peters: Best on Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She is a throwback to the days of Merman and  
Martin, Channing and Verdon. Bernadette Peters demonstrates in 
``Annie Get Your Gun'' why she is a star who shines best on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	In an age when television or pop recording stars are regularly  
thrown on Broadway to help shore up sagging box-office receipts, 
Peters sells tickets on the strength of her performing in front of 
an audience -- not on what she does in film, on television or on CD. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder she is the odds-on favorite to capture her second Tony  
Award Sunday night for her portrayal of Annie Oakley in the current 
revival of the 1946 Irving Berlin musical. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters took a risk, accepting a role so closely identified with  
Merman. Yet she seized those great Berlin songs -- including ``Doin' 
What Comes Natur'lly,' ``They Say It's Wonderful,'' ``Anything You 
Can Do'' and particularly ``Lost in His Arms'' -- and made them her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes Peters a star, much like the four other women  
mentioned above, is her uniqueness. You can't duplicate her. 
</P>
<P>
	Not her looks -- that peaches-and-cream complexion; that massive  
mountain of curls, threatening to overwhelm her petite frame, or 
that kewpie doll-chorus girl smile, suggesting saucy rather than 
sinful. 
</P>
<P>
	And not her voice, able to negotiate the soaring melody of a  
Berlin ballad or the intricate lyrics of a Sondheim song such as 
``It's Hot Up Here,'' the tongue-twisting opening number of 
``Sunday in the Park With George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a vulnerability to her playfulness -- in song and  
performance -- that makes audiences want to cheer her on. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics and audiences first took notice of Peters in 1968 in the  
off-Broadway musical spoof ``Dames at Sea,'' in which she played a 
character modeled after Ruby Keeler. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been flops as well as hits -- a one-night musical  
wonder called ``La Strada'' (based on the Fellini film) and a 
revival in 1971 of ``On the Town,'' in which she played Hildy, the 
taxicab driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters never really cut it on television. Quick, do you remember  
her series, ``All's Fair''? Or even in the movies, where her best 
film, ``Pennies From Heaven,'' was more of a cult hit than a 
popular success. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peters has had the fortune to have worked with three of the  
biggest composers of the last 35 years -- Jerry Herman, Sondheim 
(twice) and Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Lloyd Webber who refashioned ``Song &AMP; Dance'' for her,  
the show that first demonstrated her box office appeal, and for 
which she won her first Tony. Although the reviews were not great, 
Peters kept the show alive on Broadway for a year. Two weeks after 
she left, the musical closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbra Streisand hasn't been on Broadway in 35 years. Fans are  
still waiting for Bette Midler to appear in a new stage musical. 
Only Peters perseveres, underlining what it means to be a Broadway 
star.

<HEADLINE>  Florida Girl Wins Spelling Bee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nupur Lala, a 14-year-old Tampa, Fla., girl  
who never met a word she would not look up, correctly spelled 
``logorrhea'' on Thursday to win the 72nd annual Scripps Howard 
National Spelling Bee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would read different books and whenever I found a word I  
didn't know, I would write it down and look it up later,'' Nupur 
said as she clutched her gold trophy cup after a victory leap. ``So 
that way, if it was a future spelling bee word, I would know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nupur, who last year was eliminated in the third round of the  
national contest, beat out 248 other spellers, ages 9 to 15, to win 
$10,000, encyclopedias, two airline tickets and computer software 
this year. Her winning word, ``logorrhea,'' means pathologically 
excessive and often incoherent talkativeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just praying I would get a word that I knew,'' said the  
eighth-grader, attributing her victory in the 12th round to her 
parents' drilling, ``divine intervention'' and her natural affinity 
for word sleuthing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time she was very determined,'' said her father, Parag  
Lala, a University of South Florida computer science professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nupur, who plays violin, swims and serves on the student council  
at her middle school, beat David Lewandowski, a 14-year-old 
eighth-grader from Schererville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	David, who wins $5,000, cringed after misspelling ``opsimath,''  
a word describing a person who learns late in life. He misspelled 
it as ``o-p-s-o-m-a-t-h'' instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't expect to make it as far,'' said David, who  
had placed 39th in last year's bee. ``I was still trying to do my 
best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	April DeGideo, 13 of Ambler Pa., and George Abraham Thampy, 11,  
of Maryland Heights, Mo., tied for third. April misspelled 
``terrene,'' which means relating to life. George was stumped by 
``kirtle,'' a term for a man's above-the-knee tunic. 
</P>
<P>
	Many spellers missed their words by a letter or two. Marissa  
Toma, 13 of Bridgeville, Pa., spelled ``audace,'' a musical term 
for bold or spirited, as ``a-u-d-o-c-e'' in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, other youngsters were stumped by the likes  
of ``obtenebrate,'' ``revictualment,'' ``banns'' and ``muumuu.'' 
Geoff Misek, 13, of Goodrich, Mich., who spelled the word for the 
brightly colored Hawaiian dress as ``m-u-m-u,'' was eliminated in 
the fourth round with 55 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The contestants, most sponsored by their local newspapers, all  
won regional bees to qualify. Nupur was sponsored by The Tampa 
Tribune and David by The Times of Munster, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	The atmosphere livened as the field dwindled Thursday on the  
second day of the two-day contest. The audience in the downtown 
Washington hotel cheered for the spelling of ``hypsometer'' and 
``machicolation,'' ``apocope'' and ``akropodion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyra Davies said she did not feel too bad about spelling  
``roleo'' as ``r-o-l-l-e-o'' and getting out in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having a lot of fun,'' said the 13-year-old from  
Lexington, Ky. ``I would have had to guess at a lot of these words, 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Smiley's departure from competition was a bit more  
dramatic. After missing ``cucurbit,'' the 13-year-old from Kokomo, 
Ind., made a short bow for the television cameras posted near the 
stage. She then ran from the ballroom shouting, ``Mom! Mom!''

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Sues UBS, Chase Manhattan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sumitomo Corp. has sued the banking companies UBS  
AG of Switzerland and Chase Manhattan Corp. of the United States, 
demanding compensation for loans provided a former employee who 
caused huge losses from illegal copper trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge trading company said it filed a lawsuit today against  
UBS and employees at the Tokyo District Court seeking $230 million 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo said it also filed a lawsuit yesterday against Chase  
Manhattan in U.S. District Court in New York seeking $532 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chase views these claims by Sumitomo as entirely unwarranted  
and Chase intends to defend the case vigorously,'' said Ken Herz, a 
spokesman for the New York-based bank. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS spokeswoman Monika Dunant in Basel said the Swiss bank  
contests any compensation claim by Sumitomo in relation to past 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS and Chase Manhattan lent Yasuo Hamanaka, the former Sumitomo  
trader, funds for his illegal copper dealings without a funding 
contract, although both knew Hamanaka did not have the authority to 
receive such credit, the lawsuits say. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo earlier paid $532 million to Chase Manhattan and $257.4  
million to UBS to cover credit extended to Hamanaka. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sumitomo accused the banks of ``illegal behavior'' and is  
now seeking to recover the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to take appropriate action, including legal  
action, to recover damages suffered by our company,'' Sumitomo said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1996, Sumitomo said it lost $2.6 billion from  
Hamanaka's unauthorized copper trading. It has since paid millions 
of dollars in class action lawsuits filed by copper traders and 
others over trading in Japan and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamanaka was sentenced to eight years in prison in March 1998 by  
the Tokyo District Court on forgery and fraud convictions. Sumitomo 
has filed a separate civil lawsuit against Hamanaka.

<HEADLINE> Kathy Bates Has Purse Ripped Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man walked off with Kathy Bates' purse as a  
mechanic changed a flat tire on the ``Misery'' star's Jaguar 
convertible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscar-winning actress had just withdrawn some cash from an  
ATM on Wednesday when she noticed the flat tire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A man offered to help, but she declined and called a tow truck.  
Ms. Bates got out of the car when the truck arrived, and she left 
the purse inside, said police spokesman Lt. Anthony Alba. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who offered to help apparently took her purse and walked  
away, Alba said. Police said he may have flattened the tire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates also appeared in ``Primary Colors'' and ``Fried Green  
Tomatoes.''

<HEADLINE> Kasich Helped Bury Supporter's Dog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Would-be presidents have done lots of  
unusual things on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. But Rep. 
John Kasich probably is the first to dig a grave -- for a dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Kaiser accidentally ran over her dog, Magic, a 13-year-old  
black Shetland sheepdog, as she hurried to get some last-minute 
things for a coffee chat she was hosting for the Ohio Republican at 
her Amherst home May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started backing up and I heard this little thump, and I got  
out of my car and there he was,'' Kaiser said in a telephone 
interview Thursday. ``He looked at me and then he died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser said she stashed Magic's body in the barn and covered him  
with a towel. 
</P>
<P>
	When he heard what had happened, Kasich took Kaiser outside and  
asked if she wanted to cancel the gathering. Not a chance, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate lingered until all the  
guests had left, then said it was time to tend to Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not leaving here without burying this dog because if I do  
my wife will divorce me after she kills me,'' Kaiser said Kasich 
told her when she protested his offer to help. 
</P>
<P>
	And so Kasich and Kaiser's husband, Christopher, grabbed shovels  
from the barn and dug a grave for Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I would see the other candidates doing that,''  
she said. ``When you watch them on television, they always seem so 
busy. He wasn't too busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That Kasich is keen for canines should come as no surprise to  
anyone who visits his campaign Internet site, which prominently 
displays photos of his dog, Penny Bird.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Sets Sights Beyond PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. made a pair of moves in  
an effort to deliver its Web content beyond personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! acquired Palo Alto, Calif.-based Online Anywhere, a  
provider of Internet delivery services for televisions, personal 
digital assistants and wireless devices, including pagers and data 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-stock transaction is valued at approximately $80  
million, according to a Yahoo! statement released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Clara-based Yahoo!, which operates the Internet directory  
service Yahoo.com, already was using Online Anywhere's technology 
to format its content for display on non-PC devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! also entered an agreement with Kansas City, Mo.-based  
Sprint PCS to offer Web content to Sprint's 3 million wireless 
phone subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will deliver news, weather, sports, e-mail,  
horoscopes, and calendar and address book functions to Sprint PCS 
phone users. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to making Yahoo! services available to users  
of any device, from any access point, at any time,'' said Ellen 
Siminoff, vice president of Yahoo! business development and 
strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS, wholly-owned by Sprint Corp., and Yahoo! expect to  
make Sprint PCS My Yahoo! services available by the fourth quarter 
of this year.

<HEADLINE>  Jones-Johnson To Fight for Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. and Reggie Johnson don't need  
Saturday night's light heavyweight title fight. That's why they 
want it so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a matter of me needing Roy or Roy needing me,''  
Johnson said. ``We've both got titles. It was a matter of us 
needing each other because we both want to add `undisputed' to our 
title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones holds the WBC and WBA championships, while Johnson has the  
IBF belt. Their bout will unify the division for the first time 
since 1985, when Michael Spinks held the titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one who wins this can say he's the baddest fighter in the  
world, and anyone who doesn't believe it will have to fight to 
prove it,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 32, is 39-5-1 with 24 KOs. He is 7-4 in championship  
fights, with all his losses in close, disputed decisions. His last 
fight was Feb. 27 when he won a 12-round unanimous decision against 
top-ranked contender Will Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be the toughest fight of my life,'' Johnson  
said. ``I have a lot of respect for Roy. I know how tough he is, 
how good he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The respect goes both ways. Jones' father trained both fighters  
for a while in 1991, a move that drove father and son apart in a 
bitter dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``What my father didn't understand was that it was inevitable  
that we would one day meet in the ring,'' Jones said Thursday. ``I 
knew it right away. I knew we were both headed for the championship 
and we'd have to settle it between us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was trained by his father throughout his amateur and early  
pro career. But he called his father's decision to bring Johnson 
into his training program the final straw that broke their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to bring someone in to get me ready for the race,  
it shouldn't have been the horse I was going to have to run 
against,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and his father didn't speak to each other for several  
years. Although they have since reconciled and now talk, Jones said 
many of their ties remain broken. He doesn't blame Johnson, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all. We both have a lot of respect for each other,''  
Jones said. ``There aren't going to be any mind games or any other 
kind of games. There's just going to be some big boxing. This is 
going to be the real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, is 39-1 with 33 knockouts. He has successfully  
defended his WBC title three times, the WBC championship once. He 
won his last fight by stopping New York City policeman Rick 
Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscing about their days as sparring partners, Jones said he  
remembered the damage Johnson could do with either hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very heavy-handed, knockout power in either hand,''  
Jones said. ``He's a big puncher, a good defensive fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Jones was a guy who could hurt you fast and often.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has extremely fast hands, he's very smart,'' Johnson said.  
``He's a little flashier than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other title fights are on Saturday night's card. IBF  
cruiserweight champion Arthur Williams will make his first defense 
against Vasilly Jirov, the fourth-ranked challenger, and IBF 
lightweight champion Roberto Garcia will defend against No. 2 
Derrick Gainer.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Exchange Names New CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Pacific Exchange has appointed former  
mutual fund executive Philip DeFeo as chief executive, succeeding 
Robert Greber, who will remain as chairman of the nation's 
third-largest stock options market. 
</P>
<P>
	Until February, DeFeo, 53, was president and chief executive of  
Van Eck Associates Group, a New York fund company with $1.5 billion 
in assets that specializes in commodities and international stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFeo's appointment followed the recent resignations of the  
Pacific Exchange's president, Warren Langley, and chief financial 
officer, Kim Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The new CEO arrives at a critical juncture for the Pacific  
Exchange. Since the collapse of its pending merger with the Chicago 
Board Options Exchange earlier this year, it has been updating its 
technology to replace its traditional trading floor system, where 
brokers shout out buy and sell orders, with a computer-based 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFeo said he plans to study all alternatives for the exchange's  
future. ``Everything will be under review,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, DeFeo said he will re-examine negotiations under  
way with the brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald to start a computer-based 
stock options trading system. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, Cantor would provide its electronic  
trading technology and the Pacific Exchange would move a portion of 
the 800 options it handles from its San Francisco trading floor to 
the joint venture.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Majority Leader Dick Armey is suggesting  
that economic boycotts as well as federal legislation have a role 
in combating ``the violence of crudity'' that pervades modern pop 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do need to hold Hollywood, the music industry and video  
game makers accountable...,'' the Texas Republican wrote in a 
letter to all GOP House Republicans following the shootings at a 
Colorado high school. ``Demanding better warning labels and 
organizing boycotts of the most egregious products are obviously 
first steps,'' wrote the former economics professor. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the shootings, Armey said, ``We should not simply  
blame the guns.... Nor should we rush to impose government 
censorship on Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Censorship would not have deterred these mass murderers. And  
more importantly, we have to admit that somebody out there is 
paying for all that gratuitous sex and violence on the screen. 
Somebody out there is permitting their children to watch 20 hours 
of television a week. Somebody out there is letting their children 
see 200,000 fictional murder by the time they're 18.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Armey wrote, ``We have no more important duty than to  
replace today's moral relativism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The House will debate the issue later this month, when  
Republicans bring to the floor legislation to attack juvenile 
crime. Gun control proposals are certain to be part of the bill, as 
they were in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey, in his letter, called for a few new gun-related  
provisions, including the so-called juvenile Brady bill that would 
bar juvenile violent felons from ever owning a gun. He also 
suggested letting judges, police officers and others crack down on 
young offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	But he took no position on other issues likely to come up on the  
House floor, including Senate-passed measures requiring that safety 
locks be sold with all new guns and background checks be performed 
for all firearms sales at gun shows and pawn shops. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore will pick up yet another endorsement from  
a congressional Democrat next week in his quest for the 
presidential nomination, the latest turn in a checkered 
relationship with Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost a year ago, Gore traveled to Rhode Island for an  
appearance regarding Social Security and Kennedy was not invited to 
speak. Kennedy felt snubbed and let it be known; Gore's aides 
countered that the scheduling decisions had been made by others. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was long ago, when Kennedy's patron, Rep. Richard  
Gephardt of Missouri, was preparing to challenge Gore for the 
presidential nomination. These days, Gephardt is firmly in Gore's 
corner and Kennedy is chairman of the party's campaign committee, 
which is trying to win a Democratic majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy will bestow his endorsement next weekend, say Democratic  
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, when Gore returns to 
Rhode Island for a fund-raising event to benefit House candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	That event will be part of an intensive weekend of Democratic  
fund-raising to benefit House Democratic candidates. On Thursday 
night, President Clinton is scheduled to attend an event in 
Washington. On Friday, while Gore is in Rhode Island, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton is to join Gephardt in St. Louis for yet another 
fund-raising event. In all, officials say they hope to pull in $2 
million for House candidates over the two days.

<HEADLINE>  Jones-Johnson To Fight for Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. and Reggie Johnson don't need  
Saturday night's light heavyweight title fight. That's why they 
want it so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a matter of me needing Roy or Roy needing me,''  
Johnson said. ``We've both got titles. It was a matter of us 
needing each other because we both want to add `undisputed' to our 
title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones holds the WBC and WBA championships, while Johnson has the  
IBF belt. Their bout will unify the division for the first time 
since 1985, when Michael Spinks held the titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one who wins this can say he's the baddest fighter in the  
world, and anyone who doesn't believe it will have to fight to 
prove it,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 32, is 39-5-1 with 24 KOs. He is 7-4 in championship  
fights, with all his losses in close, disputed decisions. His last 
fight was Feb. 27 when he won a 12-round unanimous decision against 
top-ranked contender Will Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be the toughest fight of my life,'' Johnson  
said. ``I have a lot of respect for Roy. I know how tough he is, 
how good he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The respect goes both ways. Jones' father trained both fighters  
for a while in 1991, a move that drove father and son apart in a 
bitter dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``What my father didn't understand was that it was inevitable  
that we would one day meet in the ring,'' Jones said Thursday. ``I 
knew it right away. I knew we were both headed for the championship 
and we'd have to settle it between us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was trained by his father throughout his amateur and early  
pro career. But he called his father's decision to bring Johnson 
into his training program the final straw that broke their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to bring someone in to get me ready for the race,  
it shouldn't have been the horse I was going to have to run 
against,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and his father didn't speak to each other for several  
years. Although they have since reconciled and now talk, Jones said 
many of their ties remain broken. He doesn't blame Johnson, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all. We both have a lot of respect for each other,''  
Jones said. ``There aren't going to be any mind games or any other 
kind of games. There's just going to be some big boxing. This is 
going to be the real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, is 39-1 with 33 knockouts. He has successfully  
defended his WBC title three times, the WBC championship once. He 
won his last fight by stopping New York City policeman Rick 
Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscing about their days as sparring partners, Jones said he  
remembered the damage Johnson could do with either hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very heavy-handed, knockout power in either hand,''  
Jones said. ``He's a big puncher, a good defensive fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Jones was a guy who could hurt you fast and often.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has extremely fast hands, he's very smart,'' Johnson said.  
``He's a little flashier than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other title fights are on Saturday night's card. IBF  
cruiserweight champion Arthur Williams will make his first defense 
against Vasilly Jirov, the fourth-ranked challenger, and IBF 
lightweight champion Roberto Garcia will defend against No. 2 
Derrick Gainer.

<HEADLINE> Jet Crash Claims Half of Tour Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUSSELLVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- In a postcard to her co-workers, Judy  
Thacker gushed about how her tour group stayed in a real Welsh 
castle and watched peacocks strut majestically around the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wales is more spectacular than I ever imagined &AMP; tomorrow we  
head for Scotland,'' she wrote in a rolling, joyful script. She 
added: ``I may see you before this arrives!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The card arrived Tuesday, just a few hours before Mrs. Thacker  
and five other members of her 12-person group of widows and older 
couples died in the crash of an American Airlines jet at the Little 
Rock airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last sentence is what gets you,'' said James Biggers,  
president of the River Valley Bank, where Mrs. Thacker was a vice 
president in charge of consumer lending. He had known her for 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials did not release the names of the nine people killed in  
the crash of American Flight 1420. But friends and relatives of the 
tour group members said six of the victims were in the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of them -- Mrs. Thacker, 53, Betty Ingram, 69, Sue Gray, 88,  
and Gordon and Joyce McLerran, 64 and 65 -- were from Russellville, 
a town of 25,000 in the shadow of the Ozark Mountains, along the 
banks of the Arkansas River. The sixth member, Mary Couch, 68, was 
from nearby Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	They were part of a group that traveled to Italy last year and  
were already planning a cruise to Alaska next year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the group's survivors, real estate developer Arnold  
Bowden, 63, talked about his friends Thursday in a voice still deep 
and slightly hoarse from inhaling the smoke that filled the burning 
plane. His left arm was still crooked from a blow that knocked the 
watch off his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really were decimated in our travel group,'' Bowden said  
from his cliffside home overlooking the town. ``We lost my best 
friend and fishing buddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the town lost some of its most active citizens.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon McLerran, a retired state chemist from Corpus Christi,  
Texas, who moved to Russellville in 1986, was president of the 
local arts council and past president of the Kiwanis Club. He and 
his wife, an avid potter who was proud of her Tex-Mex cooking, were 
researching their Scottish roots during the two-week tour of 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a tremendous sense of humor, had no fewer than 150  
Aggie jokes,'' Bowden said. ``A true Texan -- outgoing and 
loudspoken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ingram, a retired college secretary, was divorced and had no  
children. Ellis Hottinger, director of Shinn Funeral Home, said Ms. 
Ingram lived for her nephews and nieces, her books -- and these 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think these trips were mainly her hobby,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gray taught Sunday School at All Saints Episcopal Church and  
also embroidered the church altar linens. She would share a room on 
the trips with Ms. Couch. Both were single -- Ms. Couch was 
divorced, Ms. Gray widowed -- and both had taught school. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, `I sure am glad Sue and I are rooming together,  
because we take care of each other,''' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	He could hardly believe that just a few hours before the crash,  
he had watched Joyce McLerran sleeping on the floor at the 
Dallas/Fort Worth airport while her husband snored in the chair 
above her. On the flight into Dallas, they had nervously joked 
about how high the plane had to fly to get over the storm clouds -- 
so high that the potato chip bags were puffed up like balloons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gordon asked how much higher we could go,'' Bowden said. ``I  
said, `I don't think too much higher till these Ruffles explode.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said everyone was so tired from their trip -- the  
McLerrans stayed up late the night before the flight to catch a 
performance of ``Othello'' in Stratford on Avon -- that they didn't 
talk much on the flight in. When the plane hit the ground, there 
was no time for last words. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't see anything but fire and smoke in front of me,''  
he said, his tired blue eyes widening. ``There's no time to 
consider your friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said he smelled fresh air to his right, grabbed the hand  
of his wife, Katherine, and walked toward the wing exit. Along the 
way, he grabbed a 2-year-old girl as her mother struggled with her 
other child. 
</P>
<P>
	He never saw his friends again.  
</P>
<P>
	Downtown at the bank Thursday, Mrs. Thacker's rust-colored  
Mercedes sat in the parking lot with the keys locked inside. Her 
husband, Jack, 57, was seriously injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before there was official word of her death, workers  
cleared Mrs. Thacker's personal items off her desk and replaced 
them with a bouquet of pink, white and yellow spring flowers, with 
a card alongside: 
</P>
<P>
	``Judy -- Smiling, happy, kind, generous, energetic and beautiful  
inside and out -- a wonderful way to be remembered.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Agassi Favorite Among Semifinalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Three players who might have thought their best  
days were behind them, and one whose seem yet to come, make up the 
unlikely semifinalists at this year's French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, the only seeded player left in the men's event,  
faces Dominik Hrbaty, and Andrei Medvedev takes on Fernando 
Meligeni in Friday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, 29, is closing in on the record books.  
</P>
<P>
	A championship win here would make him only the fifth man to win  
all four Grand Slams, and the first since Rod Laver in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Such greats as Boris Becker, Jimmy Connors, Stefan Edberg and  
Pete Sampras have won the other three Grand Slams, but slipped up 
on the clay of Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, gets great satisfaction just from being in the last  
four. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me the opportunity to do something I haven't done,  
which is always special,'' the 13th-seeded player said. ``Getting 
to the semifinals on a surface that has presented many obstacles 
for me in recent years leaves me to believe I can do much more. 
This has been nothing short of a great chapter in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Agassi fails, an unseeded player will be champion for only  
the fourth time in Roland Garros history. Marcel Bernard won in 
1946, Mats Wilander in 1982 and Gustavo Kuerten two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi is the favorite, but needs to be at his very best to  
advance to Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	Hrbaty beat top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov and ninth-seeded  
Marcelo Rios on the way to his first Grand Slam semifinal. The 
21-year-old has won five out of six matches against top 10 players 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hrbaty was voted best newcomer by his fellow professionals in  
1996, but has taken time to break through. His best previous Grand 
Slam performance came in the 1997 Australian Open, where he reached 
the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won his only match against Agassi, at the Lipton  
Championships in March. 
</P>
<P>
	But Agassi said he was not fully fit in that match.  
</P>
<P>
	``While it was a good performance on his part, I hadn't  
recovered from the hamstring injury I had,'' he said. ``We are both 
playing a lot better than we did then. I am anticipating a very 
brutal match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 54th-ranked Meligeni and Medvedev, ranked 100th, compete in  
the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	At 28, Meligeni is a tour veteran making his first appearance in  
a Grand Slam semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev, who beat Pete Sampras in the second round, was ranked  
as high as No. 4 back in 1994 before tumbling in the rankings.

<HEADLINE> Bug Zappers Found To Spread Viruses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Researchers have some advice for folks gathering  
goodies for picnics this summer: Zap that electric bug zapper to a 
remote corner of the yard. 
</P>
<P>
	James Urban, a microbiologist at Kansas State University, says  
zappers and food should be kept apart because while they are 
killing insects, the devices can spread bacteria or viruses up to 
six feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it means we should not use bug zappers in certain  
areas,'' Urban said Thursday. ``It shouldn't be hanging above the 
condiment tray at your picnic. You might be careful having a bug 
zapper in areas where small children's toys might be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The devices use light to attract pests to an electrified metal  
grid and then electrocute them with a sizzling sound of snap, 
crackle and pop. 
</P>
<P>
	Urban presented the unpublished findings to the American Society  
for Microbiology on Wednesday. He and Alberto Broce, an 
entomologist at Kansas State, gave flies specific doses of 
microorganisms. They found that a zapper could be expected to 
spread one of every 4,000 viruses or bacteria that were on a fly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be an alarmist,'' Urban said. ``Everything we  
touch has bacteria on it, and we obviously are surviving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this going to push us over the edge and make us sick? I  
don't think it's as risky as unsafe sex or something like that,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers began the work about three years ago and plan  
more experiments this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time scientists have zinged the zappers. In a  
1994 study, a group found that only a tiny fraction of the 
six-legged victims of the traps were bugs that bite people. Many of 
the insects that were killed were the types that provide needed 
food for fish and birds, while others were beneficial bugs that 
attack other, more annoying insects, they found.

<HEADLINE> Feds Warn of Mad Cow Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Some frequent American travelers to  
Britain should be prohibited from donating blood as an extra safety 
precaution against the possible spread of a fatal brain illness 
linked to mad cow disease, a Food and Drug Administration advisory 
panel says. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel made its decision in a 12-9 vote Wednesday, even  
though it had no evidence that the deadly illness, a new variant of 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, could spread through blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Panel members stressed that the precaution doesn't mean frequent  
tourists are at risk of getting the illness just because they ate 
British beef, where mad cow disease resides. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists simply don't know enough about this new illness  
that has struck at least 39 Britons who apparently ate beef 
contaminated with mad cow disease to say for sure that it could 
never be transmitted through blood. Some experiments have allowed 
scientists to transmit similar illnesses to animals through blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day you find out there is (human) transmission, you're  
years too late'' to protect the blood supply, warned Dr. Linda 
Detwiler of the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	If the FDA follows its advisers' recommendation, the next  
question is how long someone had to visit Britain to be deemed 
enough of a risk to refuse their blood. 
</P>
<P>
	That's crucial because an American Red Cross study found almost  
23 percent of recent blood donors had traveled to Britain at least 
once between 1980 and 1996. From the late 1980s through 1996, 
Britain battled a mad cow disease epidemic in its cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory panel said the concern is not a typical week-long  
tourist trip. A majority of panelists said Americans who spent a 
total of more than six months in Britain between 1980 and 1996 
should be blocked from donating blood -- a recommendation that, if 
followed, could cut the U.S. blood supply by 2.2 percent, the Red 
Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mad cow disease is an infection that kills by literally eating  
holes in the brain tissue of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in 1 million people around the world gets a similar  
brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. Although 
CJD sometimes is hereditary, usually its cause is not known. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry about blood stems from Britain's discovery in the  
mid-1990s that some people caught a new strain of the disease 
called ``new variant CJD'' apparently by eating beef infected with 
mad cow disease. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known mad cow disease in U.S. cattle, and the United  
States has not allowed importation of British beef for over a 
decade. No American has caught new variant CJD. 
</P>
<P>
	But because these brain diseases can incubate for years without  
causing symptoms, some scientists say the possibility exists that 
years from now they will discover a link between blood transfusions 
and infection. Doctors are closely watching Britain to see if that 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian health officials last month decided they too would  
determine how to block blood donations from certain Canadian 
travelers.

<HEADLINE> Hot Dogs Blamed for Listeria Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT, Mich. (AP) -- A federal investigation of a food  
poisoning outbreak that left 15 dead concludes the source was hot 
dogs from a Bil Mar meat plant, and recommends stronger steps 
against food-borne bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control report said the same rare strain  
of bacteria that caused the outbreak was found in packages of Bil 
Mar hot dogs made at the Zeeland plant. It said the bacteria was 
likely present in the plant five months before the outbreak began. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeffrey Smith, a spokesman for Bil Mar parent Sara Lee  
Corp., said the report ``indicates there is some uncertainty about 
the cause of the outbreak,'' and said the company was taking 
several steps to improve safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meats  
in December in one of the largest meat recalls ever because of 
suspected contamination with a rare strain of the bacteria listeria 
monocytogenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria-contaminated products from the plant have been linked  
to 100 illnesses in 22 states, as well as 15 deaths and six 
miscarriages or stillbirths. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC scientists found listeria in a hot dog package with a  
sell-by date of June 1998, leading them to believe the bacteria was 
in the plant as early as April 1998 -- but not in levels high enough 
to cause an outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the July 4 weekend, a refrigeration unit in a room where  
hot dogs were readied for packaging was removed. The unit had to be 
chopped up to get it out of the building, and the CDC believes the 
pieces spread the bacteria through the plant as they were taken 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said most of the plant's own tests for equipment  
contamination came back positive after July 4, and that the cooling 
unit was in the only area where hot dogs came in contact with 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
	The first cases of the outbreak occurred in August 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	``Following a voluntary recall by the manufacturer, the number  
of listeriosis cases caused by the outbreak strain decreased 
abruptly, further confirming Plant Q (the Bil Mar plant) products 
as the sole source of the outbreak,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith pointed to parts of the report that said some cases could  
not be explained. The CDC said it was possible there were a few 
listeria infections that were unrelated to Bil Mar foods. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago lawyer who represents several people suing Sara Lee  
for injuries and deaths they allege were caused by contaminated 
meat products said the report bolsters his case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It highlights the fact that this company, this particular  
plant, knew of an increase in bacteria on their product ... before 
the recall,'' Kenneth Moll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the company thoroughly cleaned its machinery after  
every positive test for bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The report contained 15 recommendations for meat plants, the  
U.S. Department of Agriculture and the CDC. It said ready-to-eat 
meats, such as hot dogs and deli foods, should be stamped with 
``use-by'' dates, rather than ``sell-by'' dates. 
</P>
<P>
	Outbreak victims who ate hot dogs claimed to have cooked them  
before eating them. The CDC said it was likely the hot dogs 
contaminated other foods during preparation, and said meat plants 
should treat hot dogs and other ready-to-eat meats after packaging, 
with heat or irradiating, to kill bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bil Mar plant continues to make deli meats, but has shut  
down its hot dog line for six to nine months for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the recall, Sara Lee has hired a government food safety  
expert and promised to make several improvements in food safety. 
The company also is contributing $1 million for food safety 
research at Georgetown University's Center for Food and Nutrition 
Policy.

<HEADLINE> Companies Recall Stairway Gates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --North States Industries, Inc. is recalling  
about 3,200 stairway gates because the lock can fail when the gate 
is shaken and could result in children falling down the stairs, 
according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis-based company has received one report of the  
lock on the gate failing. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled gates -- intended for use with children from six  
months to 24 months of age -- are white plastic and a little over 2 
feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	Ames, Ann &AMP; Hope, Hambleton &AMP; Carr and Value City department  
stores sold the gates from March through April of this year for 
about $15. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should stop using these gates and return them to the  
store where purchased for a refund. They can also call the company 
at 800-848-8421 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. EDT Monday through 
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Case Winds Toward an End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the government's antitrust case against  
Microsoft Corp. winds toward an end in federal court, it seems at 
times that company chairman Bill Gates and his own lawyers are 
reading from different scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, for at least the second time during the high-stakes  
trial, comments by Gates have undercut his lawyers' arguments. In 
the latest instance, as Microsoft argued in court that it faces 
rigorous competition from new technology devices, Gates wrote in 
Newsweek that personal computers -- which depend almost exclusively 
on his company's Windows operating system -- will remain the 
industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's mixed message -- telling the judge one thing but  
saying something else outside the courtroom -- was immediately noted 
by the government's lead lawyer and a witness this week, as the 
trial resumed after a three-month recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The government lawyer, David Boies, referred to ``a cleavage of  
what the lawyers want to argue in court and what the company 
says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court Wednesday, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara tried to  
minimize the significance of the billionaire chairman's apparently 
contradicting his legal team's arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't this exactly what you'd expect Mr. Gates to say, given  
his company's business?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument that Microsoft faces stiff competition from a new  
generation of technology devices is intended to persuade the judge 
that the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust despite 
complaints about Microsoft's alleged aggression toward software 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his Newsweek article, Gates wrote that personal computers  
would work ``in tandem with other cool devices'' rather than be 
replaced by them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given my job, it's hardly surprising that I'd say this,''  
Gates wrote, without mentioning his company's legal problems. ``But 
I'm betting Microsoft's future on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven paragraphs, Gates -- famous for his business acumen and  
his vast fortune -- managed to give the government another club to 
use against Microsoft in the courtroom. Microsoft even included a 
prominent link to the article on its corporate Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft indicated it will argue today that it faces threats  
from other upstart rivals, such as the niche Linux operating system 
software rapidly gaining popularity but still significantly behind 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But, again, the company's lawyers will wrestle with comments  
Gates made outside the courtroom. He told a technology conference 
in April that Linux's impact ``will be fairly limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's witness this week in the new phase of the  
trial, economist Franklin Fisher, maintains that Microsoft's 
influence is not threatened by any new devices or emerging 
technologies, such as Internet TV, powerful game consoles or 
handheld appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that's likely to happen, and according to a  
recent Newsweek article, neither does Bill Gates,'' Fisher told the 
judge earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at least the second time that comments from Microsoft's  
top executive outside the courtroom stood in sharp contrast to the 
company's position inside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the trial, economist Richard Schmalensee explained to  
Boies under oath why he couldn't provide precise figures about 
Microsoft's profits, saying the company's decidedly low-tech 
accounting techniques ``do not always rise to the level of 
sophistication one might expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Boies pressed him, Schmalensee added: ``They record  
operating system sales by hand on sheets of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, Gates described in his newly published book how  
Microsoft tracks sales figures digitally by product and country, to 
determine exactly how sales compare with budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``When figures are in electronic form, ... workers can study  
them, annotate them, look at them in any amount of detail,'' Gates 
wrote in ``Business at the Speed of Thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Boies said he never believed  
Schmalensee's explanation about paper ledgers at Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Gates,'' Boies said. ``This time.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Awaits Latest 'Star Wars' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Kabuki-style makeup. Samurai-style swordplay. A  
director who confesses a love for the work of Akira Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Wars'' space fantasy series holds a special appeal  
for the Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic 
samurai films. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ``Star Wars'' movie was inspired in part by ``The  
Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by 
Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans in Japan were quick to find elements of Japan's feudal  
warlord culture in the 1977 movie, citing everything from the 
design of villainous Darth Vader's costume to the samurai-style 
swordplay, albeit with lightsabers. 
</P>
<P>
	Director George Lucas, in Tokyo on Wednesday to plug the new  
film, acknowledged his debt to Kurosawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just a master that you work toward (hoping) that someday  
you can reach that level,'' Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, audiences here won't get a look at the film until  
opening day, July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened in  
the United States and Canada on May 19, it won't be released in 
many Asian and European nations until mid- to late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Japanese fans, that's just too much to ask.  
</P>
<P>
	Hiroshi Kobayashi, a 27-year-old graduate student whose business  
card reads ``Star Wars Evangelist,'' was one of 30 Japanese fans 
who flew to Los Angeles last month to see the new film. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of Japanese subtitles made the dialogue hard to follow,  
but he still gave it a thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a great visual impact,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After its release in the United States, ``The Phantom Menace''  
earned more than $205 million in a record 13 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts here are optimistic. Most expect it to go over  
well with the Japanese audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshio Furusawa, 20th Century Fox's marketing director in Japan,  
said pre-release ticket sales have been strong and that demand for 
4,000 passes to a ``Star Wars'' fan event held last month exceeded 
availability by 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie looks like it was made for audiences in Japan,''  
said Japanese film critic Yuichi Tanuma, who attended a special 
showing for the media last month in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said ``The Phantom Menace'' has touches of Japanese influence  
in the Kabuki-style facial makeup sported by the evil Darth Maul 
and Zen-like meditation practiced by the heroic Jedi knights.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Japanese Stocks Down / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Renewed rumors that China may devalue the yuan  
pushed the dollar higher against the yen today. Tokyo share prices 
dropped on profit-taking after a three-day rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.54 yen at late afternoon, up 1.00 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.33 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 190.49 points,  
or 1.16 percent, closing the day's trading at 16,227.50 points. The 
index had gained 9.49 points, or 0.06 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's advance in Asia came after  
market rumors that China might devalue the yuan emerged once again. 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Bank of China, China's central bank, reaffirmed the  
government's commitment to a stable currency, with a spokesman 
dismissing market talk of plans to devalue the yuan as ``rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Beijing have repeatedly pledged not to devalue its  
currency, more than a year of market rumors to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor supporting the dollar was a report in the  
Japanese Nihon Keizai newspaper today that the Bank of Japan, 
Japan's central bank, will keep a zero interest-rate policy until 
clear signs of a broad rise in prices emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's strength also derived from a belief among  
investors that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
to cool the economy, traders said. Higher interest rates make a 
currency more attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 121.55 yen and 121.99 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 125.95 yen, up from  
124.78 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei index dropped as investors took  
profits following three straight days of gains. There were few 
incentives to motivate buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 396  
million shares, down from Wednesday's turnover of 434 million 
shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers 794 to 373, with 128 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Some market players retreated to the sidelines waiting for U.S.  
employment data, due out Friday in Washington, for clues on the 
direction of U.S. interest rates and stock prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 9.08 points, or 0.68 percent, to 1,317.69. 
The TOPIX closed up 9.29 points, or 0.71 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.6100 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6700 
percent, driving its price up to 99.19 yen from 97.68 yen.

<HEADLINE> Tree Fruit Harvest Will Be Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANGER, Calif. (AP) -- Fruit lovers having trouble finding the  
usual supply of peaches, nectarines or plums in supermarkets 
shouldn't panic. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring fruits are coming. They're just a bit late this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to another round of unpredictable California weather, the  
tree fruit harvest in the heart of the Golden State has been 
delayed at least two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's El Nino rains caused an unusual amount of mold and  
fungus in the crop. This year, the unusually cold spring has 
delayed the ripening of the fruits. 
</P>
<P>
	The short supply affects fruit lovers across the United States  
because California is the leading producer of all three fruits. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can you do?'' asked farmer Sark Sarabian, shrugging his  
shoulders. ``You can't ship green fruit. We have our label ... to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a typical year, his packing house would be bustling with  
activity starting early in May, with as many as 35 workers grading, 
packaging and moving 25-pound boxes of peaches and nectarines and 
28-pound boxes of plums at the rate of 3,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Sarabian had fewer than a dozen workers picking  
through nectarines and boxing them at a much slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember us ever being this late,'' said Sarabian, 65,  
a second-generation farmer. ``Temperatures have been pretty warm 
during the day, but the fruit grows at night too, and the nights 
have been cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of May, California growers logged 875,000 boxes of  
peaches, 483,000 boxes of nectarines and 27,000 boxes of plums. 
Those numbers pale in comparison with the much more normal 1997 
figures: 3 million boxes of peaches, 2.5 million boxes of 
nectarines and 900,000 boxes of plums. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone from nearly 7 million boxes on a normal year to a  
little over 1 million boxes,'' said Marilyn Watkins, spokeswoman 
for the California Tree Fruit Agreement in Reedley, which 
represents about 2,000 California growers. ``But it's coming. It's 
nice and hot now. The growers will be picking like crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, one of the major downsides to the late harvest is  
missing Memorial Day weekend sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the end of May, we're usually in peak season, and  
supermarkets usually like to promote the fruit during the Memorial 
weekend,'' Watkins said. ``There isn't another holiday right after, 
so that's going to be hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the Fruit Agreement plans to launch a marketing  
campaign for the Fourth of July weekend, which is usually the 
holiday set aside for watermelons and cherries. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is an upside to the fruit's lateness.  
</P>
<P>
	``The taste and the appearance of the fruit this year is  
fantastic,'' said John Tos, a third-generation grower in Hanford. 
``We had a lot of cold hours this spring that really helped out on 
the quality. The taste will be as good or better than it has been 
in many years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many growers are anticipating a long, fruitful harvest --  
expected to last through September -- it will be difficult to rest 
easy until the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``With so much money invested, you're always anxious until you  
have the last fruit packed and ready to go,'' Sarabian said.

<HEADLINE> Two Spellers Appeal Eliminations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry Altman was stumped for four minutes and  
30 seconds by the first word he faced today in the finals of the 
national spelling bee. 
</P>
<P>
	He whispered the word ``banns'' to himself, glanced around the  
stage, sighed hard into the microphone, closed his eyes -- even 
stuck out his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
	``B-a,'' he started. He stopped. Then he started again.  
``B-a-n-d ... oops, let's see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judges were getting impatient.  
</P>
<P>
	``Take a deep breath and let's finish the word,'' judge Mary  
Brooks told the sixth-grader kindly. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry spelled ``b-a-n-d-s'' with little confidence. The  
elimination bell sounded. The 12-year-old computer enthusiast from 
Glen Rock, N.J., was out. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed his elimination, arguing that the official  
pronouncer mispronounced the word ``banns,'' a plural noun that 
means an announcement of an intended marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said `bands' and they didn't make me repeat it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Spelling bee officials disagreed. They did not reinstate Harry,  
but they did reinstate Greg Touney, 14, of Decatur, Ill., who 
appealed his elimination as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg's word was ``immanent,'' which means dwelling within. He  
spelled it ``imminent,'' and was eliminated. After he appealed, the 
judges ruled that he had given an acceptable alternate spelling. 
</P>
<P>
	The 72nd annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee began  
Wednesday with 249 spellers. When the competition resumed today, 
104 spellers were still in the running. At the end of the fifth 
round, 21 were left. The winner gets a $10,000 first-place cash 
prize, plus encyclopedias, two airline tickets and computer 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 9- to 15-year-old contestants, all wearing white  
polo shirts, spelled with their hands stuffed deep in their 
pockets. Others gazed at the ceiling for inspiration. When they sat 
waiting their turn, they yawned, examined the bottoms of their 
tennis shoes, twirled hair and fidgeted with yellow numbered 
placards hung around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday was a nerve-wracking day for Jason Espiritu, a  
13-year-old speller from Tamuning, Guam. 
</P>
<P>
	First he faced the word ``verisimilitude,'' a noun meaning  
something that appears real. It has seven -- count them, seven -- 
vowels. Then the judges accidentally sounded the elimination bell 
when he correctly spelled ``operatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It really shook me. They rang the bell, but it was right,''  
Jason said. 
</P>
<P>
	His third word on Wednesday was ``encaustic,'' a paint mixed  
with beeswax. That one troubled him for four minutes, two seconds, 
but he got it right. 
</P>
<P>
	The words didn't get any easier today. Jason spelled ``toccata''  
correctly but was stumped momentarily by ``cartonnage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to know the origin of the French word. He asked to  
hear it in a sentence. He asked for its definition (the material 
used to make Egyptian mummy cases). Finally he spelled it, then 
waited for the elimination bell. When it didn't ring, he thrust 
both arms in the air and got a high-five from another speller. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason then gave a high-five to Angela Smiley, a 13-year-old from  
Kokomo, Ind., who was so happy when she correctly spelled 
``festschrift,'' defined as a volume of essays, that she skipped 
back to her seat.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Missing Pa. Students Were Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURGETTSTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Three teen-agers suspected of breaking  
into an apartment near a Roman Catholic university campus and 
kidnapping two members of a religious fraternity say the pair were 
shot to death, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Law officers resumed a search for the missing students today in  
western Pennsylvania, about 15 miles from the Franciscan University 
campus in Steubenville, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Muha, 18, a sophomore biology major from suburban  
Columbus, Ohio, and Aaron Land, 20, a junior business major from 
Philadelphia, have been missing since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Somebody broke into their apartment just before dawn on Memorial  
Day, and police said they found blood in a bedroom and at least two 
bullet shells. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stephen Stern declined to identify the suspects, ages  
19, 18 and 16, who were held at the Jefferson County, Ohio, jail. 
The suspects said the victims had been killed, although each said 
the others did it, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trooper Diana Grady of the Pennsylvania state police said the  
three were suspected of aggravated burglary, kidnapping and 
aggravated robbery. She did not know whether charges had been 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they found blood inside and on the outside of  
Muha's Chevy Blazer, which was stopped with two of the suspects 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``The indication was that the car was pulled alongside a road  
and the alleged victims were taken up an embankment and shot two to 
four times in a wooded area,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Franciscan University is a Roman Catholic liberal arts school  
with about 2,000 students. The university is operated by the 
Franciscan Friars of the Sacred Heart Province in Loretto. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the campus was nearly deserted for the summer session, a  
vigil Wednesday night drew about 400 people to the campus chapel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to think,'' Land's brother, Mike, told  
KDKA-TV. ``I couldn't imagine life without my brother. He's just 
the greatest guy.''

                          *Nathan S. Ancell    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nathan S. Ancell, co-founder of the Ethan Allen  
furniture company and pioneer of the concept of selling furniture 
in room-style settings, died Monday at his home in New Rochelle. He 
was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Ancell and his brother-in-law, Theodore Baumritter, started  
their company in the 1930s in Beecher Falls, Vt., out of a bankrupt 
furniture factory. Its headquarters was eventually moved to 
Danbury, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking the tradition of displaying furniture in rows of  
chairs, tables and beds, Ancell applied the ``gallery concept'' of 
showing furniture in coordinated settings. 
</P>

	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Vaclav Benda, a Czech senator,  
mathematician, philosopher and former anti-communist dissident, 
died today, the news agency CTK reported. He was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Benda, a member of the Civic Democratic Party and a signatory of  
the Charter 77 human rights movement, spent four years in communist 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1989 peaceful revolution that toppled the communist  
regime, he became a deputy in the Czechoslovak parliament and later 
headed a newly established institute investigating crimes of the 
former communist officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He was elected to the upper chamber of the Czech parliament, the  
Senate, in 1996.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Dr. L. Joseph Butterfield, known as the father of  
neonatology, died Tuesday at his home in Denver. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Butterfield was known worldwide for his ideas about the care of  
newborn babies. His medical career and affiliation with The 
Children's Hospital in Denver spanned five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965, he was recruited as the medical director to create  
Children's Newborn Center, among the first of its kind in the 
nation. His program, ``Newborn Country USA,'' became recognized as 
a national model for regional perinatal care.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Christopher Cockerell, inventor of the  
hovercraft, died Tuesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Cockerell studied engineering at Cambridge University and worked  
for the electrical company Marconi, helping develop a transmission 
antenna for the BBC's first TV station at Alexandra Palace, north 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, he worked on the development of Britain's  
radar defense system and helped design an aerial direction finder 
that helped Allied pilots navigate their return to Britain's 
wartime air bases. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1950s, he left Marconi and settled in Norfolk,  
eastern England, to build tourist boats, but he also began work on 
inventing his hovercraft, which could move across land or water on 
a cushion of air. 
</P>
<P>
	The first prototype hovercraft, the SR-N1, crossed the English  
Channel in June 1959. The first commercial service began in Britain 
in 1962 and across the English Channel in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	He was knighted in 1969, and in 1971 received $250,000 from the  
government for surrendering his patent rights to the hovercraft.

reporter for the Lawton Constitution, died Monday after a brief 
illness. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard began his career in January 1979 as a staff writer for  
The Lawton Constitution and Morning Press. He went on to work at 
the Miami (Okla.) News Record, The Georgetown (Texas) Weekly and

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charles Pierce, an actor and female  
impersonator famous for characterizations of Hollywood stars 
including Bette Davis, Mae West and Joan Crawford, died Monday of 
cancer. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce did monologues and stand-up comedy in 1952 at the Cabaret  
Concert on Sunset Boulevard. He first got paid for his impressions 
while performing at the Club LaVie in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
	He added women's clothing to his act in the 1960s, quickly  
gaining admiration for his uncanny ability to conjure up images of 
female celebrities by using subtle facial expressions and vocal 
inflections. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he took his show to San Francisco's Gilded Cage and to  
Miami, where he got around laws barring cross-dressing by using 
props or wearing trousers under his gowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he returned to the stage after the death of Davis, his  
most famous character, revamping his one-man nightclub act of 
``legendary ladies of the silver screen.''

Ohio and northern Kentucky, died Sunday of kidney failure. He was 
41. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett had some of his best years in the mid-1980s at River  
Downs in Cincinnati, where he won six stakes races. He rode Tall 
Grass Walker to the 1984 Spartacus Stakes victory and set a course 
record aboard the horse on June 10, 1984, when they covered 7 1/2 
furlongs on the turf course in 1:29 3/5.

	IPSWICH, Mass. (AP) -- Crocker Snow Sr., a pioneering aviator and  
director of the Massachusetts Aeronautic Commission, died Tuesday. 
He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was a founder of Skyways Aviation, the first commercial  
flight operation at Logan International Airport in Boston. Amelia 
Earhart was one of his students. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow became the state's first aviation director in 1939 shortly  
after the forming of the commission, which he helped create by 
writing the first comprehensive aeronautical law for Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	His only absence from the commission in nearly 40 years was a  
tour of duty during World War II in the Army Air Force. He became a 
colonel by 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, President Nixon appointed him chairman of the Aviation  
Advisory Commission, created by Congress to report on the 
long-range needs of commercial and private aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his last solo flight in 1998.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anthropologist Frank Spencer, who accused a  
well-respected English anatomist of masterminding the 1912 Piltdown 
Man fraud, died Sunday of cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer worked since the early 1970s to solve the decades-long  
mystery of who was behind the counterfeit of early human fossils. 
He explained his findings in a 1990 book titled, ``Piltdown: A 
Scientific Forgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piltdown, a small village in England, made international news in  
1912 when a skull and other artifacts were discovered by Sussex 
lawyer Charles Dawson in a gravel pit. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery was debunked in 1953 when scientists learned the  
remains were a modern human skull joined to an orangutan's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer's books included ``The Piltdown Papers,'' also published  
in 1990; ``Ecco Homo,'' a bibliographic history of physical 
anthropology; and ``The Origin of Modern Humans,'' a world survey 
of the fossil evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also the editor of ``The History of Physical  
Anthropology,'' published in 1997.

<P>
	POYNETTE, Wis. (AP) -- Robert M. Thompson, who oversaw law  
enforcement at Fort McCoy when it served as an internment camp for 
thousands of Cuban refugees in 1980, died Tuesday of a heart 
attack. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, a former U.S. marshal, served five terms in the  
Assembly as a Democrat but switched to the Republican Party in 1990 
in an unsuccessful bid for secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed by President Carter in 1978 as U.S. marshal for  
western Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	That made him the top law enforcement officer involved when the  
Army camp near Sparta became home to 15,000 Cuban refugees, 
including freed prisoners and mental patients, who were permitted 
by Fidel Castro to leave for the United States.

<HEADLINE> Power Performances on Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If most of the new musicals didn't sing and new  
American plays were outnumbered by revivals and British imports, 
there still were performances to savor in the theater season that 
has just ended on and off-Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	And not just star performers, although Judi Dench, Kevin Spacey,  
Zoe Wanamaker, Brian Dennehy and Bernadette Peters provided enough 
wattage to light Times Square several times over. 
</P>
<P>
	There were others who made audiences sit up and take notice. Not  
exactly new faces, although some are, but they are the potential 
stars of tomorrow in the theater and in movies and television, too. 
Look at the flight several seasons ago of Calista Flockhart to Los 
Angeles. Does anyone remember that before ``Ally McBeal'' she was a 
staple on the New York stage? 
</P>
<P>
	Here then, in no particular order, 10 actors and actresses who  
made an impression that lasted long after the curtain came down. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Hamilton scores as the wide-eyed, innocent hero of ``The  
Cider House Rules,'' the mammoth story-theater version of John 
Irving's novel at off-Broadway's Atlantic Theater Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Hero is a difficult four-letter word to live up to, but Hamilton  
handled the role with charm and grace, two qualities that seemed in 
short supply this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jillian Armenante has traveled to New York with ``Cider House''  
from its beginnings in Seattle and Los Angeles. The play, done 
regionally in an epic, two-part version, is populated with 
memorable characters. 
</P>
<P>
	None is more memorable than Melony, a fearless, full-figured  
tomboy who quite simply hijacks the stage of the Atlantic. 
Armenante's fiercely physical portrayal of the girl took no 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a secure actor to play a child or an animal. Roger Bart  
not only plays a dog, he impersonates a famous one -- Snoopy -- in 
the Broadway revival of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' Bart 
manages to play cute without being cloying, the perfect theatrical 
beagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Brown wasn't a character in the original ``Charlie Brown''  
more than two decades ago. She is now -- and practically steals the 
musical revue. Kristin Chenoweth's Sally is compulsively 
self-centered and compulsively comic. A small, pert blonde, she is, 
quite simply, the musical-comedy find of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder both Bart and Chenoweth are favorites to take home  
Tony Awards in the featured acting categories. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major mysteries of the 1999 Tony nominations was the  
omission of Lea DeLaria. DeLaria played Hildy, the raucous taxicab 
driver -- who can cook, too -- in the short-lived revival of the 
musical ``On the Town.'' She sang the role in Central Park in 1996 
and belted it again -- even better -- on Broadway in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Tony nominators did notice another boisterous performer in  
``On the Town'': Mary Testa, as the liquor-tippling voice teacher 
Madame Dilly. Testa was larger than large, turning what could have 
been just a cartoon into a blissful comic cameo. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's blistering family drama, Frank  
Wood inhabits a man whose whole life is music, specifically jazz. 
It's an obsession that destroys his marriage and damages his 
relationship with his son. The man is happiest with his horn, a joy 
that Wood conveys with heartbreaking intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	Finbar Lynch plays a tightly coiled prison trusty in ``Not About  
Nightingales,'' and the quiet tension he produces is palpable. The 
prison drama, written by Tennessee Williams in 1938, was not seen 
on stage until last year -- in a highly theatrical production 
directed by Trevor Nunn in London. That production, now in New York 
at Circle in the Square, features Lynch, a compact bantamweight who 
paces the stage like a prizefighter. He fits right in with Nunn's 
heightened, stylized staging. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Ruffalo gave one of those edgy, explosive performances as a  
goofy, unhappy teen-ager in the already closed ``This Is Our 
Youth.'' His touching portrait of a boy who wants desperately to 
belong blended arrogance and insecurity.	   ``Everybody's Ruby,'' seen earlier this year off-Broadway at the 
Public Theater, was about Zora Neale Hurston, one of the leading 
writers of the Harlem Renaissance. Viola Davis didn't play Hurston, 
but rather the title character, a black woman wronged by a white 
Southern doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis captured the woman's pain and humiliation to such a degree  
that her hurt seemed unbearable. You couldn't take your eyes off 
her, something that could be said without reservation about these 
nine other performers who graced stages in New York during the 
1998-99 theater season.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Doubts Rival's Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. used newly disclosed evidence  
Thursday to raise questions at its antitrust trial about how a 
rival executive described under oath the dwindling health of his 
company because of its battle with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	James Barksdale, the chief executive officer of Netscape  
Communications Corp., testified in federal court in October that 
Microsoft had crippled his ability to distribute Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	But weeks later, in a far healthier assessment, Netscape told  
its investment bankers its software was included on more than 
one-fifth the machines sold by the nation's computer makers and 
given away by almost one-fourth of the 20 largest Internet 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape also told the bankers overseeing Netscape's $10 billion  
sale to America Online Inc., that computer makers were distributing 
its software for ``no compensation,'' and that consumers were 
downloading roughly 160 million copies of the Web browser annually, 
according to documents made public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first trial witness in October, Barksdale was portrayed as  
the most recognizable victim of Microsoft's alleged aggression 
toward its software rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers contend that Microsoft wielded its influence  
among computer makers to discourage them from distributing 
Netscape's browser and, in some cases, paid Internet providers to 
give its own software to their subscribers rather than Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting those claims, Barksdale told the judge that computer  
makers and Internet providers represented more than half the total 
distribution for Web software in the industry, ``and we're 
basically out of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft charged Thursday that Netscape told its investment  
bankers more than twice as many new computers included its software 
than Barksdale had represented to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have seen numbers around -- this is a new PC shipped  
worldwide -- I believe it's around 10 percent,'' Barksdale testified 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
	But documents Microsoft cited in court Thursday, dated just  
weeks after Barksdale testified, showed Netscape telling its 
bankers, ``Estimate client on 22 percent of ... (computer) 
shipments with minimal promotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Fisher, an economist testifying this week for the  
government, said Thursday he believed the numbers Netscape gave to 
its bankers might have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft continued its courtroom efforts this week to show U.S.  
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that AOL's purchase of 
Netscape illustrates competition in the high-tech industry is 
robust and federal intervention is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson took notice of the documents Microsoft cited related to  
AOL's purchase, telling Justice Department lawyer David Boies there 
was ``some very interesting information in there that I hope for 
you to revisit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies was expected to resume questioning Fisher on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The government also raised questions Thursday about what Bill  
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has been saying outside court and what 
his lawyers are telling the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney Michael Lacovara pressed Fisher about whether  
the popular upstart Linux computer operating system poses any 
threat to Microsoft's dominance. Lacovara noted that at least two 
of the largest computer makers, Dell Computer Corp. and IBM Corp., 
offer machines equipped with Linux rather than Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boies cited press interviews with Gates in which the  
billionaire predicted that, ``Newcomers such as Linux pose no 
threat to Windows. ... I've never had a customer mention Linux to 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Discovery Leaves Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery and its crew  
sailed away from the international space station Thursday after 
getting the place ready for its first permanent residents next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a mission that took a big step in making the station a  
home,'' Mission Control's Jeff Bantle said, quoting a colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	The connecting latches popped open, upon command, as the two  
spacecraft soared above Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Rick Husband, who was at the controls, said he was leaving  
``with some regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Discovery was linked to the space station for six days,  
the seven astronauts spent less than 3 1/2 days inside the orbiting 
complex. They unloaded 2 tons of supplies for the first 
inhabitants, who are due to move in next March, and also fixed a 
broken radio, replaced battery packs and installed foam insulation 
to reduce the noise caused by fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to thank you for all your hard work,'' Mission  
Control told the departing astronauts. ``You all certainly left the 
international space station in much better shape than you found 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first docking between a shuttle and the space  
station, launched in two pieces late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Once undocked, Discovery did 2 1/2 slow laps around the gleaming  
space station so the crew could photograph the entire exterior. 
Then Husband fired the engines, and the shuttle flew away for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving, the astronauts turned out the lights, shut down  
equipment and sealed all the hatches aboard the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep an eye on things from here until the next visit,''  
Mission Control assured them. 
</P>
<P>
	The next visitors are due in December aboard space shuttle  
Atlantis. But that mission -- and the dozens that are to follow -- 
cannot proceed until the Russians launch a component that will 
serve as crew quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The component should have flown last year but was held up by  
Russia's money crunch. It is now set for liftoff in November aboard 
a Russian rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for the component's arrival, Discovery's astronauts  
gave the space station a lift once all the hatches were sealed. The 
shuttle boosted the station six miles to a 246-mile-high orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bantle said the highly successful supply mission was a preview  
of what's ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space station is not going to be just about those large  
assembly pieces, but it's going to be a lot about supporting a crew 
on orbit,'' he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts have one last job before they return to Earth  
early Sunday: They will release a mirror-studded satellite on 
Saturday that students around the world will track as part of an 
education project.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Co. Wins HIV Coverage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An insurance company can set lower coverage  
levels for HIV-related illnesses despite a federal law that bans 
discrimination against the disabled, an appeals panel has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding a suit brought by two HIV-positive Chicago-area men, a  
panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the mens' 
insurer, Mutual of Omaha Co., was within its rights to limit their 
health coverage to a fraction of the $1 million cap placed on other 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men's policies capped lifetime benefits for  
HIV-related conditions at $25,000 and the other man's policy capped 
them at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists, citing the Americans with Disabilities Act, had filed  
suit in 1997 on the mens' behalf, and have not released their 
names. The decision late Wednesday overturned a ruling by a federal 
judge last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the 2-1 majority, Chief Judge Richard Posner said an  
insurance policy is a product with unique characteristics, ``just 
as a wheelchair is a different product from an armchair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual of Omaha spokesman Jim Nolan said Thursday that the  
company was pleased with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	For people with AIDS, the decision ``legalizes irrational  
discrimination by health insurers,'' Ann Fisher, executive director 
of the AIDS Legal Council of Chicago, said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the two men have not decided whether to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kentucky Coach Bradshaw Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Former Kentucky football coach Charlie  
Bradshaw, an Alabama native and Bear Bryant protege known for his 
aggressive, disciplined style, died Thursday. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw, who coached at Kentucky from 1962-68 and at Troy State  
in Alabama from 1976-82, died in Montgomery, where he grew up and 
had lived in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradshaw, who spent three years with the Marines during World  
War II, played for Bryant at Kentucky after the war. He lettered 
four years, three as an end. He eventually rejoined Bryant as an 
assistant at Alabama during 1959-61, helping win a national 
championship in his last year before taking the Kentucky job in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Bryant, Bradshaw was a tough field master, with an intense  
conditioning regime. His disciplined approach was so demanding that 
his first Kentucky team began with 88 players but dropped to 30 -- 
``The Thin Thirty'' as they were known at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 25-41-4 at Kentucky, with a 6-4 campaign in his fourth  
year the peak. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 41-27-2 in seven years at Troy State, with his first team  
winning the Gulf State Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Clem Gryska, who coached with Bradshaw at Alabama when the Tide  
won the national title, said Thursday that Bradshaw was a major 
element in the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids had a lot of respect for him,'' Gryska said. ``He  
could turn his cap around and get down in the trenches with them. 
He was a hands-on coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bradshaw was a strong recruiter for Alabama. ``We called  
him `Silver Tongue,''' Gryska said. ``We would get three, four, 
five recruits a year out of the state of Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After playing under Bryant at Kentucky, Bradshaw returned to  
Montgomery and coached junior high for four years. Then he went 
back to Kentucky as an assistant under Blanton Collier during 
1954-58. 
</P>
<P>
	After his work as an assistant under Bryant and the head job at  
Kentucky, Bradshaw was an assistant at Texas A&AMP;M in 1970 and at 
Vanderbilt in 1971-72 before entering private business. He returned 
to football at Troy State, about 40 miles south of Montgomery, four 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a sad day for Troy State,'' athletic director Johnny  
Williams said. ``I saw him just yesterday and got the opportunity 
to visit for an hour. He was in excellent health and was just

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Gov't Energy Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told federal agencies  
Thursday to do a better job of conserving energy, citing global 
warming so alarming that it is melting sea ices and killing off 
entire species in Costa Rica's forests. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government uses more energy than anyone else in the  
nation, expending $8 billion worth each year -- roughly half of 
which goes into lights, heat and air conditioning for its 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued an executive order that directs federal agencies  
to cut their energy consumption by 35 percent, compared with 1985 
levels, between now and 2010. The government has reduced 
consumption 17 percent since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the single largest consumer of energy in our country, the  
federal government should be leading the way,'' Clinton told 
reporters during an appearance in the White House Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House estimated that Clinton's order would save  
taxpayers about $750 million a year, and reduce greenhouse gases by 
2.4 million metric tons -- the equivalent of taking 1.7 million cars 
off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced that by the end of the month, the Defense  
Department will award the largest energy-saving contract in 
government history. He said under the contract, the government pays 
no up-front costs, the contractor wins a share of the energy 
savings and taxpayers will save over $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the White House has made changes that saved about  
$180,000 in energy costs annually, said Todd Stern, Clinton's 
coordinator on climate change -- even though it not stopped using 
energy-eating incandescent light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has made significant improvements,'' Stern  
said. ``We will be making further improvements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called global warming ``our most fateful environmental  
challenge,'' saying each month seems to bring disturbing new 
evidence of the damage greenhouse gases are doing to the planet. He 
cited scientists' findings that 1998 was likely the warmest year in 
a millennium, and said the permafrost in the Arctic is beginning to 
warm and sea ice is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whole species of frogs are disappearing from forests in Costa  
Rica because the air there is getting hotter and dryer,'' Clinton 
said. ``These are alarming signs for what it means to biodiversity 
and the potential of a rising water level around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yet some still insist that the vast majority of scientists are  
simply wrong and that we should do nothing. Others call for a raft 
of new regulations and new taxes. I believe there is a third way 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Congress to approve research allocations in his  
fiscal 2000 budget plan to help American businesses take advantage 
of current and developing energy-saving technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton instructed federal agencies to give annual conservation  
updates to the Office of Management and Budget, and take steps such 
as: 
</P>
<P>
	--Using private energy conservation contractors more often.  
</P>
<P>
	--Installing more efficient lighting systems, boilers and cooling  
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improving building insulation.  
</P>
<P>
	--Making wider use of renewable energy technologies.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's directive does not apply to energy uses for  
transportation, or many military or other activities tied to 
national security.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Reach Salmon Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Canada and the United States on Thursday  
announced a new agreement to jointly manage West Coast salmon runs, 
with the emphasis on conserving and rebuilding dwindling stocks 
rather than simply dividing up what's left. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal potentially ends years of bitter feelings between the  
two countries over fishing rights, which culminated in 1997 when 
Canadian fishing boats blocked an Alaska state ferry from departing 
British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and  
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy called it ``a victory for 
all those on both sides of the border interested in salmon 
conservation and the long-term viability of our salmon 
industries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington Gov. Gary Locke said: ``It wasn't easy, but after  
five frustrating years of negotiating breakdowns we finally ended 
the stalemate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement gives Canada more Fraser River sockeye salmon at  
the expense of Washington and Oregon fishermen, but reduces 
Canada's catch of chinook salmon bound for Washington, Oregon and 
Idaho rivers, Locke said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Alaska has agreed to reduce its chinook and coho  
salmon catches, backers of the agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also requires Congress to appropriate $140 million  
to be used to restore salmon habitat and take other steps to 
rebuild stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government and Washington state are expected to  
appropriate another $30 million to $35 million to buy out the 
licenses of U.S. fishermen who will lose a big chunk of their 
customary Fraser sockeye harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the agreement on a renewed Pacific Salmon Treaty were  
announced at news conferences here and in Vancouver, British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement will be in effect for 10 years everywhere but  
British Columbia's Fraser River, where it will last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. catch of Fraser River salmon will be limited to 16.5  
percent, down from a historical average of about 20 percent. Last 
year, U.S. fishermen took 25 percent of the catch. Canada must 
reduce its catch of chinook bound for Washington, Oregon and Idaho 
by between 36 percent and 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, fixed harvest quotas will be replaced by a system that  
adjusts harvest levels for salmon stocks according to their 
relative abundance. Harvest levels will decline when stocks are 
low, so they can recover, and will rise when stocks are again 
plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson called the agreement  
a ``turning point'' for the better in a struggle over salmon that 
dates back to the last century. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement sets up two bilaterally managed funds to improve  
fisheries management and includes provisions to enhance scientific 
cooperation between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The two regional funds include a Northern Fund covering Alaska  
and northern and central British Columbia and a Southern Fund 
covering southern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and the 
Snake River Basin in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds are to be managed jointly by the United States and  
Canada, and would address science, restoration and enhancement 
needs relating to salmon production. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has committed to seek $75 million for the  
Northern Fund and $65 million for the Southern Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Curtis of Trout Unlimited welcomed the agreement -- with  
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what we know about this agreement, it seems to be more  
about providing money for restoration than cutting harvests,'' 
Curtis said. ``We are worried that they are going down the road of 
trying to make more fish, rather than conserving the resource.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Provisions of the treaty, which dictate how many fish are  
allotted to U.S. and Canadian fishermen, expired in 1992 and 
negotiators have been working ever since to come up with a new 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a renewed push this year to get a deal after  
several years of squabbling and many failed attempts. The 
negotiations hit a low point in 1997 when Canadian fishing boats 
blocked an Alaska state ferry from departing Prince Rupert, British 
Columbia, after fishermen there contended Alaskans were taking too 
many salmon.

<HEADLINE> Color Gives Charismatic an Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If color has anything to do with it, Charismatic's chances of  
winning the Belmont Stakes are very good. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner is a chestnut. Eight of the  
25 horses to go into the Belmont Stakes with a chance of winning 
the Triple Crown were chestnuts. Six of them won, the last being 
Affirmed in 1978. The others were Sir Barton (1919), Omaha (1935), 
Whirlaway (1941), Assault (1946) and Secretariat (1973). 
</P>
<P>
	The two who failed were Pensive (1944) and Majestic Prince  
(1969), both of whom finished second. None of the seven who have 
tried and failed to complete the Triple Crown since Affirmed won it 
were chestnuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the winners of 130 Belmonts, 48 were chestnuts, second only  
to 51 bays. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic also should be a favorite of the cold-beer crowd.  
After all, Bob Lewis, the colt's owner, is the biggest beer 
distributor in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	But the suds crowd might prefer Silverbulletday, the sensational  
filly owned and named by a beer drinker named Mike Pegram, who's 
also in the fast-food business. A beer, a burger and a bet on 
Silverbulletday -- what a trifecta! 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody in racing has more fun than the 47-year-old Pegram, who  
grew up in southern Indiana and often went to Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	So he was thrilled when his Real Quiet won the Kentucky Derby  
last year, and he was just as thrilled when Silverbulletday won the 
Kentucky Oaks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was schoolboy, Pegram said, he enjoyed going to the Oaks  
on Friday more than going to the Derby on Saturday because you had 
to skip school to go to the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram, his family and friends, one of whom is Bob Baffert,  
trainer of Real Quiet and Silverbulletday, stayed near Belmont Park 
last year when Real Quiet tried to win the Triple Crown. He was 
nipped by a nose in the final stride by Menifee. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram and Baffert said Monday while watching Silverbulletday  
gallop that they would do their ``worrying'' about the filly's 
chances in the Belmont by staying in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to enjoy this Belmont,'' Baffert said. ``The last  
two years I went there under the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also missed becoming a Triple Crown trainer when Lewis'  
Silver Charm finished second in the 1997 Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan is quite a way from Belmont Park, but if  
Silverbulletday cocks an ear during the quiet of the evening, she 
might be able to hear the laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	One who sometimes fails to appreciate Pegram's humor is Buddy  
Bishop, who accepts or rejects suggested names of horses for The 
Jockey Club. Many of the names suggested by Pegram are suggestive, 
and a couple of risque ones have slipped by. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of names for one of Pegram's horses were  
rejected, Pegram submitted one that was accepted. It was Censored. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the matter of Button My Pants. That's the name of  
a fantasy horse that Pegram's 6-year-old grandson, Gator, uses when 
he plays at calling races. Another is Pay My Bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram submitted Button My Pants as a name for a colt, but it  
was rejected. ``What is obscene about that?'' Pegram wondered, So 
he submitted it again, and again Bishop rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	The accepted name was Buddynamedme.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Doubts Rival's Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. used newly disclosed evidence  
Thursday to raise questions at its antitrust trial about how a 
rival executive described under oath the dwindling health of his 
company because of its battle with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	James Barksdale, the chief executive officer of Netscape  
Communications Corp., testified in federal court in October that 
Microsoft had crippled his ability to distribute Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	But weeks later, in a far healthier assessment, Netscape told  
its investment bankers its software was included on more than 
one-fifth the machines sold by the nation's computer makers and 
given away by almost one-fourth of the 20 largest Internet 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape also told the bankers overseeing Netscape's $10 billion  
sale to America Online Inc., that computer makers were distributing 
its software for ``no compensation,'' and that consumers were 
downloading roughly 160 million copies of the Web browser annually, 
according to documents made public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first trial witness in October, Barksdale was portrayed as  
the most recognizable victim of Microsoft's alleged aggression 
toward its software rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers contend that Microsoft wielded its influence  
among computer makers to discourage them from distributing 
Netscape's browser and, in some cases, paid Internet providers to 
give its own software to their subscribers rather than Netscape's. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporting those claims, Barksdale told the judge that computer  
makers and Internet providers represented more than half the total 
distribution for Web software in the industry, ``and we're 
basically out of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft charged Thursday that Netscape told its investment  
bankers more than twice as many new computers included its software 
than Barksdale had represented to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have seen numbers around -- this is a new PC shipped  
worldwide -- I believe it's around 10 percent,'' Barksdale testified 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
	But documents Microsoft cited in court Thursday, dated just  
weeks after Barksdale testified, showed Netscape telling its 
bankers, ``Estimate client on 22 percent of ... (computer) 
shipments with minimal promotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Fisher, an economist testifying this week for the  
government, said Thursday he believed the numbers Netscape gave to 
its bankers might have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft continued its courtroom efforts this week to show U.S.  
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that AOL's purchase of 
Netscape illustrates competition in the high-tech industry is 
robust and federal intervention is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson took notice of the documents Microsoft cited related to  
AOL's purchase, telling Justice Department lawyer David Boies there 
was ``some very interesting information in there that I hope for 
you to revisit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies was expected to resume questioning Fisher on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The government also raised questions Thursday about what Bill  
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, has been saying outside court and what 
his lawyers are telling the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney Michael Lacovara pressed Fisher about whether  
the popular upstart Linux computer operating system poses any 
threat to Microsoft's dominance. Lacovara noted that at least two 
of the largest computer makers, Dell Computer Corp. and IBM Corp., 
offer machines equipped with Linux rather than Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boies cited press interviews with Gates in which the  
billionaire predicted that, ``Newcomers such as Linux pose no 
threat to Windows. ... I've never had a customer mention Linux to 
me.''

<HEADLINE>  Elvis Items To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elvis may have left the building, but his Army  
fatigues could soon hang in your closet. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 of the King's never displayed treasures from his  
Graceland compound will be sold at auction in October at Las Vegas' 
MGM Grand hotel, Gurnsey's auction house announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the items to be auctioned are record, movie and  
performance contracts, including the publishing contract for 
``Heartbreak Hotel'' and letters from Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra 
and President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be some classic pieces like a vintage yellow  
Cadillac station wagon with wood-grain side panels and an ivory 
wool cape decorated with rhinestones and an American eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	No minimum prices were set. Arlan Ettinger, owner of the  
Manhattan auction house that also sold Mark McGwire's 70th home run 
ball for just over $3 million in January, said he expected the 
prices to range from affordable to six figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The items were selected to help weed out the collection at  
Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised from the auction will help build houses for  
homeless families in Memphis. The development, called Presley 
Place, will cost about $1.5 million to build. It will be operated 
by the Metropolitan Interfaith Association and will provide 
counseling and job training for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Elvis -- who died Aug. 16, 1977, at age 42 -- was  
discovered, the Presley family lived for several years in a federal 
housing project in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	The items will be previewed in Las Vegas beginning Sept. 28. The

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Las Vegas Store Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man dressed in camouflage and armed with a  
shotgun opened fire today in a supermarket, killing four people. 
</P>
<P>
	A 23-year-old man with a shotgun was taken into custody outside  
the store. Three of the dead were employees of the Albertsons 
supermarket and the fourth was a shopper, Lt. Wayne Petersen said. 
A man was critically wounded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're unsure why he chose this place to go on a rampage,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Rick Alba said police do not believe robbery was a motive  
and they have not determined any connection between the victims and 
the suspect. Police received word of the shooting around 5:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found at different places in the store, which is  
about two miles west of the casinos on the Las Vegas strip, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just horrified by this. This is tragic, inexplicable and  
we are sickened by it,'' said Michael Reed, vice president of 
public affairs at Albertsons' headquarters in Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has 995 stores in 25 states, sent a  
counseling team to help employees cope with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	After the man began firing, two women employees, age 20 and 34,  
hid for three hours in a produce cooler, where they were discovered 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very upset from the whole incident. They were very  
cold, they were inside the cooler. We are trying to get them 
warm,'' said Kathi Rice, a spokeswoman for American Medical 
Response, an ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The supermarket is located at a shopping mall at one of the  
city's busiest intersections. Police cordoned off the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Across from the store's parking lot, Albertsons employees and  
family members gathered at Carl's Jr. restaurant, surrounded by 
police and store officials. Some were crying as they embraced each 
other.

<HEADLINE>  First Lady Won't Say Magic Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She looked like a candidate and sounded like a  
candidate as she shook hands, hugged strangers and made a rousing 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hillary Rodham Clinton again stopped short of saying the  
magic words her supporters have been waiting for -- that she is a 
candidate for Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Run, Hillary, run!'' students chanted at City College, where  
Mrs. Clinton began her day-long visit to Manhattan on Wednesday by 
giving the commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
	As she walked through the crowd of 3,000 graduates, she shook  
dozens and dozens of hands thrust out by cheering students. One man 
put his arms out for a hug, and she returned his embrace after a 
moment's hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The content of Mrs. Clinton's speech to the college -- calling  
for more resources and support for public schools -- was similar to 
others she has made in a half-dozen recent appearances in New York. 
But this time her every sentence was met with a roar from the 
students, most of them black, Hispanic and from working-class 
backgrounds. And like a candidate on the campaign trail, Mrs. 
Clinton's cadences grew stronger with every cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never lift up our public schools and the students they  
serve by tearing them down,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``We can never 
ensure the future of this city or state or our nation by 
undermining the public education system that is at the very 
foundation of the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City's public schools have been criticized frequently  
by Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is also a likely Senate 
candidate. And City University, of which City College is part, has 
also been under attack, accused of lowering standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a fund-raiser at Tavern on the Green for the state  
Democratic Party, Mrs. Clinton was given a New York Yankees 
baseball cap by United Federation of Teachers President Randi 
Weingarten, the luncheon's guest of honor. Afterwards, the first 
lady shook hands with patrons at the restaurant and waved to a 
small cheering crowd of joggers and mothers with strollers waiting 
near her limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not refer to her potential candidacy in any of  
her speeches, but others did. At the luncheon, Sen. Charles 
Schumer, D-N.Y., said: ``There's no candidacy yet. But Hillary 
Clinton gets closer and closer and closer and we get more and more 
excited about the prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the first lady have said she's on the verge of  
declaring herself a candidate after several months of deliberations 
and consultations with experts. 
</P>
<P>
	At an evening fund-raiser for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the  
congresswoman defended Mrs. Clinton against accusations of 
carpetbagging. The first lady has never lived in New York, and 
earlier Wednesday, Republican Gov. George Pataki had said, ``I 
don't think we need somebody from Washington or Arkansas moving to 
New York to represent us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We New Yorkers don't care where you're from,'' Ms. Maloney  
said. ``We New Yorkers care about what you can do to continue to 
build the greatest city, state and country in the world.''

<HEADLINE>  First Lady Won't Say Magic Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She looked like a candidate and sounded like a  
candidate as she shook hands, hugged strangers and made a rousing 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hillary Rodham Clinton again stopped short of saying the  
magic words her supporters have been waiting for -- that she is a 
candidate for Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Run, Hillary, run!'' students chanted at City College, where  
Mrs. Clinton began her day-long visit to Manhattan on Wednesday by 
giving the commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
	As she walked through the crowd of 3,000 graduates, she shook  
dozens and dozens of hands thrust out by cheering students. One man 
put his arms out for a hug, and she returned his embrace after a 
moment's hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The content of Mrs. Clinton's speech to the college -- calling  
for more resources and support for public schools -- was similar to 
others she has made in a half-dozen recent appearances in New York. 
But this time her every sentence was met with a roar from the 
students, most of them black, Hispanic and from working-class 
backgrounds. And like a candidate on the campaign trail, Mrs. 
Clinton's cadences grew stronger with every cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never lift up our public schools and the students they  
serve by tearing them down,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``We can never 
ensure the future of this city or state or our nation by 
undermining the public education system that is at the very 
foundation of the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City's public schools have been criticized frequently  
by Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is also a likely Senate 
candidate. And City University, of which City College is part, has 
also been under attack, accused of lowering standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a fund-raiser at Tavern on the Green for the state  
Democratic Party, Mrs. Clinton was given a New York Yankees 
baseball cap by United Federation of Teachers President Randi 
Weingarten, the luncheon's guest of honor. Afterwards, the first 
lady shook hands with patrons at the restaurant and waved to a 
small cheering crowd of joggers and mothers with strollers waiting 
near her limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not refer to her potential candidacy in any of  
her speeches, but others did. At the luncheon, Sen. Charles 
Schumer, D-N.Y., said: ``There's no candidacy yet. But Hillary 
Clinton gets closer and closer and closer and we get more and more 
excited about the prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the first lady have said she's on the verge of  
declaring herself a candidate after several months of deliberations 
and consultations with experts. 
</P>
<P>
	At an evening fund-raiser for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the  
congresswoman defended Mrs. Clinton against accusations of 
carpetbagging. The first lady has never lived in New York, and 
earlier Wednesday, Republican Gov. George Pataki had said, ``I 
don't think we need somebody from Washington or Arkansas moving to 
New York to represent us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We New Yorkers don't care where you're from,'' Ms. Maloney  
said. ``We New Yorkers care about what you can do to continue to 
build the greatest city, state and country in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Lightning Strike Snarls Railroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A lightning strike at a communications  
center slowed or halted rail traffic -- including 11 Amtrak trains -- 
in parts of the East and Midwest. Some 200 trains were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The lightning struck a CSX communications center in  
Jacksonville, Fla., at 5:30 p.m. Thursday, knocking out the signal 
system between Chicago and Philadelphia, parts of Michigan and in 
the Kentucky-West Virginia coal region, CSX Transportation 
spokesman Adam Hollingsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio communication between crews and dispatchers were also  
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It slowed and, in some places, stopped rail traffic until the  
signal system could be restored,'' Hollingsworth said. ``In some 
areas, we were able to use portable signal equipment and cellular 
phones to safely keep the trains running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said about 200 trains were affected by the outage, including  
15 passenger trains operated by Amtrak and commuter lines Virginia 
Railway Express and Maryland Area Rail Commuter. None of the Amtrak 
trains -- all in the Washington, D.C., area -- were delayed more than 
four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX runs about 1,300 trains daily through the affected areas.  
Amtrak, VRE and MARC operate on CSX-maintained tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kerr was among the stranded VRE commuters who were still  
sitting on a train three hours after leaving Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``A whole bunch of us decided to get off the train and walk,''  
said Kerr, who walked about a mile to reach his car. He arrived 
home a little after 9 p.m. to a cold take-out dinner he ordered 
from his cellular phone on the train. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX restored its signal system about three hours after the  
strike and expected to fully restore radio communications by today. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX, whose corporate headquarters is in Richmond, operates about  
22,300 miles of railroad lines in 23 states, the District of 
Columbia, and Montreal and Ontario, Canada.

<HEADLINE> Profits Slip at Air France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French national carrier Air France's profit fell 11  
percent in its latest fiscal year, hurt by a pilot strike and a 
slump in Asian cargo shipments. But it expects solid growth in 
operating results this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France also said Thursday it will select a U.S. partner in  
the course of 1999 ``to create a global alliance'' although it 
offered few details on what kind of alliance it had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon told a news conference  
that a partnership either with Delta Airlines or Continental 
Airlines would form the backbone of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France currently has code sharing agreements with  
Continental and Delta, enabling them to coordinate flight schedules 
with Air France, and Gourgeon said he hoped to maintain the 
agreement with the airline that did not enter the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance could include other airlines as well, but Gourgeon  
said it would not exceed 10 companies. It will likely include 
another European airline, said Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the chairman of 
Air France. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline's profit fell to 249 million euros, or $239 million,  
in the year ended March 31 from 280 million euros a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the year rose to 9.1 billion euros, or $8.75  
billion, from 8.97 billion euros the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-day strike by Air France pilots last June just as the World  
Cup was getting underway cost the airline an estimated $32.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargo revenues fell 12 percent and its cargo unit posted a net  
loss for the full year. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government announced in January it would sell part of  
Air France, eventually reducing the state share in the airline to 
about 53 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court Decision Raises Census Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cost of counting America next year is  
going up by $1.7 billion because of the restriction imposed by the 
Supreme Court on using statistical sampling techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau said Wednesday that it will ask for the extra  
money in addition to $2.9 billion already requested for fiscal 2000 
for the count. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is evidence that in the absence of using modern  
statistical methods, it is simply going to cost a lot more to do 
the census,'' Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But Elizabeth Morra, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations  
Committee, took issue with the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clearly evident that the 2000 census continues to be  
plagued by operational difficulties and cost overruns, and these 
are problems that are unrelated to the Supreme Court's decision,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the sampling versus enumeration controversy on  
Capitol Hill, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, has said 
Congress would provide whatever funds are necessary to do an actual 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau had planned to use statistical sampling in the  
2000 count, contending that it would save money and be more 
accurate than the 1990 effort, which, later checks indicated, had 
some 12.8 million errors -- missing 8.4 million and double-counting 
4.4 million people. With sampling, more than 90 percent of 
Americans would be counted directly and the results would be used 
to estimate those not counted. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican legislators battled the plan because census  
numbers are used to allocate seats in the House of Representatives 
among the states, and they feared sampling would increase the 
population of Democratic urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court in January agreed that sampling did not  
satisfy the requirements for numbers used in apportionment. But the 
court left open the possibility of sampling for other census 
numbers, which are used for such purposes as distributing billions 
of dollars in federal funds among states and localities. 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt said the bureau will have to increase its advertising  
and other efforts to get people to respond to mailed 
questionnaires, will visit more homes that do not mail forms back 
and will need to hire more people and keep local offices open 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans, already inundated with advertising mail, sent back  
just 66 percent of census forms in 1990, and the bureau is 
anticipating that the return rate could fall to 61 percent this 
time. Each 1 percentage-point drop costs an additional $25 million 
in follow-up efforts, Prewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the Census Bureau submitted a budget request for  
$2.879 billion for fiscal 2000 to complete the census, in addition 
to $1.686 billion it has spent since 1991 preparing for the count. 
Prewitt said it will now have to seek an additional $1.723 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Census Day is April 1. Questionnaires will be sent to some 100  
million households, and enumerators will hit the streets to track 
down those who fail to respond.

	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Michael Johnson, the Olympic gold  
medalist and world record-holder in the 200 meters, has withdrawn 
from Sunday's inaugural TFA Pro Championships because of the death 
of his maternal grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who was scheduled to face 100-meter world champion  
Maurice Greene in the 200, is remaining at home in Dallas to attend 
Saturday's funeral and be with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt it would be inappropriate to leave his family,'' his  
manager, Renaldo Nehemiah, told meet organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's grandmother died Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The funeral arrangement are going to carry into the weekend  
and that will interfere with his participation in New York,'' 
Nehemiah said. 
</P>

	Meanwhile, Gillian Russell of Jamaica was added to the women's  
100-meter hurdles field and Debbie Marshall was added to the 
women's mile. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> RE/MAX Wins Restraining Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- RE/MAX, one of the largest real estate firms in  
the nation, won a restraining order in federal court Thursday 
barring a Cuban company from using its name in connection with real 
estate marketing in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was entered in response to a complaint filed earlier  
this week by RE/MAX International, Inc., which claims that Inmocuba 
S.S. and its operator, Stephen A. Marshall, had been using the 
names RE/MAX Havana and RE/MAX Cuba without authorization and in 
violation of federal trademark laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named as a defendant is William P. Murphy, an independent  
regional director in the RE/MAX system, who allegedly sold company 
franchise rights in Cuba to Marshall in violation of U.S. embargo 
laws, and concealed those sales from RE/MAX International. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased with the prompt action taken by the court,''  
said Daryl Jesperson, president of RE/MAX International. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary restraining order bars Marshall and Inmocuba from  
using the RE/MAX name in any way. Any violation of the order could 
result in civil or criminal sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	RE/MAX International now plans to seek a similar injunction that  
would bar any improper use of the name until the lawsuit is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall told the Miami Herald in an interview last week he paid  
$75,000 to RE/MAX's Caribbean subfranchiser to use the name and 
open five offices in Cuba. The company has been doing business for 
at least a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought their attorneys had found the magic agreement to  
get around U.S. laws,'' Marshall said, referring to RE/MAX 
executives. ``They knew full well I was here. Now they've had some 
sort of memory loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesperson said his company never received any money from  
Marshall and learned of the Cuban firm's existence several months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``RE/MAX is not doing business in Cuba, and despite the  
distorted and self-serving statements attributed to Mr. Marshall in 
the media, has not authorized any individual or company to use the 
name RE/MAX in Cuba.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official said the government is looking into  
the RE/MAX trademark complaints. The United States has an embargo 
on business with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Euro, Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro fell yet again to a new low Thursday,  
reflecting continued disappointment with European economic 
fundamentals and unease about the realistic possibility of peace in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen on revived  
speculation that China would devalue its currency. The yuan has 
remained the stable currency of the region during two years of 
financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro fell to $1.0343 from $1.0355  
Wednesday and a decrease of more than 11 percent since the euro was 
launched in January. During the trading day, the euro fell as low 
as $1.0303. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 121.66 yen from 121.33 yen  
</P>
<P>
	Traders sold euros and bought dollars Thursday as they wondered  
whether peace had truly arrived in Yugoslavia even after Slobodan 
Milosevic agreed to NATO demands and the withdrawal of Serb troops 
from Kosovo. Some 850,000 ethnic Albanian refugees were to be 
allowed back home. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, meanwhile, will continue its bombing of Yugoslavia because  
President Clinton said he wanted clear confirmation the Serbs fully 
accepted NATO's terms. The airstrikes began at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, meanwhile, has risen against the euro fairly  
steadily since its January launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just part of the same grinding bearish trend we've seen  
since right after the kickoff,'' said Jordan Rosner, chief 
economist at Optima Investment Research in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's lackluster performance is largely attributable to  
Europe's stagnant economy, especially when compared with the 
soaring economy in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, interest rates in the United States are more  
attractive than those in the euro zone and the Federal Reserve has 
indicated it's likely to raise them more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are going to put their money where they can get the  
best return on it,'' Rosner said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.5402 Swiss  
francs from 1.5373, but fell to 1.4759 Canadian dollars from 
1.4799. The British pound rose to $1.6064 from $1.6041. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro no longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8911 German marks, up from 1.8889; 6.3412 French francs, up from 
6.3331; and 1,876.17 Italian lire, up from 1,869.16.

<HEADLINE> Van Gundy Complains About Fouls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Still upset over the officiating in Game  
2, New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said the referees are not 
allowing his point guards to play defense against Indiana's Mark 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also charged Rik Smits and Reggie Miller with taking  
cheap shots at his players and said the Indiana Pacers ``flop'' and 
``whine,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the NBA has come to where the way you try to  
win in the playoffs is by whining. So they whined about 
everything,'' Van Gundy said. ``They're a great team, and I know 
they're trying to take over from Chicago, but they don't have to do 
it in the whining category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks were called for 40 fouls in Game 2, including five in  
the first eight minutes of the game against point guards Charlie 
Ward and Chris Childs while defending Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played the same defense in Game 1 as we did in Game 2. For  
whatever reason, the game was called totally different,'' Van Gundy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he called NBA vice president Rod Thorn on  
Wednesday to discuss the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly galling to the Knicks coach were the fouls called  
when the Pacers ran isolation plays for Jackson on which he used 
his rear end to back toward the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the NBA, you have a right as a defender to hold your  
ground. And in Game 2, that right was taken away from us. The 
offensive player doesn't have a right to drive his shoulder through 
your chest when you're holding a legal guarding position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to flop like they do, we're going to hold our  
ground,'' Van Gundy said. ``Either call the offensive foul -- and 
we're not even asking for that -- or just allow us to hold our 
ground and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also made reference to Antonio Davis predicting that  
it would be the Pacers who would ``deliver the cheap shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And they did. Smits took Chris Childs' head off on a drive,  
and two games in a row Reggie (Miller) has tried to forearm shiver 
Charlie on an away-from-the-basket cut. He's caught him in the 
throat twice, so we're not the team that's physical. They've got 
the physical ones.''

<HEADLINE> Singer Stevie Nicks Hit With Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks and her  
family are being sued for allegedly lending credibility to a woman 
accused of bilking investors in a no-kill animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Britney Marx, 34, faces charges of defrauding someone of nearly  
$400,000 by spending the money on herself instead of building the 
animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nicks, her brother and her mother are accused in the lawsuit  
of assisting Ms. Marx by staying silent about her previous fraud 
convictions and endorsing the shelter. The lawsuit was filed by 
Dale R. Lumb, one of the people Ms. Marx borrowed money from. 
</P>
<P>
	``God knows we had no idea she borrowed any money,'' said  
Barbara Nicks, the singer's mother. ``It just kills me to think she 
borrowed money from people and didn't pay it back.''

<HEADLINE> Life on Jovian Moon Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jupiter's moon Europa probably could not  
support life because oceans beneath the frozen surface could barely 
support single-cell organisms let alone complex species, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists had suggested oceans exist beneath the frozen  
surface on Europa, boosting theories that life could develop on 
Jupiter's fourth-largest moon. The ocean theory was suggested by 
data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	But a layer of ice at least 6 miles deep blocks the sun's  
life-sustaining energy from the water, according to a paper 
published in today's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to find fish swimming in the Europan ocean,''  
said Joseph Kirschvink, one of the authors and a professor of 
geobiology at the California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Organisms could live in the oceans heated by the strain of  
Jupiter's gravitational pull, researchers had said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hate to throw cold water on it, but ... it's basically a  
smothered planet,'' Kirschvink said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible that organisms could derive their energy from  
rust, which is oxidized iron, or through some other source. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are talking about very simple organisms that can live  
on these energy sources,'' said Eric Gaidos, the paper's lead 
author and a geobiologist at Caltech.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. saw this fight coming almost  
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew when Reggie Johnson moved in with him and his father and  
began training with Roy Jones that the boxers were on a collision 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``What my father didn't understand was that it was inevitable  
that we would one day meet in the ring,'' Jones said Thursday. ``I 
knew it right away. I knew we were both headed for the championship 
and we'd have to settle it between us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Jones, who holds the WBC and WBA light  
heavyweight championships, and Johnson, the IBF titleholder, will 
unify the title for the first time in 14 years. The last time there 
was an undisputed champion was in 1985, when Michael Spinks held 
the titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters have a tempestuous history. Both trained with the  
elder Jones in 1991 and even sparred against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had been trained by his father throughout his amateur and  
early pro career. But he called his father's decision to bring 
Johnson into his training program the final straw that broke their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to bring someone in to get me ready for the race,  
it shouldn't have been the horse I was going to have to run 
against,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Father and son had a bitter split, not even speaking to each  
other for years. Although they have since reconciled and now talk, 
Jones said many of their ties remain broken. He doesn't blame 
Johnson, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all. We both have a lot of respect for each other,''  
Jones said. ``There aren't going to be any mind games or any other 
kind of games. There's just going to be some big boxing. This is 
going to be the real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, is 39-1 as a professional, with 33 knockouts. He has  
successfully defended his WBC title three times, the WBC 
championship once. He won his last fight by stopping New York City 
policeman Rick Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 32, is 39-5-1 with 24 KOs. He is 7-4 in championship  
fights, with all his losses in close, disputed decisions. His last 
fight was Feb. 27 when he took a 12-round unanimous decision 
against top-ranked contender Will Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be the toughest fight of my life,'' Johnson  
said. ``I have a lot of respect for Roy. I know how tough he is, 
how good he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscing about their days as sparring partners, Jones said he  
remembered the damage Johnson could do with either hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very heavyhanded, knockout power in either hand,''  
Jones said. ``He's a big puncher, a good defensive fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Jones was a guy who could hurt you fast and often.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has extremely fast hands, he's very smart,'' Johnson said.  
``He's a little flashier than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other title fights are on Saturday night's card. IBF  
cruiserweight champion Arthur Williams will make his first defense 
against Vasilly Jirov, the fourth-ranked challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	IBF lightweight champion Roberto Garcia will defend against No.  
2 Derrick Gainer. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO will broadcast the fights.

<HEADLINE> Sprinters Coast Into NCAA Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Leigh Daniel of Texas Tech was a shoe-in  
once she got her shoe on. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last event at the NCAA track championships Wednesday  
night, Daniel started the women's 10,000 meters as the prerace 
favorite. But in the second lap, somebody stepped on the back of 
her shoe, and it came loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to hold on to it with my toes, but decided that wasn't  
going to work in such a long race,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She stopped and tried to tug it back on, but finally had to  
reach down and retie the shoe. When she started again, the race 
leaders were half a lap ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was confident I could catch up,'' she said. ``I knew it was  
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few laps later, she rejoined the leaders. She took the lead at  
the start of the next-to-last lap and won going away in 34 minutes, 
1.63 seconds. Daniel, the NCAA indoor 5,000 meter champion, will 
try for a double in that event Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be lying down a lot between now and then,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The four-day meet continues tonight at Boise State University  
with 12 finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into tonight's competition, Southern Methodist was first  
among the women with 20 points, followed by UCLA with 12, 
Pittsburgh and Kansas State with 10 each and Southern California 
with 9. Defending champion Texas had just four points after two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, which finished 1-2-3 in Wednesday's 10,000 meter race,  
continued to lead the men with the 24 points won in that race. The 
Cardinal were in good shape to pick up more points with a strong 
contingent in tonight's 5,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn was second with 13 points, followed by seven-time  
defending champion Arkansas, Tennessee, Southern Methodist and 
Kansas State with 10 points each. Indiana State have eight points, 
with Northern Arizona, Mississippi and California having six each. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's top collegiate sprinters mostly coasted into  
tonight's semifinals. Nanceen Perry of Texas and Louisiana State's 
Peta-Gaye Dowdie had the best times, 11.19 seconds, but some of the 
other top competitors said they took it easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to run smart races,'' said Southern Cal's Angela  
Williams, a freshman who easily moved into the semifinals with 
teammate Torri Edwards. ``You've got to believe you can make it to 
the next level. That's what we're here for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kaaron Conwright of Cal Poly-San Luis had the best qualifying  
time among the men, 10.12 seconds. Defending champion Leonard 
Myles-Mills of Brigham Young finished third in his heat and moved 
into the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's John Capel, who won the third heat, had an easy time,  
winning in a slow 10.31. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coach told me to blast out the first 60 (meters) and relax  
the rest of the race. That's what I did,'' Capel said. ``Don't try 
to kill yourself (in the first round). I can go a lot faster than 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melvin Lister of Arkansas won a controversy-filled long jump.  
Frankie Young of Indiana State had the same distance, 26 feet 10 
inches, but Lister's last jump was better than Young's second-best 
effort, so he was declared the winner. But there was a delay before 
the event was decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi's Savante Stringfellow was disqualified for bad  
sportsmanship, but after an appeal, he was reinstated. That allowed 
him to complete his last three jumps after the other competitors 
were finished. He finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Lister's victory continued a long tradition for the Razorbacks.  
Since 1984, Arkansas has won eight long jump titles and 11 triple 
jump crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's Tom Pappas won the decathlon with 8,184 points,  
winning four of the 10 events. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Methodist's Kajsa Bergqvist won the women's high jump  
at 6-2 3/4, and UCLA's Sua Seilalu won the shot put at 57 feet, 9 
inches. She qualified in four throwing events, but decided to skip 
the hammer and javelin and concentrate on the discus and shot put. 
She will try for a double in the discus Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not go for a sure 20 points for my team when I know I can  
win the shot put and the discus,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Electrical Workers OK New Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASCAGOULA, Miss. (AP) -- Striking electrical workers approved a  
new contract Thursday with Ingalls Shipbuilding, a major 
shipbuilder for the Navy and Mississippi's largest private 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 733  
approved the contract by more than 50 votes -- a step that may end a 
nearly month-long strike at Ingalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 733, which represents about 1,200 of Ingalls's 11,500  
workers, is the first of 11 striking unions to ratify the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Metal Trades Council, which represents 6,500 workers, will  
conduct voting Friday. Two other unions representing Ingalls 
employees accepted a contract earlier this month, before some 7,000 
workers went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Local 733 leaders said the new contract offers improvements to  
pay scales and insurance costs that had doomed a deal last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good package,'' said Chico McGill, business manager for  
the Electrical Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	McGill said the new 45-month package offers increased  
journeyman's wages of $1 per hour for the first 14 months; 60 cents 
per hour for 15 months and 70 cents per hour for 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous package offered raises of 93 cents an hour the  
first year; 50 cents per hour the second year and 47 cents an hour 
the third. It also called for $10 annual increases in employee-paid 
health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pending agreement, McGill said insurance rates will  
increase by $5 in each of the three years. 
</P>
<P>
	An attendance bonus also will be extended into the new contract,  
McGill said. Workers will receive 37 cents per hour if they work 
the 40-day period (40 hours a week) without missing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This equates to a 16.3 percent wage increase over the life of  
the contract,'' McGill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingalls, a builder of Navy destroyers, is a division of Litton  
Industries, which controls a number of aerospace, defense and 
electronics businesses.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Ready for Triple Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In his Hall of Fame career, D. Wayne Lukas has  
trained 18 Eclipse Award winners, won 13 Breeders' Cup races and 
saddled the winners of four Kentucky Derbies and five Preakness 
Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won three Belmont Stakes in a row, from 1994-96, and  
that experience could work to his advantage on Saturday, when he 
sends out Charismatic in his bid to become only the 12th horse in 
history to sweep the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first couple of times I tried it, I came away very, very  
humbled and very, very distressed over the Belmont Stakes,'' said 
Lukas, whose first Belmont starter, Preakness winner Codex, 
finished seventh in the 1 1/2-mile race in 1980. ``And then we had a 
little bit of success with it, but ironically, the three times we 
won it, we won it with three different horses with three different 
characteristics. There's no how-to manual -- it's a constant 
learning process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same might be said of Lukas' handling of Charismatic, who  
along with the trainer arrived at Belmont Park on Wednesday from 
Louisville. Charismatic, who won the Derby at odds of 31-1 and the 
Preakness at 8-1, was made the 2-1 morning-line favorite and drew 
post No. 4 under Chris Antley for the $1 million Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	A winner of only one race in his first nine starts, the  
well-bred, high-priced Charismatic so befuddled Lukas that the 
trainer twice risked losing him by sending him out in claiming 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of February, Lukas changed tactics with the big  
colt and began working him hard and shortening up the time between 
his races. He finished second in an allowance on Feb. 19, second in 
the El Camino Real Derby two weeks later and then a respectable 
fourth in the Santa Anita Derby on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Santa Anita race was not conducive to Charismatic's  
success,'' said Lukas, who has saddled 14 starters in the Belmont 
since 1980. ``But the three he just won (the April 18 Coolmore 
Lexington, the Derby and the Preakness) and this one, the Belmont, 
are a much better fit. He's a horse that has responded at every 
turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a break of 21 days since the Preakness, it will be the  
first time since the Santa Anita Derby that Charismatic has not 
raced back in two weeks, but Lukas remained confident in the colt's 
ability to handle the final leg of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a very good work horse, but he responded well  
yesterday, so we're back in the race here,'' said Lukas, referring 
to Charismatic's 5-furlong work of 1:00 4-5 at Churchill Downs on 
Tuesday. ``One of the things you have to like about going into this 
race is that the horse would have the bounce-back ability -- go to 
the Derby, come back and run a big one in the Preakness, and 
hopefully have one more left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would give Lukas the one prize that has eluded him -- the  
Triple Crown, last won in 1978 by Affirmed. In all, 25 horses have 
headed into the Belmont with a chance to win racing's most coveted 
trophy, and only 11 have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic heads into the Belmont as the favorite in a 12-horse  
field that includes Derby and Preakness runner-up Menifee (7-2), 
the Bob Baffert-trained filly Silverbulletday (4-1), and Best of 
Luck (6-1), who won the Peter Pan Stakes for trainer Allen Jerkens 
with an impressive late rush in his last start. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered Wednesday were the Nick Zito-trained duo of Stephen  
Got Even (10-1) and Adonis (20-1), Lemon Drop Kid (20-1), Vision 
and Verse (20-1), Patience Game (20-1), Pineaff (30-1), Prime 
Directive (30-1) and Teletable (99-1). 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second biggest field in a Belmont with a Triple Crown  
on the line. In 1971, Pass Catcher denied Canonero II the Triple 
Crown in a 13-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lukas, along with owners Bob and Beverly Lewis, say they are  
delighted with a full field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not being cocky, but I hope everybody that has a Belmont  
horse is ready to run,'' Lukas, wearing his trademark white cowboy 
hat, said, ``so on Sunday morning, when they all talk about this, 
whether it's us, or somebody else (winning), we'll know who the 
best horse was on that day at a mile-and-a half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tabasco Cat gave Lukas his first Belmont win in 1994, and the  
trainer followed up wins from Thunder Gulch and Editor's Note. If 
Charismatic wins the Belmont and the Triple Crown, the Lewises 
would also get a $5 million bonus from series sponsor VISA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charismatic's had three great runs for us and we're delighted  
to get this far,'' Lukas said. ``If we can get one more, we'll be 
very happy, and if we don't we'll still be happy.''

<HEADLINE> Baffert Downplays Lukas Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bob Baffert does not warm to the task easily.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, he lost a $5 million bonus by the length of a  
thoroughbred's nose. The year before, he left the same $5 million 
on the table when his horse came up four strides short of winning 
the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``How would I feel watching someone else walk off with one?''  
Baffert repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pause.  
</P>
<P>
	Bloodshot eyes flicker behind the trademark amber shades, the  
result of allergies or revelry. Baffert does not say. He climbed 
out of a car at 9:40 a.m., several hours after everybody else in 
the training fraternity arrived, and threw the session open to 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	This question, though, is tough, and made tougher still because  
the ``someone else'' in this case -- the only someone who can win 
the Belmont and a Triple Crown this year -- is ubertrainer D. Wayne 
Lukas, whose rivalry with Baffert is the biggest the sport can 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
	They bid on the same yearlings, court the same owners, covet the  
same prizes. Between 1994 and 1996, Lukas won six Triple Crown 
races in a row, though he failed to sweep the Kentucky Derby, 
Preakness and Belmont in the same year with the same horse. The 
last two years, it was Baffert who came to New York with a shot at 
the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the shoe is back on Lukas' foot. So Baffert struggles to say  
something kind, or even better, something neutral. This is what 
comes out: 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of it that way. Win, lose or draw, believe me  
Wayne will be glad when it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no question which of those fates Baffert would wish for  
Lukas and his brilliant colt, Charismatic. Indeed, some people 
think Baffert is so desperate to stop his archrival that he is 
risking his equally brilliant filly, Silverbulletday, by throwing 
her in with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran a pair of colts and his other filly, Excellent Meeting,  
against Lukas' two horses in the Kentucky Derby and got whipped. He 
brought Excellent Meeting back for the Preakness and she developed 
a breathing problem before being eased on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert entered and then scratched Silverbulletday from both  
those races. But if he has any lingering concerns, bravado 
steamrolls them now. 
</P>
<P>
	``All her times have been faster than the colts. We had to wait  
for the right time,'' he said, ``and this is the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has been lashed in the past -- sometimes unfairly -- for  
pushing horses to the limit and beyond. Two days earlier, he 
forcefully reminded some reporters what would have happened if he 
and Baffert's roles had been reversed -- if he'd been the trainer 
with one promising filly eased in the Preakness and a second 
pressed into service in the toughest of spring classics as a 
spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lukas didn't bring it up again Thursday, when an air of  
civility as thick as the early summer haze hung over Belmont's 
barns. With the race little more than 48 hours off, it wasn't just 
the horses who refused to talk trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the Knicks and Miami, with Van Gundy and Riley  
going at it,'' said Lukas, who coached basketball before he turned 
to horses. ``It's not just the two of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas and Baffert came up through the thoroughbred ranks when  
deans like Charlie Whittingham and Woody Stephens took the measure 
of one another in the newspapers almost daily. Back then, a 
well-timed barb could make a rival chafe just as much as sticking a 
burr under the saddle of his mount. And Lukas was a frequent 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	They were amused because he had grooms manicure the grounds  
around his stable and insisted the bridles and buckets and blankets 
be stacked just so. They had fun with the creases in his jeans and 
the starch in his manner. He was already racing's organization man 
and his desire to win was so raw that Stephens and Whittingham 
never lacked for material with which to taunt him. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert is 18 years Lukas' junior and the funnier of the two.  
They have little in common, but as the rivalry deepened, Baffert 
began to value Lukas more as a foe than a foil. 
</P>
<P>
	Both started in the quarterhorse racket, learning to make do  
with a shoestring budget. Both learned to spot talent in a 
heartbeat and get it for a song. Both learned to break the horses 
themselves in order to train them. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that both have the best of everything and all the help they  
need, they need each other as a way to measure how far they have 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have respect for each other,'' Baffert said. ``Even though  
we're not great friends, we know when we run against each other 
that we have to be ready.

	Serb Parliament OKs Kosovo Deal  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's parliament overwhelmingly  
approved a Western-backed peace plan for Kosovo designed to end the 
mass expulsions of ethnic Albanians and the NATO bombing campaign 
on Yugoslavia, parliamentary deputies said today. The plan provides 
for a series of steps, including a meaningful and verifiable Serb 
withdrawal, after which NATO will halt the attacks. No vote totals 
in the 250-member assembly were released but delegates said members 
of the Serb Radical Party, which controls 82 seats, voted against 
the plan. The alliance will likely continue its airstrikes until it 
sees verifiable signs that a large-scale Serb withdrawal from 
Kosovo has begun.

	WTO Approves EU Beef Sanctions  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization today approved a U.S.  
and Canadian request to impose sanctions against the European Union 
because of its ban on hormone-treated beef imports, trade officials 
said. The WTO also agreed to an EU request for a neutral 
arbitration panel to assess the amount due. The panel should report 
back by mid-July, delaying the implementation of any sanctions 
until then. The United States wants to impose retaliatory sanctions 
against $202 million of EU exports to compensate for lost trade. 
Canada has threatened sanctions on trade worth $51 million. The EU 
says the figures are too high.

the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In a separate attack, an Israeli 
soldier fatally shot a Palestinian motorist at an army roadblock 
after he allegedly tried to hit the soldier with his car. The 
marches, organized by the Palestinian Authority on what it 
designated a ``day of rage,'' were intended to exert pressure on 
Israel's moderate prime minister-elect, Ehud Barak.

one person and injuring five others, military officials said. 
Officials don't know what caused the MH-53J Pave Low aircraft to go 
down last night. Military police were guarding the crash site 
pending the arrival of investigators. Five of the six crew members

a news report said. Yeltsin had been planning to take the action 
for some time and is pushing the reluctant parliament to abolish 
the death penalty altogether. Yeltsin issued the decree today after 
the presidential commission for pardons reviewed the cases of all 
716 convicts on death row and recommended that they be given either 
life sentences or 25-year prison terms, the Interfax news agency 
said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Up; Dow Gains 38.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mostly higher on Wall Street today  
as the modest rally that lifted technology stocks late Wednesday 
spread to blue-chips. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 38.31 at  
10,616.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 3.81 at 1,298.62, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 5.35 at 2,427.06. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow closed 18.37 lower at 10,577.89, but other  
market indicators rose as investors began seeking bargains. 
Technology stocks that have been battered over the past few weeks 
were snapped up at their new, lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, however, the volatile Internet companies led the  
technology sector right back down. Amazon.com fell 2 15/16 to 109 
3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, gains were broad-based, with Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 1  
7/16 at 93 1/8, leading the Dow components. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest retailers were mostly higher after  
stronger-than-expected sales in May indicated that Americans are 
still ready and willing to spend money. Wal-Mart rose 1 1/8 to 45 1/2 and 
Gap Inc. rose 2 7/8 to 65 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron rose 1 15/16 to 93 15/16 and Texaco fell 9/16 to 63  
15/16 after the companies called off merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The market is waiting for the Friday morning release of the  
Labor Department's unemployment data. Traders are especially 
interested in the wage component of the report, which could offer 
the latest indication of whether inflation has returned to the U.S. 
economy -- and whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 
when its Open Market Committee meets later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a separate report showed the number of Americans filing  
new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, but only a 
slight 4,000 to 305,000. That level is still considered extremely 
low unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 228.6 million shares, 
slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.06 at 622.56, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.44 at 773.67.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Sues UBS, Chase Manhattan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sumitomo Corp. has sued the banking companies UBS  
AG of Switzerland and Chase Manhattan Corp. of the United States, 
demanding compensation for loans provided a former employee who 
caused huge losses from illegal copper trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge trading company said it filed a lawsuit today against  
UBS and employees at the Tokyo District Court seeking $230 million 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo said it also filed a lawsuit yesterday against Chase  
Manhattan in U.S. District Court in New York seeking $532 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chase views these claims by Sumitomo as entirely unwarranted  
and Chase intends to defend the case vigorously,'' said Ken Herz, a 
spokesman for the New York-based bank. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS spokeswoman Monika Dunant in Basel said the Swiss bank  
contests any compensation claim by Sumitomo in relation to past 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS and Chase Manhattan lent Yasuo Hamanaka, the former Sumitomo  
trader, funds for his illegal copper dealings without a funding 
contract, although both knew Hamanaka did not have the authority to 
receive such credit, the lawsuits say. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo earlier paid $532 million to Chase Manhattan and $257.4  
million to UBS to cover credit extended to Hamanaka. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sumitomo accused the banks of ``illegal behavior'' and is  
now seeking to recover the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to take appropriate action, including legal  
action, to recover damages suffered by our company,'' Sumitomo said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1996, Sumitomo said it lost $2.6 billion from  
Hamanaka's unauthorized copper trading. It has since paid millions 
of dollars in class action lawsuits filed by copper traders and 
others over trading in Japan and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamanaka was sentenced to eight years in prison in March 1998 by  
the Tokyo District Court on forgery and fraud convictions. Sumitomo 
has filed a separate civil lawsuit against Hamanaka.

<HEADLINE> French Open Fans Must Endure Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Tennis fans haven't let a citywide transport strike  
stop them from seeing action at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	They've hitched rides, endured traffic jams and reached the  
stadium on foot, rollerblades or bicycyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Paris transport workers walked off the job Wednesday following  
erroneous reports that a ticket inspector died after being attacked 
by thugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But most Metro lines were running with partial service by  
mid-afternoon after officials announced that the ticket inspector 
died of natural causes, not a violent attack. 
</P>
<P>
	With no warning of the strike, French Open organizers said they  
were unable to provide extra buses or parking facilities for 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact was evident around the stadium in western Paris, with  
heavy traffic and scores of bikes chained up outside the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	With taxis almost impossible to find, some fans resorted to  
rollerblading or jogging to catch a piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
	But attendance figures haven't been impacted.  
</P>
<P>
	Tournament organizers said that 17,217 spectators showed up on  
Wednesday, just 273 fewer than on the same day last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Nash, a tennis coach from London visiting Roland Garros with  
his wife, rides from sympathetic Parisians. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Wednesday, I knocked on a car window and the driver dropped  
me about a five minutes walk from the courts,'' said Nash, who is 
staying at a hotel five miles across town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I carried a sign with `Roland Garros' written on it and  
got a lift after ten minutes,'' he said. ``I can't believe how 
friendly and helpful people have been. I don't think that would 
ever happen in London.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others have put up with heavy delays.  
</P>
<P>
	Michel Bernadeau, a sales account manager from Paris, treated  
his 11-year-old daughter Nathalie to a visit to the women's 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	It took him more than an hour for a drive what would normally  
take 15 minutes, but he has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time I've got tickets for Roland Garros, so  
it was worth it,'' he said. ``Anyway I had no choice because my 
daughter is the No. 1 fan of Martina Hingis.''

<HEADLINE> College Choir Helps at Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- There were shoves and cries of fear on  
American Airlines Flight 1420 as frantic passengers clambered to 
get out of the burning plane and into the stormy night. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was also selflessness at the terrifying scene. Choir  
members from an Arkansas college have emerged as heroes, risking 
their lives to make sure fellow passengers made it out of the 
flaming, smoke-filled wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Ouachita Singers, a choir from Ouachita Baptist  
University in Arkadelphia, went back into the aircraft to retrieve 
the elderly and the injured. They also guided others to safety and 
told rescuers about those who needed help. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pulled off their shirts and covered the injured,'' said  
Arnold Bowden, a 63-year-old retired real estate dealer from 
Russellville who was on the flight. ``I never saw people so kind 
and so helpful to each other as they were in this disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 145 people aboard were were killed in Tuesday's  
crash after the plane slid off a runway during a powerful storm and 
was torn apart by a light tower. The jet ended up only yards from 
the Arkansas River. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 25 people traveling in the choir party, one was presumed  
dead Wednesday night and two were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The choir was returning from a two-week trip to Europe, where  
members entertained German school children and Kosovo refugees in 
Austria. They had planned to tour China, but rescheduled after the 
NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade forced a 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
	After a stopover in Dallas, the Ouachita party boarded Flight  
1420 to Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouachita senior Luke Hollingsworth remembers seats collapsing  
and a black smoke that filled the cabin. He and several others 
escaped through a rip in the tail section and began pulling people 
out after them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollingsworth went back to the cockpit to check on the pilots.  
</P>
<P>
	``The pilot was dead,'' said Hollingsworth, 21. ``The co-pilot,  
he was alive. He was talking to us. He asked, `Is the pilot dead?' 
and I said, `Yeah, he's dead.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was calm. From the waist up, he was OK, but his legs looked  
like they were broken, crushed up pretty bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tad Hardin found Kristin Maddox, 22, of Ponca City, Okla. -- a  
bridesmaid at his June 12 wedding -- leaning against the bumper of a 
fire truck. Blackened skin was peeling from her face and hands, and 
Hardin lost no time shepherding her to an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though there were professionals on the scene, we realized  
they were just as confused as we were,'' Hardin said. ``On foot, we 
were pretty much equal ... out there in the rain and the hail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardin said he was inspired by watching choir director Charles  
Fuller, whose own 14-year-old daughter Rachel was critically burned 
in the crash, guiding passengers onto the wing of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't so much that I could see him, but I heard his voice  
and I saw his silhouette and I knew that if he was there things 
were going to he handled smoothly and orderly, and he wasn't going 
to leave until everyone was out of there,'' Hardin said. ``He 
didn't even know where his own children were and he was right there 
helping total strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was really being the father for all of us.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hollingsworth, a 6-foot-2 fullback on the school football team,  
carried a woman with a broken pelvis through the river's backwater 
on his shoulders. Before he left her in the triage area, he gave 
her his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all I had,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dave Ozmun, an assistant mass communications professor who was  
along to videotape the choir's tour, lost his glasses and had to 
listen for voices as he led people out of the billowing smoke. He 
said he was very proud of his students. 
</P>
<P>
	``All through the trip -- and certainly last night -- I saw a  
level of maturity and courage and strength,'' Ozmun said Wednesday. 
``I didn't hear people screaming. I knew that they would not only 
be able to take care of themselves, but they would be able to take 
care of others too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The singers said their faith helped them, and Hardin said the  
words of the 91st Psalm echoed in his head during the rescue: 
``Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night.''

<HEADLINE> Gene Study Might Help Hemophiliacs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh  
Medical Center are testing a new hemophilia therapy that could stop 
disease sufferers from bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Miller, 50, is the first patient to use the gene therapy  
designed by California-based Chiron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	For 43 years, Miller has been going to the hospital for  
treatment of hemophilia A, a disease that prevents his blood from 
clotting and causes severe bleeding in his joints and body 
cavities. 
</P>
<P>
	He uses a needle-administered treatment that stops bleeding  
after it starts, but the therapy could prompt his body to produce 
blood-clotting protein before he bleeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``No needle sticks,'' Miller said Thursday. ``And I wouldn't be  
as afraid of hurting myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gene therapy is injected into the veins of the hand and  
travels through the blood. The idea is for the friendly virus shell 
to carry the blood-clotting protein called factor VIII into the 
patient's body, where it will take up residence in cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a virus that's gutted of all its junk,'' said Dr.  
Margaret V. Ragni, professor of medicine at the University of 
Pittsburgh and director of the Hemophilia Treatment Center of 
Western Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemophilia A is passed on genetically and affects only males.  
About one in every 10,000 men has the disorder, and pooling of 
blood in the joints often leads to crippling arthritis in later 
life when the enzymes in blood dissolve cartilage between the 
joints. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is the first of what researchers hope will be several  
human test cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``With humans, we don't really know, and that's why we're very  
interested to be starting these trials,'' Dr. Deborah Hurst, who 
designs clinical trial plans and protocol for Chiron.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Moves Closer to N.Y. Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton intends to form an  
exploratory committee in early July, preparing her for a potential 
Senate campaign in New York next year, a top adviser said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She would be the first sitting first lady to run for public  
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Ickes, who is heading up Mrs. Clinton's political  
operation, disclosed the plans after Rep. Nita Lowey said, in a 
telephone call to the first lady, that she would seek re-election 
to the House. That move leaves the Democratic field clear for Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her it seemed clear she was running ... I wished her  
well,'' said Lowey, who also had been eyeing the Senate race. ``I 
told her I would support her enthusiastically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Mrs. Clinton said, ``I thank Nita for her  
support and I look forward to working with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no mention of her own plans.  
</P>
<P>
	Lowey said she did not ask Mrs. Clinton if she would seek the  
seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. ``It's 
clear to me she was running and it was time for me to move on,'' 
the congresswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Mrs. Clinton's conversation with Lowey, Ickes said,  
``I think you can discern that Hillary is going to press forward 
and she will be forming an exploratory committee in early July and 
just keep moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a subsequent conversation, Ickes, a former deputy White House  
chief of staff, said he meant to say that Mrs. Clinton intends to 
form a committee in July. 
</P>
<P>
	He cautioned that formation of a committee does not necessarily  
mean Mrs. Clinton will seek the seat. ``This is one step at a 
time,'' he said. ``The initial step forward is to form the 
exploratory committee and continue to talk to the people of New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton met Thursday with political mastermind James  
Carville. Asked whether they discussed the New York Senate race, 
Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said, ``They both have a 
love of politics, so it wouldn't surprise me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the exploratory committee, Berry said, ``We are not  
announcing an exploratory committee and the actions taken by 
Congresswoman Lowey today do not affect Mrs. Clinton's 
decision-making process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think exploring New York is a good thing. Maybe she should  
explore New York a little,'' New York Mayor Rudloph Giuliani 
quipped to reporters when told of Ickes' remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani formed his own exploratory committee six weeks ago in  
anticiapation of seeking the Republican nomination for Moynihan's 
seat in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Staying in Washington on Thursday after a campaign-like foray  
into New York City the previous day, Mrs. Clinton spoke at high 
school graduation and posed for Paris fashion photographer Michel 
Comte. The photo shoot was for an upcoming cover story in Talk 
magazine, the latest project of Tina Brown, the former editor of 
The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers have said for days that Mrs. Clinton intended to form  
an exploratory committee, but Ickes was the first to say it on the 
record. Advisers also have said it would require a major change of 
heart for Mrs. Clinton to decide against a campaign after forming 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Formation of an exploratory committee will allow Mrs. Clinton to  
begin raising money. That means she can begin paying for some of 
her travel to New York, for polling and other campaign expenses. 
She already has come under fire for making campaign-style trips to 
New York at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Hope, the state's Democratic Party chairwoman, said that  
while she was disappointed to lose Lowey as a potential statewide 
candidate for next year, ``I'm happy we have a united Democratic 
Party in New York, unlike the Republicans who seem to be split into 
two or three separate camps.''

<HEADLINE> Violence at Baseball Game Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mike Hargrove keeps a photograph of ``10-cent  
Beer Night'' hanging on his office wall at Jacobs Field, a reminder 
of a night 25 years ago when Cleveland Stadium became a 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was crazy,'' said Hargrove, a rookie for the Texas Rangers  
in 1974. ``Absolutely crazy. I remember not feeling safe until we 
got back to the hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago today, thousands of Cleveland fans, many  
of them drunk on 10-cent beer, turned a seemingly harmless 
promotion during a game between the Indians and Rangers into a 
night of violence that left players, spectators and umpires 
bloodied. 
</P>
<P>
	Memories of the infamous night still shake Jim Fregosi.  
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of punches thrown,'' said the Toronto  
manager, who was playing first base for the Rangers that night. ``A 
lot of people got hurt. Players got hit with chairs over their 
heads. It was nasty. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's as much as I want to remember. It was awful,'' he said.  
``They needed the riot squad to get us out of the stadium. It was a 
mad house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans fought with fans, with police, with the Rangers and the  
Indians, many of whom ran on the field to protect their Texas 
counterparts. Umpire Nestor Chylak and Indians reliever Tom 
Hilgendorf were both struck in the head with chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like we were in a battle zone,'' umpire Joe Brinkman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 25,134 showed up that warm Tuesday night enticed by  
the chance to drink as many beers as they could handle for 10 cents 
apiece. And by the end of the night, it was estimated that over 
60,000 cups were quaffed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble had been brewing between the teams after Rangers second  
baseman Lenny Randle intentionally ran over Cleveland pitcher Milt 
Wilcox a week earlier. Rangers fans doused the Indians with beer 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Texas arrived in Cleveland, Indians fans were ready and  
the cheap beer was additional fuel. When Rangers manager Billy 
Martin delivered his lineup card before the game, he was booed. 
Never one to back down, he responded by tipping his cap and blowing 
kisses. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, armed with a bat, Martin was running from the fans.  
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said nothing prepared him for the violence he would  
later witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember a father and son going out to center field and  
mooning everybody,'' Hargrove said. ``Streakers were running across 
the field and I remember one woman coming out and running over to 
kiss an umpire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the sixth inning with the Rangers leading 5-1, the crowd had  
gotten rowdier and bolder. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups of fans began running onto the field. Initially, they  
dashed out between innings, then between outs and finally between 
pitches. Some stopped to shake hands with players before being 
escorted off the field by a badly outnumbered security force. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Indians closed to 5-3 in the sixth, fireworks and other  
projectiles were being launched toward the Texas dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember getting spit on a lot and having a lot of hot dogs  
thrown at me,'' Hargrove said. ``Somebody threw a gallon jug of 
Thunderbird wine at me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing things were getting worse in the seventh, the Rangers  
pitchers vacated their bullpen and headed to the relative safety of 
the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the ninth, and mayhem.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland scored two runs to tie it 5-5. More fans poured onto  
the field in celebration and one threw a punch at Texas right 
fielder Jeff Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	He punched back, and in an instant, he was surrounded by a dozen  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when Billy grabbed a bat,'' said photographer Ron  
Kuntz, standing next to the Texas dugout. ``I'll always remember 
this, he grabbed a bat and said, `Let's get 'em boys.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rangers started going after that guy and before you knew  
it, there were thousands of fans all over the field. I was scared. 
The only thing I can compare it to was when I was covering riots in 
Venezuela and there were guys with Uzis running around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once he knew all the players had escaped the field, Chylak gave  
the Rangers the 9-0 forfeit, one of only four forfeits in the last 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While wiping away blood, Chylak told the Lorain Journal, ``We  
went as far as we could go, but you can't pull back uncontrollable 
beasts. The last time I saw animals like that was in the zoo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Grieve, now a broadcaster for the Rangers, said when he  
heard the game had been forfeited, he was relieved for his safety 
and that the two homers he hit were safely in the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid they wouldn't count. Fortunately, they did. I  
didn't hit many, so I needed those two,'' said Grieve, who hit 65 
in a nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Hargrove, Brinkman still has a picture.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember holding on to a guy who had been kicked in the  
head. I'm holding him and blood is running down his face,'' 
Brinkman said. ``I think there were about 10,000 people on the 
field at one time. It was scary.''

<HEADLINE> Gambling Panel Makes Recommendations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The federal gambling commission, wrapping  
up its two-year effort Thursday, urged a slowdown in new casinos 
and lotteries nationwide, an increase to 21 in the minimum betting 
age and more help for addicted gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	The federally appointed panel also recommended curbing political  
contributions by the gambling industry and banning betting on 
college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Concluding two days of meetings here, the nine members of the  
National Gambling Impact Study Commission voted unanimously to 
adopt a report nearly 300 pages long. Commissioner J. Terrence 
Lanni, a casino executive, had threatened to write a minority 
report, but said he does not plan to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners joked about their wide ideological  
differences, which sometimes rendered consensus elusive and turned 
their meetings testy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed on more than I ever imagined,'' said Commissioner  
Richard Leone. ``We finished with more respect for each other than 
when we started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Membership ranged from casino industry figures like Lanni to  
James Dobson, president of the conservative group Focus on the 
Family. On many key recommendations the panel was divided. 
</P>
<P>
	It voted 5-4, for example, for language urging states to  
consider a moratorium on new expansions of lotteries and casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the commission unanimously called on insurance  
companies and managed care providers to cover treatment plans for 
pathological gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel could not reach consensus on the booming gambling  
industry's impact on American society, and said more research was 
needed on that question. 
</P>
<P>
	The report will be presented to Congress, the White House, state  
governors and Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	At its final meeting, the commission struggled over Indian  
reservation casinos, which in the past decade have developed into 
the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. gambling boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The only American Indian on the panel, Alaska businessman Robert  
Loescher, said the draft report overstated the potential spread of 
Indian casinos and understated gambling's unique ability to help 
tribes make money. 
</P>
<P>
	Loescher did press successfully for a sentence in the report  
declaring that the commission found no evidence ``suggesting any 
viable approach to economic development across the broad spectrum 
of Indian country, in the absence of gaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also unanimously approved a last-minute  
additional recommendation calling on states to curtail the growth 
of new lottery games, reduce lottery advertising and limit 
locations of lottery machines. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday the panel had unanimously approved a package of  
recommendations for further research. Commissioners urged the 
National Institutes of Health to study gambling addiction, the 
National Science Foundation to evaluate the costs and benefits of 
gambling and the National Institute of Justice to investigate 
adolescent gambling and sports betting, both legal and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission contended with sharp differences among its  
members -- people reflecting views on both sides of a passionate 
debate on gambling in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-gambling lawmakers grumbled in 1996 when three people who  
make their living in and around Las Vegas casinos were named to the 
nine-person commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in the end, the commissioners managed to reach consensus on  
more than 70 recommendations. They include calls for a nationwide 
minimum age of 21 to place bets -- gambling is legal at 18 in many 
states -- less aggressive state lottery advertising and more funding 
of programs to treat gambling addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the gambling industry, fearing the commission  
would become a runaway jury, worked to weaken its subpoena power in 
1996. Yet in the end, the commission never issued any subpoenas. 
Nor did the commission's anti-gambling members advocate an outright 
ban of gambling or a crippling federal tax on its proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Leone, a former New Jersey treasurer, had been boosted for  
membership on the commission by the state's two Democratic 
senators, Frank Lautenberg and Robert Torricelli, both of whom 
support gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Leone emerged as a driving force behind several of the  
panel's strongest and most controversial recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed the language encouraging a moratorium on further  
expansion of gambling, a call for states to require ``gambling 
impact statements'' before approving new gambling and restrictions 
on political contributions by the gambling industry in state and 
local campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put four or five big issues on the table,'' Leone said.  
``We got the point across that we've come very far, very fast (on 
gambling expansion) without thinking about what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner John Wilhelm, national president of the Hotel  
Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, said that despite ``some 
misguided, inaccurate or unrealistic'' elements, the report is good 
news for casino employees because it does not call for new federal 
taxes or regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner William Bible, former chairman of the Nevada Gaming  
Control Board, said he believes suggestions like the moratorium and 
limits on campaign contributions will be ``discounted, blown off by 
the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted that all nine members of the commission found  
common ground on problem gambling and will issue a strong appeal 
for more research, education and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that will probably be the legacy of this commission,''  
Bible said.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Burton Faces Jail Over DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins defensive lineman Shane Burton  
already has a 2-year-old drunken driving conviction on his record, 
meaning he could get jail time if convicted again for a similar 
arrest last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Motor Vehicle Department records show Burton was  
arrested for driving under the influence in North Carolina on Dec. 
27, 1996. He was convicted the following April. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Florida law, a second DUI conviction within five years  
brings a mandatory jail term of between 10 days and nine months. He 
also would face a fine of between $500 and $1,000, and up to a 
year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old lineman was arrested by Davie police May 9 after  
driving his Lexus east in the westbound lanes of State Road 84 
around 6:30 a.m., according to a Florida Highway Patrol arrest 
report. The car's emergency flashers were on. 
</P>
<P>
	His blood alcohol level was .106, according to the arrest  
report. The legal limit in Florida is .08. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, attorney Adam Swickle and agent Drew Rosenhaus have  
refused comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	League and team officials apparently were not aware of Burton's  
previous conviction, even though it came near the end of Burton's 
rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the league is concerned, Burton has one DUI, and  
it's (the May 9 arrest),'' Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton will have to undergo an evaluation as part of the NFL's  
substance-abuse program. League spokesman Greg Aiello indicated a 
previous conviction could impact those results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior history would be factored in terms of both  
substance-abuse program and possible fines,'' said Aiello, who 
would not comment on Burton specifically, citing confidentiality 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton played as a reserve in 15 games last year, finishing with  
23 tackles, two sacks and one fumble recovery. The 6-foot-4, 
300-pound lineman was the Dolphins' fifth-round draft pick out of 
Tennessee in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Unhappy With Leaf's Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers are a little upset that  
quarterback Ryan Leaf prefers to be at a charity golf tournament in 
New Jersey instead of at the team's minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	While these workouts are voluntary, the Chargers made it clear  
that Leaf should be here, what with his horrendous play as a rookie 
and because new coach Mike Riley continues to put in his offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very disappointing,'' general manager Bobby Beathard  
said. ``We'd love for him to be here. He needs it as much as 
anybody. We just hope he wants to play football as badly as we want 
him to play football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said Leaf told him several weeks ago that he would have a  
conflict due to a charity event, but the coach was under the 
impression it would be for just one day. Riley doesn't expect Leaf 
here until Monday, meaning he will have missed three days of what 
the Chargers call ``summer school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his round Thursday in the NFL Golf Classic, Leaf was asked  
if he had spoken with Riley about his absence, but he basically 
evaded the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we had practice yesterday and today and tomorrow and  
we had the schedule for about a month or so,'' Leaf said. ``But we 
have a summer school next week, too, and I'll be back for that.''

<HEADLINE> Lopez Has High Hopes at Women's Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- If only the scene can be replayed for  
Nancy Lopez on Sunday -- and for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
	There Lopez was on the 18th hole of a U.S. Women's Open, pumping  
her fists in the air as a 12-foot birdie putt dropped into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But the reaction Thursday by Lopez at the end of her first round  
of the 54th Open was more of relief than celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez finished with an opening round 4-over 76 at Old Waverly  
Golf Club, a course where she believes she has her best chance to 
finally win an Open title. The birdie at No. 18 was her only one of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confused. I've been hitting the ball well and putting  
well,'' said the 42-year-old Lopez, who had top-20 finishes in the 
two events leading up to her 23rd Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``That bothers me because I didn't feel nervous. I felt  
confident. I felt good, I felt excited. And when you don't play the 
way you feel, that confuses you a little bit. Maybe I need to feel 
really bad tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is no secret that Lopez would like to face the same scene at  
No. 18 on Sunday -- only this time celebrating that elusive Open 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the first-round 76 and ever-weakening knees, Lopez  
believes she can still make a run this year. The Hall of Famer with 
48 career victories still feels good about her overall game. 
</P>
<P>
	And she knows the Old Waverly course probably better than anyone  
else in the field. She was part of the first official foursome to 
play there 11 years ago and is still an annual visitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to forget today, try to shoot 4- or 5-under Friday and  
hit the way I've been hitting. I'm not going to let the U.S. Open 
get me,'' Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take away two double-bogeys and things wouldn't have been so bad  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 4, a 390-yard par-4, Lopez hit a solid drive in the  
fairway. But her 6-iron approach landed in heavy rough to the right 
of the green. She had to punch a shot over a mound, and then 
three-putted from 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing a 6-foot par putt at No. 5, Lopez had 10 straight  
pars. She ran into trouble again at the 388-yard 16th hole -- again 
with a bad approach shot after a good drive and another three-putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 9-iron approach at No. 16 came up short of the elevated,  
two-tier green. The third shot landed above the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately I had two holes that just really kill you,''  
Lopez said. ``But I did feel good because I did birdie 18. That did 
make me feel like I was coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to take that attitude tomorrow and go out there and  
keep swinging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And swinging harder with her irons.  
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, former major-league player and manager Ray Knight,  
told Lopez after the round that her iron swings were lazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few weeks I have been playing well and made a lot of  
birdies. And today I had the opportunity to make a lot of birdies, 
but I didn't have the irons in my hand,'' Lopez said.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky State Hires Ramsey As AD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Derrick Ramsey, an oversized quarterback  
at Kentucky who became a tight end in the NFL, was hired Wednesday 
as athletic director by Kentucky State. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey takes over on July 1 as athletic chief for the  
historically black NCAA Division II school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Kentucky State now is on the move,'' Ramsey said.  
``The president that we have, President (George) Reid, is a real 
innovative guy, and of course he wants winning football, winning 
basketball and a winning program. Those are things that I have 
loved to do, have longed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said he wants Ramsey to raise Kentucky State's athletic  
profile. 
</P>
<P>
	``What impressed me about him is his fine character as a human  
being and the fact that he wins friends the moment he walks into a 
place,'' he said. ``And that's what Kentucky State University 
needs. We need people desperately who can win friends and 
supporters for us, and Derrick can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey had been working at Kentucky as a community relations  
officer in addition to doing part-time duty as an analyst on local 
Kentucky football telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-time All-Southeastern Conference pick at quarterback,  
Ramsey led Kentucky to a 9-3 record and a Peach Bowl victory in 
1976, and a 10-1 record as a senior in 1977, when the Wildcats were 
on NCAA probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey played tight end for the Oakland-Los Angeles Raiders, New  
England Patriots and Detroit Lions during a pro career that ended 
in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Tax Cut Linked to Insurance Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of American workers will get a modest  
income tax cut this year because of a change in the way the federal 
government figures the value of group life insurance provided by 
their employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Final federal regulations released Thursday, which take effect  
July 1, are based on updated mortality estimates showing that 
people are living longer and that women now make up roughly half 
the U.S. work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service considers group life insurance a  
benefit to the worker that is taxable like regular income, with the 
first $50,000 in coverage exempt. The income shows up each year on 
W-2 forms under code ``C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line of the change: An estimated 163 million workers  
with group term life insurance provided by employers will see cuts 
of 11 percent to 52 percent on the taxable income derived from that 
coverage, depending on a person's age. 
</P>
<P>
	``The net effect for workers is a reduction in the taxes they  
pay for the benefit,'' said Carroll Campbell, president of the 
American Council of Life Insurance, which represents 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It is difficult to show how the change will lower the amount  
someone might owe Uncle Sam, given the many variables in an 
individual's tax picture. But here are two examples of how it will 
reduce taxable income: 
</P>
<P>
	--Under current regulations, a 45-year-old worker who has  
$100,000 in death benefit protection pays taxes on $174 in annual 
income from that insurance policy. The new rules will cut that 
taxable income to $90, a reduction of 48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--A 55-year-old with $200,000 in group coverage will see taxable  
income for that policy reduced from $1,350 to $774, a cut of 43 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Total death benefit coverage by group term life insurance  
provided by employers is estimated by ACLI at about $6.2 trillion. 
Typically, employees get coverage worth at least twice their annual 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	While sales of individual policies have been dropping, group  
coverage sales grew 6.5 percent in 1997 compared with the year 
before. They have become one of the most popular benefits offered 
by companies because of relatively low costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The table the IRS now uses to figure the value of the insurance  
to an individual is rooted in mortality estimates of the 1970s. In 
the early 1990s, the life insurance companies began a campaign to 
modernize the table as it became clear that societal and 
demographic changes were lowering the costs of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies knew the government calculations weren't fair,  
said Laurie Lewis, senior counsel for federal taxes at ACLI. 
``There aren't many times when government lowers taxes just because 
it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of study, the Treasury Department and IRS developed  
a new table to reflect today's longer life expectancy, which is 
about 2.5 years longer than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The new table also raised the ratio of women in the work force  
from 15 percent to 50 percent. Because women live longer on average 
than men, that was an additional factor in the longer life 
expectancy estimate.

<HEADLINE> Philly Waits on GOP Convention Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Wendy Rosen is tired of waiting for the  
Republicans to decide where in Philadelphia they want to hold their 
presidential nominating convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rosen, who produces trade shows for the wholesale craft  
industry, booked the glitzy Pennsylvania Convention Center in 
downtown Philadelphia for the week before the 2000 Republican 
National Convention. But she'll have to move her show to Atlantic 
City, N.J., if the Republicans select the convention center over 
the First Union Center, home of the city's professional basketball 
and hockey teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are they putting all the rest of us in so much pain and  
agony? This is extremely selfish on their part,'' said Ms. Rosen, 
whose show draws 10,000 artists, craft stores and jewelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rosen is not the only one in limbo. If the Republicans pick  
the convention center, they could potentially displace the nation's 
largest municipal workers union and the second largest teachers 
union -- traditional Democratic supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Muravchik, director of conventions and meetings for the  
American Federation of Teachers, said she has confidence that a 
solution will be found. Ms. Muravchik wouldn't even entertain a 
scenario in which her group would have to switch dates or move. 
</P>
<P>
	The union plans to send 5,000 teachers to Philadelphia the week  
of July 2, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been dealing with Republicans for a long time. We can  
deal with them a little bit longer,'' said Ted Kirsch, president of 
the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees  
is scheduled to meet in Philadelphia in late June that year. About 
7,000 people are expected at that convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans have said they would need the convention center  
from about mid-June 2000. The convention is scheduled to begin in 
late July. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson expects to  
make a final decision on a site within the next few weeks after 
consulting with convention manager James ``Chip'' DiPaula. 
</P>
<P>
	Both prospective locations are appealing. The $522 million  
convention center, which opened in 1993, is within walking distance 
of major downtown hotels and attractions. The $210 million First 
Union Center, which opened in 1996, is larger and has 
state-of-the-art television production equipment and a superior 
sound system. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick said the GOP ``wants to  
make the right decision for this convention and not a hasty 
decision. We feel it merits careful consideration because so many 
other things will be affected by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on schedule with our decision,'' Fitzpatrick said. ``We  
have been following the timetable that we laid out from the start. 
We're about six months ahead of where we were in preparations for 
the '96 convention in San Diego.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The convention center would require more preparation work:  
Skyboxes for broadcast media would have to be built, along with 
elevated seating. The First Union Center already has seating for 
21,000 people, 126 luxury suites and 13 club boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP's lengthy decision-making process has forced at least  
two other groups to change plans.. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bandy, president of the Trade Show Exhibitors  
Association, pulled out of Philadelphia this week. ``I think that 
the Republicans are doing a disservice to the city of Philadelphia 
by using their big stick, if you will,'' said Bandy, whose group 
will meet in Washington, D.C., instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have to vote Democratic in the next election, and I've  
never done that,'' Bandy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microscope Society of America had been booked for the same  
week of the Republican convention, but accepted a later date.

<HEADLINE> Boston Sues Gun Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Accusing the gun industry of ``negligence,  
recklessness and greed,'' Mayor Thomas M. Menino announced the 
filing Thursday of a lawsuit against 31 companies accused of 
flooding the city's streets with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, similar to a slew of litigation filed in other  
cities, said guns have created a public health problem. It accuses 
gunmakers of failing to incorporate all possible safety devices and 
unjustly making money from firearms flowing to people not 
authorized to own them. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is seeking more than $100 million in damages for  
police, fire and medical expenses caused by gun violence, as well 
as for increased security costs and declines in real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the companies named in the suit are Springfield-based  
Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Colt's Manufacturing Company Inc. of 
Hartford, Conn., and Browning Arms Corp. of Morgan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``These lawsuits, they have no merit,'' said Travis Hall, a  
spokesman for Browning. ``Our industry is one of the most 
prohibited and monitored industries there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said public officials should more rigorously enforce gun laws  
and not allow people accused of gun-related crimes to make plea 
bargain deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston joins 19 other cities, including Chicago and New Orleans,  
in filing suit against the gun industry.

<HEADLINE> Reds Send Belinda for Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Relief pitcher Stan Belinda, sidelined since  
the spring because of biceps tendinitis, was sent to the Cincinnati 
Reds' Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis on Thursday on a 
rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander is being sent to Indianapolis to get in some  
work and there is no timetable for when Belinda might return to the 
Reds, team spokesman Mark Walpole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Belinda, 32, was placed on the disabled list March 24 with what  
was described as a strained right shoulder. He has not been 
activated this season, but has been throwing on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	Belinda's season was cut short in August last year because of  
inflammation in his spinal cord. In September, doctors went public 
with worse news, that Belinda was diagnosed in the early stages of 
multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said he could resume his baseball career because the  
disease was detected early and could be treated aggressively to 
allow him to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	His arm ailment is not believed to be related to the disease.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Belinda had a 4-8 record and 3.23 earned run average  
with one save in 40 relief appearances.

<HEADLINE> Jones' Star Rising in CART Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- P.J. Jones didn't burst onto the scene  
like some second-generation racers. The son of former Indianapolis 
500 winner Parnelli Jones, P.J. has spent a long, hard 
apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 30, it looks like P.J. may finally be on the verge of  
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	He carries a string of four top 12 finishes, including a  
career-best second last month in Nazareth, Pa., into Sunday's 
Miller Lite 225 at the Milwaukee Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	In his fourth season in the CART FedEx Championship Series, and  
his first year with Patrick Racing, Jones may be ready to become 
the dominating driver that many expected when he graduated from 
sports cars to Champ cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel confident in where I am and where I am going,'' Jones  
said. ``Obviously, I would have liked this opportunity with Patrick 
Racing to have come along a few years ago, but it didn't work out 
that way. Sometimes you just have to take things as they come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Jones, who won here in 1964, said his son's three  
seasons with Dan Gurney's All-American Racers team, struggling to 
develop an underpowered Toyota engine, slowed P.J.'s development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really think P.J. had much of an opportunity to show  
what he was capable of until he came to the Patrick team,'' 
Parnelli said. ``Not taking anything away from where he was before, 
but they were still in a development stage there. P.J. just got 
really complacent over there. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind success breeds success and failure breeds failure  
and not just from the driver's standpoint but with the whole crew. 
You have to have some feeling that you are going to do well and 
have something to get you pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and the rest of the CART racers begin practice here  
Friday, with qualifying on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J., who will make his 49th career start on Sunday, has been  
particularly effective on short ovals like the one in this 
Milwaukee suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my dirt track experience definitely plays a part in  
it,'' he said. ``I think that's a reason I have always been strong 
at places like Milwaukee. But, in the past I have not been in the 
position to really show it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even last year, we were running seventh before I had a  
problem. I think I have a good feel for setting up the car here and 
I think that place suits my driving style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem for Jones and the rest of the CART drivers  
will be a decision by the sanctioning body to slow the cars by 
using small rear wings on the short ovals. The stubby wings also 
make the cars more difficult to handle through the turns and in 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what kind of wings they put on the cars,'' Jones  
said. ``I just want something that we can race with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Milwaukee Mile is the only CART track where both father and  
son have raced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real drivers' track and obviously you need a car that  
works, but I think he will do well here,'' Parnelli said. ``Last 
year, he ran quite well here. P.J. passed a lot of cars, but then 
the car went loose on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good drivers' track. Although they took a lot of  
downforce out of the car with the new wings, I do think it puts a 
little bit back into the driver's hands. That should be to P.J.'s 
advantage.''

<HEADLINE> Battle Continues on Florida Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSCEOLA NATIONAL FOREST, Fla. (AP) -- Add alligators to the  
hazards faced by those who are battling widespread wildfires here. 
</P>
<P>
	Mac McCarthy was one of 600 firefighters Wednesday helping  
contain a fire that has burned 64,000 acres in the Osceola National 
Forest, the Okefenokee Swamp and private timber lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got pretty scary last night,'' said McCarthy, 23. ``We had  
to go through the swamp and put out some fires. There were several 
alligators, about 3 or 4 feet. I kept an eye on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, 23, from Anadarko, Okla., is a Kiowa Indian, from one  
of several American Indian tribes that have sent crews. The Navajo, 
Creek, Cherokee, Kiowa, Arapaho and Chickasaw also have 
firefighters on the lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze, dubbed the Friendly Fire by firefighters, started as  
a lightning strike on May 21 in the Osceola National Forest, 
between Lake City and Jacksonville. There have been no serious 
injuries or structures burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Containment lines have been established around the fire south of  
Florida Highway 2 and appeared to be holding, said Mike Melton, the 
incident commander for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire continues to burn in a northerly direction through the  
Okefenokee Swamp on the Florida-Georgia line. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fire is not going away for a long time until it rains,''  
Melton said. ``We are in for the long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, who has the Kiowa tribal shield painted on the side of  
his truck, said he enjoys the work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we can be here for a while because I'm making good  
money,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed To Cut Up to 2,000 Ga. Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. will cut up to 2,000  
more jobs at its Marietta plant so the defense contractor can offer 
cheaper planes. 
</P>
<P>
	While 40 percent of the job cuts will come through early  
retirement, attrition and transfers, the bulk of the cuts -- about 
1,200 jobs -- will be layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is necessary to make us competitive for future  
business,'' said Tom Burbage, who became president of the Marietta 
plant in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts, which will shave the plant's total workforce of 9,550  
by about 20 percent, are part of an overall streamlining strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	While demand for the plant's major product -- the $60 million  
C-130J military transport plane -- is adequate, Burbage said the 
downsizing is necessary for the plant to compete for future 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we need to streamline our operation and make  
our organization more effective,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its C-130J production, it is the lead developer  
of the F-22 stealth fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Georgia's congressional delegation have been pushing  
for increased Air Force orders for the C-130J, for which orders 
have slowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant lost a powerful advocate this year when former House  
Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose district included Marietta, resigned 
from Congress. But Burbage said the current congressional 
delegation is doing ``a fine job'' in helping the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The products themselves are really what makes you a success or  
failure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, which laid off 280 workers in January, had as many as  
32,000 employees in Marietta, northwest of Atlanta, in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Lockheed Martin were down $1 to $40.50 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Snooping a Part of Horse Claiming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Doug Peterson is part snoop, part  
detective and a good bluffer, all necessary qualities to 
successfully play horse racing's claiming game. 
</P>
<P>
	He's lucky, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The trainer claimed a rundown-looking horse for $25,000, fixed  
its bad teeth, trimmed its overgrown hair, medicated its ulcers and 
helped it gain weight. Now the horse is good enough to run in a 
$125,000 stakes race this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly Charismatic, a one-time $62,500 claimer who will run  
for the Triple Crown on Saturday, but good enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Claiming horses is kind of like going through trash cans,''  
trainer Mel Stute said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainers never know if they'll find a gem like Charismatic or a  
horse on its last legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnover is constant, with horses moving in and out of trainers'  
barns and changing owners as frequently as every 25 days, making 
them the equivalent of leased vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're like buses, they just keep coming,'' said Peterson,  
who trained Seattle Slew after the colt won the Triple Crown in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
	In a claiming race, any licensed owner or trainer with enough  
credit or cash can buy a horse for a predetermined price. Horses in 
claiming races usually aren't fast enough to run in stakes races or 
compete in allowance races against well-bred horses on their way 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospective buyers line the fence around the paddock before a  
race to check out the horses, then fill out a claim card and drop 
it in a box in the steward's office 16 minutes prior to post. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very secretive,'' Peterson said. ``I don't want them to  
scratch their horse if they get wind early enough, and I don't want 
somebody else taking my idea and following me to the claim box and 
putting in a claim also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the horse's name is misspelled or the claiming price is  
incorrect, the card is voided. Otherwise, a buyer is obligated once 
the gates open. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the horse breaks down during the race, it's your horse,''  
said Jim Miller, paymaster at Hollywood Park. ``It's a shame, but 
that's the brutal reality of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every trainer can recall his greatest claims, like the horse  
Stute paid $32,000 for that went on to win more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But for every good claim, there are costly ones.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson claimed a horse for $80,000 last summer. The horse won  
easily, but took a bad step and broke down after the race. The 
owner was out his investment and Peterson had a useless horse. 
That's why he carries insurance to recoup some of his costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainers also can get lucky on a potentially bad deal.  
</P>
<P>
	When two or more trainers want to claim the same horse, numbered  
peas are assigned to each trainer. The clerk of scales puts them in 
a shaker and the first number to fall out wins the horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson recently put in claims for two fillies in the same  
race, one of which won. But he lost her in a shake and ended up 
with the other filly. 
</P>
<P>
	A good thing, since the winner ended up with a bowed tendon and  
may not race again. 
</P>
<P>
	Like used car salesmen, trainers who want to unload a horse  
because it's injured or running poorly will repackage their 
product. Or they'll disguise a good horse because they don't want 
to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the closet thing to a poker game that I've ever seen,''  
said Mike Mitchell, a veteran trainer of claimers. ``You're holding 
a certain hand and you're bluffing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson admits to putting bandages on the legs of a perfectly  
sound horse, leaving paddock-watchers to wonder about a possible 
injury. Other trainers will stuff cotton inside a bandage to create 
the look of a bowed tendon, a worrisome sight to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, Peterson's tricks confuse his owners.  
</P>
<P>
	``The owner will say, `Was there something wrong with that  
horse?' I'll say, `No, just playing the game,''' he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	But trainers never want to be too deceptive.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you burn people with horses, they're not going to come back  
too often and you've got less people claiming from you,'' Peterson 
said. ``It makes it harder to play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snooping is a big part of claiming.  
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m., clockers are scattered around the Hollywood Park  
grandstand, timing horses and watching how they gallop. The 
clockers, hired privately, tip off owners and trainers on horses to 
claim later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Gossip spreads the word, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``One guy from another barn might try to talk to a groom in my  
barn and find out if I like the horse or not,'' Peterson said. ``At 
the same time, if a horse is going bad, I don't want it to get out 
in case I want to lose the horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming races at Hollywood Park range from $8,000 to $100,000,  
and usually comprise half of an eight-race card. If a trainer runs 
a horse in a $50,000 race, then drops it to a $10,000 race the next 
time, it's a sign he's looking to unload. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the ones you have to be careful of,'' Stute said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stute, 71, briefly considered buying Charismatic both times the  
horse ran in claiming races last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I would've claimed him, he'd have never run in the Kentucky  
Derby. I'd have been looking for some other kind of race,'' said 
Stute, who thought the price of $62,500 was too high. ``He was no 
gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one claimed Charismatic, who went on to win the Derby and  
Preakness Stakes. A victory in Saturday's Belmont Stakes would make 
him the 12th Triple Crown winner in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the things that the game needs, for people to see  
that this can happen,'' Peterson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lighting and sound technicians swarmed the  
West Wing of the White House on Thursday, getting things just right 
for the newest installment of President Clinton's campaign against 
youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and 40  
teen-agers -- some from high schools that have suffered gun violence 
in the past year -- were sitting down before ABC's ``Good Morning 
America'' cameras Friday morning for a live give-and-take on how to 
stop the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	With their own breakfast and lunch caterers in tow, ABC crews  
took over the West Wing press area and the Roosevelt Room -- just 
steps from the Cabinet Room, where the president was meeting with 
his Joint Chiefs of Staff at a critical juncture in the campaign 
against Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Why such a fuss by the network?  
</P>

	``They're very particular about their lighting,'' one White  
House aide whispered.

	The EEOC is looking for Sidney Frank employees nationwide who  
believe they were harassed, and plans to divide the settlement 
money after all candidates have been identified. So far, women have 
come forward from Texas, California, New York, South Carolina, 
Massachusetts, Florida, and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former ``Jagerettes'' appeared Thursday on behalf of the 100  
or so women who have already claimed they were grabbed, groped and 
even licked by company president Sidney Frank, as well as by 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``His idea of being a team player, of making the (boss) happy,  
was submitting to his sexual advances,'' said 28-year-old Patrice 
Chase, now of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank was not named personally as a defendant in the case, but  
he was accused in court papers of grabbing and kissing employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chase said Frank frequently tried to fondle her and would  
remind her that she was a single mother dependent on a paycheck 
from his company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like he tried to make a victim of me because I was  
young,'' Ms. Chase said. ``No job is worth this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Podger, 29, from Hickory, S.C., said she signed on to  
promote Jagermeister to earn money for college, but then lost the 
job after refusing Frank's advances at a dinner party where he 
appeared in his pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the women represented by the EEOC also said they were  
sent to bars and restaurants to promote Jagermeister, but found 
that bar owners and patrons often expected more. 
</P>
<P>
	That is something Sidney Frank Importing should have guarded  
against, EEOC attorney Louis Graziano said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the settlement, the company denied any wrongdoing, but agreed  
to make substantive changes in the way it handles future 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive vice president Debra Posen said making employees  
comfortable in their work environment is a ``top priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company is setting up a toll-free, 24-hour hotline to deal  
with sexual harassment issues, and employees will no longer be 
required to forfeit their right to monetary damages if they are 
harassed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidney Frank Importing had previously required employees to  
submit discrimination and harassment complaints to arbitration, 
rather than going to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC had sued the company in U.S. District Court in  
Manhattan on behalf of the workers, whose complaints date back to 
July of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now employs about 400 Jagerettes in 25 states.

<HEADLINE> Florida Girl Wins Spelling Bee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nupur Lala bounced up and down and smiled in  
disbelief when she became this year's national spelling bee champ, 
her reward for spending two hours a day drilling words into her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-year-old girl from Tampa, Fla., won today in the 12th  
round of the annual contest by correctly spelling ``logorrhea,'' 
which means incoherent talkativeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would look at lists of uncommon words and whenever I would  
miss a word, I would mark it,'' said Nupur, who has labored over 
words for the past few months, but also found time to play the 
violin, swim and surf the Internet. ``I would keep on re-quizzing 
until all the words were just drummed into my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She credited her success to that intensive studying and a little  
``divine intervention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents -- they would take turns quizzing me,'' said Nupur,  
an eighth-grader at Louis Benito Middle School in Tampa. ``When one 
got tired, the other would take over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nupur was eliminated in the third round of the bee,  
tripped up by the word ``commination,'' which means the threat of 
punishment. But she proved she had mastered it by spelling it 
correctly at a question-and-answer session after becoming this 
year's champ. 
</P>
<P>
	Nupur beat David Lewandowski, another 14-year-old, from  
Schererville, Ind., who spelled 10 words correctly before missing 
``opsimath,'' a person who begins to learn late in life. He 
misspelled it as ``opsomath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The words were harder this year, especially in the first few  
rounds,'' said David, an eighth-grader at Forest Ridge Academy who 
finished 39th in last year's bee. ``I really didn't expect to make 
it as far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 72nd annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee began  
Wednesday with 249 spellers, ranging in ages from 9 to 15. When the 
competition resumed today, 104 spellers were still in the running 
but they were steadily eliminated with the ding of a bell 
throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	All had their own spelling style. Nupur wrote imaginary words in  
the palm of her hand. David grabbed the microphone and didn't let 
go until he finished a word. Some contestants spelled with their 
hands in their pockets; others with hands clutched behind their 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
	George Abraham Thampy, 11, of Maryland Heights, Mo., who tied  
for third place with April DeGideo, 13, of Ambler, Pa., repeatedly 
pronounced each word before spelling it, his voice rising on the 
final syllable as if asking a question. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the words that tripped up young contestants in the final  
rounds: ``obtenebrate,'' ``revictualment,'' ``banns'' and 
``muumuu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Ferrier, 14, of Stevensville, Mich., walked off the  
stage with his head down when he missed the word ``brouhaha,'' an 
uproar or confused medley of sounds. He stuck a ``g'' and ``h'' in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	Dipal Shah, a 12-year-old from West New York, N.J., literally  
ran back to her seat after correctly spelling ``zolaesque,'' a term 
referring to the works and style of French novelist Emile Zola. But 
then she missed her next word ``pochette,'' a kit or pouch. 
</P>
<P>
	As winner, Nupur will get a $10,000 first-place cash prize, plus  
encyclopedias, two airline tickets and computer software. The 
contestants, most sponsored by their local newspapers, all won 
regional bees to qualify. David was sponsored by The Times of 
Munster, Ind., and Nupur was sponsored by The Tampa Tribune.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Down; Gold Also Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies in  
late European trading Thursday, and lost ground against the euro 
after hitting a record high against the single european currency in 
morning trading. Gold prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro dropped to $1.0340 in the morning compared with  
Wednesday's $1.0371, and climbed to $1.0387 in the afternoon before 
dropping back to $1.0350. 
</P>
<P>
	It traded as low as $1.0303 earlier in the session, its lowest  
level since it replaced the currencies of 11 European nations on 
Jan. 1. $1.0300 is a politically and psychologically important 
barrier for the euro -- the floor of a tight range with which German 
bankers say they feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates compared with late Wednesday: 121.47 Japanese  
yen, up from 120.71; 1.5336 Swiss francs, down from 1.5338; 1.4784 
Canadian dollars, down from 1.4798. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.6038, down from $1.6103.  
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading in New York, the dollar was worth 121.57 yen,  
while the euro was worth $1.0320 and the British pound was worth 
$1.6038. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth: 1.8830 German marks, down from 1.8859; 
6.3152 French francs, down from 6.3249; 2.1216 Dutch guilders, down 
from 2.1249; and 1,864.13 Italian lire, down from 1,867.00 
</P>
<P>
	Gold closed in London at $265.40 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$266.20 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zurich the bid price was $265.45, down from $265.95.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell $2.80 in Hong Kong to close at $264.55.  
</P>

	Silver closed in London at $4.96 bid per troy ounce, down from  
$4.99.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Advises Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new  
service at a quarter of its dealerships to advise parents on how to 
install car seats to protect children. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal  
agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using 
trained personnel to help customers fit child seats. The company 
will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be 
available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in  
autos. Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in 
half, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	By next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct  
800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled 
properly in child seats and child seats are properly installed in 
both new and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates 30,000  
child seats a year are being inspected now at community events 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton was announcing the  
initiative today at a news conference. Also involved is the child 
seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National Safety 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's move follows a recommendation by the National  
Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of 
``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the 
deaths of children in automobile accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70  
models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with 
different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially 
100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB 
Chairman Jim Hall says. 
</P>
<P>
	This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic  
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them  
across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle 
administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships. 
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government 
transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses 
to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only DaimlerChrysler has come forward but other  
automakers are considering the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. also is considering some type of permanent  
fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign,  
a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or 
daylong child safety seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's 
dealerships.

<HEADLINE> Texaco Cancels Chevron Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Texaco Inc. formally rebuffed a takeover offer  
from Chevron Corp. Wednesday, ending weeks of speculation over a 
deal between the nation's third- and fourth-largest energy 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco said Chevron's proposal was ``unacceptable for several  
reasons, including complexity, feasibility, risk and price.'' 
Texaco did not provide any details about Chevron's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron reportedly was considering bidding $42 billion, or $80 a  
share, for Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to San Francisco-based Chevron was not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Derr, chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron  
pursued Texaco after he failed to win a bid for Atlantic Richfield 
Co. earlier this year. Derr lost out to BP Amoco, which agreed in 
March to buy Arco for $26.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Derr's plans to combine Chevron and Texaco faced several,  
obviously insurmountable, obstacles. Texaco already has an alliance 
with Shell, the U.S. subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Texaco 
and Chevron also have overlapping operations on the West Coast. And 
there were also issues of control, namely that Derr wanted it and 
Texaco chief executive Peter Bijur was apparently unwilling to cede 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies have been rushing to merge this year as a way to  
preserve profits in an era of historically low oil prices. Though 
prices have risen in recent weeks as producers worldwide curb 
output, oil companies are still struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	News of a stalemate between Chevron and Texaco, based in White  
Plains, N.Y., comes just six days after shareholders of Exxon and 
Mobil voted to approve their $82 billion merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco's terse statement was released after the markets had  
closed. Texaco's shares ended the day up 31 1/4 cents, at $64.50, on 
the New York Stock Exchange. Chevron's stock closed up $1.56 1/4, at 
$92, also on the Big Board.

<HEADLINE>  First Lady Won't Say Magic Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She looked like a candidate and sounded like a  
candidate as she shook hands, hugged strangers and made a rousing 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hillary Rodham Clinton again stopped short of saying the  
magic words her supporters have been waiting for -- that she is a 
candidate for Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Run, Hillary, run!'' students chanted at City College, where  
Mrs. Clinton began her day-long visit to Manhattan on Wednesday by 
giving the commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
	As she walked through the crowd of 3,000 graduates, she shook  
dozens and dozens of hands thrust out by cheering students. One man 
put his arms out for a hug, and she returned his embrace after a 
moment's hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The content of Mrs. Clinton's speech to the college -- calling  
for more resources and support for public schools -- was similar to 
others she has made in a half-dozen recent appearances in New York. 
But this time her every sentence was met with a roar from the 
students, most of them black, Hispanic and from working-class 
backgrounds. And like a candidate on the campaign trail, Mrs. 
Clinton's cadences grew stronger with every cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never lift up our public schools and the students they  
serve by tearing them down,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``We can never 
ensure the future of this city or state or our nation by 
undermining the public education system that is at the very 
foundation of the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City's public schools have been criticized frequently  
by Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is also a likely Senate 
candidate. And City University, of which City College is part, has 
also been under attack, accused of lowering standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a fund-raiser at Tavern on the Green for the state  
Democratic Party, Mrs. Clinton was given a New York Yankees 
baseball cap by United Federation of Teachers President Randi 
Weingarten, the luncheon's guest of honor. Afterwards, the first 
lady shook hands with patrons at the restaurant and waved to a 
small cheering crowd of joggers and mothers with strollers waiting 
near her limousine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not refer to her potential candidacy in any of  
her speeches, but others did. At the luncheon, Sen. Charles 
Schumer, D-N.Y., said: ``There's no candidacy yet. But Hillary 
Clinton gets closer and closer and closer and we get more and more 
excited about the prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the first lady have said she's on the verge of  
declaring herself a candidate after several months of deliberations 
and consultations with experts. 
</P>
<P>
	At an evening fund-raiser for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the  
congresswoman defended Mrs. Clinton against accusations of 
carpetbagging. The first lady has never lived in New York, and 
earlier Wednesday, Republican Gov. George Pataki had said, ``I 
don't think we need somebody from Washington or Arkansas moving to 
New York to represent us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We New Yorkers don't care where you're from,'' Ms. Maloney  
said. ``We New Yorkers care about what you can do to continue to 
build the greatest city, state and country in the world.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alice Rivlin, the No. 2 official at the  
Federal Reserve, announced today that she was resigning from the 
central bank after serving three years as its vice chairman. The 
unexpected resignation was announced in a brief statement by the 
Fed, which also released her resignation letter to President 
Clinton. In the letter, Rivlin said the resignation would be 
effective July 16. She said leaving the Fed would give her more 
time to spend as head of the Financial Assistance Authority for the 
District of Columbia, the group that is overseeing Washington's 
city government.

	Retailers Have a Good Month  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The raging U.S. economy encouraged Americans to  
go on a shopping spree in May, boosting sales at the nation's 
biggest retailers to better-than-expected levels for the fourth 
straight month. Discounters and specialty clothing stores fared 
best last month as consumers bought up everything from trendy capri 
pants from the Limited to new gardening equipment at Wal-Mart. 
Separately today, the Labor Department reported the number of 
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose a slight 
4,000 to 305,000 last week, signaling that unemployment remains 
extremely low. But there are concerns that a sharp or prolonged 
decline on Wall Street, a rise in interest rates or signs of a 
slowing economy could cause Americans to curb their buying. 

</P>

	NEW YORK (AP)) -- Evidence of an economic slowdown came today  
with a Commerce Department report that orders to American factories 
for manufactured goods fell 1.2 percent in April, reflecting a big 
drop in demand for aircraft and other transportation products. 
Additionally, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said that the 
average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages hit its 
highest level in nearly two years, jumping to 7.41 percent from 
7.23 percent a week ago.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Stock Exchange will delay extending  
its trading hours until next year at the earliest, its chairman 
announced today. Richard Grasso said the board of the world's 
biggest stock exchange would wait to make sure stock traders 
smoothly handled two challenges -- the Year 2000 computer bug and 
the planned shift to reporting stock prices in decimals rather than 
fractions. The deadline for the move to decimals is at the end of 
the second quarter of 2000.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Litton Industries Inc. will buy Avondale  
Industries for $529 million after Newport News Shipbuilding 
declined to raise its offer for the shipbuilder. Litton also 
indicated today it plans to re-examine its offer to buy Newport 
News in light of potential government opposition. New Orleans-based 
Avondale had agreed earlier to merge with Newport News for $470 
million in stock. But Litton offered more in cash, ultimately 
enticing Avondale.

	Fed Has Nest Egg For Any Y2K Crisis  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Federal Reserve has stockpiled $200  
billion as a cushion against Year 2000-related hysteria, enough to 
keep the nation's financial system afloat even if every adult in 
the nation withdraws $1,000 at year's end. The cash stockpile is 
just one of the many ways in which the Fed has prepared for the 
Year 2000 computer bug, according to Robert T. Parry, president of 
the Fed's San Francisco district, which covers nine Western states. 
While short-term, isolated disruptions are possible, Perry said, 
the public should have confidence that the financial infrastructure 
-- checks, automated tellers, credit and debit cards, direct 
deposits -- will run smoothly.

	FDIC Gives Banks, Thrifts Y2K Orders  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is  
requiring that banks and thrifts considered to be unprepared for 
the Year 2000 computer date change use a standard backup system for 
storing key deposit and loan data. The FDIC's board of directors 
proposed the new requirement and opened it to public comment for 30 
days, although it will take effect immediately. The rule is 
designed to ensure that bank customers will have quick access to 
their money in the event of Y2K problems. The new rule will apply 
to banks and thrifts with a less-than-satisfactory rating from the 
government for their Year 2000 readiness as of July 31.

	Penny Shortages Reported  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A penny saved is a penny earned, but too  
many pennies saved is a big problem for the Federal Reserve Bank in 
Philadelphia. Some area stores have been asking customers to dig 
for exact change as their cash drawers have run short of pennies in 
recent weeks. Meanwhile, stores and banks have sharply increased 
their orders for pennies, though no one can point to a reason for a 
shortage except the accumulations that pile up on dressers, in jars 
and in piggy banks, Federal Reserve Bank spokesman Bob McCarthy 
said.

	Profits Slip at Air France

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French national carrier Air France's profit fell 11  
percent in its latest fiscal year, hurt by a pilot strike and a 
slump in Asian cargo shipments. But it expects solid growth in 
operating results this year. Air France also said today that it 
will select a U.S. partner in the course of 1999 ``to create a 
global alliance'' although it offered few details on what kind of 
alliance it had in mind. Chief Executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said 
a partnership either with Delta Airlines or Continental Airlines 
would form the backbone of the alliance.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- State regulators postponed for a week a  
vote on a rate shift in Internet telephone charges, a proposal that 
could lead to higher fees for some Internet users in California. A 
plan pushed by Pacific Bell to shift connection fees for such calls 
to a smaller phone company, which could pass them along to Internet 
service providers, had been scheduled for a vote at today's Public 
Utilities Commission meeting. But the sponsor, Josiah Neeper, 
changed his proposal before the meeting so that it would require a 
full review and public comment before final PUC action, said 
Pacific Bell spokesman Bill Mashek.

	Hot Dogs Blamed for Listeria Outbreak  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT, Mich. (AP) -- A federal investigation of a food  
poisoning outbreak that left 15 dead concludes the source was hot 
dogs from a Bil Mar meat plant, and recommends stronger steps 
against food-borne bacteria. The Centers for Disease Control report 
said the same rare strain of bacteria that caused the outbreak was 
found in packages of Bil Mar hot dogs made at the Zeeland plant. It 
said the bacteria was likely present in the plant five months 
before the outbreak began. But Jeffrey Smith, a spokesman for Bil 
Mar parent Sara Lee Corp., said the report ``indicates there is 
some uncertainty about the cause of the outbreak.'' He said the 
company was taking several steps to improve safety.

<HEADLINE> Local Police Ratings Vary by Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blacks' dissatisfaction with police outstrips  
whites' by two-to-one or more in New York and Chicago and nearly 
that in a number of other cities, the government said Thursday in a 
report coming amid the controversy over ``racial profiling'' by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of a dozen cities last year indicated that 24 percent  
of blacks were dissatisfied with local police compared with 10 
percent of whites, though the figures varied substantially by city. 
</P>
<P>
	Many black Americans clearly believe they are treated  
differently from whites, said Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, 
who announced the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the 24 percent black dissatisfaction figure ``too  
large,'' Holder said law enforcement agencies and all segments of 
communities must work together to break down ``the barriers of 
mistrust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 85 percent of residents surveyed in 12 cities said they  
were satisfied with local police. Three percent said they were very 
dissatisfied and 12 percent said they were dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics were included as either black or white in the survey  
based on their individual preference. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, 31 percent of blacks were dissatisfied with police,  
compared with 11 percent of whites. In New York, the figures were 
23 percent for blacks, 11 percent for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the figures were closer together, 25 percent for  
blacks, 19 percent for whites. In Los Angeles, 18 percent of blacks 
were dissatisfied, compared with 11 percent of whites, according to 
the survey, which covered more than 9,000 households -- some 700 in 
each city. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest black-white difference was in Knoxville, Tenn.,  
where 37 percent of blacks said they were dissatisfied with police 
compared with 9 percent for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Three black men died in confrontations with Knoxville police  
during a seven-month period in 1997, enraging the black community 
and leading Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe to create a citizen panel 
to review complaints against officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's release of the survey by the Bureau of Justice  
Statistics came amid continuing controversy about police 
departments using racial profiling, the practice of stopping or 
searching people based on race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has investigated allegations involving  
New Jersey's state police. The matter also has become an issue in 
Florida, Maryland, Connecticut and elsewhere, and Holder said it 
was of ``great concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides race, personal involvement made a difference in how  
survey respondents felt about the police. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of the 12 cities, residents who had been victims of  
violent crime were less likely than others to say they were 
satisfied with local police. Likewise, people who were fearful of 
crime in their neighborhoods were less likely to be satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in New York, 39 percent of violent crime victims  
were dissatisfied with police, compared with dissatisfaction by 15 
percent of others. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Washington, 31 percent of those who were fearful of  
neighborhood crime were dissatisfied with police compared with 15 
percent of those who weren't fearful. 
</P>
<P>
	People get their perceptions of the police from ``their  
neighbors and the media, but an important component is based on 
personal experience,'' said Jan Chaiken, director of the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	In details of the report:  
</P>
<P>
	In Madison, Wis., 3 percent of blacks -- the same figure as for  
whites -- were dissatisfied with police. In Tucson, Ariz., 9 percent 
of blacks and 12 percent of whites were dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for black dissatisfaction with police in other  
cities: Springfield, Mass., 24; Spokane, Wash., 21; Savannah, Ga., 
19; Kansas City, Mo., 14; San Diego, 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Among whites, the level of dissatisfaction with local police in  
those cities: San Diego, 5 percent; Kansas City and Springfield, 10 
percent; Savannah and Spokane, 12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Bounce Back / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen Friday  
morning in Tokyo amid the euro's continued weakness against major 
currencies. Japanese stocks bounced back moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.55 yen in late morning, up 0.01 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York level of 
121.66 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 104.76 points,  
or 0.65 percent, to 16,332.26 points at the end of the morning 
session. The index had lost 190.49 points, or 1.16 percent, on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's fall reflects continued disappointment with European  
economic fundamentals and unease about the realistic possibility of 
peace in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency hit a new record low against the dollar early in  
the Asian session Friday, dropping to $1.0284. In Tokyo trading, 
the euro was quoted at 125.19 yen, down from 125.95 yen late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some dollar-buying early in the session by players  
ahead of the release later Friday of U.S. non-farm payroll data for 
May, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The data will be scrutinized for signs of inflationary pressure,  
and the figures could indicate whether the U.S. Federal Reserve 
will favor an interest rate rise. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices posted moderate gains following the  
1.16 percent fall in the Nikkei a day earlier. Trading was thin in 
the dearth of fresh market-moving news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazunori Jinnai, a general manager of the equity department at  
Daiwa Securities, said buying on the Tokyo Stock Exchange should 
remain steady for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``With no strong lead from the U.S., the Tokyo stock market is  
likely to follow an independent course,'' Jinnai said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section edged up 1.37 points, or 0.10 percent, to 1,319.06. 
The TOPIX finished down 9.08 points, or 0.68 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.80 to  
close at 10,663.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6500 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6050 percent, driving 
its price down to 97.85 yen from 98.23 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Slip in Thin Volume / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slipped in thin volume Thursday as  
traders awaited more economic data to determine whether the Fed 
will move to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32  
point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.95 percent from 5.94 percent the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports from retailers Thursday that sales remained strong in  
May lent more credence to the view that the U.S. economy is still 
growing, which could lead to higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But many traders were holding out ahead of the May unemployment  
report, due out Friday, which might give a better insight into the 
Fed's thinking. The Fed said last month it would lean toward 
raising rates, which would hurt the values of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to down 1/32 point and intermediate maturities were 
down 1/32 point to 7/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.60 percent as the  
discount fell 0.11 percentage point to 4.48 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.94 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 percentage 
point to 4.75 percent. One-year yields were 5.04 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.01 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.79 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 percent from 4.69 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 121 3/16. The average yield to 
maturity was unchanged at 5.42 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Army Sgt. Sues CNN and Time Inc. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A veteran of U.S. Special Forces in Vietnam  
sued CNN and Time Inc. on Thursday, saying he was deceived into 
giving interviews for a story that accused U.S. commandos of using 
nerve gas to hunt down and kill defectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hagen, a former Army Special Forces sergeant, sued CNN,  
Time Inc. and three producers as well as reporter Peter Arnett. He 
said he was told CNN producers could help him get medical treatment 
for his war-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took this brave war hero and made him look like a  
buffoon,'' said Hagen's lawyer, Kevin McLean. ``He was a hero, not 
a murderer and he has to restore his reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which does not specify a damage amount, came a day  
after former Army Special Forces Lt. Robert Van Buskirk filed a 
defamation lawsuit in North Carolina seeking $100 million in 
damages for the same story, which was later retracted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen said he was never told the true nature of the story being  
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	``They asked to interview me about my medical problems and the  
problems I was having with the Veterans Administration,'' Hagen 
said Thursday. ``The whole family was ecstatic that finally we were 
going to get some help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said producers discussed his illnesses and shot footage of  
some 20 bottles of narcotic medications prescribed for him. But 
they also asked him questions about the nerve gas sarin and about 
orders for dealing with defectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen said he told producers he knew nothing about sarin gas or  
its use. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bittler, a CNN spokesman in Atlanta, declined to comment.  
Telephone messages seeking comment from Time magazine were not 
immediately returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint CNN-Time story telecast on June 7, 1998, claimed the  
military used sarin gas in Laos during Operation Tailwind, a 
mission to find defectors. Two U.S. defectors were supposedly 
killed in the attack, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The story was retracted after an internal investigation could  
not substantiate the allegations. Time and CNN, both owned by Time 
Warner, apologized for the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Two producers were fired and a third resigned over the story.  
Arnett, the story's lead reporter, was reprimanded and ultimately 
left the network.

<HEADLINE> Earthlings Look for ET on Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ray Christian doesn't use his home computer  
to shoot up fictional space aliens. He's too busy letting it search 
for the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Like thousands of other earthlings, the retiree from Des Moines,  
Iowa, installed a free screensaver that uses his idle computer to 
scan data from a radio telescope for evidence of intelligent life 
in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	SETI(at)home has become one of the hottest programs on the  
Internet with more than 450,000 copies downloaded since the 
University of California at Berkeley project began May 15. 
Scientists who developed it initially expected about 100,000 users. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of using a single powerful computer, SETI(at)home  
spreads the workload among the home, school and office computers of 
its unpaid volunteers. As of Wednesday, more than 5,000 years of 
computer time had been logged. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a wide distribution of participants -- people in their  
80s, kids who are 6 years old,'' said Dan Werthimer, chief 
scientist of SETI(at)home. ``It's not just a bunch of computer 
geeks out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Projects involving the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,  
or SETI, are based on the assumption that alien beings are trying 
to communicate on specific radio frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The search is not unlike quickly turning a radio dial and  
hearing static and ``pops'' that indicate the signal of a station. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody knows for sure what channel might be used by aliens.  
And the signal would be faint and mixed with radio noise from 
satellites and stars. Analysis of even a few seconds of data from a 
sliver of sky involves billions of computations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we're doing SETI(at)home,'' Werthimer said. ``We  
don't know what the signal is going to look like. We couldn't 
handle it even with the biggest supercomputer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers say chances are slim that a signal will be detected  
during SETI(at)home's two-year run. It's a test of distributing 
computer work over the Internet -- and a way to spark the public's 
interest in science, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you an indication of the dynamics and the noise, the  
different interactions of forces,'' said Rubin McDavid, a Los 
Angeles environmental engineer who runs the program at home. ``It 
lets you know there is a real interaction of forces playing outside 
our planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SETI(at)home researchers receive the data from a  
1,000-foot-diameter radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and 
break it into small chunks, which are distributed via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants download the screensaver from SETI(at)home's Web  
site, setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu. When their computers are turned 
on but not in use, the program kicks in, displaying a screensaver 
with colorful graphs showing what is being analyzed and whether a 
strong signal has been detected. 
</P>
<P>
	Periodically, participants dial in to download data to a  
Berkeley computer. It takes about five minutes to transmit 39 hours 
of computer work. 
</P>
<P>
	SETI(at)home organizers promise to share the credit of any  
discovery with the volunteer whose computer finds it, Werthimer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have been looking for ways to process more data for  
less money since Congress axed NASA's life-searching program in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that the interest in the idea in contact is enormous  
and it has always manifested itself in mythology, pseudoscience, 
astrology, folklore and tales of alien abduction,'' said Louis 
Friedman, who founded the Planetary Society with the late 
astronomer Carl Sagan. ``Here we're making a bridge. We're 
capturing that interest.''

<HEADLINE> Feds To Review Snowmobiles in Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Park Service will assess the  
impact snowmobiles are having on the park system in response to a 
request from environmentalists to ban the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the review is done this fall, the park service will decide  
whether to propose new restrictions, Chip Davis, the agency's 
regulations program manager, said Wednesday. An announcement of the 
study is expected later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobiles are permitted in 28 parks, national monuments and  
other units of the park system, with the heaviest use by far in 
Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks in Wyoming, and at 
Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The study will entail a broad look at snowmobile use in the  
parks ``to see what impacts have been observed, how many have 
occurred and what resources are affected,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency announced earlier this year  
that it plans to propose emission standards for snowmobiles that 
would likely force manufacturers to redesign or replace the 
two-stroke engine standard on snowmobiles and some all-terrain 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowmobile manufacturers deny the machines are damaging parks  
but say they are developing quieter and cleaner models. The 
International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association said the 
environmentalists' petition to ban the machines from the parks was 
based on outdated research and inflated emissions data. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as it's based on facts, we have no difficulty in  
dealing with the issues,'' said Ed Klim, president of the 
manufacturers group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bluewater Network, a coalition of environmental groups that  
petitioned the park service, contends that snowmobiles are killing 
wildlife, ruining air and water quality, and destroying solitude in 
the parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled that the (park service) is acknowledging that  
snowmobiles have extremely serious impacts to the park system, and 
hopefully their review will flesh those out in detail,'' said 
Russell Long, the coalition's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The park service is already considering restrictions on  
snowmobiles in Yellowstone because of a lawsuit by the Fund for 
Animals and other environmental groups. One plan under review would 
stop snowmobiles from using the road between Old Faithful and the 
park's popular West Yellowstone gateway. Some 63,000 snowmobiles 
entered the park last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Voyageurs, snowmobiles have been banned from areas where gray  
wolves feed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. sales of snowmobiles have doubled since 1992 to more than  
160,000 units a year.

<HEADLINE> Conflict Gives Raytheon Big Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The missiles and bombs raining down on Serb forces  
in Yugoslavia could add up to big money for the Raytheon Co., whose 
officials estimate they could gain about $1 billion in new 
contracts to replace munitions used in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	While 10-figure defense outlays are nothing new in the United  
States, Raytheon's direct link between military action and possible 
new revenues cast the Kosovo conflict in a new light, as a war that 
could be profitable to American defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon Systems Co., Raytheon's defense unit, is eyeing  
Pentagon contracts for the replacement of weaponry used in the 
nearly three-month-old engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Shea, a spokesman for Raytheon Systems, said Thursday the  
company sees the potential for $1 billion in new orders. ``But 
contract awards have not started flowing yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company is trying to capitalize on a variety of  
congressional outlays, including $420 million for the renovation 
and upgrade of Tomahawk missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, President Clinton signed a bill that earmarked $12  
billion for the air assault, as well as for the Kosovo Albanian 
refugees, Balkan countries near the fighting and U.S. forces around 
the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon expects contract awards within  
six to 12 months, with the work spread out over about two or three 
years, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of a humanitarian crisis paying off for American  
executives and shareholders is unsettling for investment managers 
like Sophia Collier, who chairs Citizens Funds, a Portsmouth, N.H., 
mutual fund company that tries to practice what it calls socially 
responsible investing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't hold Raytheon. One of the things the fund has done is  
made a conscious decision not to hold the stock of military 
contractors,'' said Collier, the company's chairwoman. ``We've made 
the moral decision to avoid profiting from war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Raytheon has been a hot stock, and analysts expect the  
new business to benefit shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly significant,'' said Paul Nisbet, a defense  
analyst at JSA Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense giant had sales of $4.9 billion for the quarter  
ending in April, and with any new contracts spread over a few 
years, ``its impact on any one year is not great,'' Nisbet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon's stock closed up 68 3/4 cents Thursday on the New York  
Stock Exchange, at $68.81 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Asks Team To Get Him a Ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Patrick Ewing stood before his teammates,  
his injured left leg strapped into a thick, black walking cast, and 
directed them to deliver something he's craved for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to go out and get me my ring,'' Ewing said.  
``They're ready to go get it for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life without Ewing began anew Thursday for the New York Knicks,  
right in the middle of the Eastern Conference finals. A partial 
tear of the Achilles' tendon will keep Ewing sidelined for the rest 
of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The series against the Indiana Pacers, tied at one game apiece,  
resumes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel we have an opportunity to win it,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's teammates echoed that confidence, bouyed by the fact  
they already know what it's like to win without him. Tendinitis in 
the same tendon kept Ewing out of 12 games during the regular 
season, and he missed most of the previous season because of a 
broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jeff Van Gundy said he had not yet decided how he will  
change his starting lineup, although Latrell Sprewell said he 
expected to continue coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can start big with (Chris) Dudley, you can start big with  
(Marcus) Camby, you can start small,'' Van Gundy said. ``I just 
have to decide what's best for our team in Game 3, and I haven't 
decided yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the initial shock from Wednesday's news about Ewing had  
worn off by the time the players arrived for practice. After they 
finished stretching, Ewing stood before them and spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``He basically said he still believes in us as a team and he  
still wants his ring, so we better keep competing and get the job 
done,'' Sprewell said. ``It's a setback, but it's a challenge, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's role with the Knicks, especially on offense, has  
diminished during the playoffs because of a multitude of injuries. 
He scored 16 points during 40 minutes in Game 1, then had 10 points 
in 25 minutes in Game 2 after feeling a ``ripping sensation'' in 
his Achilles' tendon during pregame warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told it was unlikely that when you have tendinitis it  
leads to a tear. Unfortunately, it happened,'' Ewing said. ``I 
don't regret playing. It was rough enough for me last year to sit 
and watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Ewing will be especially troublesome if the  
remaining Knicks big men get into foul trouble. Van Gundy will be 
reluctant to press 40-year-old backup Herb Williams into service 
behind Dudley and Kurt Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas has been getting the early defensive matchup on Rik  
Smits, while Ewing was guarding the less-dangerous Dale Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he expects Smits to see more playing time since  
he can avoid foul trouble by not having to guard Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The formula for winning is the same no matter who plays: Play  
defense, rebound and get quality shots,'' Van Gundy said. ``We 
can't turn into a jump shooting team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What they can turn into is a run-and-gun team that pushes the  
ball upcourt and tries to get into the paint before Indiana sets up 
its defense. The Knicks had 22 fast-break points in their Game 1 
victory but only seven in the Game 2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ewing sat out 12 games earlier this season, that was the  
strategy the Knicks used successfully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling a little confident because we have played without  
him and we've been successful without him during the regular 
season. He's going to be missed a lot, but we'll play a more 
uptempo style,'' Camby said. ``Everyone's in an uptempo spirit, 
everyone's ready to raise their level of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Indianapolis, the Pacers said they know what to expect of the  
Ewing-less Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at it one of two ways,'' Davis said. ``Either  
they're going to respond to him or it is going to hurt them badly. 
Knowing the character of that team, I think they'll respond 
positively. I look for them to push the ball more. They're going to 
be home, so I look for them to be more of an uptempo team.''

<HEADLINE> Cancer Tests at Department Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It's been more than a year since Janet  
Harris was screened for breast cancer. The 64-year-old grandmother, 
who still puts in a full work week, says that between grocery 
shopping and church activities, there's little time for things like 
regular mammograms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called my doctor's office to try to make an appointment, and  
the earliest they could get me in was the middle of June,'' said 
Harris. ``And they weren't open on the weekends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was among the first women to sign up for a mammogram at  
the St. Vincent Women's Center, which opened Thursday at the 
Lazarus department store in suburban Indianapolis. There, in a set 
of offices off the store's bathing suit department, women can get 
screened for breast cancer for an initial fee of $75, which can be 
charged to their Lazarus credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	The center also tests for osteoporosis for an additonal $25.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a great idea,'' said Harris, her purse in one  
hand, a shopping bag in the other. She happened to be taking a spin 
through the department store on her lunch break when she noticed 
the center's big, pink sign next to the Ladies Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 43,000 women in the United States are expected to die  
this year from breast cancer, the second-deadliest form of cancer 
among women. The American Cancer Society recommends that women age 
40 and over get mammograms each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The center is the first of its kind in Indiana, and the seventh  
to be opened by the store's parent company, Federated Department 
Stores of Cincinnati. Over the past 18 months, the chain has given 
up permanent floor space for similar breast-cancer screening 
centers in its stores in Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio; Pittsburgh, 
Miami, Atlanta and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Each is operated by a local hospital or health care company, and  
offers slightly different on-site screening services in addition to 
the mammograms. Test results are sent to both the patient's home 
and their regular doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big message is convenience,'' said Ellen Fruchtman, a  
spokeswoman for the Federated's Rich's/Lazarus/Goldsmith's 
division, whose stores house five of the chain's seven centers. The 
division's five established centers screened 3,500 women last year, 
and detected six cases of cancer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now women can add a screening to their shopping lists,'' said  
Fruchtman, who declined to specify how much Federated has invested 
in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to the National Retail Federation, such an  
investment pays off for retailers in the long run. After all, women 
are responsible for up to 80 percent of all retail shopping in the 
country, said Pam Rucker, a spokeswoman for the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	``It pays off in goodwill to the consumer,'' Rucker said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If a retailer has a reputation as being a good corporate  
citizen, that could help instill good customer loyalty,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not a new idea in the retail business, where stores for  
decades have been offering everything from free clothes to Bosnian 
refugees to space for child-safety education, Rucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just getting more notice now,'' she said. ``The issues,  
the causes, are much more high-profile. Breast cancer gets a lot of 
notoriety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that can save lives, said Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman  
for the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything like this has to be viewed as a positive,'' said  
Schellenbach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It presents women with a convenient opportunity, and perhaps  
removes an excuse they may be making which is, I just haven't found 
the time.''

<HEADLINE> Tribes Sue Tobacco Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- American Indians have filed a $1 billion  
lawsuit against the tobacco industry, claiming they were unfairly 
excluded from the massive settlement reached by states. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again in Indian country we have been left clear out of  
the process,'' said Wilfred Louie, one of several tribal officials 
who appeared at a news conference Thursday to discuss the class 
action federal suit filed on behalf of 20 tribes and pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed Wednesday in San Francisco, demands $1 billion  
in compensation and punitive damages from several tobacco 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit stems from an agreement reached last November in which  
the tobacco industry promised to pay $40 billion over 25 years to 
settle four state lawsuits and another $206 billion in a broader 
deal with the other 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Indians were counted in census data used  
to determine how the money would be distributed but were not 
allotted their own share of the money. The suit claims that is a 
violation of Indian sovereignty and amounts to racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the tobacco industry said officials had not seen  
the suit and could not comment on its allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for California Attorney General  
Bill Lockyer, said the assumption that Indians won't benefit from 
the settlement is ``perhaps a premature conclusion, at least for 
California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Indians traditionally have used tobacco  
for ceremonial and medicinal purposes only. But during World War 
II, Indian soldiers were introduced to cigarettes and tobacco 
companies began targeting that population, the suit charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, American Indians smoke at a rate of 39 percent, compared  
to 26 percent for blacks, 25 percent for whites, 18 percent for 
Hispanics and 15 percent for Asians, the suit says.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Management Exodus Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The recent management exodus from Compaq Computer  
Corp. continued Wednesday with the announcement that John Rose, a 
senior vice president, is resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest personal computer maker also said it has  
named Michael Capellas as acting chief operating officer, a new 
position. He had been a senior vice president and chief information 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of executive departures began earlier this year when, in  
the wake of stunningly poor earnings, the board of directors ousted 
chief executive officer Eckhard Pfeiffer. Earl Mason, chief 
financial officer, also resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq also named Enrico Pesatori as a senior vice president to  
replace Rose atop the company's Enterprise Computing Group. Fred 
Jones moves up to replace Capellas as acting chief information 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	As Compaq searches for a new chief executive, chairman Benjamin  
Rosen is heading an interim management team composed of directors 
Frank Doyle, a retired General Electric Co. executive, and Robert 
Ted Enloe III.

<HEADLINE> Tears Shed for Fenway Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A. Bartlett Giamatti once compared Fenway Park to  
Mount Olympus, the pyramids at Giza and the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Except ... it was better than all those inconsequential  
places,'' wrote the scholar-turned-baseball commissioner who, like 
many American intellectuals, was given to flights of poetry and 
hyperbole about the nation's smallest major league ballpark, built 
in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	Old and small, however, do not add up to major league profits.  
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox want to tear down Fenway Park and build a  
bigger ballpark across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal has led to an outpouring of opposition, nostalgia  
and, yes, support from Fenway's most faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever tears I've had for Fenway, I've long since shed,''  
said Roger Angell, the New Yorker magazine editor who wrote the 
classic baseball book ``The Summer Game.'' ``We can let some of 
these parks go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway and Detroit's Tiger Stadium are the nation's oldest major  
league ballparks. They opened on the same day, April 20, 1912. 
Tiger Stadium, however, will close at the end of the season, and 
the team will move to a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway was featured in the 1989 movie ``Field of Dreams,'' and  
the writer John Updike once called the lopsided, 33,871-seat 
ballpark a ``lyric little bandbox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Boston Herald poll showed 49 percent of Massachusetts  
voters don't want to let go of Fenway's beloved nooks and crannies, 
its hand-operated scoreboard, the outfield bullpens where Ted 
Williams used to deposit his homers, and the Green Monster, the 
37-foot-high wall in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fenway's awesome,'' David Doucette, a 28-year-old corporate  
banker, said Thursday. ``I like the old Fenway just like I liked 
the old Garden,'' referring to the Boston Garden, legendary home of 
the Celtics and Bruins that was torn down last year after a newer, 
larger arena was built next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one percent of those polled supported tearing down the  
park and getting rid of the narrow seats, the views obstructed by 
grandstand poles, and the puddles of standing water when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time they did it,'' said pitcher Pedro Martinez,  
the team's Cy Young Award winner. ``It's like an old man who passes 
away. You have to let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox say they need the revenue from a bigger park if  
they're ever to win a World Series, something that has eluded them 
ever since they committed the error of selling Babe Ruth to the 
Yankees in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should, with that treacly `baseball is life' stuff,  
convince you otherwise: I believe baseball is life, but life is 
profits,'' said filmmaker Ken Burns, a Fenway fan who chronicled 
baseball's history in an affectionate, nine-part series on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox plan is to build a ballpark that is 35 percent  
bigger than the house that Ruth fled, but -- like Baltimore's Camden 
Yards and Cleveland's Jacobs Field -- one that retains the intimacy 
and charm of older ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents of the Kenmore Square neighborhoo agree the Red  
Sox need a better home field. But many of them object mightily to 
the team's plans to destroy 24 buildings when they move home plate 
206 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that this new megaplex belongs in this area at  
all,'' said Stephen M. Mindich, chairman of the Phoenix Media Group 
and owner of several buildings the Red Sox want the city to take by 
eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighborhood group called Save Fenway Park! hired an architect  
to draw up plans to renovate the old ballpark by adding seats, 
luxury boxes and concession areas. But Red Sox officials, along 
with Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, have said saving the park is 
not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has cultivated the state's most powerful politicians,  
who may be called on for up to $200 million for the $350 million 
park. The preservationists are likewise lobbying lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate will probably intensify during the days leading up to  
this year's All-Star Game, which will be held at Fenway on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox best-case scenario has a new park opening in 2003.  
But Dan Shaughnessy, the Boston Globe sportswriter who has waxed 
eloquent on the old ballpark in two books and hundreds of columns, 
believes it will take at least five more years, given Boston 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like it to be forever,'' he said, ``but I understand the  
reality.''

<HEADLINE> Doyle a Favorite on Senior PGA Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) -- To watch Allen Doyle swing a golf club on  
the Senior PGA Tour is to understand why he is fast becoming a fan 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a home-grown, slapshot-type swing that can be seen on any  
public course -- or hockey rink. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get more and more people saying I'm their hope,'' Doyle said  
Thursday after his final practice round for the $1.1 million 
Cadillac NFL Golf Classic, which starts Friday at the Upper 
Montclair Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see a funny, odd swing and they can identify with this  
guy,'' Doyle said. ``That's nice that they will say nice things to 
you, but you still have to hit the ball and get it in the hole. 
There isn't anything wrong with being unique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 50-year-old who won the Senior Tour's national qualifying  
tournament to earn his playing card, Doyle has become one of the 
most remarkable stories on the tour. In 13 events, he has two wins, 
a second, seven top 10s and 10 top 25 finishes. His earnings of 
$871,364 are second to fellow rookie Bruce Fleisher, the tour's 
only three-time winner this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is something very new to Doyle. Unlike like most of  
the Seniors on the tour, Doyle didn't turn pro until 1995, and that 
was on the Nike Tour. He got on the PGA Tour the following year at 
47 years old, becoming the oldest rookie in tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	Before turning pro, the one-time hockey player from the New  
England area made his living running a driving range in La Grange, 
Ga., earning between $30,000-$35,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	When time allowed, he played golf rather well. He won six  
Georgia amateur titles, played on two Walker Cup teams and 
represented the United States on three World Amateur Cup teams. 
</P>
<P>
	At each level, there were people chuckling at his game and  
swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always the guy no one wanted to talk to,'' Doyle said.  
``It was always (David) Duval, (Justin) Leonard or (Tiger) Woods or 
(Scott) Verplank or (Phil) Mickelson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle is now getting his chance and he intends to make the most  
of it. With two daughters in college, he wants the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a guy who has played the tour for 25 years and has  
millions, it's just a continuation for him,' Doyle said. ``For a 
guy who has played a short period of time and has that opportunity, 
you have to seize it in those first few years or you don't have 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 54-hole tournament is being run in conjunction with an event  
for NFL players. Only five of the top 10 money winners on the 
Senior Tour are in the field, with Dana Quigley, Graham Marsh and 
Tom Jenkins joining Fleisher and Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dickson is the defending champion, having won last year's  
event in a playoff with Larry Nelson. Other former winners in the 
field include Lee Trevino, Raymond Floyd and Bob Murphy.

<HEADLINE> Another Good Month for Retailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans' shopping spree extended into May,  
boosting sales at the nation's biggest retailers to 
better-than-expected levels for the fourth straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued strength of the U.S. economy combined with warmer  
weather through much of the country encouraged consumers to do lots 
of buying in May -- from sundresses to patio furniture to beach 
towels. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers for May are extremely strong and that's because  
the consumer is very confident about their current economic 
situation and the outlook for the coming months,'' said Kurt 
Barnard, who heads the retail consulting firm Barnard's Retail 
Trend Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The robust U.S. economy, as well as low unemployment and  
inflation levels have made consumers confident about their personal 
finances and has raised their eagerness to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	And their spending didn't slow last month even with the extreme  
volatility on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 
to a record high of 11,107.19 on May 13, but then fell by about 5 
percent by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that the vibrant and value-conscious American  
consumer is still very much alive,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, managing 
director at Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in May were specialty clothing chains, while  
department stores also fared well. Discounters were strong, as 
shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart and Target for their wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in sales came despite being compared with the very  
strong performance of May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some merchants -- including Kmart and J.C. Penney -- were  
hurt by the late Memorial Day this year. Most retailers ended their 
fiscal month of May on the 28th or 29th, which meant that much of 
the buying over the holiday weekend will be included in June's 
sales figures. Memorial Day was observed on May 31 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 4.8 percent in May. It rose 6.4 percent in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 7.7 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 14.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 1.9 percent, total sales down 2.8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 3.7 percent, total sales up 5.6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales up 2.2 percent,  
same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 13.4 percent, total 
sales rose 9.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 6.3 percent, total sales up  
10.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 4.1 percent, total sales up  
14.9 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 2.9 percent, total  
sales up 7.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 10 percent, total sales up 8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 8 percent, total sales up 28 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After surveying the proximity of  
Silverbulletday's assigned stall in Barn 1 at Belmont Park to the 
heavy traffic on Hempstead Turnpike, trainer Bob Baffert set out to 
find other quarters for the filly. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday morning, shortly before Silverbulletday's arrival  
from Kentucky, Baffert and owner Mike Pegram happened to visit 
exercise rider Tonja Batsch at Barn 50, on the complete opposite 
end of the track. Underneath the towering oaks next to the barn is 
a shady, cool deck with a picnic table covered by an umbrella. It 
was built by trainer Bobby Barbara, whose horses occupy most of the 
stalls in Barn 50. 
</P>
<P>
	After being introduced to Baffert, Barbara offered him the use  
of one of his stalls for Silverbulletday. But Pegram, already 
ensconced in one of the chairs and enjoying the morning breeze, had 
already reached a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't moving from here,'' said Pegram. ``To heck with Barn  
1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The filly arrived at Barn 50 an hour later.  
</P>

	 *VISA RENEWS SPONSORSHIP: VISA USA has renewed its exclusive  
sponsorship of the $5 million Visa Triple Crown Challenge bonus, 
which began in 1996 and will now continue through 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	The $5 million bonus is awarded to the owner of any horse that  
wins all three Triple Crown races: the Kentucky Derby, the 
Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. There have been only 11 Triple 
Crown winners in thoroughbred racing history, the most recent being 
Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Charismatic will try to complete the sweep when he  
takes on 11 challengers in the 1 1/2 mile Belmont, which will see a 
Triple Crown on the line for the third straight year. In 1997, 
Silver Charm was foiled by Touch Gold and last year Real Quiet's 
bid was thwarted by Victory Gallop. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *NEW YORK TRIPLE: June 5 may be one of the biggest days in New  
York sports history.. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5:27 p.m. at Belmont Park, Charismatic will try to become  
racing's 12th Triple Crown winner in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	About four hours earlier, the New York Mets host their American  
League rivals, the New York Yankees, at Shea Stadium beginning at 
1:15 p.m. in the middle game of their interleague series. 
</P>
<P>
	And at 6:30 p.m. at Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks  
will face the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of the NBA Eastern 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	At Belmont Park, the Yankees-Mets games will be shown on TV  
on-track at many locations and the track will keep the third floor 
clubhouse and the second floor grandstand open and tuned in to the 
Pacers-Knicks game until its conclusion. 
</P>

<P>
	 *RUNNING MAN: Jockey Chris Antley, who will be aboard  
Charismatic in the Belmont, says he has a new appreciation of what 
horses go through in their training regimens. In the effort to lose 
the 30-odd pounds he gained while away from riding, Antley ran up 
to 25 miles a day for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was about nine or 10 percent body fat at 125 pounds, so I  
had to kind of go into my own muscle,'' said Antley, who weighs in 
at 114 pounds. ``So I kind of played with my body until it cursed 
me back. 
</P>
<P>
	``My left knee went, and my right knee went, and I have no  
cartilage in my right knee from the constant pounding. I had to 
change my training because I kept breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne (Lukas) talks about training -- I have a lot more  
respect now.''

	 *BELMONT BITS: The Belmont Stakes was first run at Jerome Park  
in 1867, then moved to Morris Park in the Bronx in 1890. In 1905, 
the race was moved to its current location at Belmont Park. ... A 
filly, Ruthless, won the very first Belmont Stakes, while another 
filly, Tanya, took the first running at the new Belmont Park in 
1905. ... Of the 130 previous runnings of the Belmont, 58 have been 
won by favorites. ... The lowest-priced winner was Count Fleet 
($2.10 in 1943), the highest-priced was Sherluck ($132.10 in 1961). 
... Best of Luck, the 6-1 fourth choice in the Belmont, worked 4 
furlongs in 49 3-5 and galloped out 5 furlongs in 1:02. ``I'd have 
liked to go a little faster, but he seems to be doing OK,'' trainer 
Allen Jerkens said. ... Vison and Verse, trained by Hall of Famer 
Bill Mott, had a strong 1 1-2-mile gallop on the main track, and 
Mott said ``he definitely got something out of it. At this point, 
everything is going well.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Must Do More Than Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No one in the Clinton administration is  
willing to simply take Slobodan Milosevic at his word. 
</P>
<P>
	He will, at a minimum, have to order his army and police forces  
in Kosovo to stop fighting and start heading home. 
</P>
<P>
	Given his history of broken promises, any NATO decision to stop  
bombing Yugoslavia will rest on a judgment about whether the 
long-defiant Milosevic has really been broken after 72 days of 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want this to be an exercise in paper promises,''  
Defense Secretary William Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton struck the ``trust, but verify'' theme in  
remarks Thursday at the White House in which he welcomed 
indications from Belgrade that the Yugoslav leadership has decided 
to yield to NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on our past experience, we must also be cautious,''  
Clinton added. ``First we must have clarity that the Serbian 
leadership has fully accepted these conditions and intends to fully 
implement them.'' Until a verifiable Serb troop withdrawal is under 
way NATO will keep bombing, the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who was deeply  
involved in the diplomacy that brought about the Yugoslav 
agreement, said Milosevic must now begin ``prompt unambiguous 
implementation'' of the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The West learned a lesson in Milosevic's methods last fall, when  
he agreed -- under threat of NATO bombing -- to stop attacking the 
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which was fighting for independence 
from Serbia. The KLA agreed to a cease-fire and to enter good-faith 
negotiations. But the deal fell apart within weeks, and monitoring 
officials said both sides broke their peace promises. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference this time, in the view of Brookings Institution  
analyst John Steinbruner, is that a large, heavily armed 
international force under NATO command would enter Kosovo to 
implement the accord. Also, an interim administration for Kosovo 
would be set up under the auspices of the United Nations, which 
Steinbruner believes would mean that Milosevic would have less 
opportunity to undermine it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an entirely different situation'' from last fall,  
Steinbruner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also different is the condition of Milosevic's military after  
more than two months of unrelenting bombing. NATO claims to have 
destroyed at least one-third of the Serb armor in Kosovo, 80 
percent of the Serb air force, and large portions of the air 
defenses, fuel, ammunition and other resupply resources. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past seven days alone, NATO warplanes struck 310 pieces  
of Serb heavy armor, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration's cautionary response Thursday  
reflects a determination not to let Milosevic off the hook by 
stopping the bombing before it is clear that the peace terms will 
be met in full. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said the bombing would be  
suspended, not ended, if Milosevic demonstrates his acceptance of 
NATO's terms by beginning a verifiable withdrawal from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The word suspension is extremely important because if the rest  
of the withdrawal didn't take place ... and this is what we need to 
guard against given the history of our dealings with President 
Milosevic as recently as his violations, repeated violations, of 
the October agreements -- we would want to be able to resume the air 
campaign,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to halt the bombing will rest with the North  
Atlantic Council, the primary decision-making body of NATO. The 
Clinton administration wants to be as certain as possible of 
Milosevic's intentions before that NATO decision is made, because 
once the bombing stops it would be hard to restart. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doubt that anything short of forcing Milosevic from power  
will bring a lasting peace to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't accept promises or pledges from people like  
Milosevic,'' former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told CNN.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed To Cut 2,000 Jobs in Ga. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. is cutting another  
2,000 jobs at its Marietta plant, or nearly 21 percent of its work 
force at facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contractor disclosed the plans today, saying it  
hopes to accomplish 40 percent of the cuts through early 
retirement, attrition and transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant makes the C-130J military transport plane and is the  
lead developer of the F-22 stealth fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Sam Grizzle said the cuts will be across the board,  
including management. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is part of an ongoing initiative. We've been looking hard  
at how to cut costs,'' Grizzle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for the C-130J have been slow, and Lockheed faces a  
production slowdown over the next three to six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which laid off 280 workers in January, had as many  
as 32,000 employees in Marietta, northwest of Atlanta, in the 
1970s.

<HEADLINE> Daly Withdraws After Six-Putt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- John Daly wasn't having a good day before he  
got to the 18th hole in the opening round of the Memorial 
Tournament on Thursday. Then it got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The last hole proved to be his last hole as he withdrew after a  
six-putt 10 for an 82 on the 444-yard, par-4 hole. It was the 
highest score on the hole in the tournament's 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was 4-over on the round as he stood over an uphill 8-foot  
par putt at the finishing hole. 
</P>
<P>
	He rolled the ball 2 feet past the cup, then quickly stroked the  
comeback putt 4 feet down the hill. He again putted quickly, 
pushing his uphill putt a couple of feet past the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	On his fourth putt, he took a stab at the ball even as he kicked  
at it. He finally two-putted from 5 feet for his 10. 
</P>
<P>
	After his playing partners finished, he walked off the green and  
between the ropes leading to the scorer's tent. He was handed a hat 
to autograph and after signing it, he threw the hat over his head 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly then withdrew from the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Can't Work During Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Illegal immigrants can't work while they  
appeal their deportation orders, a federal court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a federal  
judge's 1998 injunction that entitled 19 immigrants to keep their 
work permits pending court appeals of their deportations. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1986 law entitles illegal immigrants appealing deportation  
orders to have work permits if their applications are 
``non-frivolous.'' The law specified that the permits would be 
valid until a final determination of their status. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service interpreted the law  
to mean it was required to provide work permits only until its own 
``final determination'' of applications, leaving immigrants 
ineligible to work legally while awaiting court review. 
</P>
<P>
	Reasoning that a ``final determination'' includes a judicial  
review, U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins of San Francisco 
prohibited the government from revoking the permits until the 
workers had lost their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appeals court, in a 3-0 ruling, said Congress had  
consistently used the term ``final determination'' in immigration 
laws to refer to INS actions, not court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ruling had been upheld, it could have affected thousands  
of immigrants nationwide, said Jonathan M. Kaufman, lawyer for the 
immigrants in the suit. He said judicial review of deportation 
orders can take up to six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who have no employment authorization have to work  
illegally,'' Kaufman said. ``Obviously that leaves them open to all 
kinds of exploitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said making things difficult for illegal aliens was  
one of the specific goals of the 1986 law.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Weather Fears / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rose sharply on the  
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for weather conditions that 
could reduce this year's crop production. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service's latest 10-day forecast calls for  
above-normal temperatures and normal to below-normal rainfall in 
Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather could stress young crops early, and market  
participants are beginning to worry a dry weather pattern in some 
eastern growing states could sharply reduce production on what is 
expected to be bumper acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, substantial rainfall in western growing states such as  
North Dakota and Iowa was keeping farmers from completing final 
planting. Wheat futures in particular benefited from such delays in 
spring wheat plantings, which come as the window of opportunity for 
getting those crops into the ground comes to a close. Wheat also 
gained amid expectations heavy recent rainfall in the Plains may 
have reduced the quality of the winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 7 3/4 cents to $2.61 a bushel; July  
corn jumped 6 1/2 cents to $2.23 1/4 a bushel; July oats rose 3 3/4 cents to 
$1.26 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 6 3/4 cents to $4.65 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and lean hog futures advanced on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle were mixed and pork 
bellies retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .25 cent to 64.77 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .30 cent to 75.37 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .37 cent to 51.02 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .48

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Edge Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits edged up slightly last week to the highest 
level in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that 305,000 Americans filed new  
claims for jobless benefits last week, up by 4,000 from the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was unexpected. Most economists had been looking  
for jobless claims to remain unchanged from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which helps  
smooth out week-to-week volatility, also was up, rising to 304,250, 
also the highest level since the week ending May 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the slight increase, the jobless claims applications  
are remaining at low levels, which analysts say depicts an 
extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	The government on Friday will report on unemployment for the  
month of April and many analysts believe the rate will stay at 4.3 
percent, close to a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing has lost more than 400,000 jobs in the past year  
due to the global financial crisis, which has cut into exports and 
increased cheap imports into this country. But the rest of the U.S. 
economy has continued to forge ahead, powered by strong consumer 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said that for the week ending May 22, 32  
states and territories reported declines in jobless claims while 21 
had increases. The state data lags a week behind the national 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the biggest declines in applications for jobless  
benefits were Michigan, down 913; Pennsylvania, down 873; New 
Jersey, down 786; Missouri, down 702, and New York, down 652. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase in claims for the week  
ending May 22 was Mississippi, where claims rose 1,607, an increase 
officials blamed on layoffs in apparel and service industries. 
Other states with large claims increases were Iowa, up 1,277; 
Arkansas, up 1,064; Oregon, up 896, and Florida, up 646.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Study Knicks Without Ewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- They may be just trying a little reverse  
psychology, but the Indiana Pacers say the loss of Patrick Ewing 
makes the New York Knicks a quicker, more dangerous team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes our job a little more difficult. First, because of  
the simple fact they've been playing so much without him,'' said 
Reggie Miller, who made a snide remark to the New York center after 
Ewing missed a 15-footer at the buzzer in Game 2 Tuesday that would 
have sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you make the last shot, that's all that matters,''  
Miller said. ``Right, Pat?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller had hit two free throws with two seconds to play in the  
game, giving the Pacers a split of the first two games. Game 3 is 
Saturday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing will watch the rest of the playoffs in a suit and a cast  
on his left foot. He learned Wednesday that he has a partial tear 
of his left Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was more contrite on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unfortunate. Looking at the game, I knew he was  
hobbling a little bit. But, looking at all the other playoff series 
I thought he was going to play through the pain,'' Miller said. 
``It's unfortunate he isn't there, but I think that makes them a 
more dangerous team. A wounded animal is more dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller and his teammates believe the absence of the 36-year-old  
Ewing will mean more fast-break attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look for it to be more of a track meet. A lot of time ... he  
would wait at half court to see if they got the fast break and then 
he would run down and get in the post and they would throw it in,'' 
Miller said. ``Now they're going to put on track shoes and really 
try and get out and run, get as many easy baskets as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rik Smits, who is likely to be defended by Chris Dudley with  
Ewing gone, anticipates his task will be more challenging 
offensively and on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He works his butt off on defense. He's tough down there. He's  
a guy that doesn't let anything come easy,'' Smits said of Dudley. 
``Dudley is a great rebounder. He's a guy who really works hard to 
get into position, beat his man off the board. It's going to be 
tough. I don't see things getting any easier for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smits felt compassion for Ewing, who he has battled for much of  
his career -- including five playoff series in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect him as a fellow athlete, putting in this many years.  
He's got a lot of miles on him, a lot of hours. He's been trying to 
get that first championship,'' Smits said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt real bad for him, to play this far with this much pain  
and this much discomfort and now you've got to sit down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Dale Davis thought the loss of Ewing gave the Knicks a  
chance to show their character. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely going to be big,'' Davis said of Ewing's  
absence. '' Even though he was banged up he was in there giving 110 
percent. He's their leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at it one of two ways, either they're going to  
respond to him or it is going to hurt them badly. Knowing the 
character of that team, I think they'll respond positively,'' Davis 
said. ``I look for them to push the ball more. They're going to be 
home, so I look for them to be more of an up-tempo team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at the things that he was doing when he was on  
the floor, while he was hurting, he still was rebounding,'' Antonio 
Davis said of Ewing. ``He still was trying his best to control the 
middle. I think if we're able to get guys in there attempting to 
rebound. Maybe that will be one stat that we'll have in our favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we need something in our favor in order to be  
successful.''

<HEADLINE> Interleague Play Is Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	To fans at Yankee Stadium, Dodger Stadium and Jacobs Field this  
weekend, interleague play figures to be a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
	To Mark McGwire, Pedro Martinez and John Franco, the whole thing  
is still a big miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do anything for the game,'' McGwire insisted. ``It  
screwed up the schedule and hasn't gained the notoriety they 
thought it would. I think we should go back to the way the game of 
baseball is meant to be played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No such luck, Big Mac.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, interleague play returns for the third season starting  
Friday night. The featured matchups: New York Mets at New York 
Yankees, Anaheim at Los Angeles and Oakland at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, McGwire and his St. Louis Cardinals visit Detroit while  
Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs travel to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	And this year's twist: Some natural rivals, such as  
Yankees-Mets, White Sox-Cubs and Blue Jays-Expos, will play six 
games, up from the previous three. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six games is too much,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``If  
you have to have something like this, three games is enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Toronto outfielder Shawn Green: ``It's kind of weird. We  
play Montreal six times and some American League teams only seven 
or eight games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those counting, AL teams held a 114-110 advantage last  
season. The year before, NL clubs had a 117-97 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds ran above the average for those games, though last  
season's attendance figure of 31,447 dipped from 33,407 in 1997. 
Naturally, the upcoming games in New York will be sellouts; 
Minnesota and Milwaukee next week might not do so well. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's 252 interleague games will be played from June 4-13  
and July 9-20. Originally proposed by owners as a two-year 
experiment, the players' union gave its approval to continue it 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, AL teams are hurt when they lose the designated hitter  
for games at NL parks. While Edgar Martinez may become a 
pinch-hittier when Seattle plays on the road, Anaheim manager Terry 
Collins intends to use Mo Vaughn -- limited to DH duties since May 
11 because of a sprained left ankle -- back at first base at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of history there,'' Vaughn said. ``They've got a  
great ballclub, I've got some friends over there. I'm looking 
forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fanfare is certainly down from the first year, when the concept  
became one of the most hotly debated issues in baseball history. 
Proponents said the plan would take the sport into the future, 
while critics claimed it would wreck more than 100 years of 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was more exciting the first year,'' St. Louis  
manager Tony La Russa said. ``I thought the original idea made the 
most sense -- that you give the fans in either league a chance to 
see all players from the other league, which means we were going to 
play the Central, then the East, then the West, instead of just 
playing the Central all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, though, it will be East teams vs. East teams,  
Central vs. Central and West vs. West. There are some quirks, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the NL Central has six clubs and the AL Central has  
five, St. Louis does not play Cleveland at all. That could be an 
advantage to the Cardinals if they get into a wild-card race with 
the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play the Yankees six times. I don't think it's fair  
to do that, especially when they're not in your division, your 
league,'' said Franco, the Mets reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was up to me, I'd keep it just National, no interleague  
at all. But it brings a lot of money to owners, so we have it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa agreed, up to a point.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you wanted to get a microscope out, you might find a little  
inequity,'' he said. ``I think because of the nature of the game, 
that stuff works itself out. You're only talking about 15 games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Martinez, who pitches for Boston against the Atlanta Braves  
and Massachusetts native Tom Glavine on Friday night at Fenway 
Park, this interleague stuff is no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just other players, I don't see anything exciting about  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Philadelphia manager Terry Francona, there's a side  
benefit. In a plan right out of the old days, the Phillies struck a 
deal with Amtrak for a charter to take them to Baltimore this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shoot, we get a train ride out of it,'' he said. ``You can't  
beat that.''

<HEADLINE> Mark Portugal May Quit Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) -- After meeting with Boston Red Sox general  
manager Dan Duquette and manager Jimy Williams for nearly an hour 
Thursday, pitcher Mark Portugal said he will make an announcement 
about his future on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation that the 36-year-old would retire to spend more time  
with his three children mounted after Portugal cleaned out his 
locker after pitching three innings against the Detroit Tigers on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important priority is my state of being and we're  
going to try and work on that and tomorrow have a better answer,'' 
Portugal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan confirmed that the right-hander  
wants to retire, The Boston Globe reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite indications that he would leave the game after pitching  
11 years in the major leagues, Portugal did not rule out that he 
might continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to tie up some loose ends on my end before I can  
come back and play baseball,'' Portugal said. ``The kids are the 
most important things in my life and I know they want me to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal signed a $2.7 million, one-year contract with the Red  
Sox, a deal that gives Boston a $3.3 million option with a $300,000 
buyout. He is 3-3 with a 5.33 ERA in 10 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two years, Portugal, who has been on the disabled  
list 10 times in his career, has had surgery on both his pitching 
elbow, which caused him to miss almost all of the 1997 season, and 
his left knee. He wears a brace on his right knee, which was 
operated on previously. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Williams said Portugal's issue is not physical.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not his health. You know, mentally maybe he's not into  
it anymore,'' center fielder Darren Lewis said. ``If that's the 
case and you're at the point mentally, then there's no point to be 
in the game if you don't have that fire to compete. Plus, wanting 
to see his kids, that just adds to the problems. I'm sure he want 
to spend some time with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has the team in mind when he does make the decision  
because he's not doing us any good by being here if he's not into 
it,'' pitcher Derek Lewis added. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1980, Portugal  
played for the Astros, Giants, Reds and Phillies before coming to 
Boston. An 18-game winner in 1993, Portugal is 105-86 in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said Pat Rapp was scheduled to take Portugal's turn on  
the mound Sunday against the Atlanta Braves.

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh's Smith Wins 7th Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- For the second straight year, Stanford  
runners finished 1-2-3 in the 10,000 meters, helping their team 
take the early lead in the NCAA men's track championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Nathan Nutter won the event in 29 minutes, 11.96 seconds  
with a burst in the final yards, and teammates Jason Balkman and 
Brent Hauser were right behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford, runnerup to Arkansas last year, moved into first place  
with 24 points, 11 ahead of Auburn. The Cardinal also led after the 
first day of last year's championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Finals were scheduled today in the women's shot put, men's long  
jump, women's high jump and women's 10,000 meters. Competition on 
the Boise State University track continues through Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdi Abdirahman of Arizona came into the race with the fastest  
time this season in the 10,000 meters and led the first two-thirds 
of the race. But the Stanford runners stayed close, burst into the 
lead in the final laps and won going away. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutter said it was his best race of the season. He captured the  
Pac-10 championship last month, but said it was only because a 
teammate let him finish first because he was a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phenomenal,'' he said. ``We couldn't win any more points than  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh's Trecia Smith wons her seventh national track and  
field title, but wanted to talk more about her upcoming events than 
winning the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	She competes Friday in the triple jump and Friday and Saturday  
in the heptathlon. ``My goal is to finish all three events. I 
pulled up last year in the triple jump, and I want to finish all 
three events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had no problems Wednesday, winning her second outdoor long  
jump championship with a leap of of 21 feet, 8 1/4 inches. That was 
nearly six inches ahead of runnerup Angie Smith of James Mason, 
last year's champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Florence Ezeh of Southern Methodist won the women's hammer with  
a toss of 207-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The LSU women's team, which saw a string of 11 straight  
championships broken by Texas last year, saw its chances fall when 
the 400-meter relay team dropped the baton on the first exchange 
and didn't finish, failing to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Chenelle Marshall and Joyce Bates of LSU didn't make the  
connection in the first handoff in the 400 relay, and the baton 
fell to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just brushed my hand,'' Marshall said. ``I'm very  
disappointed. It's my only event. We've just got to put this behind 
us.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't believe it,'' Bates said. ``I didn't think we  
would come out here and drop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bates still thinks LSU has a good chance to recapture the  
championship. ``We've always come from behind. Everybody just has 
to focus and do what they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A freshman who has been in the United States only since January,  
Auburn's Gabor Mate won the discus at 202-1, and immediately 
pronounced himself ``the happiest man in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mate, a native of Hungary, said it was the first time he'd ever  
won against major competition. He was 7 inches behind his personal 
best, but said, ``I'm happy with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Janus Robberts of Southern Methodist won the eight points for  
second place in the discus with a throw of 198-11, and Northern 
Arizona's Nick Petrucci was third at 195-5. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU, Kansas State and Pittsburgh held the first-day lead in the  
women's competition with 10 points each. Southern California was 
fourth with 9 points.

<HEADLINE> BellSouth Plans Fiber-Optic Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth Corp. plans to test a new type of  
fiber-optic data line at 400 suburban Atlanta homes this fall in 
what the company hopes will be its key to providing high-speed 
Internet access affordably. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, which was announced today, involves 400 houses already  
selected in Dunwoody, BellSouth spokesman John Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, the fiber can deliver data at 100 megabits per  
second, faster than the digital subscriber lines (DSL) BellSouth 
has been marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL, which transfers data at about 1.5 megabits per second, has  
encountered some technical difficulties because many homes are in 
areas not equipped to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiber technology also would allow Atlanta-based BellSouth to  
compete with cable companies who offer high-speed Internet access. 
The company expects the fiber technology to be as cheap as copper 
wire in two years as demand grows, Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fiber, called passive optical networking, doesn't  
require a power source between the company and a customer's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the next logical step,'' Goldman said. ``What we are  
doing in Dunwoody is getting ready for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone and cable companies are scrambling to find ways to  
deliver increased speed for Internet connections as consumers turn 
to video and other data-heavy applications online. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth will price the service at $59.95 per month, the same  
as its DSL service.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Holds Off on Euro Food Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department said Thursday it is  
holding off the market all imports of chickens, pork and any 
byproducts from the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made a day after EU officials began  
destroying those items for fear they could be laced with a 
cancer-causing dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's Food and Safety Inspection Service said it was  
acting in response to information received from the Belgian 
government Wednesday when it decided to place a hold on chicken and 
pork. The department could not say how many pounds of imported 
goods the action involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are precautionary steps,'' said Mark Mina, acting  
administrator for the inspection service. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the European Union called for the destruction of  
Belgian chickens, eggs and any byproducts that could contain a 
cancer-causing dioxin. The Belgian government also issued a 
slaughter ban on pigs, fearful that many of them have also been 
infected by the same contaminated animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department, which has not ordered any  
recall of products on store shelves, said it is reviewing products 
imported since January to determine if additional action is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork imports from the EU to the United States totaled $245  
million in 1998. The United States imported virtually no poultry 
meat from the EU during that period, said USDA spokesman Andy 
Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's executive commission ordered the measure after a  
meeting of veterinary experts and lashed out at Belgium for moving 
too slowly when the European consumer could be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal broke last week when a television station reported  
that dioxin-laced fat was used to make poultry feed. Dioxin is a 
carcinogenic byproduct in the manufacture of some herbicides and 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU decision forces EU nations to destroy any poultry, eggs,  
or byproducts from some 400 suspect farms in Belgium produced from 
Jan. 15 to June 1.

<HEADLINE> Polygamist Convicted of Incest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A member of a polygamist clan was  
convicted Thursday of incest and unlawful sex with his 16-year-old 
niece, who testified she was forced to become her uncle's 15th 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The case of David Ortell Kingston brought renewed attention to  
polygamy in Utah, where the polygamist population is estimated to 
include between 20,000 and 30,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretive Kingston clan has as many as 1,000 members and  
business assets worth up to $150 million. While the clan shares 
many of the beliefs of other polygamous groups in Utah, it stands 
apart in practicing incest, former members said. 
</P>
<P>
	At trial, the girl, now 17, said in October 1997 that Kingston,  
33, called her and suggested they marry. 
</P>
<P>
	Her father performed the ceremony and the defendant's other  
wives were in attendance. Her uncle later gave her a ring with 15 
diamonds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ceremony, they had four sexual encounters, all in  
1998, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now is in foster care, stayed at home and sometimes  
visited her uncle after the wedding, she said. She repeatedly tried 
to avoid her husband-uncle and would stay out late with friends 
when she knew he was planning to visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers contended there never was a wedding and no sex  
ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston, an accountant for the family's multimillion dollar  
business empire, was convicted of two of the four felony counts. 
Each conviction carries a penalty of up to five years in prison. 
Sentencing was set for July. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of Utah's population are members of The Church  
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which renounced polygamy in 
1890 after Congress passed tough anti-bigamy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Large-scale prosecution of polygamists has not taken place in  
Utah for more than four decades. Kingston was not charged with 
polygamy, and there was limited discussion of the topic during the 
trial.

<HEADLINE> Stoudamire's Complaints Puzzle Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- To opponents and even his coach, Damon  
Stoudamire's attitude this week has been puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
	He makes $9 million a year as the starting point guard for the  
Portland Trail Blazers, who are in the Western Conference 
semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs. But instead of talking 
about Friday night's Game 3, or how he's going to bring the Blazers 
back from a 2-0 deficit, he's been talking about himself. 
</P>
<P>
	More specifically, his lack of playing time late in important  
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Dunleavy's pattern of going to the more experienced,  
more defensive-minded Greg Anthony in the fourth quarter has irked 
Stoudamire all season. But like the rest of the players on the 
crowded Portland roster, he has been quiet about the reduced 
minutes because the Blazers have been winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Stoudamire didn't start openly complaining about the  
situation until Wednesday, two days after he factored heavily in 
the outcome of Game 2. Stoudamire played most of the fourth 
quarter, but he committed a costly turnover and missed one of two 
free throws with 12 seconds left. That allowed the Spurs' Sean 
Elliott to win the game 86-85 with a 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire on Wednesday said he would never forget all the times  
he's watched the action from the bench in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm 55 years old, I'll sit back and remember what  
happened to me this year,'' he said. ``I don't ever want to feel 
like this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday's practice at the Rose Garden, Stoudamire,  
facing a mob of reporters and cameras, said too much was being made 
of his remarks. But he didn't take them back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said what I felt,'' he said. ``It's not like I'm not  
accepting it. I'm going on with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always want to play, but right now it can't really be that  
big of a deal. Bottom line is, if we've been doing it for this 
long, it's not going to change, so there's no need to complain or 
cry about it all the time. I'm just going to do what I can in the 
minutes I'm on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy said he'll stick to what has been working, and compared  
Anthony to a relief pitcher who comes in to spell Stoudamire, a 
better scorer and playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your starter is going good and he gets you to a certain  
point and you've got Goose Gossage in the bullpen, (he can) come 
put out the fire,'' Dunleavy said. ``If you've got momentum and 
you're playing well, there's no reason to change it up. You'd be 
silly not to just ride what's going for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy seemed perplexed at the timing of Stoudamire's  
comments. Asked why he thought the problem surfaced after 
Stoudamire had played right up to the end of Game 2, the coach 
said, ``I'm still trying to figure that one out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire's teammates backed him up Wednesday, saying there's  
no questioning his desire to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Damon's concerns are valid,'' shooting guard Jim Jackson said.  
``Here's a guy who wants to compete and wants to play. He's not 
taking shots at anybody else. That's a competitor who wants to play 
more than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said the Blazers, a young, talented group not used to  
being this deep in the playoffs, will learn to put aside personal 
goals as they mature. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're an older group. We've been through situations where  
maybe we were unhappy with our playing time or we were unhappy with 
the number of shots we got,'' said the 31-year-old Elliott. ``But 
we're beyond that now. Guys here aren't trying to star in 
commercials. We're trying to win. We don't have a lot of time left 
on these legs, so we're trying to get it done now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire, 25, was Rookie of the Year with the Raptors in 1996  
before being traded to the Blazers last year. He signed a 
seven-year, $81 million contract to stay in his hometown, but said 
Wednesday he's often thought that was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	One way or another, he said, things will be different next  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely don't want to leave,'' he said Thursday. ``I like  
the situation here. We'll have to see what happens when that time 
comes.''

<HEADLINE> Affirmed Still Going Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- His back is level and remarkably strong,  
and his chestnut coat shows only the lightest smattering of white 
hair around the muzzle and eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 24, Affirmed, thoroughbred racing's last Triple Crown  
winner, looks as though he could join Charismatic and 12 other 
horses in Saturday's Belmont Stakes -- and maybe even win. 
</P>
<P>
	Brought from his stall to meet a tour group visiting Jonabell  
Farm on Wednesday, Affirmed strutted and posed as though he, not 
Charismatic, would be going for the Triple Crown this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked in circles on the lawn in front of the Jonabell  
stallion barn, the 1978 Triple Crown champion's muscles were 
sharply defined, and the ribs of his barrel chest were outlined by 
his taut, shining coat. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing a little spirit, Affirmed tossed his white-blazed head  
against the lead held by Jonabell stallion manager Phillip Hampton. 
His steps, however, were sure and steady, belying any notion of 
skittishness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you didn't know he was a Triple Crown winner, you  
would enjoy being around him on an every-day basis just because of 
his personality,'' Hampton said. ``He's a real gentlemen. He's just 
an exceptional individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a camera shutter clicked, Affirmed's gaze had the calm  
certainty of one accustomed to being the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does have that command presence, and he always knows when  
there's a camera around,'' Jonabell manager Jimmy Bell said. ``From 
a physical standpoint, he defies age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was 21 years ago that Affirmed made thoroughbred racing  
history by winning the Belmont in a riveting stretch duel with his 
equally famous rival, Alydar. 
</P>
<P>
	That victory produced the sport's last Triple Crown winner.  
Since then, six colts have won the first two races -- the Kentucky 
Derby and the Preakness -- only to lose in the Belmont, including 
Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, it's Charismatic's turn, and Affirmed's former  
jockey said he will be rooting for the D. Wayne Lukas-trained colt 
to end the Triple Crown drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``Affirmed will always have his place in history, and so will  
I,'' said Steve Cauthen, who was 18 then and a Kentucky horse 
breeder now. ``Nothing will change if Charismatic wins the Triple 
Crown, except it'll be good for racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's missing this time, though, is the fierce rivalry that  
binds Affirmed to Alydar to this very day. 
</P>
<P>
	Alydar finished second in all three races, coming closer to  
victory each time. Affirmed won by 1 1/2 lengths in the Derby, a neck 
in the Preakness and a mere head in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	The most famous duel, of course, was the last, when Affirmed and  
Alydar battled side-by-side down the final seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pulled it out under the most extreme situation,'' Cauthen  
said. ``Anyone that saw that race will never forget it, and 
probably remember it as the greatest race they ever saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed was retired to stud after the 1979 season, having won  
14 stakes races and more than $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed has not had as successful a stud career as Alydar, who  
was euthanized in 1990 after breaking a leg in his stall, or fellow 
Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, now 25 and still standing at 
Three Chimneys. But his progeny have been strong turf runners and 
his daughters have made good broodmares. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the nearly 660 Affirmed foals who had reached racing age as  
of last fall, 68 had won stakes races. As a group, his foals had 
earned more than $33.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, when he's not in the breeding shed or posing for visitors,  
Affirmed splits time between the paddock and his stall in the 
Jonabell stallion barn, diagonally across from that of 1994 Horse 
of the Year Holy Bull. There, Hampton frequently finds the stallion 
gazing out his window, which overlooks a pasture and a line of 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a very content horse,'' Bell said. ``I think he  
enjoys his lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton said Affirmed's breeding book recently has been trimmed  
to about 45 mares a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to sustain him here in the latter years,''  
he said. ``By him still seeing mares and doing a good job of it, 
he's turned back the hands of time a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cauthen bred one of his mares to his former mount in 1998, and  
now is raising a 3-month-old Affirmed filly. When the former jockey 
came to visit Affirmed earlier this week, he showed off a snapshot 
of the foal to Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad to breed to him and I'm glad I got a filly'' who  
might be both a runner and a broodmare, Cauthen said. ``Maybe he'll 
do me one more favor.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Cos. Eye California Drilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Oil companies eager to drill their 40  
offshore leases along California's coast have turned in exploration 
and development plans, a critical step that could mean new oil 
drilling there within a few years, federal officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The leases are the only sites along the entire U.S. West Coast  
where new offshore oil development can take place for at least 12 
years and would be the first new offshore drilling facilities since 
1989, said John Romero, spokesman for the Minerals Management 
Service's Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's National Oceans Conference in Monterey, President  
Clinton extended until 2012 a moratorium on new offshore leasing, 
``to protect our oceans and coasts from the environmental risks of 
offshore oil and gas drilling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's ban only covers new leases. The 40 leases now  
subject to planning were sold between 1968 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies collectively paid $1.25 billion for the 40 leases  
along the coast of San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura 
counties. In 1990, the federal government stopped development on 
the sites after local communities demanded a study on the impact of 
offshore drilling on their lands and economies. 
</P>
<P>
	That suspension expires on June 30, when the California Offshore  
Oil and Gas Energy Resources study is completed. Minerals 
Management will review the submitted plans and announce whether 
they have been approved by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	One company, Whiting Petroleum, says it's ready to drill.  
Whiting plans to pull oil from wells near its existing platform 
near Point Arguello and anticipates production by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Four companies proposed revisions of their exploration plans in  
order to drill up to six wells from mobile drilling structures. 
Another company asked to submit plans for a site that has not been 
explored. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leases are getting back on track to hopefully be a normal  
course of business'' said Frank Holmes, coastal coordinator for the 
Western States Petroleum Association, which represents prospective 
operators at all the undeveloped sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``With success, these will generate a lot of revenue,'' Holmes  
said, adding it will take about eight to 10 years to get new 
platforms into production. 
</P>
<P>
	County officials and environmental groups oppose any new  
development on the leases, and have called on state and federal 
government officials to scrutinize the proposals or cancel the 
leases altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still dealing with two of the largest oil spills in the  
nation,'' says John Euphrat, senior planner for San Luis Obispo 
County. ``It's not a question of if, but when the next one will 
happen. The technology today isn't adequate to contain spilled 
oil.''

<HEADLINE> Chaotic 'Beer Night' Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Billy Martin began the night blowing kisses to  
Indians fans. A few hours later, armed with a bat, he was running 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago Friday, thousands of Cleveland fans, many  
of them drunk on 10-cent beer, turned a seemingly harmless 
promotion into a night of violence that left players, spectators 
and umpires bloodied. 
</P>
<P>
	Memories of ``10-cent Beer Night'' at Cleveland Stadium still  
shake Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of punches thrown,'' said the Toronto  
manager, who was playing first base for Martin's Texas Rangers that 
night. ``A lot of people got hurt. Players got hit with chairs over 
their heads. It was nasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans fought with fans; with police; with the Rangers and the  
Indians, many of whom ran onto the field to protect their Texas 
counterparts. Umpire Nestor Chylak and Indians reliever Tom 
Hilgendorf were both struck in the head with chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like we were in a battle zone,'' said umpire Joe  
Brinkman. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 25,134 showed up that warm Tuesday night enticed by  
the chance to drink as many beers as they could handle for 10 cents 
apiece. And by the end of the night, it was estimated that over 
60,000 cups were quaffed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble had been brewing between the teams after Rangers second  
baseman Lenny Randle intentionally ran over Cleveland pitcher Milt 
Wilcox a week earlier. Rangers fans doused the Indians with beer 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Texas arrived in Cleveland, Indians fans were ready and  
the cheap beer was additional fuel. When Martin delivered his 
lineup card before the game, he was booed. Never one to back down, 
he responded by tipping his cap and blowing kisses. 
</P>
<P>
	Current Indians manager Mike Hargrove, a rookie with the Rangers  
in 1974, said nothing prepared him for the violence he would later 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember a father and son going out to center field and  
mooning everybody,'' said Hargrove. ``Streakers were running across 
the field and I remember one woman coming out and running over to 
kiss an umpire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the sixth inning with the Rangers leading 5-1, the crowd had  
gotten rowdier and bolder. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups of fans began running onto the field. Initially, they  
dashed out between innings, then between outs and finally between 
pitches. Some stopped to shake hands with players before being 
escorted off the field by a badly outnumbered security force. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Indians rallied to within 5-3 in the sixth, fireworks and  
other projectiles were being launched toward the Texas dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember getting spit on a lot and having a lot of hot dogs  
thrown at me,'' said Hargrove, who has a photograph of the infamous 
night hanging in his Jacobs Field office. ``Somebody threw a gallon 
jug of Thunderbird wine at me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing things were getting worse in the seventh, the Rangers  
pitchers vacated their bullpen and headed to the relative safety of 
the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the ninth, and mayhem.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland scored two runs to tie it 5-5. More fans poured onto  
the field in celebration and one threw a punch at Texas right 
fielder Jeff Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	He punched back, and in an instant, he was surrounded by a dozen  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when Billy grabbed a bat,'' said photographer Ron  
Kuntz. ``I'll always remember this, he grabbed a bat and said, 
'Let's get 'em boys.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Rangers started going after that guy and before you knew  
it, there were thousands of fans all over the field. I was scared. 
The only thing I can compare it to was when I was covering riots in 
Venezuela and there were guys with Uzis running around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once he knew all the players had escaped the field, Chylak gave  
the Rangers the 9-0 forfeit, one of only four forfeits in the last 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While wiping away blood, Chylak told the Lorain Journal, ``We  
went as far as we could go, but you can't pull back uncontrollable 
beasts. The last time I saw animals like that was in the zoo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grieve, now a broadcaster for the Rangers, said when he heard  
the game had been forfeited, he was relieved for his safety and 
that the two homers he hit were safely in the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid they wouldn't count. Fortunately, they did. I  
didn't hit many so I needed those two,'' said Grieve, who hit 65 in 
a nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Hargrove, Brinkman still has a picture.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember holding on to a guy who had been kicked in the  
head. I'm holding him and blood is running down his face,'' 
Brinkman said. ``I think there were about 10,000 people on the 
field at one time. It was scary.''

<HEADLINE> Sorvino Back in 'Championship' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Paul Sorvino and his co-stars in ``That  
Championship Season'' are tossing dialogue to each other with the 
deftness of a winning team. Then, abruptly, a line is dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cut, cut, cut. I was wondering who was up,'' says Sorvino.  
``It's me. I know it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actor can be forgiven for the flub and for calling the time  
out: Sorvino was directing Showtime's remake of the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning drama as well as playing the pivotal role of the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent D'Onofrio, Terry Kinney, Tony Shalhoub and Gary Sinise  
also featur in the TV movie, filmed last January in a studio north 
of Los Angeles. It debuts 8 p.m. EDT Sunday on the cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``That Championship Season'' is an exercise in nostalgia and  
reinvention for Sorvino, who appeared in the Jason Miller play on 
Broadway that won a Tony Award in 1973, and in the 1982 movie 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	In both, Sorvino was Phil Romano (now D'Onofrio's role), one of  
four middle-aged men who have gathered with their high school 
basketball coach to relive the triumph of winning the state 
championship two decades before. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides trying on a different character, Sorvino is attempting  
to give the play a different treatment. He believes the first 
movie, starring Bruce Dern, Stacy Keach, Robert Mitchum and Martin 
Sheen, missed the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics agreed, with one dubbing the film ``unimaginative.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We never rehearsed before the production began and there were  
some casting problems, there were some things that didn't go 
right,'' Sorvino said. ``It was Jason's first directing job, and he 
was pushed into it. He was a playwright then. ... It just never 
came off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorvino strongly believes the drama, adapted by Miller for the  
new production, deserves to be revisited. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes this play for me the finest play of the century and  
the American repertoire is that it's not only a supreme, towering 
drama -- to quote most of the original reviewers -- but it's an 
extraordinarily funny comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a black comedy; it's just very funny. It's a slice of  
life about men who are lost -- fatherless men who seek to create a 
family with one another, with all the antagonisms and frustrations 
of their lives and old sins and new conspiring to tear them 
apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got just the cast he wanted, ``extraordinarily high caliber  
actors,'' Sorvino said. The appearance of a smoothly functioning 
team is not deceiving, said Shalhoub (``Big Night,'' TV's 
``Wings''), who plays George Sitkowski, athlete-turned-politician. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a true ensemble piece. The biggest trap in doing this  
play would be to find yourself in a situation where everybody's out 
for their own advancement or taking care of themselves as opposed 
to feeding the other actors,'' Shalhoub said. 
</P>
<P>
	He lauds Sorvino's contributions: ``He did the play. He was  
there while it was being created. ... He has a feel for the 
intricacies of the material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While respecting the play's integrity, Sorvino says he has added  
small touches and opened it up to take advantage of the move from 
stage to screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the men going into a store to buy liquor instead of  
just hearing about it,'' Sorvino said. ``I put an old man playing 
violin outside, as homage to Fellini and company. Little touches 
like that can bring it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote a bit of business for that scene to illuminate Tom  
Daley, the character played by Sinise. When another one of his 
former teammates passes by the old musician, Tom empties his 
pockets for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can set the character up in a visual way, which you can't  
do on stage,'' Sorvino said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as his co-stars are bringing new dimensions to their roles,  
Sorvino said, he is reinterpreting the coach, played by Richard A. 
Dysart (``L.A. Law'') on stage and by Mitchum in the '82 film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a more emotional actor than the other fellows, and I allow  
myself to have my emotional tectonic plates shifted more. I've 
never seen the role played the way I'm playing it, and I hope 
that's a good thing. But I don't know if it is,'' he said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping I hit it right and, if I do, it should vitalize the  
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinise believes the play carries its own timeless energy.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at what informs the characters' being and what has  
gotten them to this point, to where the best moment in their lives 
was a moment in high school, a lot of people can relate to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people have their greatest moment in their life happen in  
their first two decades, and they never get that rush, that shining 
moment again.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreman Seeks Bout Against Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The heavyweight fight picture is full of boxers  
wanting to fight each other. 
</P>
<P>
	George Foreman wants to fight Mike Tyson. And Evander Holyfield  
and Lennox Lewis both want a rematch of their controversial first 
fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But it remains to be seen whether a Foreman-Tyson fight is  
merely wistful thinking on the part of the aging former champions 
and those who see it as a rich spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's proposed November fight with Lewis is also looking  
shaky as the various parties try to work out a deal, despite 
promoter Don King's announcement last week that the fight would be 
held in November at a Las Vegas casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no deal,'' HBO vice president Lou DiBella said.  
``There are some problematic issues that need to be worked out. 
We're hopeful we can work them out, but they haven't been resolved 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Lewis and his promoter sent a letter to Park Place  
Entertainment on Wednesday telling the casino operator to stop 
giving the public ``a false impression that the fight is made, 
which is consistent with the current state of facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lewis and Holyfield have both agreed to $15 million  
paydays for the proposed November fight, and Park Place has signed 
a deal with King to hold it at one of its Las Vegas casinos, no 
contracts for the fight have actually been signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly concerned,'' Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas,  
said. ``Evander wants this fight to happen very badly and so, we 
think, does Lennox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main issue to be resolved is HBO's insistence that King step  
aside as the fight promoter if he were to be indicted on charges 
stemming from a number of ongoing investigations into boxing, 
sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, told The Associated Press. King, so far, has refused 
such a clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've settled basically on the money,'' Lewis attorney Milton  
Chwasky said. ``There's only one hindrance to this. It's Don's 
thing with HBO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Foreman adviser said he was trying to put together  
a Foreman-Tyson fight for December that would match the two former 
heavyweight champions in a bout that would pay Tyson $25 million 
and Foreman $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime Foreman adviser Ron Weathers and light heavyweight  
champion Roy Jones Jr. were trying to put together a deal for 
Foreman and Tyson to meet in a pay-per-view spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Showtime network, which shows Tyson's fights,  
said they were interested, and Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel did not 
discount the possibility of a matchup between the two former 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good story more than reality right now,'' Finkel said.  
``I've told them to have Foreman call me personally so we would 
know if he really wants to fight. So far he hasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, released last month from a Maryland jail, has been  
running and doing conditioning exercises since then, while Finkel 
and others try to put together a deal for his first return fight. 
</P>
<P>
	That would most likely be in September on Showtime, but not on  
pay-per-view, against the likes of Denmark's Brian Nielsen or 
Germany's Axel Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well in that fight, Tyson would fight in a  
pay-per-view bout in December. And his opponent could possibly be 
Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
	``From both of their standpoints, where else would they get this  
kind of money,'' said Fred Levin, who is Jones' lawyer and would 
co-promote the bout with the light heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has got problems now and it would be George's swan song.  
People wouldn't buy Larry Holmes and George Foreman, but they will 
buy Mike Tyson and George Foreman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman would be 51 at the time of the fight, which would  
fulfill a goal he had when he came out of retirement 13 years ago 
to fight Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been his one goal in life to fight Mike Tyson,''  
Weathers said. ``It would be a great show with two guys who are 
huge punchers. Mike Tyson didn't want this fight for a long time, 
but I'm told he does now.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Times Appoints New Publisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Times Mirror Co. chairman, president and CEO  
Mark H. Willes has relinquished the job of Los Angeles Times 
publisher and promoted Times executive Kathryn M. Downing to the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Downing, 46, retains her current titles of president and chief  
executive officer of the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Willes, 57, who added the publisher's job to his  
responsibilities in 1997, announced Thursday he is giving up the 
post just as plans to improve circulation and financial performance 
were bearing fruit. He said the Times is on track to boost 
circulation and to increase operating profits, which have declined 
for five consecutive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to be publisher when all of these good things  
that I think are going to happen happen and are obvious to 
everybody,'' Willes said. ``But this isn't about personal agendas 
and personal satisfaction. Good leaders know when to get in and 
also they know when to get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willes, a former General Mills executive, raised eyebrows in the  
industry in 1997 by vowing to boost the paper's circulation by 
500,000, then later upped the ante to a 1 million increase. 
Circulation currently is 1,095,007 daily and 1,383,373 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Downing reiterated  
that one of her goals as publisher would be to boost circulation by 
1 million over an unspecified period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Willes generated controversy when he implemented a policy of  
having advertising executives work more closely with editors to 
support special projects and sections. Critics accused him of 
lowering the wall between editorial and advertising departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Willes told reporters Thursday that the policy had not  
compromised journalistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very pleased and it's going to make us a better paper and  
it's going to make us a substantially better business,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Willes, Downing had no newspaper experience before coming  
to Times Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	She joined Times Mirror in 1995 as president and chief executive  
officer of Mosby Matthew Bender, a legal and medical publishing 
unit that Times Mirror sold last year. She was named president and 
chief executive officer of the Times in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Times Mirror, Downing was president and chief  
executive officer of Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, a division of 
Thomson Legal Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Downing said she wanted the Times to make a difference in the  
lives of its readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely fallen in love with this paper and wonder  
how it took me this long in my career to find the magic of 
newspapers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Willes' exit was not surprising given his responsibilities  
running Times Mirror, said newspaper analyst John Morton of Morton 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man who's the chairman and CEO of the parent company  
shouldn't be spending a lot of his time being publisher of the 
newspaper,'' Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror publishes The (Baltimore) Sun, Newsday on New  
York's Long Island, The Hartford (Conn.) Courant and other papers 
in addition to the Times.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Out for Rest of Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing has a partially torn Achilles'  
tendon and will miss the rest of the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a shocking development on the day after Game 2 of the Eastern  
Conference finals, the New York Knicks learned Wednesday that their 
franchise player is finished for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're kidding,'' Ewing told Dr. Norman Scott, the Knicks team  
physician who ordered an MRI performed after Ewing felt a ``ripping 
sensation'' in the tendon in his left leg before Game 2 on Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't believe me,'' the doctor said. ``He was really  
depressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not yet known exactly how the Knicks will compensate for  
the loss of their leading rebounder. Coach Jeff Van Gundy could 
choose to move Chris Dudley into the starting lineup, or he could 
move Kurt Thomas to center and Larry Johnson to power forward while 
adding Latrell Sprewell to the starting five. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy refused to discuss his plans during a conference call,  
choosing instead to praise Ewing for his performance in a difficult 
season that has lasted longer than anyone would have imagined six 
weeks ago when the team was in danger of missing the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, to me, it's not about what we do in the future,'' he  
said. ``I just wish there was a way to honor a guy who did so much 
for us this year, who really was the consummate team guy in doing 
what he could to help us win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been cheated out of another opportunity.''  
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-7 series against the Pacers resumes Saturday at  
Madison Square Garden tied at one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old center, who played through injuries all year,  
limped to 10 points and three rebounds in 25 minutes in the Pacers' 
88-86 Game 2 victory that evened the series. He had a chance to tie 
the game at the buzzer with a 15-foot jumper that missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, criticized throughout his career for not bringing a title  
to New York, has been to the NBA Finals just once, when the Knicks 
lost to Houston in 1994. If his team returns this season, he'll 
have to watch from the sidelines in a suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating to work so hard and be so close to something  
I've dreamed about for so many years,'' Ewing said. ``To not be 
able to be on the floor to help my teammates is very frustrating 
and disappointing. But if my Achilles' ruptures completely, it 
would end my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, who will be in a cast for six weeks, does not need  
surgery, and a full recovery is expected, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said it was rare that Achilles' tendinitis, which caused  
Ewing to miss 12 games during the regular season, would develop 
into a tear. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-time All-Star also has struggled with sore knees that  
need to be packed in ice after every game. He was out for most of 
last season with a broken wrist, but came back in the second round 
of the playoffs, when New York lost to the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick has been on this journey,'' Van Gundy said. ``The  
reason he plays today is to win a championship. It is the reason he 
fought through a lot of pain to try and help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Pacers sounded as if they would miss him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I could see he was hurting,'' said Mark Jackson, once Ewing's  
teammate. ``I'm proud of him. He's a warrior. A lot of guys 
wouldn't have even suited up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Reggie Miller: ``It's a shame because Patrick is such a  
great competitor and has been a huge part of this great rivalry and 
the great games the two teams have played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing, in the second year of a four-year, $68 million contract,  
averaged 17.3 points and 9.9 rebounds in the regular season. During 
the playoffs he averaged 13.1 points and 8.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after Ewing walked off the floor after his miss in Game  
2, Miller teased him in the news conference. Miller, who hit two 
foul shots to win the game, was asked about his shooting just as 
Ewing entered the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you make the last one, that's all that matters,''  
Miller said. ``Right, Pat?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither of them realized at the time that Ewing would not take  
another shot for the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Estimates 200M New Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A world that had been making progress finds  
itself with 200 million more people in abject poverty than a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A new World Bank report blames the Asian financial crisis for  
increasing poverty across Asia and much of the rest of the world. 
It calls for bailout programs and preventative measures to provide 
urgent relief for suffering people, not just suffering economies. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first detailed look at the impact of the Asian financial  
crisis on global poverty, the bank estimates 200 million ``newly 
poor,'' with setbacks in the modestly successful march against 
poverty in Africa, South Asia, East Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countries that until recently believed they were turning the  
tide in the fight against poverty are witnessing its 
re-emergence,'' said World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn. ``We 
must now draw on the lessons of recent experience to help us 
reshape our strategies for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank will stress programs that provide social protections,  
referred to by economists as ``safety nets,'' it said in its annual 
update on global poverty. Planned measures include programs to 
provide unemployment insurance, subsidized school fees, job 
creation and food subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is responding to data showing poverty rising again in  
India, continuing to go up in Africa and sharply worsening across 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Among the hardest hit are the poor 
of Indonesia, whose numbers have increased by 30 million since the 
crisis began in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, the number of people below the abject poverty level  
of $1 a day income is estimated at 1.5 billion -- up 200 million 
from 1993. Final figures for 1999 will not be available for several 
years, but the estimate is based on trends since 1.2 billion poor 
were counted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gloomy outlook for global poverty, the bank reported  
widespread progress in health and education. An exception to the 
increase in poverty is China, where the number of poor is believed 
to have declined from 280 million in 1990 to 125 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, in a report last week based on a survey of Asian  
companies, concluded that Asian economies are recovering more 
quickly than expected from the crises, which started in Thailand in 
1997 with plunging currency rates and spread through Asia and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	The new report points to a lasting impact on some of the world's  
poorest, diminishing hope of cutting worldwide poverty in half by 
2020 -- a goal many experts had thought could be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's underlying purpose always has been to cut poverty,  
but it has been criticized in recent years for lending programs 
that stress long-term development over dealing more directly with 
the suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``The East Asia crisis and its spillover into other emerging  
markets offers the world an opportunity to devise a new approach to 
crisis, one that rightly puts concern for the poor and the 
vulnerable right at the center of its response,'' said World Bank 
economist Giovanna Prennushi, who wrote the global report.

<HEADLINE>  ANC Sweeps in S. Africa Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- As a farewell present to  
Nelson Mandela, voters gave his African National Congress a 
decisive victory in South Africa's first election since the 
apartheid-ending vote of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, who will turn over the presidency to hand-picked  
successor Thabo Mbeki on June 16, saw his two election day wishes 
come true -- peaceful voting and an ANC victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The voting, which stretched from Wednesday into early today  
because of long lines at many polling stations, proceeded 
harmoniously across a nation still scarred by apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	The South African Broadcasting Corp. projected the ANC would win  
at least a two-thirds majority, which would give the party 
unilateral power in Parliament to make constitutional changes. Five 
years ago, the ANC won 62 percent of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	With 59 percent of the polling stations reporting today, the ANC  
had 63 percent. The New National Party, which ruled for 46 years of 
the apartheid era, was in danger of losing its status as the 
largest opposition party with only 9 percent of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Running second behind the ANC with 11 percent was the Democratic  
Party, founded as an anti-apartheid movement in the 1980s but 
increasingly popular among many whites now because of its shift to 
an anti-crime, anti-ANC stance. 
</P>
<P>
	In fourth place, with 8 percent, was the Zulu-nationalist  
Inkatha Freedom Party. An array of smaller parties trailed well 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Complete results were not expected until late today at the  
earliest. Officials estimated that 85 percent of the 18.2 million 
registered voters cast ballots, just under the 87 percent turnout 
in the historic 1994 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the biggest winner was South African democracy  
itself. Voters turned out in huge numbers, waiting in line 
sometimes for six or seven hours, yet only minor disturbances were 
reported, even in areas that five years ago were wracked by 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kind of peace and stability that we've managed to get  
right through the day has been monumental,'' said Smuts Ngonyama, 
an ANC official. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities extended the voting into the wee hours of this  
morning because of long lines at numerous polling stations at 9 
p.m. Wednesday, when voting was supposed to have ended. 
</P>
<P>
	In some areas, voters tried to force their way into the stations  
at 9 p.m., calming down only when informed that all those in line 
would be allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Joubert Park polling station in downtown Johannesburg,  
Herman Khumalo, holding his 5-year-old daughter in his arms, had no 
complaints about his three-hour wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important for me to vote,'' he said. ``I would like  
to make a farewell to my president, Nelson Mandela, because I think 
he has been ruling this country so nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, who spent 27 years as a prisoner of the white-minority  
regime during the apartheid era, has devoted his five-year 
presidency to promoting racial reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mbeki, who as deputy president has been running day-to-day  
government affairs for the past two years, is respected for his 
skills, but does not enjoy the same level of affection as Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
	After his expected election as president by the Parliament and  
inauguration ceremonies on June 16, Mbeki will immediately face 
pressure to improve living standards for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mbeki, 56, inherits a diverse, complicated nation that remains  
divided between wealthy whites and poor blacks, with Indian and 
mixed-race minorities groping to find their niche. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is beset by rampant crime and a crumbling education  
system, with black unemployment at 42 percent and a spreading AIDS 
epidemic that has infected at least 3.6 million people with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the ANC remains the overwhelming top choice among the  
black majority, the party lost some supporters from 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very angry,'' said Martha Mghbi, voting in Johannesburg.  
``They didn't fulfill anything. People are without jobs. The crime 
is too high ... I'm going to try another party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For all the problems, South Africa has made huge strides since  
the collapse of apartheid. Many more blacks, who make up 77 percent 
of the population of 42 million, have entered the middle class, and 
most whites now aspire to racial tolerance.

<HEADLINE> Guthridge Wants To Keep Coaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Bill Guthridge wants to fulfill his  
five-year contract as North Carolina's basketball coach -- and then 
some. 
</P>
<P>
	The 61-year-old Guthridge, 58-14 in two seasons since replacing  
legendary coach Dean Smith, has more wins in his first two years 
than any coach in NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthridge, a 30-year assistant under Smith, said he wasn't too  
upset in March when an unauthorized book written about Smith said a 
deal had already been struck for Kansas coach Roy Williams to 
replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't bother me much because I know what's going on,''  
Guthridge said on Thursday. ``I signed a five-year contract and I'm 
sure that I could get an extension if I wanted it. I plan to coach 
a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How long?  
</P>
<P>
	``When I took the job I made a long-term commitment and I still  
have that long-term commitment,'' he said. ``Eventually, I will 
have to stop coaching, but I can see myself coaching seven or eight 
more years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some North Carolina fans were upset with the team -- and  
Guthridge -- following a first-round exit from the NCAA tournament. 
The 76-74 loss to Weber State was the earliest exit from the 
postseason since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there is interest there are opinions and there will be  
those who think I'm not doing a good job, and there are those who 
think I'm doing a good job,'' Guthridge said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Commutes Death Sentences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Seeking votes from a crime-weary populace, Boris  
Yeltsin cranked up Russia's execution rate in 1996. On Thursday, he 
commuted every last death sentence in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's decree spares all 716 of the country's death-row  
inmates, completing a turnaround that has earned him accolades from 
international human rights groups -- and the ire of Russians gripped 
by fears of violence, which has soared since the 1991 Soviet 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, which Yeltsin had been planning for some time,  
steps up pressure on the reluctant parliament to pass a bill that 
would join Russia to the few dozen nations that have formally 
abolished the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a historic day in Russian democracy,'' said Justice  
Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov, who announced the decree at a Moscow 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has a centuries-old tradition of executions, and they  
were a key tool of terror in the Soviet police state. 
</P>
<P>
	Anatoly Pristavkin, head of the presidential pardon commission,  
said that as many as 20,000 people a year were executed under 
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Millions of others perished in the 
country's vast network of prison camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Perestroika and the collapse of the Soviet Union freed political  
prisoners, but it also spurred a rise in violent and organized 
crime. Russia's murder rate has climbed to among the world's 
highest. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Yeltsin increased the pace of executions in 1995-6,  
when 132 prisoners a year were executed with a shot to the back of 
the head, Pristavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once safely re-elected, Yeltsin promised to scrap the death  
penalty after Russia joined the Council of Europe, the continent's 
leading human rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been executed since 1996, though Russian courts  
handed down death sentences until February and capital punishment 
remains on the books. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin issued Thursday's decree after the presidential pardon  
commission had reviewed the cases of all 716 convicts on death row 
and recommended that they be given either life sentences or 25-year 
prison terms. Many of the death-row inmates had not been convicted 
by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups want the lower house of parliament, the  
State Duma, to pass a bill formally outlawing capital punishment. 
But Communists and other hard-line lawmakers fiercely oppose 
banning capital punishment, and polls show a majority of Russians 
feel the death penalty is needed to control serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pristavkin insisted that capital punishment was not deterring  
Russia's most violent criminals, and said many death-row inmates 
were alcoholics and drifters -- not the organized crime bosses and 
hit men that Russians widely fear. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he added, prison conditions in Russia are so atrocious  
that many inmates are ``practically begging for a death sentence'' 
to escape severe overcrowding and disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Waiting for death is even worse punishment than execution,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> California To Sell Individuals' Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California has joined a growing number of  
states with laws authorizing the sale of confidential information 
about their residents' income to banks, lenders and car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs are designed to speed up processing of loan  
applications and reduce fraud by allowing lenders to quickly verify 
information provided by people seeking credit. The states are not 
supposed to release the data unless the consumer gives written 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	But privacy advocates caution that the electronic disclosures  
could allow private information to fall into the wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you establish electronic access to a large-scale database  
there are going to be illegitimate uses of the information,'' said 
Beth Givens, director of the San Diego-based Privacy Rights 
Clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a law passed quietly last year, lawmakers authorized the  
state to give financial companies access to private income data the 
state collects on nearly 14 million employed people. The 
information is normally used to calculate worker compensation and 
unemployment insurance payments employers make to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and other lenders hope to see similar systems in every  
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Programs already are operating in Iowa, Minnesota, North  
Carolina and Texas and one is being implemented in Pennsylvania. 
Legislatures in Florida, Indiana and Oregon authorized such systems 
in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that our lawmakers are acting in a policy vacuum,''  
said Givens. ``They don't appear to be looking at the long-term 
implications and the unintended consequences of allowing private 
companies to be vendors of this personal data,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bernick, director of the California Employment  
Development Department, which collects income data, on Thursday 
declined to comment except to say plans to implement the new law 
were under study. The department is required under the new law to 
complete the evaluation by July 1, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how much revenue the state could make from  
selling the data. 
</P>
<P>
	If California follows the lead of other states, the data will be  
released through Verification of Income and Employment, a joint 
venture of Norwest Mortgage and First American Financial Corp., a 
company that provides mortgage-related services like title searches 
to lenders. Verification, which is negotiating to run the 
California program, headed the lobbying campaign for the new law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other states, Verification take requests from lenders and  
relay them electronically to the state, which will retains control 
of the database, said Verification President William Skowronnek. 
</P>
<P>
	The state sends requested information to Verification, which  
releases it to the lender, said William Skowronnek, president of 
Verification. The company, under contract to operate nearly 
identical systems in Iowa, Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas, 
never has the state database in its possession. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of our greatest safeguards, the fact that we don't  
store the information,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lenders who use the program get a report containing the  
consumer's name, name of the employer and quarterly income. 
Verification can release two to four years worth of data, depending 
on local laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Before requesting information, the lender must get the written  
consent of the consumer. However, neither the state nor 
Verification try to confirm that consent has been granted. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Verification auditors make random checks of the records  
of lenders, looking for those written consent documents. The 
accounting firm Peat Marwick audits Verfication to confirm that 
checks are being made, Skowronnek said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program has worked well in Iowa, which began selling income  
data in 1995, said Joe Bervid, attorney for the state's 
unemployment insurance division. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a win-win situation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Employers no longer have to respond to income verification  
letters from lenders and lenders don't have to wait for a response. 
The time needed to verify employment and income information has 
dropped from about two weeks to an hour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Income verification, along with credit reports, have benefitted  
both consumers and lenders. Widespread use of such information by 
lenders began in the early 20th century, and enabled millions of 
middle- and low-income people to borrow money to buy cars, homes 
and other big-ticket items, said Solveig Singleton at the Cato 
Institute, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern about the California plan is whether consumers are  
voluntarily providing information in the loan process. They have no 
choice in what the government collects. Also, by getting into the 
information business, state governments provide one more potential 
means for information to be accessed illegally, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm skeptical this is a good idea. Ordinarily the traffic in  
information can be an extremely good thing. Having information that 
is not a part of the public record being sold by the government 
makes me uncomfortable,'' said Singleton.

<HEADLINE> Charity Fires Staff Amid Theft Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Feed the Children fired all 14 employees  
at its Nashville distribution center amid an investigation into 
whether they stole boxloads of goods that had been donated to the 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Founder and president Larry Jones said Thursday the center will  
stay closed while the relief agency takes an inventory of how much 
is missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 201 aid agencies in 15 Eastern states are left  
without food from the charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``For it to just sit here while agencies are really begging for  
it, that's really a sin,'' Jones said. ``I'm saddened for Feed the 
Children. I'm also saddened for the children who are hurt right 
now. But you have to remember that every company in America has 
this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones closed the 274,000-square-foot warehouse on Tuesday and  
fired the employees after state investigators found boxloads of 
donations in the homes of several upper-level employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings followed a four-month investigation by Nashville TV  
station WTVF, which secretly videotaped administrative staffers 
carting boxes of clothes, food, toiletries and more to their cars 
and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Torry Johnson said the Tennessee Bureau of  
Investigation will deliver the findings of its investigation to him 
this week. He will then decide whether to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Feed the Children spokeswoman Emilee Truelove said the  
organization was not sure all of the employees were stealing, but 
all were fired ``to restore the trust in our donors. We wanted to 
let them know that we were doing all that we could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said some staffers could be rehired later.  
</P>
<P>
	Five staffers from the charity's Oklahoma City headquarters  
arrived in Nashville to begin taking inventory. Jones said he could 
not estimate how much was taken or when the warehouse might reopen. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he is considering installing surveillance cameras and  
is meeting with consultants for other ways to prevent employee 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he does not think stealing has been a problem at Feed  
the Children's other warehouse in Oklahoma City, but ``we're going 
to look at all the operations, all the operations, because we don't 
want it to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said workers first reported stealing at the warehouse to  
him while Feed the Children was in the midst of Oklahoma tornado 
relief work, but the agency was unable to investigate before the TV 
news reports ran.

<HEADLINE> Tribes Sue for Tobacco Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Representatives of more than 20 American  
Indian tribes and groups said Thursday they were snubbed in the 
tobacco industry's $200 billion settlement with the states, and 
they're suing for what they claim is their fair share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again in Indian country we have been left clear out of  
the process,'' said Wilfred Louie, one of several tribal officials 
who appeared at a news conference at the American Indian Public 
Charter School in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The class action suit, filed Wednesday in San Francisco federal  
court, demands $1 billion in compensation and punitive damages from 
several tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit stems from an agreement reached last November in which  
the tobacco industry promised to pay $40 billion over 25 years to 
settle four state lawsuits and another $206 billion in a broader 
deal with the other 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, American Indians were counted for census  
data used to determine how the money would be distributed but were 
not allotted their own share of the money. The suit claims that is 
a violation of Indian sovereignty and amounts to racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the tobacco industry said officials had not seen  
the suit and could not comment on its allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, American Indians traditionally have used  
tobacco for ceremonial and medicinal purposes only. 
</P>
<P>
	But during World War II, American Indian soldiers were  
introduced to cigarettes and tobacco companies began targeting that 
population, the suit charges. Today, American Indians smoke at a 
rate of 39 percent, compared to 26 percent for blacks, 25 percent 
for whites, 18 percent for Hispanics and 15 percent for Asians, the 
suit says.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts End Space Station Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- The latest visitors to the new  
international space station turned out the lights and locked up 
today after outfitting the outpost with 2 tons of supplies for 
future guests. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling outpost ``was a tremendously pleasant working  
environment,'' astronaut Tamara Jernigan said as the crew sealed 
the hatch to the American-made Unity module. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's seven astronauts will bid a final farewell tonight  
when the space shuttle pulls away from the station in preparation 
for Sunday's return to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	It took more than three hours for the crew to close up all six  
hatches inside the two-room station. They started in the Russian 
Zarya control module, pulling out air ducts, switching off lights 
and closing the doors before proceeding into Unity and repeating 
the routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers on the ground helped by shutting off some equipment  
and power. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Robert Cabana, who commanded the first space station  
construction mission in December, watched nostalgically from 
Mission Control as the crew made its exit. Cabana and his crew 
spent only a day inside the station, while this crew had more than 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Payload manager Sharon Castle was ``ecstatic'' at how smoothly  
the moving job went. ``It was not only finished, but it all went so 
well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once back inside Discovery, commander Kent Rominger and pilot  
Rick Husband fired the shuttle's thrusters and boosted the station 
complex about 6 miles so it will be at the correct altitude for the 
arrival of the next component -- a Russian service module. 
</P>
<P>
	That piece, due to arrive in November, will serve as the living  
quarters for the station's first permanent occupants, who are 
scheduled to move in next March. The next temporary guests are 
expected in December when space shuttle Atlantis delivers more 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts left the outpost a little cozier and  
quieter for all those who will follow. 
</P>
<P>
	They stowed more than 100 items inside the station after  
floating aboard Sunday, including laptop computers, water, clothes, 
trash bags and spare parts. The bulk of the supplies was left in 
Zarya, stuffed behind panels and strapped to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spent a lot of this mission stowing supplies for them, so  
it should be pretty comfortable,'' said Ellen Ochoa, the astronaut 
in charge of the moving. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts also reduced the noise level in Zarya by placing  
mufflers over clattering fans, ducts and outlets. Before the 
repairs, the noise level was 65 to 69 decibels -- equivalent to that 
of a busy street corner. Afterward, it was about 3 decibels lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the crew's final chores were replacing an air filter in  
Zarya and photographing the station interior to help engineers on 
the ground solve any problems that might crop up before the next 
crew arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts also snapped shots of the station's exterior.

<HEADLINE> Hasek Has Everything But a Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hockey has thrown more than pucks at  
Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek. He's gotten adoration, millions 
of dollars, an Olympic gold medal, recognition as the league's MVP 
the past two years, even criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing eludes him: The Stanley Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has a place set aside in his heart for hockey's biggest  
prize. ``Right next to the gold medal,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres won the Eastern Conference championship and await the  
winner of Friday's Game 7 of the Western Conference final between 
the Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, almost recovered from the chronic groin injury that  
sidelined him for the first two games against Toronto in the 
conference final, is determined to scoop the only thing that's 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hungrier than ever,'' Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley  
said. ``Nothing would compare to winning this thing and it's nice 
to have him in there with that drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is the only goaltender in NHL history to twice be selected  
the league's MVP. He did so in each of the last two seasons and is 
a candidate for a third in a row. Last year he was voted top goalie 
for the fourth time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	His greatest achievement was leading the Czech Republic to its  
first gold medal in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He earned 
the right to be called the world's best goalie after beating 
Patrick Roy and Canada 2-1 in the semifinal and shutting out Russia 
1-0 for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he runs out of things to win, it seems Hasek never runs  
out of things to prove. The Stanley Cup might quiet critics who 
question his heart and pain threshhold, not to mention filling a 
void in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us feel that there's always a little hole if you  
don't get it,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``He's going to feel 
that way if we don't accomplish what we set out to accomplish. You 
can't say it doesn't bother you if you don't win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy is the winningest goaltender in playoff history. Hasek rode  
the bench behind the other goalie he could face in the Stanley Cup 
final, Dallas' Ed Belfour, when both played for Chicago. Hasek had 
spent two seasons in Chicago when the Blackhawks traded him to 
Buffalo in August 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Belfour is a great goaltender and Patrick has won three  
Stanley Cups,'' Hasek said. ``But it doesn't matter to me if we 
play Dallas or Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the Sabres' three playoff series have pitted Hasek  
against another good goalie. Ottawa's Ron Tugnutt led the league's 
starters with a 1.79 goals-against average. Hasek, second with a 
1.87 GAA, made 40 saves in a 2-1 victory in the opener of 
quarterfinal series against Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dom won that first game on his own and since then has just  
made the key save,'' Buffalo's Joe Juneau said. ``We don't need a 
guy who's going to steal a game every night. We just need key saves 
at the right time, and that's what Dom gives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Byron Dafoe ranks third among playoff goalies with a  
2.03 GAA but couldn't beat Hasek's Sabres in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dafoe was in the running for the Vezina (trophy as top goalie)  
and really issued a personal challenge,'' Ruff said. ``He thought 
he could outplay Dom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anticipated duel between Hasek and Toronto's Curtis Joseph  
in the conference final fizzled due to a groin injury that kept 
Hasek out for two games and Joseph's own shaky play. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek bristles at the suggestion that he was tanking it.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough to go to the coach and tell him that I could not  
play, but I'm glad I made the decision,'' he said. ``I could play 
hurt and maybe give up some bad goals and we could lose. I feel 
good about the decision I made.''

	Milosevic Accepts Western Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Caving in to Russian and Western  
demands, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted a peace 
plan for Kosovo on Thursday that is designed to end mass expulsions 
of ethnic Albanians and 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes. Even though 
the draft appeared to signal a victory for NATO, President Clinton 
and other U.S. officials reacted cautiously. In the meantime, 
NATO's bombing campaign continued, with airstrikes reported in 
Kosovo and elsewhere Thursday night. Though cloaked in language 
meant to make it palatable to the Belgrade government, the plan 
contained tough conditions Milosevic had until now resisted 
including the deployment of foreign troops on Yugoslav soil.

prayer. The pope has repeatedly pushed for appeals and diplomacy to 
end the conflict in Kosovo. John Paul, who was conferring with U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the Vatican when the news came out 
of Belgrade, urged the United Nations to oversee the quick return 
of refugees to Kosovo. Annan later pronounced himself encouraged by 
Yugoslavia's acceptance, but told reporters, ``It's premature to 
jump for joy.''

<HEADLINE> Aging Panda Has Kidney Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- His appetite has improved, along with his  
energy, but officials at the National Zoo say an aging Hsing-Hsing 
isn't likely to survive the latest illness plaguing the popular 
black-and-white giant panda. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently diagnosed with severe kidney dysfunction, the  
28-year-old mammal has responded well to various medication and 
fluids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's irreversible but stabilizable,'' zoo veterinarian Lucy  
Spelman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vets discovered the kidney problems May 15 after putting  
Hsing-Hsing (pronounced Shing-Shing) under anesthesia for an exam. 
Zookeepers had noted the animal seemed lethargic and had lost both 
weight and appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day-to-day situation with him and that's just how we  
have to take it,'' said Lisa Stevens, the zoo's mammal curator. 
</P>
<P>
	The illness will probably be his last, Stevens acknowledged, and  
zoo officials are doing all they can to make Hsing-Hsing 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidney problem is probably related to the animal's advanced  
age, Steven said. Zoo officials have ruled out extreme measures, 
including dialysis treatment. Dialysis would require daily 
anesthesia, a huge risk for such an elderly animal. Pandas rarely 
live to their 20s in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens reminded reporters that Hsing-Hsing was relatively  
healthy until two years ago when he was diagnosed with testicular 
cancer and underwent surgery. Veterinarians removed an enlarged, 
tumorous testicle. They also removed the other testicle as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Hsing-Hsing also suffers from arthritis.  
</P>
<P>
	For now, the giant panda exhibit, a major draw for the National  
Zoo, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution, remains open 
although it closes periodically to allow Hsing-Hsing to rest or 
receive treatment. A handwritten sign posted at the exhibit's 
entrance informs visitors that ``Hsing-Hsing is not feeling well 
... at times, we may need to close the panda house to care for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hsing-Hsing, along with his female mate, Ling-Ling, arrived in  
Washington in 1972 as a gift from the People's Republic of China 
following President Nixon's trip to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ling-Ling died of heart failure in 1992. None of the cubs that  
the pair produced survived more than a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Devra Kleiman, a senior research scientist at the zoo, said  
officials have discussed conservation and breeding programs with 
zoo officials in China for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have hopes of receiving another pair sometime in the  
future,'' she said. Kleiman said a team from the National Zoo is 
scheduled to go to China this month, and ``we hope to come back 
with an agreement.''

<HEADLINE> NL Denies Marlins' Replay Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a decision that won't be reviewed on  
videotape, the National League denied the Florida Marlins' protest 
of umpire Frank Pulli's use of a TV replay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly agree with the Marlins' position that instant  
replays should not be allowed in the game and I sympathize with 
their concern that Mr. Pulli, in an excess of caution, decided to 
use a video camera,'' NL president Len Coleman wrote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That being said, however, it does not follow that the protest  
should be sustained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman held that Pulli's incorrect decision to consult a replay  
and change Cliff Floyd's home run to a double was a judgment call -- 
and judgment calls can't be overturned with protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't really expecting to get a home run out of it,'' Floyd  
said in Miami after the decision was announced. ``I would have 
liked for us to get a win out of it. I'm glad it's resolved now, 
and we can play the game like it's supposed to be played, and 
hopefully nothing like that happens again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd claimed his fifth-inning drive in Florida's 5-2 loss to  
St. Louis on Monday was a home run because it bounced off the 
facade behind the left-field scoreboard in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Gibson, the second base umpire, thought the ball hit off  
the scoreboard and called it a double. Pulli, the crew chief, 
changed the call to a homer after Florida argued, and St. Louis 
then argued. Pulli studied replays on a TV camera near the Marlins 
dugout, then changed the call back to a double. 
</P>
<P>
	The following day, Coleman and AL president Gene Budig issued  
statements saying replays had no place in umpiring decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I have taken steps to ensure that umpires in the future  
do not use a video camera,'' Coleman said, ``I do not believe that 
I can or should overrule the judgment of Mr. Pulli to do so in this 
case, particularly because he was using the camera to review and 
reverse a prior judgment of fellow umpires that in turn had 
reviewed and reversed an earlier judgment. The protest is denied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida general manager Dave Dombrowski was disappointed in  
Coleman's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had a very legitimate case,'' he said. ``I was  
hoping we'd win, but I wasn't expecting to win because you normally 
don't win these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dombrowski read from a 1988 memo from then-commissioner Peter  
Ueberroth which said: ``The instant replay, electronic eye and like 
devices have no role in the officiating on the field of play in 
major league baseball. They simply will not be used now or in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That seems pretty clear to me,'' Dombrowski said. ``Len said  
it's a judgment decision, which is a very broad way of getting 
around that memorandum. ... I don't know why you can selectively 
choose to use it and then not bear the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa had predicted the protest would  
be turned down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like anything from a jury. You never know how the jury is  
going to decide,'' he said. ``If you made a list of reasons for or 
against, the reasons against allowing the protest was several lines 
deep, versus one or two. It had to adversely affect the outcome of 
the game (to be upheld), and it didn't.''

<HEADLINE> Hobbled Floyd Happy to DH for Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Cliff Floyd will be the Florida Marlins' designated  
hitter this weekend at Tampa Bay, and he's delighted with the 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players dislike the DH role, but Floyd will gladly give up  
his left fielder's glove. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that I don't want to play defense,'' Floyd said Thursday.  
``I want to be an all-around player. But I kind of like just 
hitting. If you do something good at the plate but stink it up in 
the field, you didn't have a good day. If you just hit and you do 
good, then you had a good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense is not what Floyd does best. His throwing arm is  
inconsistent, and a sore knee that kept him out of the first 19 
games makes it difficult for him to cover ground in left. 
</P>
<P>
	It's clear his confidence in his fielding is shaky, even though  
he made a fine running catch Wednesday with the bases loaded 
against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that ball gets in the lights and hits off my glove and  
three runs score, it's not a good day,'' Floyd said. ``Now I won't 
have to worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins visit the Devil Rays beginning Friday for a  
three-game interleague matchup billed as the citrus series. Floyd 
was a DH against Tampa Bay last year when he hit a homer off Dennis 
Springer, who now pitches for the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``To just hit will be good for me,'' Floyd said. ``I'm not  
Harold Baines, who's my idol, but I think I can handle being a 
designated hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays' artificial turf and Floyd's troublesome knee  
made the decision to use him as a DH an easy one, Marlins interim 
manager Fredi Gonzalez said. Bruce Aven, batting .365 through 
Wednesday in 63 at-bats, will replace Floyd in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, 26, who is in the first season of a $19 million,  
four-year contract, said his left knee remains sore and weak 
following surgery April 6 to repair torn cartilage. It hasn't 
affect him much at the plate, and he was hitting .280 with six 
homers and 24 RBIs in 33 games through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the field and on the bases, Floyd is at least a step  
slow. He stole 27 bases last year but is just 1-for-5 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distances I've been thrown out -- it's embarrassing,'' he  
said. ``My grandmother runs faster than me right now, and she's 
86.''

<HEADLINE> Rivers May Be Next Orlando Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Doc Rivers went back home to San Antonio  
late Thursday after meeting two days with officials of the Orlando 
Magic, and will be named the NBA team's new coach by Monday, a 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers played in the NBA for 13 years. He is currently a  
basketball analyst working with Turner Sports, and has spent much 
of the past month working NBA playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers would be the second youngest coach in the league, behind  
New York's Jeff Van Gundy. Both are 37. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to net a four-year deal worth an estimated $6  
million, The Orlando Sentinel reported in Friday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side admitted on Thursday the job was offered, but the  
newspaper reported that Rivers' agent and Magic officials were in 
fact negotiating a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	No offer was made to Rivers as of late Thursday, Magic general  
manager John Gabriel said. He said he was still was talking to 
other people about the coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process isn't over,'' Gabriel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rivers sounded upbeat at Orlando International Airport  
before boarding his flight back home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think things will happen here for me. And I think they will  
happen soon,'' Rivers said. ``I've got to go home now, and see what 
the boss (my wife) says, but I think I already know. She likes 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I've yet to meet any kids that don't like it here. My  
family has played a big role in this decision,'' Rivers said. 
``Let's just let the next couple days play out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hiring Rivers would mark a dramatic change for the Magic, who  
have been coached the past two seasons by Chuck Daly, the oldest 
coach in the league, with 40 years of coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers' hiring would apparently signal a willingness to gamble  
that his basketball knowledge, his toughness and leadership skills 
can overcome his lack of coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
	During his NBA career, Rivers played for Mike Fratello in  
Atlanta, Larry Brown in Los Angeles and Pat Riley in New York, 
three well-respected coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if there are many guys who have played for those  
three and survived,'' Rivers said. ``I think you may see a lot of 
those guys in me, and the way I coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers would be back in Orlando next week for the announcement,  
The Sentinel reported. The paper also reported he would be expected 
to rush off to attend the NBA pre-draft camp in Chicago to take a 
look at potential draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers told the newspaper he would not name anyone, but likely  
would hire at least one new veteran assistant with NBA head 
coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
	One trouble spot in the Rivers scenario is a reported preference  
among a majority of current Magic players for former assistant 
coach Bob Hill, a former head coach in Indiana and San Antonio, for 
the position. Magic fans favored hiring former player Scott Skiles, 
now an assistant at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic contacted Hill the day Daly resigned, while Skiles,  
who is the only other candidate who actually visited Orlando for an 
interview, got a call a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivers, too, has looked elsewhere, interviewing for the opening  
in Washington. But he made it clear Thursday that Orlando was his 
first choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known for some time, this is a great organization,''  
Rivers said. ``In the last two days, I was blown away by the people 
here. They want to win here. They really want to win. I have a good 
feeling about this whole situation. I think it will work well 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Rampage Leaves Four Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A former Marine dressed in camouflage blasted  
away with a pump-action shotgun as he roamed through a supermarket 
before sunrise Thursday, killing four employees and critically 
wounding one, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the gunman in the parking lot after talking him  
out of killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were alerted by a 911 call from inside the Albertsons  
supermarket as shots were being fired. They confronted a man with a 
goatee and shaved head who walked out the door with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He placed the gun to his head and officers were able to talk  
him into surrendering,'' Lt. Rick Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were all shot at point-blank range, Officer Steve  
Meriwether said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zane Floyd, 23, who was honorably discharged from the Marine at  
Camp Pendleton, Calif., last July and worked part-time as a bouncer 
at a bar, was arrested for investigation of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were baffled as to what triggered the rampage,  
Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not found any connection between Floyd and the  
victims -- three men and a woman -- and there was no indication he 
had had any run-ins at the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the gunman had an accomplice, police took at least three  
hours to search and clear the store, finding two employees hiding 
in a walk-in vegetable cooler. More than 20 people were in the 
store when shooting started. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has 995 stores in 25 states, sent counselors  
to help employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Floyd moved from an apartment into a guest house  
behind his parents' home just two blocks from the supermarket, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all they talked about is when he would be coming home  
from leave. They did everything they could for him,'' said neighbor 
Cathy Downey. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd served four years in the Marines. After the Marines, he  
started college but dropped out, Downey said. Floyd had worked one 
day a week for the past month at Sneakers, a sports bar in Las 
Vegas, said bar manager Tom Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a regular 23-year-old guy who likes to party and hang out  
just like me. I don't understand what happened,'' said Tony 
Marquez, a fellow bouncer.

<HEADLINE> Penny Shortages Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A penny saved is a penny earned, but too  
many pennies saved is a big problem for the Federal Reserve Bank in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Some area stores have been asking customers to dig for exact  
change as their cash drawers have run short of pennies in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, stores and banks have sharply increased their orders  
for pennies, though no one can point to a reason for a shortage 
except the accumulations that pile up on dressers, in jars and in 
piggy banks, Federal Reserve Bank spokesman Bob McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People do not take time to put pennies back in their pocket,''  
McCarthy said Wednesday. ``Everyone hoards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As area merchants feel the crunch, some have posted notes at  
cash registers asking customers for exact change. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris McDowell, manager of a downtown Wawa Food Market, said he  
has run short of pennies several times in the last two weeks, but 
customers have helped the cashiers cope. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes a cashier will return a little extra money to make the  
change come out even. At other times a customer will hand over a 
dollar for a 98-cent item and wave away the change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell said he understood the tendency to pile up pennies.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a five-gallon jug at home that I would say is  
three-fourths full of pennies. I just don't want to wrap them,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Bank distributed 700 million pennies to  
financial institutions in eastern Pennsylvania, western New Jersey 
and Delaware from January through May of this year, a 22 percent 
jump from 575 million distributed in the same period last year, 
McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, banks are not sending as many pennies as usual back  
to the Federal Reserve, worsening the pinch, McCarthy said. When 
banks have accumulated more pennies than they want to keep on hand, 
they return the coins to be put back in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve officials said none of the nation's 11 other  
federal reserve banks was encountering such a crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing nationally going on that would indicate a  
shortage,'' said Rose Pianalto, a spokeswoman for the Federal 
Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said a national shortage would be unlikely, since the  
two U.S. mints, in Philadelphia and Denver, use most of their 
capacity producing pennies. He said the Philadelphia mint produces 
40 million pennies a day, and the $500 billion worth of U.S. 
currency in circulation worldwide includes 200 billion pennies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, other areas in the country have experienced minor  
shortages recently. In southeast Missouri last month, banks were 
forced to cope with a dearth of pennies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Ramsey, a supervisor at Mercantile Bank in Cape Girardeau,  
Mo., said Thursday that the shortage is over, at least for now. The 
bank received new pennies from the Federal Reserve, while local 
residents dug into their personal hoards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of people bring in a lot of pennies,'' Ramsey  
said. ``We're overflowing now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank is asking  
other Federal Reserve banks and the Philadelphia U.S. Mint to 
supply whatever pennies they can spare to ease the shortage. ``It 
has been over the last several weeks. We can't associate it with an 
event,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Up; Factory Orders Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The raging U.S. economy encouraged Americans to  
go on a shopping spree in May, boosting sales at the nation's 
biggest retailers to better-than-expected levels for the fourth 
straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	Discounters and specialty clothing stores fared best last month  
as consumers bought up everything from trendy capri pants from the 
Limited to new gardening equipment at Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers today have a tremendous sense of well-being and  
wealth,'' said Wendy Liebmann, president of the retail consulting 
firm WSL Strategic Retail. ``Even though many know that their 
spending can't go on forever, they are thinking `I better spend it 
while I can.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers have watched their sales rise steadily over the last  
year, benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, as well as low 
unemployment and inflation levels. That's made consumers confident 
about their personal finances and eager to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Thursday, the Labor Department reported the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose a slight 
4,000 to 305,000 last week, signaling that unemployment remains 
extremely low. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are concerns that a sharp or prolonged decline on Wall  
Street, a rise in interest rates or signs of a slowing economy 
could cause Americans to curb their buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Some evidence of a slowdown came Thursday with the Commerce  
Department's report that orders to American factories for 
manufactured goods fell 1.2 percent in April, reflecting a big drop 
in demand for aircraft and other transportation products. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said that the  
average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages hit its 
highest level in nearly two years, jumping to 7.41 percent from 
7.23 percent a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all sorts of things that can turn people away from  
shopping very quickly,'' Liebmann said. ``While they are spending a 
lot now, most consumers today realize that this boom can't go on 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite concerns over what's to come, Americans did plenty of  
shopping in May. They bought lots of clothes and accessories at the 
specialty apparel stores, and turned to the discount chains for 
everything from patio furniture to groceries to new ``Star Wars'' 
toys. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth in May sales came despite being compared with the  
very strong performance of May 1998. Retail stocks surged on Wall 
Street on Thursday, helping lift the Dow Jones industrial average 
up 85.80 to 10,663.69. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at a very strong second quarter,'' said Walter  
Loeb, who runs the retailing consulting firm Loeb Associates. ``May 
was great and June has started off with a great bang. It think the 
quarter could end above expectations.'' For retailers, the fiscal 
year's second quarter runs from May through July. 
</P>
<P>
	While most fared well in May, some merchants -- including Kmart  
and J.C. Penney -- were hurt by the late Memorial Day this year. 
Most retailers ended their fiscal month of May on the 28th or 29th, 
which meant that much of the buying over this year's holiday 
weekend will be included in June's sales figures. Memorial Day was 
observed on May 31 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 4.8 percent in May. It rose 6.4 percent in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 7.7 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 14.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 1.9 percent, total sales down 2.8  
percent. --Kmart: Same-store sales up 3.7 percent, total sales up 
5.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales up 2.2 percent,  
same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 13.4 percent, total 
sales rose 9.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 6.3 percent, total sales up  
10.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 4.1 percent, total sales up  
14.9 percent. Federated's total sales included revenue from the 
Internet and from catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 2.9 percent, total  
sales up 7.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 10 percent, total sales up 8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 8 percent, total sales up 28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Got Weather 'Play by Play' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The pilot of the American Airlines jet  
that crashed was getting a ``play by play'' about the deteriorating 
weather in the minutes before the accident, a federal safety 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they  
have to base that on the information they have,'' said George 
Black, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that this was a very dynamic situation,'' Black said  
this morning on NBC's ``Today.'' ``The weather was changing 
rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's even indications the tower controller was providing  
sort of a play-by-play wind direction and velocity sequence of 
radio transmissions during the approach,'' he told ``Good Morning 
America.'' He didn't give specifics such as what precise wind speed 
the pilot was told about. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 145 people on board, including the pilot, were  
killed when Flight 1420 crashed while landing Little Rock National 
Airport during a violent storm just before midnight Tuesday. The 
plane caught fire after it rolled off the runway and down an 
embankment, striking steel supports for approach lights and 
breaking apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combination of weather and pilot error. He should  
have gone to another airport,'' said Richard Klamm, 49, of Pine 
Bluff, who was in the first-class section of the plane as part of 
its metal skin was sheared off by a light tower. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm unleashed hail, lightning and wind gusts to 75 mph in  
the area in the minutes before the crash. A gust of 87 mph was 
recorded at the airport shortly after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said he would not  
have attempted to land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 50 knots, 
or 57.5 mph. He oversees all of American Airlines' pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane initially was directed to land from the north because  
the airport was reporting southerly winds as the plane neared 
Little Rock. When winds shifted to the northwest, Flight 1420 was 
ordered to approach from the south instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not make two approaches,'' Black said this morning.  
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Buschmann, who was killed, was a veteran American  
pilot with 5,500 hours of flight time in the MD-80 series of 
aircraft, which includes the MD-82. As a chief pilot in American's 
Chicago operation, he supervised other pilots and flew passenger 
planes for two months each year. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB investigators hoped to talk to the crew's first officer,  
Michael Origel, today to see what he remembers about the minutes 
before the crash. They were waiting for a doctor's authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	At the crash site today, investigators swarmed over the rubble,  
peering into the plane's nose and walking through the shell. They 
also looked over a grassy field at the end of the runway where the 
plane broke through a metal fence and took out a steel walkway. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, investigators stressed that many factors were  
being looked at, in addition to the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators will also examine whether the pilots' long day and  
their desire to get the plane to its intended airport for the night 
-- to prevent delays the next morning -- played a role in the 
decision to land. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew had been on duty for 13 1/2 hours, just short of the  
airline's maximum of 14. FAA spokesman William Shumann said the 
federal maximum is 16 hours on duty a day, including a maximum of 
eight hours in flight. The crew was on the last leg of a flight 
schedule that started in Chicago and stopped in Salt Lake City and 
Dallas before ending in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said investigators also are looking at the groovings  
across the runway, designed mainly to prevent a plane from 
hydroplaning, as well as the runway drainage system. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said it felt like the aircraft never got a grip on  
the rain-slickened runway. Braking seemed useless. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no traction,'' said Carla Koen of Little Rock. ``We  
started sliding sideways and the next thing I knew there were 
flames in the back of the plane and there was a pole in the side of 
the plane and people were jumping out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB recovered the flight recorder and data box from the  
wreckage and was looking for clues for any mechanical problems. The 
Federal Aviation Administration said there was no distress call 
before the landing. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-level NTSB official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said today that both recorders were in good condition, with the 
flight recorder scarred by fire but the data inside apparently 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators gave the cockpit voice recorder a ``quick  
play-through,'' the official said, but planned a more detailed 
listening today. They also were preparing the flight data recorder 
for analysis today. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said investigators were pleased the plane had a  
modern flight data recorder, which he said could yield up to 100 
different pieces of information about the plane's operation and 
performance. The NTSB has repeatedly asked for flight recorder 
upgrades, saying some existing models that provide only 11 pieces 
of information leave investigators with too much guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
	A check of the plane's maintenance records revealed no major  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft wound up 150 yards from the Arkansas River, where  
passengers, some drenched in aviation fuel, slogged through mud and 
weeds to safety as the storm raged around them. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact on the left side of the cockpit killed Buschmann at  
the controls, then peeled away the airplane's metal skin down the 
left side of the first-class section. The back section of the plane 
whipped around and broke away from the front half as the plane went 
over a levee and struck the light rigging. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel spilling from the broken fuselage ignited a fire that  
burned about a third of the jet. Hospitals said they treated 83 
people for injuries. Five people remained in critical condition 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first aboard a U.S. carrier in nearly 1 1/2  
years. They also were the first in a commercial carrier at Little 
Rock's airport in its 82-year history. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Downing Named L.A. Times Publisher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Times Mirror Co. chairman, president and CEO  
Mark H. Willes relinquished the job of Los Angeles Times publisher 
on Thursday and promoted Times executive Kathryn M. Downing to the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	Downing, 46, retains her current titles of president and chief  
executive officer of the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Willes, 57, who added the publisher's job to his  
responsibilities in 1997, said he was giving up the post just as 
plans to improve circulation and financial performance were bearing 
fruit. He said the Times was on track to boost circulation and to 
increase operating profits, which have declined for five 
consecutive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to be publisher when all of these good things  
that I think are going to happen happen and are obvious to 
everybody,'' Willes said. ``But this isn't about personal agendas 
and personal satisfaction. Good leaders know when to get in and 
also they know when to get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willes, a former General Mills executive, raised eyebrows in the  
industry in 1997 by vowing to boost the paper's circulation by 
500,000, then later upped the ante to a 1 million increase. 
Circulation currently is 1,095,007 daily and 1,383,373 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Downing reiterated  
that one of her goals as publisher would be to boost circulation by 
1 million over an unspecified period of time. 
</P>
<P>
	Willes generated controversy when he implemented a policy of  
having advertising executives work more closely with editors to 
support special projects and sections. Critics accused him of 
lowering the wall between editorial and advertising departments. 
</P>
<P>
	Willes told reporters Thursday that the policy had not  
compromised journalistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very pleased and it's going to make us a better paper and  
it's going to make us a substantially better business,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Willes, Downing had no newspaper experience before coming  
to Times Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	She joined Times Mirror in 1995 as president and chief executive  
officer of Mosby Matthew Bender, a legal and medical publishing 
unit that Times Mirror sold last year. She was named president and 
chief executive officer of the Times in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Times Mirror, Downing was president and chief  
executive officer of Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, a division of 
Thomson Legal Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Downing said she wanted the Times to make a difference in the  
lives of its readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely fallen in love with this paper and wonder  
how it took me this long in my career to find the magic of 
newspapers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Willes' exit was not surprising given his responsibilities  
running Times Mirror, said newspaper analyst John Morton of Morton 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man who's the chairman and CEO of the parent company  
shouldn't be spending a lot of his time being publisher of the 
newspaper,'' Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror publishes The (Baltimore) Sun, Newsday on New  
York's Long Island, The Hartford (Conn.) Courant and other papers 
in addition to the Times.

<HEADLINE> Elvis Items To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Elvis may have left the building, but his Army  
fatigues could soon hang in your closet. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 of the King's never displayed treasures from his  
Graceland compound will be sold at auction in October at Las Vegas' 
MGM Grand hotel, Gurnsey's auction house announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the items to be auctioned are record, movie and  
performance contracts, including the publishing contract for 
``Heartbreak Hotel'' and letters from Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra 
and President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	There will also be some classic pieces like a vintage yellow  
Cadillac station wagon with wood-grain side panels and an ivory 
wool cape decorated with rhinestones and an American eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	No minimum prices were set. Arlan Ettinger, owner of the  
Manhattan auction house that also sold Mark McGwire's 70th home run 
ball for just over $3 million in January, said he expected the 
prices to range from affordable to six figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The items were selected to help weed out the collection at  
Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised from the auction will help build houses for  
homeless families in Memphis. The development, called Presley 
Place, will cost about $1.5 million to build. It will be operated 
by the Metropolitan Interfaith Association and will provide 
counseling and job training for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Elvis -- who died Aug. 16, 1977, at age 42 -- was  
discovered, the Presley family lived for several years in a federal 
housing project in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	The items will be previewed in Las Vegas beginning Sept. 28. The  
auction is slated for Oct. 8-10.

<HEADLINE> May, Year-To-Date Retail Sales list </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	May sales and sales for the fiscal year to date reported by  
leading retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales compare the current year's sales with those of the  
previous year. Retailers are ranked according to results at the end 
of May. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting periods vary slightly. Most retailers' fiscal years  
end in late January or early February. 
</P>

as same-store or comparable store sales, and total sales. Retailers 
release only percentage changes for same-store sales, while they 
provide dollar figures and percentages for total sales.

<HEADLINE> Tempo Key to Avalanche-Stars Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The first six games of the Western Conference  
finals have been as much about styles as they have scoring goals. 
</P>
<P>
	So with Game 7 looming Friday, the Dallas Stars and Colorado  
Avalanche know that whichever team can control the tempo the 
longest will likely be playing Buffalo for the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this series, there have been so many tempo changes and  
switches of momentum,'' Dallas forward Jamie Langenbrunner said. 
``It's going to come down to the team that sticks with it the 
longest and keeps battling the hardest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars play a plodding, defensive-oriented game with an  
emphasis on tight checking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche are an offensive-minded bunch who try luring  
opponents into a wide-open game by daring teams to try outskating 
and outshooting them. 
</P>
<P>
	The inherent pressure of a seventh game is somewhat to Dallas'  
advantage. Players tend to be tentative for fear of making the 
season-ending mistake, thus slowing the game's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado coach Bob Hartley is warning his players not to fall  
into that trap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't play cautious,'' Hartley said. ``Dallas plays for  
breaks and is very opportunistic. We have to use our speed to our 
advantage and we have to be on our best game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having the game in Reunion Arena is Dallas' reward for having  
the NHL's best regular-season record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars are 6-2 at home in the playoffs, with both losses in  
this series. Colorado is 8-1 on the road in the postseason, with 
the only loss in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	One theory behind the Avalanche's road success is that teams  
want to play exciting hockey for their home fans, so they end up 
playing to Colorado's strength. That's exactly what happened in 
Game 5 when the Avalanche won 7-5 and took a 3-2 lead in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	The pendulum swung back in Game 6, with Dallas forcing Colorado  
to scrounge for every opportunity. The Stars ended up winning 4-1 
in a game that was close until the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't do anything fancy, even though our fans would like to  
see that, because that's not our style,'' Stars defenseman Craig 
Ludwig said. ``We've got to keep things simple and not try to do 
more than what our team allows us to do. We've got to continue to 
play like that -- or at least start to play like that in this 
round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As much as forwards and defensemen try determining the game's  
flow, it really comes down to which goaltender is playing best. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this series, it's been a push.  
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Patrick Roy has shown flashes of why he's won more  
playoff games than any goalie in history. He's also shown flashes 
of vulnerability -- especially on shots above his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has a 2-3 record in Game 7s.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind big games. I feel comfortable,'' he said. ``The  
reason is it is easier for me to focus and concentrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Ed Belfour has been superb throughout the playoffs, but  
won't be able to escape his choker reputation until he hoists the 
Cup -- even though he's 2-0 in Games 7s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a battling series all the way through,'' Belfour  
said. ``They feel they are right there and we have to keep doing 
what need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players on both teams are somewhat savoring the excitement of  
this game. They feel the pressure and understand what's riding on 
their next 60 minutes on the ice, but they know the reward is what 
they've been working toward since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set up a game plan Day 1 of training camp with the  
players,'' Hartley said. ``That ultimate goal is none different, 
but now there are 24 teams watching.''

<HEADLINE> Truck Carrying Explosives Overturns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- An overturned tractor-trailer on the  
Washington area's busiest intersection forced people to sit and 
wait in traffic for hours -- but not Raina Alexis Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8-pound baby girl was born Wednesday in her parents' car  
while they were stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The driving nightmare began at 4 a.m. Wednesday when a  
tractor-trailer carrying 20 tons of explosive fireworks powder 
overturned at an interchange where 370,000 drivers converge daily 
at the intersections of Interstates 95, 395 and 495. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities evacuated more than 50 homes near the accident site  
and traffic was backed up for 20 miles. The interchange was 
reopened and the residents were allowed back in their homes about 
8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The tractor-trailer's driver, Juanita Kirk, 41, was charged with  
reckless driving, although police have not determined the cause of 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The traffic stretched across the Potomac River into Maryland,  
where Venita Cooper and her husband Wesley were headed to Bethesda 
Naval Hospital for the birth of Rainia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper helped deliver his third child in the car.  
</P>
<P>
	``She just fell asleep and we waited,'' Cooper said. ``It seemed  
like forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A rescue crew, delayed in traffic, arrived about 20 minutes  
later.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Tracking Racist E-Mails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Stanford University has turned loose its  
electronic bloodhounds to track the source of racist e-mail sent to 
25,000 campus computer users over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-paragraph message accused the university of giving  
preference in housing to non-whites, said Rachel Lotan, a professor 
in the School of Education who received the e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The message was so racist ``it took my breath away,'' she said.  
``It must be someone very angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A housing shortage for students has been a problem at Stanford  
for some time. Last week, some 1,300 students were not selected in 
the lottery held for scarce campus housing. Last year, almost 900 
missed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julius Finkelstein, head of Santa Clara County's  
high-tech crimes unit, said the hacker could be charged with such 
offenses as unauthorized use of a computer account and harassment 
via e-mail.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel Soldiers Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinians protesting Jewish  
settlement expansion clashed today with Israeli soldiers throughout 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate attack, an Israeli soldier fatally shot a  
Palestinian motorist at an army roadblock after he allegedly tried 
to hit the soldier with his car. 
</P>
<P>
	The marches, organized by the Palestinian Authority on what it  
designated a ``day of rage,'' were intended to exert pressure on 
Israel's moderate prime minister-elect, Ehud Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a message from our people to Mr. Barak that peace with  
settlements is not possible,'' said Palestinian spokesman Khaled 
Khatib. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat fears Barak will try to reach a  
peace agreement with Syria before focusing on the conflict with the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat also worries Barak will harden his position on  
settlements in an effort to lure pro-settlement parties into his 
government coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of demonstrators marched to settlements and Israeli  
army posts, some hurling stones. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas, 
rubber bullets and live rounds, injuring at least seven 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian police, some wielding batons, tried to keep back the  
crowds. Near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, protesters lobbed a 
fire bomb at an Israeli army outpost and a tent caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, an Israeli soldier shot a Palestinian motorist at a  
military checkpoint near the Jewish settlement of Yattir in the 
southern West Bank. The motorist died at an Israeli hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, another Palestinian tried to run over a soldier  
manning a roadblock near the Jewish settlement of Beitar, Israel 
army radio said. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest demonstration took place at the Gush Katif junction  
in the southern Gaza Strip, where 1,000 Palestinians blocked the 
main thoroughfare in the strip. Marchers chanted ``No to peace with 
settlements'' and ``Settlers get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some marchers tried to throw stones at Israeli soldiers but were  
pushed back by Palestinian police. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes also erupted near a new settlers' enclave on a West Bank  
hilltop. Soldiers opened fire, and four demonstrators were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has assured potential hard-line coalition partners that he  
will not cut funding to settlements and will complete some of the 
construction authorized by his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Palestinian leaders said they would not resume  
peace negotiations unless Barak declared a settlement freeze.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Gov't Energy Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told federal agencies  
Thursday to do a better job of conserving energy, citing global 
warming so alarming that it is melting sea ices and killing off 
entire species in Costa Rica's forests. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government uses more energy than anyone else in the  
nation, expending $8 billion worth each year -- roughly half of 
which goes into lights, heat and air conditioning for its 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued an executive order that directs federal agencies  
to cut their energy consumption by 35 percent, compared with 1985 
levels, between now and 2010. The government has reduced 
consumption 17 percent since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the single largest consumer of energy in our country, the  
federal government should be leading the way,'' Clinton told 
reporters during an appearance in the White House Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House estimated that Clinton's order would save  
taxpayers about $750 million a year, and reduce greenhouse gases by 
2.4 million metric tons -- the equivalent of taking 1.7 million cars 
off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced that by the end of the month, the Defense  
Department will award the largest energy-saving contract in 
government history. He said under the contract, the government pays 
no up-front costs, the contractor wins a share of the energy 
savings and taxpayers will save over $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the White House has made changes that saved about  
$180,000 in energy costs annually, said Todd Stern, Clinton's 
coordinator on climate change -- even though it not stopped using 
energy-eating incandescent light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has made significant improvements,'' Stern  
said. ``We will be making further improvements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called global warming ``our most fateful environmental  
challenge,'' saying each month seems to bring disturbing new 
evidence of the damage greenhouse gases are doing to the planet. He 
cited scientists' findings that 1998 was likely the warmest year in 
a millennium, and said the permafrost in the Arctic is beginning to 
warm and sea ice is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whole species of frogs are disappearing from forests in Costa  
Rica because the air there is getting hotter and dryer,'' Clinton 
said. ``These are alarming signs for what it means to biodiversity 
and the potential of a rising water level around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yet some still insist that the vast majority of scientists are  
simply wrong and that we should do nothing. Others call for a raft 
of new regulations and new taxes. I believe there is a third way 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Congress to approve research allocations in his  
fiscal 2000 budget plan to help American businesses take advantage 
of current and developing energy-saving technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton instructed federal agencies to give annual conservation  
updates to the Office of Management and Budget, and take steps such 
as: 
</P>
<P>
	--Using private energy conservation contractors more often.  
</P>
<P>
	--Installing more efficient lighting systems, boilers and cooling  
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improving building insulation.  
</P>
<P>
	--Making wider use of renewable energy technologies.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's directive does not apply to energy uses for  
transportation, or many military or other activities tied to 
national security.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Boyfriend Arrested for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former boyfriend was accused Thursday of stabbing  
a woman who staggered from door to door, pleading for help, before 
she died in a driveway in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Gary Ferguson was charged with second degree murder in  
the May 24 death of Portia Lee, 30, a mother of six who left a 
trail of blood for 100 yards before she collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Lee was visiting a friend in the neighborhood  
and Ferguson caught up with her in the middle of the street after 
she left the friend's home. A handful of people watched the attack, 
but did nothing, police said. Someone eventually called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only did people watch her get beaten up, they likely  
watched her get stabbed,'' Lt. Bill Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said anyone who saw the attack would be treated as a witness  
and would not face charges for failing to assist Ms. Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson had been arrested twice since March for domestic  
violence against Ms. Lee and she was in the process of obtaining a 
restraining order against him, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum sentence for second degree murder is life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Case Winds Toward an End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the government's antitrust case against  
Microsoft Corp. winds toward an end in federal court, it seems at 
times that company chairman Bill Gates and his own lawyers are 
reading from different scripts. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, for at least the second time during the high-stakes  
trial, comments by Gates have undercut his lawyers' arguments. In 
the latest instance, as Microsoft argued in court that it faces 
rigorous competition from new technology devices, Gates wrote in 
Newsweek that personal computers -- which depend almost exclusively 
on his company's Windows operating system -- will remain the 
industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's mixed message -- telling the judge one thing but  
saying something else outside the courtroom -- was immediately noted 
by the government's lead lawyer and a witness this week, as the 
trial resumed after a three-month recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The government lawyer, David Boies, referred to ``a cleavage of  
what the lawyers want to argue in court and what the company 
says.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court Wednesday, Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara tried to  
minimize the significance of the billionaire chairman's apparently 
contradicting his legal team's arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't this exactly what you'd expect Mr. Gates to say, given  
his company's business?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument that Microsoft faces stiff competition from a new  
generation of technology devices is intended to persuade the judge 
that the high-tech industry is sufficiently robust despite 
complaints about Microsoft's alleged aggression toward software 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his Newsweek article, Gates wrote that personal computers  
would work ``in tandem with other cool devices'' rather than be 
replaced by them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given my job, it's hardly surprising that I'd say this,''  
Gates wrote, without mentioning his company's legal problems. ``But 
I'm betting Microsoft's future on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In seven paragraphs, Gates -- famous for his business acumen and  
his vast fortune -- managed to give the government another club to 
use against Microsoft in the courtroom. Microsoft even included a 
prominent link to the article on its corporate Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft indicated it will argue today that it faces threats  
from other upstart rivals, such as the niche Linux operating system 
software rapidly gaining popularity but still significantly behind 
Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	But, again, the company's lawyers will wrestle with comments  
Gates made outside the courtroom. He told a technology conference 
in April that Linux's impact ``will be fairly limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's witness this week in the new phase of the  
trial, economist Franklin Fisher, maintains that Microsoft's 
influence is not threatened by any new devices or emerging 
technologies, such as Internet TV, powerful game consoles or 
handheld appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that's likely to happen, and according to a  
recent Newsweek article, neither does Bill Gates,'' Fisher told the 
judge earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at least the second time that comments from Microsoft's  
top executive outside the courtroom stood in sharp contrast to the 
company's position inside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the trial, economist Richard Schmalensee explained to  
Boies under oath why he couldn't provide precise figures about 
Microsoft's profits, saying the company's decidedly low-tech 
accounting techniques ``do not always rise to the level of 
sophistication one might expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Boies pressed him, Schmalensee added: ``They record  
operating system sales by hand on sheets of paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks later, Gates described in his newly published book how  
Microsoft tracks sales figures digitally by product and country, to 
determine exactly how sales compare with budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``When figures are in electronic form, ... workers can study  
them, annotate them, look at them in any amount of detail,'' Gates 
wrote in ``Business at the Speed of Thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Boies said he never believed  
Schmalensee's explanation about paper ledgers at Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Gates,'' Boies said. ``This time.''

<HEADLINE> Fitness Standards Track Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just because you're 75, you shouldn't have  
trouble lifting a bag of groceries or getting up from a chair. But 
for millions of older Americans, those simple activities are a 
daily struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Disabling frailty doesn't have to be part of aging. In fact,  
studies have found that even 90-year-olds can rebuild lost muscle 
with some careful exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be better to never become so frail in the first place,  
and researchers have come up with a way to help: Fitness 
performance standards to let anyone 60 and older assess quickly if 
they're in good physical condition for their age, or if they're at 
risk of a downhill slide that could lead to a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our main interest is in keeping people mobile and staying  
physically independent as long as possible,'' said Roberta Rikli, a 
professor at California State University, Fullerton. She led a 
study of 7,000 Americans ages 60 to 94 that established the 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tests signal you're at risk of becoming too frail, ``we  
can do something to try to prevent that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exercise tests are simple enough that many people could try  
them at home, and senior centers around the country are starting to 
use them. 
</P>
<P>
	Frailty is a huge risk of aging. By age 70, most people have at  
least 20 percent less muscle than they did at age 30. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of elderly women are too frail to lift just 10  
pounds, and 60 percent cannot perform such household work as 
vacuuming. About 35 percent of men are equally frail. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the muscle deterioration may be inevitable. But Rikli  
says at least half is due to people becoming more sedentary with 
age, meaning that keeping active is important if you want healthy 
retirement years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rikli and colleague C. Jessie Jones studied some 7,000 Americans  
over 60 who live independently. They performed such simple tests 
as: 
</P>
<P>
	--How many times in 30 seconds they could rise from a  
straight-backed chair without using their arms to push themselves 
up. That measures lower body strength. 
</P>
<P>
	--How many times in 30 seconds they could lift a weight -- 5  
pounds for women, 8 pounds for men -- in a ``bicep curl'' that 
measures upper body strength. 
</P>
<P>
	--How many yards they could walk in six minutes, to measure  
aerobic fitness. 
</P>
<P>
	--How long it took them to rise from a chair, walk 8 feet and  
return to a seated position, to measure mobility. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, funded by a Medicare HMO provider, set standards for  
fitness levels that are normal, below average, or so low that 
people are at risk of needing a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	Say an 80-year-old woman could stand up from a chair without  
pushing off 10 times in 30 seconds. That's normal for that age. 
</P>
<P>
	But doing only 10 of these ``chair stands'' at age 60 is below  
average -- and while people at that level may function OK right now, 
they're at big risk of losing mobility by age 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Rikli found that fitness declined with age on average 1 percent  
a year. She advised people to track whether they're declining 
faster than normal, or if exercise is paying off and they're 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of age, people who got moderate physical activity at  
least three times a week were the most fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors already use similar but experimental tests to  
assess elderly patients' limitations. ``They're very powerful 
predictors'' of who will wind up disabled, said Dr. Jack Guralnik 
of the National Institute on Aging, a pioneer of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rikli wants such assessments to reach more older Americans. She  
hopes to have easy-to-read consumer brochures available by fall to 
illustrate the tests and show how to measure anyone's fitness level 
against the national standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an excellent idea,'' said Guralnik. ``The more people  
are aware of their level of functioning, the more they can tune 
into the fact that they need to exercise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, some of the 267 senior centers that participated in  
Rikli's study are using the fitness assessments. She will advertise 
the consumer brochures in publications targeted to older Americans 
once they're complete. But instead of waiting, senior centers or 
doctors could simply check April's edition of the Journal of Aging 
and Physical Activity for the study results.

<HEADLINE> Hank Williams Sr. Estate Wins Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The illegitimate daughter of Hank  
Williams Sr. isn't entitled to $12 million from his estate, a judge 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Jett Williams was born five days after the country legend died  
in 1953. She said she was denied the inheritance because Robert 
Stewart, her father's longtime attorney, and Irene Smith, her 
father's sister, hid the fact that she was Williams' daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	She asked Circuit Judge Gene Reese to award her the $12 million  
from American States Insurance Co., which insured her father's 
estate. Reese ruled Tuesday that since another court found that 
Stewart and Smith were not personally liable for any damages, Ms. 
Williams is not entitled to collect from the bonding company. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' mother cared for Jett Williams until she died. She was  
later adopted and didn't discover she was Williams' daughter until 
she was 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The country star's son, Hank Williams Jr., once tried to block  
her from collecting any money from the estate. They settled for an 
undisclosed sum.

<HEADLINE> Group Seeks Ban of Antibiotic Trovan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The popular antibiotic Trovan is too dangerous  
to stay on the market, a consumer advocacy group contended in a 
petition filed Thursday that accuses the government of approving 
the drug despite evidence it could harm patients' livers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since February 1998, 140 cases of serious liver damage have been  
reported among Trovan users. While most recovered after stopping 
the antibiotic, five patients died and three required liver 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans can buy eight other antibiotics from the same drug  
class, called quinolones, that are equally effective but less 
dangerous to the liver, said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the consumer 
advocacy group Public Citizen, which petitioned the Food and Drug 
Administration on Thursday to ban Trovan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe cited an internal FDA report that concluded almost a year  
ago that Trovan was more liver-toxic than related antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trovan is another example of a drug with no unique benefits  
and unquestionably unique, life-threatening risks,'' said Wolfe, 
who has long charged that the FDA approves too many ``me-too'' 
drugs that are no better than competitors but turn out to be 
riskier. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union last week warned Europeans to stop taking  
Trovan if they experience symptoms suggesting liver damage. 
Officials did, however, call the risk rare, since Trovan has been 
prescribed to 2.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the FDA called the liver problems serious and said  
it was discussing them with manufacturer Pfizer Inc. But the FDA 
has not yet upgraded warnings for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Lawrence Bachorik said the FDA said would consider  
Wolfe's petition carefully. ``We're concerned about the adverse 
events associated with this product, and we're discussing them with 
the company,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Before Trovan's approval, animal studies suggested the drug  
could harm liver cells. Also, a study of 140 men who took Trovan 
for inflamed prostates found 10 percent had liver tests suggesting 
damage, Wolfe said. That's a high side-effect rate, and the study 
showed the damage was most likely when people took the drug longer 
than two weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Every drug causes side effects, and the FDA often approves drugs  
with liver risks as long as doctors are warned to monitor patients 
carefully so they can stop the drug if a problem arises. Trovan's 
label tells doctors that monitoring patients' livers is advisable, 
but Wolfe said that's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of liver toxicity include fatigue, yellowing of the  
skin or eyes, stomach pain with nausea or vomiting, or dark urine.

<P>
	TULLAHOMA, Tenn. (AP) -- After praying, church members retreat to  
a back room to learn the Gospel through Barney Fife. Bibles in 
hand, they watch black-and-white TV reruns to see how the bumbling 
deputy can bring them closer to God. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding the Way Back to Mayberry'' is a Bible study class  
developed by two Alabama men who believe watching ``The Andy 
Griffith Show'' can help lead to spiritual enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mayberry may be fictitious, but its lessons are not,'' said  
Pat Allison, a preacher who leads a class at the Bel-Aire Church of 
Christ in Tullahoma. ``Not only are the episodes funny, cute and 
clean, the principles are there and need to be emulated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allison sees God in Aunt Bee's nurturing, in Andy's wise counsel  
and Opie's innocence. Even Barney has something to teach, the 
minister says, but it's mostly about how not to act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone has to be the instigator. ... He stirs things up and  
makes a mess of things,'' Allison said of Barney, the sidekick 
played by Don Knotts. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the class came from Joey Fann, 33, and Brad  
Grasham, 38, members of the Twickenham Church of Christ in 
Huntsville, Ala. The concept has spread through Fann's Web site and 
word of mouth. Classes are being taught in Alabama, Tennessee and 
other states, and inquiries have poured in from as far away as New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Fann and Grasham grew up watching Andy keep the peace in the  
North Carolina town where Otis, the town drunk, was the jail's most 
frequent visitor, and a dinner date for Barney and Thelma Lou was 
about as racy as it got. 
</P>
<P>
	Fann, an engineer, said that as a college student he began to  
see a deeper meaning in the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``To take a break and relieve stress, I would pop a video in and  
watch the show,'' he said. ``That's when I started to realize that 
some episodes brought some good Christian moral values that we all 
can appreciate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fann and Grasham consulted their minister to choose a few  
episodes for a class last summer, then found related Bible passages 
to draw out the lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	Among their choices:  
</P>
<P>
	--Opie accidentally kills a mother bird with his slingshot, and  
Andy makes him care for the orphaned babies. (Romans 8:28, ``And we 
know that all things work together for good to them that love God, 
to them who are the called according to his purpose.'') 
</P>
<P>
	--Andy tries selling his house, and Opie makes him tell  
prospective buyers about the flaws. (Luke 8:15, ``But that on the 
good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having 
heard the word, keep it ... .'') 
</P>
<P>
	--A businessman passing through Mayberry has car trouble on a  
Sunday. The local service station owner prefers to sit on his porch 
and read the paper on his day of rest, and the man eventually 
steals a truck. (James 1:3, ``The trying of your faith worketh 
patience.'') 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 people attended the first class. Within weeks, Sunday  
night attendance grew to more than 200, Fann said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most everyone's familiar with the show and enjoys the show,''  
he said. ``When you mention it, you can see people's eyes light 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fann posted the lesson plans on his Web site, where he  
evangelizes and offers a little commentary. ``Outstanding 
performance by Buddy Ebsen as Mr. Dave the hobo,'' is among the 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor George Lindsey, who played Goober and lives in Nashville,  
said he wasn't surprised by the class since Griffith and his 
writers purposely wove moral themes into their stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a wonderful show ... . If it can be of value to  
somebody, I think that's just topping on the cake,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Hill, who researches popular culture and is chairman of the  
Department of Communication Studies at the University of North 
Carolina at Charlotte, remembers discussing Andy Griffith in his 
childhood Sunday religion classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a big stretch to do that,'' he said. ``The  
show always satisfies the eternal quest for the good prevailing. 
There are real clear-cut distinctions of what's right and what's 
wrong. It's always the good, the more virtuous that wins out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent Wednesday night, Allison walked his congregants  
through an episode in which Andy confronts Opie about a hatchet the 
boy claims was given to him by a man in the woods. A skeptical Andy 
asks his son to admit the man doesn't exist. Opie insists the man 
is real and, at the end of the episode, he's proven right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could you see Opie's convictions?'' Allison tells the crowd of  
about 70, turning the program into a lesson in sticking to the 
truth, regardless of pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Reading Romans 12:2, he says: ``And be not conformed to this  
world; but be ye transformed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the class dismissed, 64-year-old Barbara Jett clutched her  
Bible and observed, ``There are so many tidbits in there. It's 
entertaining, yet you're learning when you're watching it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Mosley, father of a 3-year-old boy, said he was surprised  
by how much he learned about parenting. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I was curious. How are they going to get a moral  
story and tie it to `Andy Griffith?','' he said. ``When you look at 
what's on TV today, they're giving just the opposite meaning Andy 
Griffith would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But does ``Finding the Way Back to Mayberry'' trivialize  
Christianity? Allison said no, adding that the Gospel itself 
provides a precedent for teaching moral lessons through simple, 
compelling stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, in a way, like a parable,'' he said.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Against GOP Budget Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Setting the stage for a budget fight,  
President Clinton on Thursday said GOP spending plans were ``a 
blueprint for chaos'' and failed to shore up the Social Security 
and Medicare systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, appearing in the Rose Garden after meeting with his  
Cabinet, said his budget would address the fiscal problems of both 
Social Security and Medicare while honoring mandated spending caps 
and investing in education and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the Republican majority in Congress is moving  
ahead with a budget plan that, in the end, may do none of these 
things,'' Clinton said. ``It fails to extend the solvency of Social 
Security and Medicare. It fails to make new, crucial investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said the GOP plans called for cuts ``in areas of  
great national need -- from law enforcement, to education, to the 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority budget plan is simply not realistic,'' the  
president said. ``It is a blueprint for chaos and we can do 
better.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks China Trade Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As protesters marked the 10th anniversary of  
the Tiananmen Square crackdown, President Clinton moved Thursday to 
extend normal trade relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual recommendation came at a time when allegations that  
China stole nuclear secrets from U.S. research facilities and 
meddled in U.S. elections have increased congressional criticism of 
administration policy toward China. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton argued in a letter to Congress that building better  
relations with Beijing is in America's national interest as well as 
the best way to promote reform within China. He renewed his pledge 
to press for even closer economic ties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pursue engagement with our eyes wide open,'' Clinton said.  
``A policy of disengagement and confrontation would only strengthen 
those in China who oppose greater openness and freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's letter went to Capitol Hill, a small group of  
demonstrators gathered at the Chinese Embassy in Washington to mark 
the anniversary of the Chinese government's bloody crackdown on 
pro-democracy demonstrators 10 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters read the names of those killed in the crackdown,  
called for the release of pro-democracy demonstrators still jailed 
and scolded policy-makers for putting trade ahead of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1974 law, the president must seek an annual waiver to  
extend normal trade relations to totalitarian states. Since 1980, 
every president has extended that status to China and, despite 
concerns over human rights, Congress has approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acknowledged concerns about human rights in China, but  
insisted the only way to address them was through continued 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trade ... remains a force for social change in China,  
spreading the tools, contacts and ideas that promote freedom,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations leveled against China, coupled with NATO's  
errant bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade has tensions 
between Washington and Beijing running high. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration's China policy, like that of the  
administration before it, has not succeeded in making trade fairer, 
people freer, or the world safer,'' Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House International  
Relations Committee, criticized Clinton for pursuing ``a strategic 
partnership with a country that is actively engaged in nuclear 
espionage activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In our relationship with China, stopping proliferation should  
be no less a priority than protecting commercial interests,'' said 
Gilman, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress was expected to approve the extension after some  
stormy debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations to bring China into the World Trade Organization  
have been stalled since the errant embassy bombing. But Clinton 
reasserted his intention to seal a WTO deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am committed to bringing China into global structures, to  
promote China's adherence to global norms on human rights, weapons 
of mass destruction, crime and drugs, immigration, the environment, 
and on trade,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding WTO, he said bringing China in would not be ``a favor  
to China but a means of opening and reforming China's markets and 
holding China to the rules of the global trading system -- 
developments that will benefit America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The business community supports greater trade with China. In  
1998, U.S. exports to China totaled more than $14.3 billion, 
imports were $71.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``American companies and workers have a huge stake in U.S.-  
China commercial relations,'' said U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
President Thomas J. Donohue.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Rise, Tokyo Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets edged higher Thursday,  
but Tokyo, the region's biggest bourse, fell after a three-day 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 190.49  
points, or 1.16 percent, to close at 16,227.50. The index had 
gained 9.49 points, or 0.06 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With few incentives to encourage buying, many investors remained  
on the sidelines awaiting U.S. employment data, due out Friday in 
Washington, for clues on the direction of U.S. interest rates and 
stock prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian markets are closely watching whether the U.S. Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates later this month to alleviate 
inflationary pressure. Higher U.S. rates would encourage investors 
to shift funds from Asia to higher yielding U.S. fixed income 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese  
yen after rumors that China might devalue the yuan emerged once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 121.54 yen, up 1.00 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.33 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Bank of China, China's central bank, later  
reaffirmed the government's commitment to a stable currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indonesia, the Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index soared  
2.3 percent, or 13.254 points, to 587.569, as a massive rally by 
parliamentary frontrunner Megawati Sukarnoputri concluded 
peacefully. Declining interest rates contributed to the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The election campaign, grouping 48 political parties, will end  
Saturday, and voters head to the polls June 7. Some had worried 
that Thursday's rally, which gridlocked the capital, would turn 
chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices edged up slightly amid talks among  
local brokers that the United States may not raise interest rates 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 0.1 percent, or 12.97  
points, to close at 12,471.61. It gained 0.8 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices rose in brisk trading on reports of  
falling inflation. The SET index rose 1.19 points, or 0.2 percent, 
to 476.05. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares fell slightly in the absence of  
fresh incentives. The Composite Index fell 4.96 points, or 0.67 
percent, to 744.50. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks fell as investors unloaded shares on  
fears of a possible U.S. interest rate hike. The PSE index fell 
33.36 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,382.41. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Baffert Downplays Lukas Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bob Baffert does not warm to the task easily.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, he lost a $5 million bonus by the length of a  
thoroughbred's nose. The year before, he left the same $5 million 
on the table when his horse came up four strides short of winning 
the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``How would I feel watching someone else walk off with one?''  
Baffert repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Pause.  
</P>
<P>
	Bloodshot eyes flicker behind the trademark amber shades, the  
result of allergies or revelry. Baffert does not say. He climbed 
out of a car at 9:40 a.m., several hours after everybody else in 
the training fraternity arrived, and threw the session open to 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	This question, though, is tough, and made tougher still because  
the ``someone else'' in this case -- the only someone who can win 
the Belmont and a Triple Crown this year -- is ubertrainer D. Wayne 
Lukas, whose rivalry with Baffert is the biggest the sport can 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
	They bid on the same yearlings, court the same owners, covet the  
same prizes. Between 1994 and 1996, Lukas won six Triple Crown 
races in a row, though he failed to sweep the Kentucky Derby, 
Preakness and Belmont in the same year with the same horse. The 
last two years, it was Baffert who came to New York with a shot at 
the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the shoe is back on Lukas' foot. So Baffert struggles to say  
something kind, or even better, something neutral. This is what 
comes out: 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of it that way. Win, lose or draw, believe me  
Wayne will be glad when it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no question which of those fates Baffert would wish for  
Lukas and his brilliant colt, Charismatic. Indeed, some people 
think Baffert is so desperate to stop his archrival that he is 
risking his equally brilliant filly, Silverbulletday, by throwing 
her in with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran a pair of colts and his other filly, Excellent Meeting,  
against Lukas' two horses in the Kentucky Derby and got whipped. He 
brought Excellent Meeting back for the Preakness and she developed 
a breathing problem before being eased on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert entered and then scratched Silverbulletday from both  
those races. But if he has any lingering concerns, bravado 
steamrolls them now. 
</P>
<P>
	``All her times have been faster than the colts. We had to wait  
for the right time,'' he said, ``and this is the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has been lashed in the past -- sometimes unfairly -- for  
pushing horses to the limit and beyond. Two days earlier, he 
forcefully reminded some reporters what would have happened if he 
and Baffert's roles had been reversed -- if he'd been the trainer 
with one promising filly eased in the Preakness and a second 
pressed into service in the toughest of spring classics as a 
spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lukas didn't bring it up again Thursday, when an air of  
civility as thick as the early summer haze hung over Belmont's 
barns. With the race little more than 48 hours off, it wasn't just 
the horses who refused to talk trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the Knicks and Miami, with Van Gundy and Riley  
going at it,'' said Lukas, who coached basketball before he turned 
to horses. ``It's not just the two of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas and Baffert came up through the thoroughbred ranks when  
deans like Charlie Whittingham and Woody Stephens took the measure 
of one another in the newspapers almost daily. Back then, a 
well-timed barb could make a rival chafe just as much as sticking a 
burr under the saddle of his mount. And Lukas was a frequent 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	They were amused because he had grooms manicure the grounds  
around his stable and insisted the bridles and buckets and blankets 
be stacked just so. They had fun with the creases in his jeans and 
the starch in his manner. He was already racing's organization man 
and his desire to win was so raw that Stephens and Whittingham 
never lacked for material with which to taunt him. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert is 18 years Lukas' junior and the funnier of the two.  
They have little in common, but as the rivalry deepened, Baffert 
began to value Lukas more as a foe than a foil. 
</P>
<P>
	Both started in the quarterhorse racket, learning to make do  
with a shoestring budget. Both learned to spot talent in a 
heartbeat and get it for a song. Both learned to break the horses 
themselves in order to train them. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that both have the best of everything and all the help they  
need, they need each other as a way to measure how far they have 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have respect for each other,'' Baffert said. ``Even though  
we're not great friends, we know when we run against each other 
that we have to be ready. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Duncan Unfazed by MVP Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tim Duncan didn't win the MVP award many  
people thought he deserved. He didn't even finish second. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed hardly to care, though, as he and his San Antonio  
teammates prepared for Friday night's Game 3 against the Portland 
Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals. After all, the two 
players who finished ahead of him in the MVP voting, Karl Malone 
and Alonzo Mourning, are finished for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan and the Spurs are two victories away from the NBA Finals.  
That means a lot more than any MVP award, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be right here right now, I'll tell you that,''  
Duncan said. ``I'm very happy with the position that I'm in right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Mario Elie said such an attitude is typical for the  
team-oriented Duncan, who in just two years has become the Spurs' 
go-to player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of disappointed he was all the way down to third,''  
Elie said. ``I understand those other two guys had terrific years. 
But we had the best record in the league. We won all the big games 
we needed to win, and Tim was a big part of that. I guess a lot had 
to do with Tim being in his second year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize Karl Malone has a thousand games under his belt, but  
I felt this year Tim was the best player in the league. Karl Malone 
is out fishing or driving his 18-wheeler across the country. Tim is 
still in the hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan gives himself an average grade so far in the Western  
Conference finals, even though he's averaged 22 points and 11.5 
rebounds per game and shooting 61.5 percent from the field as the 
Spurs took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Average for him,'' teammate Sean Elliott said, ``but above  
average for anybody else. He can probably play better, but you've 
got to give credit to Portland, too. That's their defensive 
scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio is 4-0 on the road in the playoffs, and the Spurs  
are one of three teams to beat the Blazers in Portland this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is,'' Duncan said. ``In a hostile  
environment, we just get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The youthful Blazers, meanwhile, feed off the noise of the Rose  
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a dangerous team at home,'' Jim Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs are preaching teamwork, sacrifice and  
cohesiveness, the Blazers were weathering Damon Stoudamire's 
ill-timed outburst. The Portland point guard is unhappy about being 
benched in the fourth quarter in favor of Greg Anthony. Stoudamire 
lashed out at the situation after practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get over it, but I'm never going to forget it,'' he said  
in a wide-ranging conversation that also included a jab at his 
persistent critics in Portland, where he grew up and was a high 
school star. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, who earned NBA coach of the year honors for dealing  
with such problems on a deep, talented and young team, downplayed 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments don't bother me. The timing of it at this point  
maybe does a little bit,'' Dunleavy said Thursday. ``But it's 
nothing that major. I don't think it's going to affect the way he 
plays tomorrow night. It's not going to affect the way I coach 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day layoff has not erased the pain of Elliott's tip-toe  
3-pointer that beat Portland 86-85 Monday night in Game 2, a game 
the Blazers led by as many as 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``To wait this long, it eats at you,'' Jackson said, ``but you  
know you have a chance for it to set in and hurt, because you know 
you gave a game away, or maybe two away, and you've got to have a 
time period where you sit there and think about it, about the 
little things you did wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has shown a marked contrast between the high emotion  
of the fragile Blazers and the even, uncomplaining keel of the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're an older group,'' Elliott said. ``We've been through  
situations in our careers where maybe we were unhappy with our 
playing time or we were unhappy with the number of shots we got. 
But we're beyond that now. Guys here aren't trying to star in 
commercials. We're trying to win. We don't have a lot of time left 
on these legs, so we're trying to get it done now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, who played on two championship teams in Houston, senses  
that special something on this team, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident group. We've got a lot of trust in each  
other,'' he said. ``That's what I like. A guy can miss all day but 
if he's open, you get him the ball. That's what this team has been 
about all year, trusting each other, sharing the ball. We've got a 
bond right now that's hard to explain. We feel good about each 
other.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Smuggler Gets Life in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A man dubbed ``Captain Jump Off'' because he would  
make smuggled illegal immigrants jump from his boat into choppy 
surf was sentenced to life in prison Thursday for drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard B. Barker, 47, was arrested last fall in the Bahamas, a  
month after he escaped a high-seas shootout with U.S. Customs 
agents. He had been using a 35-foot speedboat to deliver 1,100 
pounds of cocaine 15 miles off of Grand Bahama Island. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to drug trafficking in March as part of a plea  
bargain, and drug conspiracy charges were dropped. Federal 
prosecutor Ellen Cohen said Barker was sentenced to life because of 
the shootout, the large amount of drugs involved and Barker's 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker was known to federal authorities as ``Captain Jump Off''  
because illegal immigrants he had smuggled said he forced them to 
jump into neck-high waters. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, four Haitians drowned after they were forced off his  
boat near the Florida coast. Barker was convicted of negligent 
homicide and was paroled after spending less than four years in 
prison.

	Yugoslavia Accepts Kosovo Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After more than 2 1/2 months of NATO  
airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic's government today accepted an 
international peace plan, capitulating on Western demands to end 
the Kosovo conflict. The move came right after Serb lawmakers in 
Belgrade overwhelmingly approved a peace deal to resolve the crisis 
and allow the return of more than 850,000 ethnic Albanians to 
Kosovo. The government said in a statement that the peace plan 
accepted by it and the Serbian assembly confirms the sovereignty 
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and the role of the United 
Nations in bringing peace to the region. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Cautious on Belgrade Peace Move  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration reacted cautiously  
today to Yugoslavia's reported acceptance of a peace plan for 
Kosovo. ``It's a hopeful sign, but we need to see more'' details, 
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. The White House said there 
is no immediate plan to halt the bombing campaign. Officials said 
they want to hear directly from Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, 
who is representing the European Union in talks with Slobodan 
Milosevic's government. Ninety percent of Kosovo's prewar 
population of 2 million was ethnic Albanian. NATO intervened 13 
months after Serb forces cracked down on ethnic Albanians, killing 
at least 2,000 people. 

</P>
<P>
	Factory Orders Drop 1.2 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to American factories for manufactured  
goods fell 1.2 percent in April, reflecting a big drop in demand 
for aircraft and other transportation products. The Commerce 
Department reported today that the decrease in factory orders in 
April followed a 1.9 percent advance in March and was only the 
second decline in the past six months. However, the weakness was 
confined to the volatile transportation sector. Excluding 
transportation, factory orders would have risen by 0.5 percent, 
posting the fifth increase in the past six months. Manufacturing 
has been the hardest-hit sector from the global currency crisis.

	American Pilot Was Told About Weather  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The pilot of the American Airlines jet  
that crashed was getting a ``play by play'' about the deteriorating 
weather in the minutes before the accident, a federal safety 
official said today. ``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land 
or not, but they have to base that on the information they have,'' 
George Black, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety 
Board told NBC. Nine of the 145 people on board, including the 
pilot, were killed when Flight 1420 crashed while landing at Little 
Rock National Airport during a violent storm just before midnight 
Tuesday.

watched others and reportedly broke up one attempt at public 
mourning today, the 10th anniversary of the night soldiers shot 
their way into Beijing to end democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen 
Square. The entirely state-controlled media made no mention of the 
sensitive anniversary. Families of people killed in the military 
assault planned private memorials at home, despite the presence of 
plainclothes security agents outside their doors.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new late-night national newscast from the team  
behind public television's ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' is expected 
to make it on the air early next year. So far, about a dozen PBS 
stations have agreed to air the show, which is being developed with 
The New York Times, said Robert MacNeil yesterday. He is the former 
``NewsHour'' anchor who is working on it for MacNeil-Lehrer 
Productions. MacNeil said the second newscast, to air at 11 p.m. 
ET, will provide a substantive alternative to the ``body bag'' 
journalism of late-night local news programs.

<HEADLINE> Pilots Warned About MD-80 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One major airline has reminded its pilots they  
can turn up the automatic brakes on MD-80 aircraft, a reminder that 
came after a number of them overshot runways. 
</P>
<P>
	One such model, an American Airlines MD-82, crashed and ran off  
the runway in Little Rock, Ark., on Tuesday, killing nine people. 
The cause remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines, which flies 120 custom versions of the MD-80,  
the MD-88, recently instituted new procedures in which both members 
of the two-person flight crew must ensure that the spoilers are 
armed before touchdown. Spoilers, which pop up from the wing, 
disrupt air flow and slow a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delta captain, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
procedure was instituted because it's hard to tell whether the 
spoiler lever is armed or in the stowed position. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the airline reminded its pilots that the autobrake switch  
has a ``maximum'' position and pilots shouldn't be afraid to use 
that highest setting if there is the slightest doubt. Autobrakes 
slow a plane evenly and are used on most landings. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots are often reluctant to use the maximum setting because it  
slows a plane rapidly, which can alarm passengers. The switch is 
usually positioned to ``light'' or ``medium'' unless it's raining. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always the pilot's decision, but they've been pushing the  
use of max autobrakes when landing,'' the captain said. ``They 
basically say, `You have all these tools available. It's better to 
use what you've got than to explain it before the'' federal 
transportation regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-80 series, which includes the MD-81, -82, -83, -87 and  
-88, was designed by McDonnell Douglas, which was bought in 1997 by 
the Boeing Co. Spokesman John Thom said he had not heard of any 
problems with the planes overshooting runways, and only nine of 
1,167 delivered have been lost in accidents, including the American 
Airlines plane in Tuesday night's incident. 
</P>
<P>
	A Delta spokeswoman did not immediately return a call seeking  
comment on the new procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta captain said there is nothing inherently wrong with  
the MD-80 series, which he has flown for several years. However, 
because the plane is a smaller aircraft used on short to medium 
routes, many airlines use them for the first assignment they give 
their new captains. 
</P>
<P>
	Paired with a more junior pilot, ``that means less experience in  
the cockpit,'' the captain said. 
</P>
<P>
	That can be particularly troublesome in bad weather, which has  
been a factor in many of the MD-80 overshoots. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 15, a Korean Air plane skidded off a runway while  
landing in Pohang, South Korea, during a heavy rain. On Dec. 24, a 
Delta plane skidded off a snow-covered runway in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1996, planes owned by Delta and American skidded off  
snow-covered runways in Cleveland on consecutive days.

<HEADLINE> Malone Wins Bittersweet MVP Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- This wasn't the trophy Karl Malone hoped  
to be holding at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Malone wasn't even holding the Maurice Podoloff Trophy  
Thursday after winning his second NBA Most Valuable Player award in 
three years. It's still in New York, where Malone is expected to 
pick it up over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``So they got me a hat,'' he said bemusedly, while looking at an  
``MVP'' cap sent to him by the league office. ``They said FedExing 
it (the trophy) was out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was that kind of season for the 35-year-old Malone, another  
banner individual year marred by setbacks in other areas, notably 
Utah's failure to win its first title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we were here in a different scenario, but we're not,''  
Malone said. ``Last time when I won this award, I went out on the 
court, held it up and then had to go back to playing ball. ... I 
prefer doing that to doing this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite posting his lowest scoring and rebounding numbers in  
over a decade, he edged fellow big men Alonzo Mourning of Miami and 
Tim Duncan of San Antonio in the voting by 118 North American media 
members. Malone received 827 points and 44 first-place votes to 
Mourning's 773 points and 36 first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, who also won the award in 1997, became the ninth player  
in league history to win the MVP award twice. It comes at the 
conclusion of a 12-month span in which Malone wrestled Dennis 
Rodman on pay-per-view, started a short-lived talk radio show, 
vowed to never again play for the Jazz and then returned, all but 
promising to finish his career in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	He then led the Jazz to a league-best 37-13 record, but his team  
sputtered down the stretch and was eliminated from the playoffs in 
the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers, Utah's earliest 
exit since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole year was weird, so to top it off with this was  
really special,'' Malone said. ``I didn't like the way I played in 
the playoffs, but I'm getting the award Saturday, and I'm not 
giving it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone is the first MVP in nine seasons to fail to take his team  
to at least the conference finals. Magic Johnson's Los Angeles 
Lakers also were upset in the second round of the playoffs in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individual awards are nice because they come with the  
territory, but you play this game for a championship,'' Malone 
said. ``Everybody knows we're disappointed with what happened, but 
this could start the healing process on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, the second-year big man many thought deserved the award  
after a tremendous late-season surge, finished third in the voting 
with 740 points and 30 first-place votes. Philadelphia's Allen 
Iverson finished fourth, followed by Phoenix's Jason Kidd, the 
Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and Sacramento's Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone grinned when asked if he would trade the MVP trophy for a  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, because I have another one,'' he said. ``I'd trade the  
one from '97. This one is different, but it's still bigger for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone also was chosen by the league's coaches for the  
all-defensive first team, was third in the league in scoring, 11th 
in field goal percentage (.493) and 14th in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	His first MVP award, for which he beat out Michael Jordan, was  
considered by many to be a lifetime achievement award for a 
brilliant career. Jordan then led his Bulls to the first of two NBA 
Finals wins over the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have people talking about this one, too,''  
Malone said. ``Some guys in the last couple of weeks have been 
taking their shots, but they're going to have to swallow really 
hard now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone averaged 23.8 points per game in 1999, his lowest since  
1986-87, his second year in the league. His rebounding average was 
down to 9.4 per game, lowest since his rookie year in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	But Malone almost always came through for the Jazz during the  
regular season, when they tied the Spurs for the league's best 
record. He led Utah in scoring for the 13th straight year and 
continued to be the Jazz's focal point on both offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In one memorable week in April, Malone went 12-for-12 from the  
field in a victory over the Lakers, scored a season-high 38 points 
in beating Golden State and hit three free throws with six-tenths 
of a second left to beat Phoenix by a point. His coach, Jerry 
Sloan, called it the finest week of Malone's career. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone is now a free agent, though he said Thursday that ``I'd  
probably bet the ranch'' he wouldn't consider offers from other 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not interesting in dealing with that right now,'' he said.  
``I've cleared my schedule, and I'm going to relax.''

<HEADLINE>  Jones and Johnson To Square Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. saw this fight coming almost  
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew when Reggie Johnson moved in with him and his father and  
began training with Roy Jones that the boxers were on a collision 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``What my father didn't understand was that it was inevitable  
that we would one day meet in the ring,'' Jones said Thursday. ``I 
knew it right away. I knew we were both headed for the championship 
and we'd have to settle it between us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Jones, who holds the WBC and WBA light  
heavyweight championships, and Johnson, the IBF titleholder, will 
unify the title for the first time in 14 years. The last time there 
was an undisputed champion was in 1985, when Michael Spinks held 
the titles. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters have a tempestuous history. Both trained with the  
elder Jones in 1991 and even sparred against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had been trained by his father throughout his amateur and  
early pro career. But he called his father's decision to bring 
Johnson into his training program the final straw that broke their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wanted to bring someone in to get me ready for the race,  
it shouldn't have been the horse I was going to have to run 
against,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Father and son had a bitter split, not even speaking to each  
other for years. Although they have since reconciled and now talk, 
Jones said many of their ties remain broken. He doesn't blame 
Johnson, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all. We both have a lot of respect for each other,''  
Jones said. ``There aren't going to be any mind games or any other 
kind of games. There's just going to be some big boxing. This is 
going to be the real deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 30, is 39-1 as a professional, with 33 knockouts. He has  
successfully defended his WBC title three times, the WBC 
championship once. He won his last fight by stopping New York City 
policeman Rick Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 32, is 39-5-1 with 24 KOs. He is 7-4 in championship  
fights, with all his losses in close, disputed decisions. His last 
fight was Feb. 27 when he took a 12-round unanimous decision 
against top-ranked contender Will Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be the toughest fight of my life,'' Johnson  
said. ``I have a lot of respect for Roy. I know how tough he is, 
how good he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscing about their days as sparring partners, Jones said he  
remembered the damage Johnson could do with either hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very heavyhanded, knockout power in either hand,''  
Jones said. ``He's a big puncher, a good defensive fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Jones was a guy who could hurt you fast and often.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has extremely fast hands, he's very smart,'' Johnson said.  
``He's a little flashier than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other title fights are on Saturday night's card. IBF  
cruiserweight champion Arthur Williams will make his first defense 
against Vasilly Jirov, the fourth-ranked challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	IBF lightweight champion Roberto Garcia will defend against No.  
2 Derrick Gainer. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO will broadcast the fights.

<HEADLINE>  Daly Withdraws After Six-Putt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- John Daly wasn't having a good day before he  
got to the 18th hole in the opening round of the Memorial 
Tournament on Thursday. Then it got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The last hole proved to be his last hole as he withdrew after a  
six-putt 10 for an 82 on the 444-yard, par-4 hole. It was the 
highest score on the hole in the tournament's 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly was 4-over on the round as he stood over an uphill 8-foot  
par putt at the finishing hole. 
</P>
<P>
	He rolled the ball 2 feet past the cup, then quickly stroked the  
comeback putt 4 feet down the hill. He again putted quickly, 
pushing his uphill putt a couple of feet past the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	On his fourth putt, he took a stab at the ball even as he kicked  
at it. He finally two-putted from 5 feet for his 10. 
</P>
<P>
	After his playing partners finished, he walked off the green and  
between the ropes leading to the scorer's tent. He was handed a hat 
to autograph and after signing it, he threw the hat over his head 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly then withdrew from the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Tempo Key to Avalanche-Stars Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- They've been skating since last fall in hopes of  
winning the Stanley Cup, knowing all along they were talented 
enough to be hockey's best team, and realizing that talent alone 
isn't always enough. 
</P>
<P>
	They've endured all the practices, road trips, slumps, injuries  
and everything else that happens over an 82-game regular season and 
three rounds of the playoffs to get to a game like this one. 
</P>
<P>
	For either the Dallas Stars or the Colorado Avalanche, it'll all  
be worth it after tonight's seventh game of the Western Conference 
finals, which will send the winner into the Stanley Cup finals 
against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	For the loser, it'll all seem like such a waste.  
</P>
<P>
	``Failure is a tough word, but I think both teams would be  
disappointed if they fail to win,'' said Dallas' Mike Keane, who 
knows how Colorado feels because he was on the 1996 Avalanche team 
that won the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``You only get so many opportunities to get this far. Sometimes  
you take it for granted and say, `Well, I'll be back next year,' 
and it doesn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To understand what is on the line in the next 60 minutes, these  
teams play, consider what it took to reach this point. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing to Detroit in the conference finals last year, the  
Stars' front office decided the team was a scorer away from the 
finals. So as soon as the free-agent period began, they gave Brett 
Hull a $17.5 million, three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas responded with all sorts of team records in the regular  
season while winning the Presidents' Trophy for the best record for 
the second straight year. The Stars won their first six playoff 
games, lost two, then bounced back with two more to reach this 
round. They reached this game by staving off elimination in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to get to the Stanley Cup finals. We're one game  
away,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've at least given ourselves the chance to know that if we  
win the game, then our goal of getting to the Stanley Cup finals 
has been reached,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``That's what 
we set out to do in September and now we have a chance to look it 
in the eye and realize that dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's past nine months have been just as eventful.  
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche endured a horrendous start to the season,  
recovered nicely, then won the sweepstakes for Theo Fleury to add 
even more punch to their already powerful offense. 
</P>
<P>
	They got the No. 2 seed in the West, but started the postseason  
on the road because of the Columbine High School tragedy. That 
series went six games, then Colorado lost two home games to 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Avalanche swept the next four games against the two-time  
defending Cup winners, with three of the wins on the road. The 
Avalanche came to Dallas and ended the Stars' home winning streak 
with their seventh straight road win. They go into Game 7 8-1 away 
from Denver, where they're a lowly 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the start of the playoffs, we all knew what our ultimate  
goal was,'' Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said. ``Today, that 
ultimate goal is no different. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now there are 24 teams watching.''

	Yugoslavia Accepts Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Caving in to Russian and Western  
demands, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted a peace 
plan for Kosovo today that is designed to end his mass expulsions 
of ethnic Albanians and 11 weeks of NATO airstrikes. Even though 
the draft appeared to signal a victory for NATO, President Clinton 
and other U.S. officials reacted cautiously, waiting for signs that 
Milosevic would begin pulling his troops out and allow the return 
of more than 855,000 refugees. Clinton said NATO airstrikes would 
continue until Milosevic produced ``real results.''

	Conflict Gives Raytheon Big Contracts

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The missiles and bombs raining down on Serb forces  
in Yugoslavia could add up to big money for the Raytheon Co., whose 
officials estimate they could gain about $1 billion in new 
contracts to replace munitions used in the Balkans. While 10-figure 
defense outlays are nothing new in the United States, Raytheon's 
direct link between military action and possible revenues cast the 
Kosovo conflict in a new economic light.

getting the place ready for its first permanent residents next 
year. The connecting latches popped open, upon command, as the two 
spacecraft soared above Mongolia. Discovery was linked to the space 
station for six days. The astronauts have one last job before they 
return to Earth early Sunday: They will release a mirror-studded 
satellite on Saturday that students around the world will track as

Senate campaign in New York next year, a top adviser said today. 
She would be the first sitting first lady to run for public office. 
Harold Ickes, who is heading Mrs. Clinton's political operation, 
disclosed her plans after Rep. Nita Lowey said, in a telephone call 
to the first lady, that she would seek re-election to the House. 
That leaves the Democratic Senate field clear for Mrs. Clinton.

he brought the plane in for a landing, a federal investigator said 
today. Investigators are analyzing the conversation between the 
tower and the pilot, information from the plane's flight data

Flight 1420 skidded off the runway at the Little Rock airport,

Police arrested the gunman in the parking lot after talking him out 
of killing himself. Officers were alerted by a 911 call from inside 
the Albertsons supermarket as shots were being fired. They 
confronted a man with a goatee and shaved head who walked out the 
door with a shotgun. The victims were all shot at point-blank 
range, Officer Steve Meriwether said.

ties between the United States and the island nation in the areas 
of public health and drug interdiction. ``It's important that 
people like me in the U.S. Senate know what is going on in Cuba,''

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Leader Pleads to Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A civil rights leader who helped blacks  
gain voting rights and get elected to offices in Alabama was 
sentenced to six months in federal prison for vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiver Gordon, 59, who lost his post as a Eutaw City Councilman  
after pleading guilty in the federal vote fraud case, also was 
fined $2,000 on Wednesday and required to serve three years on 
supervised probation when he leaves prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Gordon was a field lieutenant in the state for the  
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the fight for voting rights. Gordon 
is one of six Greene County residents, including County Commission 
Chairman Garria Spencer, who pleaded guilty to vote fraud charges 
stemming from the 1994 general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, a Southern Christian Leadership Conference vice  
president, admitted that he solicited a person who lived outside of 
Greene County to fill out an absentee ballot and list a Greene 
County address on it.

<HEADLINE>  Chinese Police Detain Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police detained dissidents, closely  
watched others and reportedly broke up one attempt at public 
mourning today, the 10th anniversary of the night soldiers shot 
their way into Beijing to end democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
	The entirely state-controlled media made no mention of the  
sensitive anniversary. Families of people killed in the military 
assault planned private memorials at home, despite the presence of 
plainclothes security agents outside their doors. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 people, some wearing the white flowers that are a sign  
of mourning, gathered in a park in the eastern city of Hangzhou to 
remember the crackdown's victims, the Hong Kong-based Information 
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Plainclothes police broke up the gathering, beat one 70-year-old  
man who resisted and took him and two others away, the group said. 
Police refused to confirm the incident. But in recent days, 
repression against dissidents has increased, especially in 
Hangzhou, a center for democracy campaigners who have tried to 
organize an opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, authorities have questioned nearly 100 activists and  
warned them against holding memorials and have detained at least 
34, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among six people held Wednesday was Peng Cheng, a construction  
company manager recently fired for collecting 190 names on a 
petition demanding the government stop condemning the 1989 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	After seven weeks of demonstrations that brought 1 million  
people to Tiananmen Square, soldiers swept through Beijing late on 
June 3, 1989, to dislodge the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	By the dawn of June 4, soldiers and tanks reached the square,  
killing hundreds on the way. The true number of casualties is not 
known. The communist government has never given a credible account. 
</P>
<P>
	Police go on heightened alert every year as the anniversary  
approaches. This year, authorities fear dissidents could exploit 
public discontent over unemployment and corruption. State-run media 
this week have reiterated President Jiang Zemin's call for 
``stability above all else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dissidents have called on ordinary Chinese to wear plain  
clothing, light candles and perform other minor acts to commemorate 
the victims of the military assault. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hangzhou, five activists who tried to donate blood as a  
memorial gesture were turned away because the blood center did not 
want to take part in a political act, the South China Morning Post 
in Hong Kong reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Two police sat in chairs near the entrance to the Beijing  
apartment of Ding Zilin and Jiang Peikun, retired professors whose 
17-year-old son was killed in the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors were turned away and their phone line was cut, said Su  
Bingxian, a woman whose 21-year-old son was shot to death in the 
assault. All three parents have urged the government to re-examiner 
the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ding and Jiang traditionally have marked the night quietly at  
home by cooking their son's favorite dinner. Ms. Su said she and 
her other children would light candles in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiananmen Square, a broad concrete expanse in the heart of the  
city, was quiet today. It is being resurfaced and is blocked off by 
a wall of corrugated metal. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao accused some Western  
media for using the anniversary to spread ``anti-China 
propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the political turmoil which took place in 1989, some of the  
anti-Chinese forces played an inglorious role. They did not have 
their way, and they will not have their way now,'' Zhu said at a 
routine briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Police ordered hotels, offices and apartment buildings allowed  
to receive CNN in Beijing to stop carrying the cable broadcasts 
until June 8 because of reports about the anniversary. In Shanghai, 
some foreign newspapers delivered to hotels had articles and 
pictures snipped out.

<HEADLINE> Illnois School District in Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Ill. (AP) -- When teachers complain about outrageous  
behavior, they're often talking about their students. In Venice, 
they're talking about their boss. 
</P>
<P>
	Since taking over last fall, Superintendent James Doughty has  
been sued for harassment, chastised for locking out students, 
charged with illegally withholding teachers' paychecks and accused 
of pressuring a principal to give bad evaluations to union 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, police were called to a raucous school board meeting  
in this small community northeast of St. Louis to escort the 
superintendent to his car as angry parents shouted ``Doughty's got 
to go!'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this in a district that ranks near the bottom of Illinois  
schools in student achievement, and where teachers say some 
classrooms went without books all year despite state funds to help 
troubled schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Doughty ``needs to go,'' said Ann Mullins, an elementary school  
teacher in Venice. ``There's nothing this district can do as long 
as he's here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doughty has declined repeatedly to comment on the allegations.  
In March, he said the controversy doesn't mean he lacks community 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations against Doughty continued to build on Wednesday when  
the school board learned about dozens of union grievances filed 
since he took office. They include accusations that Doughty has 
refused to meet with union leaders over labor complaints and has 
improperly laid off, demoted and transferred employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still in awe,'' school board Vice President Metro Pierson  
after reviewing the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Doughty was criticized for locking out high school  
students who staged a walkout to protest the suspension of a 
popular principal. Doughty had punished the principal for missing a 
bathroom inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Madison County prosecutors filed misdemeanor charges  
against Doughty, accusing him of illegally withholding the 
paychecks of five teachers who failed to check in with him 
following an education conference. 
</P>
<P>
	And last week, Venice Elementary School Principal Rachelle Artis  
wrote school board members alleging Doughty pressured her to file 
negative evaluations of three teachers who serve on the board of 
the teacher's union. 
</P>
<P>
	School board member Tyrone Echols said he will work to close a  
split in the board that has produced a narrow majority in favor of 
Doughty throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board needs to come together and realize he is destructive  
to our community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tears Shed for Fenway Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The late A. Bartlett Giamatti once compared Fenway  
Park to Mount Olympus, the pyramids at Giza and the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Except ... it was better than all those inconsequential  
places,'' wrote the scholar-turned-baseball commissioner who, like 
many American intellectuals, was given to poetry and hyperbole 
about Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenway and Tiger Stadium are the oldest ballparks in the majors,  
having officially opened on the same day, April 20, 1912. Fenway is 
also the smallest, with 33,871 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Old and small, however, do not add up to major league profits.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox want a bigger park across Yawkey Way, inspiring an  
outpouring of opposition, nostalgia and, surprisingly, even support 
from some of Fenway's most faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever tears I've had for Fenway, I've long since shed,''  
said Roger Angell, an editor at the New Yorker who wrote the 
classic baseball book, ``The Summer Game.'' ``We can let some of 
these parks go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly the most treasured features of the park that writer  
John Updike once called a ``lyric little bandbox'' would be missed. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Boston Herald poll showed 49 percent of Massachusetts  
voters don't want to let go of Fenway's beloved nooks and crannies, 
its hand-operated scoreboard, the outfield bullpens where Ted 
Williams used to crack homers and the Green Monster, a 37-foot-high 
wall listed as only 315 tantalizing feet from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fenway's awesome,'' said David Doucette, a 28-year-old  
corporate banker during a cigarette break Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the old Fenway just like I liked the old Garden,'' he  
said, referring to the Boston Garden. The home of the Celtics and 
Bruins finally was torn down last year after a larger arena was 
built next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 31 percent of those polled supported tearing down the  
park, which was featured in the 1989 film, ``Field of Dreams.'' 
They'd like to get rid of the narrow seats, the obstructed views 
and the puddles of standing water when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time they did it,'' said Pedro Martinez, the team's  
Cy Young award winner. ``It's like an old man who passes away. You 
have to let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox say they need the revenue from a bigger park if  
they're ever to win a World Series, a prize that has eluded them 
since 1918. Boston, it is said, has been cursed ever since selling 
Babe Ruth to the hated New York Yankees after the 1919 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should, with that treacly `baseball is life' stuff,  
convince you otherwise,'' said filmmaker Ken Burns, a Fenway fan 
who chronicled baseball's history in a nine-part public TV series. 
``I believe baseball is life, but life is profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People actually opposed Fenway when it was built in 1912 because  
the flavor of the game would be lost without the old wooden 
grandstands, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox plan is to build a ballpark that's 35 percent bigger  
than the house that Ruth left, but -- like Baltimore's Camden Yards 
and Cleveland's Jacobs Field -- one that retains the intimacy and 
charm of older ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the Kenmore Square neighborhood that defines the  
park's quirky geometry also agree the Red Sox need a better home 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	But the neighbors, many of whom work or study at nearby colleges  
and hospitals, object mightily to the team's plans to move home 
plate 206 yards to the southwest, destroying 24 buildings in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that this new megaplex belongs in this area at  
all,'' said Stephen M. Mindich, chairman of the Phoenix Media Group 
and owner of several buildings the Red Sox want the city to take by 
eminent domain. ``It's just wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A neighborhood group called Save Fenway Park! hired an architect  
to draw up plans to renovate the ballpark by adding seats, luxury 
boxes and concession areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox officials, along with commissioner Bud Selig, have said  
saving the park is not feasible. The team has carefully cultivated 
the state's most powerful politicians, who may be asked for up to 
$200 million in assistance to buy land and build infrastructure to 
support the projected $350 million park. 
</P>
<P>
	But the preservationists are also wooing key lawmakers, who say  
they're open to saving Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate will likely intensify during the days leading up its  
starring role in the All-Star game on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox best-case scenario has a new park opening in 2003,  
but Dan Shaughnessy, The Boston Globe columnist who wrote two books 
about Fenway, thinks it will take at least five more years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like it to be forever, but I understand the reality,''  
Shaughnessy said. ``We could all be dead by the time this is 
done.''

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Lawmakers Void Gun Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A bill intended to thwart New Orleans'  
landmark lawsuit against gun manufacturers awaits the approval of 
Gov. Mike Foster, who promised to sign it into law ``as soon as it 
hits my desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with all the national gun legislation is that it  
won't stop violence,'' Foster said Thursday. ``The way to stop 
violence is to put people in jail who use guns. There's just not 
enough prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which passed the state Senate on Wednesday night  
without a dissenting vote, would prevent Louisiana cities from 
suing the gun industry for the costs of violent crime and 
accidental shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has a retroactive clause designed to nullify the  
first-in-the-nation suit filed last fall by New Orleans, which 
claimed that gun makers should be held responsible for making a 
product without adequate safety devices. Other cities -- including 
Boston on Thursday -- followed with similar suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Marc Morial said New Orleans would proceed with its suit  
and challenge the law in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Louisiana Legislature has taken a giant leap backwards by  
passing an ill-advised, unconstitutional law that is nothing but a 
sad sellout to the money and power of the gun lobby,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Church, associate professor at Louisiana State University  
Law Center, said the major legal question in the bill is whether it 
can be applied to a suit already filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia adopted a similar law in February after heavy lobbying  
from the National Rifle Association. NRA President Charlton Heston 
had dropped by the Louisiana Capitol to support the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the people who lobbied against the bill was Wilma  
Williams, whose 13-year-old son, Webster, accidentally shot himself 
to death in 1997 while he and his cousin were playing with a gun 
they didn't realize was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``No money can replace Webster, but it will draw attention to  
the fact that guns need to be made safer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by Boston on Thursday seeks $100 million from  
31 firearms companies to cover the costs of police, fire and 
medical expenses, as well as declines in real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
	The city accuses the gun industry of creating a public nuisance,  
negligent distribution and marketing, and failing to warn of the 
dangers of guns. The lawsuit also claims gun makers have failed to 
incorporate safety devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``These lawsuits, they have no merit,'' said Travis Hall, a  
spokesman for defendant Browning Arms Corp. ``Our industry is one 
of the most prohibited and monitored industries there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston is the 20th city to file suit against the gun industry.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Can't Work During Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Illegal immigrants can't work while they  
appeal their deportation orders, according to a federal appeals 
court that oversees nine Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday overturned a  
federal judge's injunction that entitled 19 immigrants to keep 
their work permits pending court appeals of their deportations. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1986 law entitles illegal immigrants appealing deportation  
orders to have work permits if their applications are 
``non-frivolous.'' The law specified that the permits would be 
valid until a final determination of their status. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service interpreted the law  
to mean it was required to provide work permits only until its own 
``final determination'' of applications, leaving immigrants 
ineligible to work legally while awaiting court review. 
</P>
<P>
	Reasoning that a ``final determination'' includes a judicial  
review, U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins of San Francisco last 
year prohibited the government from revoking the permits until the 
workers had lost their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a 3-0 ruling, the appeals court said Congress had  
consistently used the term ``final determination'' in immigration 
laws to refer to INS actions, not court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ruling had been upheld, it could have affected thousands  
of immigrants nationwide, said Jonathan Kaufman, lawyer for the 
immigrants in the suit. He said judicial review of deportation 
orders can take up to six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who have no employment authorization have to work  
illegally,'' Kaufman said. ``Obviously that leaves them open to all 
kinds of exploitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said making things difficult for illegal immigrants  
was one of the specific goals of the 1986 law.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Reporters Ordered Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge ruled Thursday that two reporters for The  
Atlanta Journal-Constitution are in contempt of court and ordered 
them jailed for refusing to disclose sources for stories about 
former Olympic bombing suspect Richard Jewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulton County Judge John Mather's order to jail Kathy Scruggs  
and Ron Martz was stayed indefinitely when the newspaper 
immediately filed its intent to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell, who was working as a security guard at the 1996 Atlanta  
Olympics, is suing the Journal-Constitution for libel. He was 
identified as a suspect in the fatal bombing in Centennial Olympic 
Park, but was eventually cleared by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims he was libeled ``in a series of false and defamatory  
articles which portrayed him as an individual with a bizarre 
employment history and an aberrant personality who was likely 
guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ruled last year that reporters are not legally  
protected from naming their sources when the reporters are parties 
to a lawsuit or criminal case. In an order on March 16, the judge 
gave the reporters 60 days to disclose their sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court has shown defendants considerable patience, but  
there arrives a point at which the authority of the court and 
respect for the commands of that court must be vindicated,'' Mather 
wrote in Thursday's order. 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered the reporters jailed for civil contempt until they  
disclose their confidential sources. Editor Ron Martin pledged the 
newspaper would challenge the order. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really an important issue for us,'' Martin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's attorney, Peter Canfield, has said the reporting  
was accurate. He has asked the judge to dismiss the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell attorney Lin Wood praised the order as ``clearly a  
significant victory for Richard Jewell in his continued pursuit of 
the truth from the Journal-Constitution and its reporters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said Jewell recently started his own security firm and also  
serves as a fishing guide.

<HEADLINE> DC To Get Alexander Pushkin Statue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A monument to Alexander Pushkin, sometimes  
called the Russian Shakespeare, will go up this year on the campus 
of George Washington University in celebration of the 200th 
anniversary of his birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking in front of the university library is set for  
Friday, two days before Pushkin's actual birthday. The monument, a 
statue of the poet in a frock coat and elaborate neckcloth, will be 
more than 11 feet high and will include an image of Pegasus, the 
winged horse symbolic of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having the statue may be more important for Russia than the  
next loan from the World Bank,'' said sculptor Alexander Burganov. 
He spoke to a small group representing the university and the 
American-Russian Cultural Cooperation Foundation, headed by former 
Rep. James Symington, D-Mo, chief of protocol in President Lyndon 
Johnson's White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Burganov is also doing a figure of the poet for the front of the  
Pushkin House on the Arbat, Moscow's broad pedestrian avenue. 
Pushkin died in 1837 from a wound in a duel brought on by rumors 
that his wife Natalya was unfaithful. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-time official in the czar's foreign ministry, Pushkin was  
frequently in trouble with Russian authorities for his democratic 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Rollberg, who teaches Slavic languages at the university,  
said Pushkin is known more for his poetry and stories than for his 
one big drama, ``Boris Godunov,'' which has become a standard of 
the opera repertory. He said Pushkin was largely responsible for 
transforming the Russian language into the eloquent medium it has 
become for poets and novelists of the past 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
	His novel in verse, ``Eugene Onegin,'' has been translated in  
English repeatedly and also has been made into an opera. Its witty, 
dramatic style owes much to the English poet Lord Byron, some of 
whose work Pushkin translated into Russian. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian empire of Pushkin's time is already represented  
among Washington's memorials by a statue of the poet Taras 
Shevchenko. His place in the literature of the Ukrainian language 
is similar to Pushkin's in Russian.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Rampage Leaves Four Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man dressed in camouflage blasted away with a  
pump-action shotgun as he roamed through a supermarket before 
sunrise Thursday, killing four employees and critically wounding 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the gunman in the parking lot after talking him  
out of killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were alerted by a 911 call from inside the Albertsons  
supermarket as shots were being fired. They confronted a man with a 
goatee and shaved head who walked out the door with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He placed the gun to his head and officers were able to talk  
him into surrendering,'' Lt. Rick Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were all shot at point-blank range, Officer Steve  
Meriwether said. Some were chased. 
</P>
<P>
	Zane Floyd, 23, who was honorably discharged from the Marines at  
Camp Pendleton, Calif., last July, was arrested for investigation 
of murder. He worked as a security guard and part-time as a bouncer 
at a bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were baffled as to what triggered the rampage,  
Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not found any connection between Floyd and the  
victims -- three men and a woman -- and there was no indication he 
had had any run-ins at the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was fired by Affirmative Security on May 14. Owner Laura  
Sellers said Floyd started missing shifts and acting differently 
after a while, but added ``there was not one incident of 
aggression, violence or abrupt behavior ... We're not looking at a 
bad boy or someone who would go insane at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't pick up his belongings and final paycheck until  
Wednesday night, Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was agitated last night, a little bit more sarcastic,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the gunman had an accomplice, police took at least three  
hours to search and clear the store, finding two employees hiding 
in a walk-in vegetable cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five people, including 14 employees, were in the  
42,000-square foot store when the 911 call was made to police at 
5:16 a.m., Clark County Sheriff Jerry Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were people hiding throughout the store in various  
locations,'' Meriwether said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Floyd moved from an apartment into a guest house  
behind his parents' home just two blocks from the supermarket, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all they talked about is when he would be coming home  
from leave. They did everything they could for him,'' said neighbor 
Cathy Downey. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd served four years in the Marines. After the Marines, he  
started college but dropped out, Downey said. Floyd had worked one 
day a week for the past month at Sneakers, a sports bar in Las 
Vegas, said bar manager Tom Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a regular 23-year-old guy who likes to party and hang out  
just like me. I don't understand what happened,'' said Tony 
Marquez, a fellow bouncer.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Rampage Leaves Four Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man dressed in camouflage blasted away with a  
pump-action shotgun as he roamed through a supermarket before 
sunrise Thursday, killing four employees and critically wounding 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the gunman in the parking lot after talking him  
out of killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were alerted by a 911 call from inside the Albertsons  
supermarket as shots were being fired. They confronted a man with a 
goatee and shaved head who walked out the door with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He placed the gun to his head and officers were able to talk  
him into surrendering,'' Lt. Rick Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were all shot at point-blank range, Officer Steve  
Meriwether said. Some were chased. 
</P>
<P>
	Zane Floyd, 23, who was honorably discharged from the Marine at  
Camp Pendleton, Calif., last July, was arrested for investigation 
of murder. He worked as a security guard and part-time as a bouncer 
at a bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were baffled as to what triggered the rampage,  
Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not found any connection between Floyd and the  
victims -- three men and a woman -- and there was no indication he 
had had any run-ins at the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was fired by Affirmative Security on May 14, but he didn't  
pick up his belongings and final paycheck until Wednesday night, 
said Laura Sellers, who has owned the security firm for more than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was agitated last night, a little bit more sarcastic,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she could not discuss the reasons he was fired, but  
``there was not one incident of aggression, violence or abrupt 
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the gunman had an accomplice, police took at least three  
hours to search and clear the store, finding two employees hiding 
in a walk-in vegetable cooler. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five people, including 14 employees, were in the  
42,000-square foot store when the 911 call was made to police at 
5:16 a.m., Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were people hiding throughout the store in various  
locations,'' Meriwether said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Floyd moved from an apartment into a guest house  
behind his parents' home just two blocks from the supermarket, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all they talked about is when he would be coming home  
from leave. They did everything they could for him,'' said neighbor 
Cathy Downey. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd served four years in the Marines. After the Marines, he  
started college but dropped out, Downey said. Floyd had worked one 
day a week for the past month at Sneakers, a sports bar in Las 
Vegas, said bar manager Tom Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a regular 23-year-old guy who likes to party and hang out  
just like me. I don't understand what happened,'' said Tony 
Marquez, a fellow bouncer.

<HEADLINE>  NTSB Says Doomed Jet Was Briefed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The flight data recorder on American  
Airlines Flight 1420 showed the wing flaps that slow the plane on 
landing did not deploy before it skidded off a runway in a 
hailstorm and crashed, investigators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The data recorder also showed that the reverse thrusters turned  
on and off rather than remaining engaged throughout the landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators do not know if the departure from the typical  
landing routine was done on purpose by the pilot, or if the plane 
had mechanical problems before the Tuesday night crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet turned on the runway and broke into three pieces when it  
hit a steel walkway, killing nine people including the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the pilot was warned twice about dangerous  
wind shear and received more notice than usual of bad conditions as 
he brought the plane in for a landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the most interesting thing was the repeated cycling  
of the thrusters. But ``it could be that the only person who knows 
the answer to that question is no longer with us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a typical landing, the flaps open and the thrust reversers  
are turned on to slow down the plane. In this case, the data 
recorder showed that the flaps did not deploy, said George Black, a 
member of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The data recorder showed that the thrust reversers cycled on and  
off twice, and then eight seconds before the end of the recording, 
while the engine was near idling, the left thrust reverser deployed 
and the right did not, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was not clear whether that irregularities were  
accidental or intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm with hail, lightning and gusts of 75 mph hit the area  
just minutes before the plane made a bouncy landing. The jet had 
been directed to land from the north because the airport was 
reporting southerly winds as the plane neared. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the fierce storm moved in from the northwest, the pilot  
was ordered to approach from the southwest instead. 
</P>
<P>
	During the approach, air traffic controllers relayed regular  
updates, Black said. Many came less than a minute apart. The 
warnings included word of wind up to 46 mph and two alarms for wind 
shears, sudden down bursts that can rob a plane of its lift, Black 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the cockpit voice recorder, a pilot commented twice  
that he had lost visual contact with the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of care, we think, by the controller was pretty  
good,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black declined to say how a pilot should react to such  
information, stressing that the decision of whether or not to land 
rests with the pilot. He said that tests on the runway showed it 
had proper grooves to prevent hydroplaning and that tests on the 
tires and a brake showed them to be in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The captain of the jet, Richard Buschmann, had 5,500 hours of  
flight time in the MD-80 series of aircraft, which includes the 
MD-82. His colleagues said Buschmann, who helped supervise 1,800 
pilots in Chicago, had an excellent record and was unlikely to take 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
	When the jet crashed, Buschmann and his crew had been on the job  
for 13 1/2 hours, having flown from Chicago to Salt Lake City and to 
Dallas before Little Rock. The airline's maximum is 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government does not specify a limit for duty time  
but caps pilots' actual flying time at eight hours in a day. They 
also must have eight hours of rest in a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators want to know whether the pilot's decision to land  
was influenced by a desire to end the long day and get the plane to 
its intended airport for the night, to prevent delays the next 
morning. Officials said the plane was not low on fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators planned to interview the injured co-pilot Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Skid marks indicate that the plane touched down 2,000 feet from  
the start of the 7,200-foot runway, which Black said was about the 
proper place to begin a landing. Investigators want to know whether 
the pilot used an anti-skidding mechanism while landing, and 
whether the runway was in good enough condition to reduce slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the plane never seemed to get a grip on the  
rain-slickened runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got worried because I knew we should have been slowing down  
and we weren't,'' Dave Ozmun said. ``I could tell he was trying to 
work the brakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors said that if the plane had not hit the steel  
structure at the end of the runway, it could have gone into the 
Arkansas River. The jet went down a rock embankment and stopped 
just short of the water. 
</P>
<P>
	At the crash site Thursday, investigators peered into the  
plane's broken nose, climbed into an engine that had broken away 
from the jet and walked through the burned, severed shell. Some 
investigators wore biohazard suits to protect them from blood and 
spilled fuel.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Undocks From Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Their supply run to the  
international space station over, Discovery's astronauts enjoyed 
some time off today after the shuttle undocked from the outpost and 
soared away. 
</P>
<P>
	The only job left for the astronauts is the deployment early  
Saturday of a mirror-studded satellite that students worldwide will 
track as part of an education project. Discovery and its crew of 
seven are due home the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle separated from the space station Thursday evening,  
six days after Discovery made the historic first docking with the 
fledgling outpost. The connecting latches popped open upon command 
as the two spacecraft soared above Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
	With pilot Rick Husband at the controls, Discovery took 2 1/2 slow  
laps around the gleaming space station so the crew could photograph 
the exterior. Then Husband fired the engines, and the shuttle flew 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``You all certainly left the international space station in much  
better shape than you found it,'' Mission Control told the 
departing astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
	While the spacecraft were linked, the astronauts transported 2  
tons of supplies to the interior and exterior of the station. They 
also fixed a broken radio, replaced battery packs and installed 
foam insulation to reduce fan noise. 
</P>
<P>
	The work was in preparation for the first permanent station  
residents, who are scheduled to arrive next March for a five-month 
stay. The living quarters for that three-man crew are due in 
November, followed by another shuttle visit a month later to 
deliver additional supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The first station component, the Russian-built Zarya control  
module, was launched in November, followed a month later by the 
second part, the American Unity node. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA estimates 45 launches and more than 160 spacewalks will be  
needed over the next five years to assemble the complex. Once 
completed, the 16-nation outpost will have a mass of 1 million 
pounds, be longer than a football field and house up to seven 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight controllers said the work of Discovery's crew went a long  
way toward preparing the station for a long-term presence in space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space station is not going to be just about those large  
assembly pieces, but it's going to be a lot about supporting a crew 
on orbit,'' Mission Control's Jeff Bantle said. ``This is a mission 
that took a big step in making the station a home.''

<HEADLINE> Four Seasons Wins James Beard Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They have wined and dined world leaders, top  
celebrities and Manhattan's social elite. Now Alex von Bidder and 
Julian Niccolini have their own claim to fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Their restaurant, The Four Seasons, recently won the 1999 James  
Beard Award as the nation's outstanding restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Bidder said winning the award -- the food industry's  
equivalent of the Oscars -- was a ``Roberto Benigni moment,'' with 
Maguy Le Coze of Le Bernardin filling in as Sophia Loren at the 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
	But after 40 years as one of New York's top restaurants, The  
Four Seasons was hardly an underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	The Four Seasons is the only Manhattan restaurant named an  
architectural landmark. And the physical space is as impressive as 
the food prepared by executive chef Christian Albin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grill Room -- where the term ``power lunch'' was born -- is a  
warm, wood-paneled room. In contrast, the Pool Room is elegant and 
tranquil, with a white-marble pool centerpiece beneath a canopy of 
trees that change with the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis called the Four Seasons her  
``cathedral,'' where she could find solace, von Bidder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald and Nancy Reagan are among von Bidder's all-time favorite  
customers. Richard Holbrooke, who is awaiting Senate confirmation 
as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is a familiar 
face. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Bidder said he still can't get used to the idea that  
presidents, first ladies and high-ranking diplomats dine at the 
restaurant when they visit Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there are still some customers that command a second  
glance. 
</P>
<P>
	For Niccolini, it was Sharon Stone.  
</P>
<P>
	Niccolini and von Bidder said they have grown accustomed to the  
attention their restaurant gets in the gossip columns, as well as 
the accolades it receives from the culinary world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're the ultimate New York experience,'' Niccolini  
said. ``Even if people find out about us from Page Six (the New 
York Post's gossip page), they should come. We make an extra effort 
to seat everyone. We're here to take care of customers, whomever 
they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Von Bidder said they have never forgotten that they are in a  
service business. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a notion that a fancy restaurant is automatically  
snobby, but we really see ourselves as here to please,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Niccolini is the showman of the duo, the comic to von Bidder's  
straight man. And it was Niccolini who was carrying the 
medallion-shaped Beard award in his back pocket the day after the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've worked so long together and we complement each other,''  
von Bidder said. ``I have the patience to renegotiate our lease for 
a year and a half. Julian cannot. He thrives on being a 
troublemaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Von Bidder spent an uninterrupted hour with an interviewer  
detailing the restaurant's history. Niccolini greeted and charmed, 
and then was off to a wine tasting -- with the award still in his 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 23 years, we still have fun, and the customers have fun.  
That's the important thing,'' von Bidder said. ``We get a kick out 
of being with customers so long that we become part of their 
families -- through births, weddings and funerals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant's most famous clients are treated like valued  
customers. But they are not catered to with the ``yes, ma'am'' and 
``no, sir'' they hear all day -- and they like it. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the guidance of von Bidder, who joined The Four Seasons in  
1976, and Niccolini, who followed a year later, the restaurant's 
interior has been restored to its original 1959 look, designed by 
Philip Johnson and Mies van der Rohe. The kitchen recently 
underwent an extensive renovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Being the best is a process. Winning the James Beard Award  
doesn't signal that there is no room for improvement, von Bidder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Four Seasons' pledge is ``may we always change,'' allowing  
the restaurant to continually undergo a cycle of renewal that keeps 
it fresh and contemporary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the changes are subtle -- a varied preparation of the  
soft-shell crab special in the springtime or a change in the shade 
of the carpet -- so a customer is never jarred by the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	In honor of the restaurant's 40th anniversary, von Bidder is  
updating ``The Four Seasons: A History of America's Premier 
Restaurant,'' with co-author John Mariani. 
</P>
<P>
	A star-studded birthday bash is planned in June. Seagram  
president and CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Vanity Fair editor Graydon 
Carter are in charge of the guest list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be better than the Oscar party. We'll have big stars  
and good food,'' von Bidder said.

<HEADLINE> Cocoa Up As Producer Selling Slows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cocoa futures prices soared more than 10 percent Thursday on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York as massive producer selling 
began to weaken, signaling supplies may shrink in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain and soybean futures also rose sharply,  
while energy products were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures posted their biggest gains in nearly nine years,  
recovering from recent six-year lows, as cocoa traders and 
exporters reported fewer arrivals of beans at ports in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa grower, in the week ended  
May 30 shipped an estimated 7,540 metric tons, down by nearly half 
the week's previous 14,280 metric tons. Exporters in that country 
said there likely wouldn't be much more to sell from the midyear 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana, another large grower, also is expected to run out of  
shipments soon, providing supply-side relief to a market that has 
been pressured by a bumper world crop and weaker world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers from Russia and Asia have sharply curtailed purchases  
in recent months because of economic problems, while Western 
chocolate makers have been content to sit on the sidelines as they 
waited for prices to reach a bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa for July delivery rose $97, or 10.5 percent, to $1,023 a  
ton 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures rose sharply on the Chicago Board of  
Trade amid forecasts for weather conditions that could reduce this 
year's crop production. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service's latest 10-day forecast calls for  
above-normal temperatures and normal to below-normal rainfall in 
Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather could stress young crops early, and market  
participants are beginning to worry a dry weather pattern in some 
eastern growing states could sharply reduce production on what is 
expected to be bumper acreage. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, substantial rainfall in western growing states such as  
North Dakota and Iowa was keeping farmers from completing final 
planting. Wheat futures in particular benefited from such delays in 
spring wheat plantings, which come as the window of opportunity for 
getting those crops into the ground comes to a close. Wheat also 
gained amid expectations heavy recent rainfall in the Plains may 
have reduced the quality of the winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat rose 7 3/4 cents to $2.61 a bushel; July corn jumped 6 1/2  
cents to $2.23 1/4 a bushel; July oats rose 3 3/4 cents to $1.26 1/4 a 
bushel; July soybeans rose 6 3/4 cents to $4.65 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Unleaded gasoline futures retreated on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after weekly figures showed an unexpected rise in 
inventories -- at a time when they usually begin to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute reported inventories last week  
rose a sharp 2.32 million barrels to 222.27 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	While the figures do not factor in the beginning of the peak  
summer driving period, which began on Memorial Day, investors had 
bet that demand in the week leading up to that period also would be 
higher as Americans geared up to take to the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil was virtually unchanged after inventories showed an  
unexpected decline. 
</P>
<P>
	July unleaded gasoline fell .37 cent to 48.60 cents a gallon;  
July crude rose 9 cents to $16.74 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Fed Has Nest Egg For Any Y2k Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Federal Reserve has stockpiled $200  
billion as a cushion against Year 2000-related hysteria, enough to 
keep the nation's financial system afloat even if every adult in 
the nation withdraws $1,000 at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash stockpile is just one of the many ways in which the Fed  
has prepared for the Year 2000 computer bug, according to Robert T. 
Parry, president of the Fed's San Francisco district, which covers 
nine Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	While short-term, isolated disruptions are possible, Perry said,  
the public should have confidence in that the financial 
infrastructure -- checks, automated tellers, credit and debit cards, 
direct deposits -- will run smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an economist, I deal with probabilities all the time,''  
Perry said at a Commonwealth Club luncheon on Wednesday. ``I think 
the probabilities are very high that on Jan. 1, 2000, nothing very 
unusual is going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem arises from computers that may confuse the year  
2000 for 1900 when the millennium hits. This may happen because 
some older software was designed to recognize only the last two 
digits -- the two zeros in those years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Fed, the threat of Y2K is no small matter. More than $2  
trillion pass through the Fed's banking system each day. A shutdown 
of its network could trigger mass panic and an economic 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	While Y2K experts say that's extremely unlikely, some predict  
that people may make a huge run on banks in the days before the 
millennium, withdrawing billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	About 98 percent of the computer systems in thousands of banks  
that do business with the Fed are Y2K-compliant, and the rest 
should meet federal regulations for Y2K readiness by the end of 
this month, Perry said.

<HEADLINE> Actor Sweetens 'Hurrah at Last' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Laurie, the protagonist and novelist-hero of  
``Hurrah at Last,'' Richard Greenberg's uneven and slightly sour 
new comedy, has done enough suffering for art. 
</P>
<P>
	Show him the money, preferably a nice fat advance for adapting  
one of his less-than best sellers into a film. Laurie would like to 
eat regularly and pay his rent on time. The man could be consumed 
by opportunism. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, Laurie is played by Peter Frechette, an actor of  
uncommon ability at portraying the neurotic -- with a great deal of 
charm. Whenever the production, which the Roundabout Theater 
Company has opened at off-Broadway's Gramercy Theater, threatens to 
turn into a whinefest, Frechette pulls it back from the sobs and 
the self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a savage, bitter man with a lump of coal where my heart  
should be,'' Laurie complains. You don't quite believe him, 
particularly when the playwright gives him some wry, often funny 
observations about the vicissitudes of life. When a friend insists 
money can't buy happiness, Laurie retorts, ``But it upgrades 
despair so beautifully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie certainly has things to worry about. The man is destitute  
and desperate. And physically sick with a mysterious illness. He is 
almost delirious, as he feverishly contemplates the success of his 
relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	There are sister Thea and brother-in-law Eamon who live in an  
expensive loft but still are unhappy. They can't conceive a child, 
a fact that has put a strain on their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	There are Laurie's squabbling parents, an older Jewish couple  
for whom fighting became a way of life. Mom originally is from 
Brooklyn, Dad from the Bronx, and those differences were enough to 
start them battling. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, there is his good friend, Oliver, a fabulously  
successful playwright who has been hired to adapt one of Laurie's 
novels for the movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver is one of those cheerfully intense people, forever  
proclaiming friendship and announcing he would do anything for a 
good buddy -- anything, except tell him how much money he was paid 
for the screenplay of Oliver's book. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenberg seems to believe that telling how much money one makes  
is the last taboo. People will do almost anything else, including 
shedding their clothes, before revealing their finances. In one of 
the play's funniest scenes, Oliver does just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Director David Warren injects a liveliness into ``Hurrah at  
Last,'' even when the dialogue falters. The cast catches his 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Michael Valley is hilariously enthusiastic as the  
excessively devoted Oliver. Kevin O'Rourke and Ileen Getz add some 
warmth and commonsense as the infertile couple. Larry Keith and 
Dori Brenner do well as Laurie's parents, roles that teeter on 
stereotypes. Only the talented and vocally strong Judith Blazer 
seems wasted in the underwritten part of Oliver's Italian wife. 
</P>
<P>
	An inconsistent play, this ``Hurrah at Last.'' Often smart and  
funny, it veers into an anger that often seems as indecisive and 
unhappy as its troubled lead character.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 62.06 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mostly higher on Wall Street today  
as investors turned from the technology stocks that rallied late 
Wednesday to retailers that showed surprising strength in May. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 62.06 at  
10,639.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 5.36 at 1,300.17, and the Nasdaq composite index, 
which is dominated by technology stocks, was down 5.97 at 2,426.44. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow fell 18.37 to 10,577.89, but other market  
indicators rose as investors began seeking bargains after two weeks 
of losses. Technology stocks that have been battered recently were 
snapped up at their new, lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the volatile Internet companies led the technology sector  
right back down. Amazon.com fell 4 1/8 to 108. 
</P>
<P>
	But the broad market rose as new reports indicated the economy  
is faring well enough to entice consumers to spend, but perhaps not 
so well that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates 
to slow growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest retailers were mostly higher after  
reporting stronger-than-expected sales in May. Wal-Mart rose 1 5/16 
to 45 11/16 and Gap Inc. rose 3 11/16 to 66 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also gained support from a Commerce Department report  
that showed orders to American factories for manufactured goods 
fell 1.2 percent. The decline suggested that the nation's economic 
growth may be slowing a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks have been volatile since the Fed served notice last month  
that it is willing to raise interest rates to cool off the booming 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders remain focused on the Friday morning release of the  
Labor Department's unemployment data. The wage component of the 
report is expected to offer a more pointed indication of whether 
inflation has returned to the U.S. economy. A separate report today 
showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment 
benefits rose slightly last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, investors turned to a broad-based range of  
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure looks like rapid sector rotation,'' said Tom Madden,  
chief investment officer for domestic equities at Federated 
Investors of Pittsburgh. ``The market's tone is better, but there's 
no strong conviction for any sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Express, up 1 3/4 at 120 3/16, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up  
1 1/4 at 92 15/16, led the Dow stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron slipped 1/8 to 91 7/8 and Texaco fell 1 13/16 to 62 11/16  
after the companies called off merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 566.3 million 
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.05 at 623.55, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 3.52 at 774.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Market indexes held steady after the New York Stock Exchange  
announced it will not adopt extended trading hours until at least 
2000. The board that governs the Nasdaq Stock Market expects to 
start an extended schedule as soon as September.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Edge Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits edged up slightly last week to the highest 
level in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that 305,000 Americans filed new  
claims for jobless benefits last week, up by 4,000 from the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was unexpected. Most economists had been looking  
for jobless claims to remain unchanged from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which helps  
smooth out week-to-week volatility, also was up, rising to 304,250, 
also the highest level since the week ending May 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the slight increase, the jobless claims applications  
are remaining at low levels, which analysts say depicts an 
extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	The government on Friday will report on unemployment for the  
month of April and many analysts believe the rate will stay at 4.3 
percent, close to a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing has lost more than 400,000 jobs in the past year  
due to the global financial crisis, which has cut into exports and 
increased cheap imports into this country. But the rest of the U.S. 
economy has continued to forge ahead, powered by strong consumer 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said that for the week ending May 22, 32  
states and territories reported declines in jobless claims while 21 
had increases. The state data lags a week behind the national 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the biggest declines in applications for jobless  
benefits were Michigan, down 913; Pennsylvania, down 873; New 
Jersey, down 786; Missouri, down 702, and New York, down 652. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase in claims for the week  
ending May 22 was Mississippi, where claims rose 1,607, an increase 
officials blamed on layoffs in apparel and service industries. 
Other states with large claims increases were Iowa, up 1,277; 
Arkansas, up 1,064; Oregon, up 896, and Florida, up 646.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas' Lister Wins NCAA Long Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- In just his first season at Arkansas, Melvin  
Lister already is following in the tradition of great Razorbacks 
jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like Michael Conley, Robert Howard and Erick Walder in the  
past, Lister waited until his final attempt before securing the 
long jump title in the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to keep it going,'' Lister said of the Arkansas  
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Lister's final jump was not his best, but it proved to  
be the clincher. Going into the final round, Lister and Frankie 
Young of Indiana State had the best jumps of the competition, each 
at 26 feet, 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, however, was leading on the basis of a better second jump  
-- 26-3 1/2 to 26-3. 
</P>
<P>
	With the pressure on, Lister, jumping ahead of Young, leaped  
26-9. Young couldn't match it and Lister was the champion. Since 
1984, the Razorbacks have won eight NCAA long jump titles, 
including three by Walder and two each by Conley and Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	Lister's victory gave Arkansas 10 points in the quest for its  
eighth consecutive team title. 
</P>
<P>
	Lister, a junior who attended Butler County Junior College for  
two years before enrolling at Arkansas, will attempt a horizontal 
jump sweep in Saturday's triple jump. Arkansas athletes have won 11 
triple jump titles since 1984, including three each by Howard and 
Edrick Floreal, two apiece by Conley and Brian Wellman, and one by 
Walder. 
</P>
<P>
	Before being declared the winner, Lister had to wait for Savante  
Stringfellow of Mississippi to take his final three jumps. 
Stringfellow was disqualified after three jumps for unsportsmanlike 
conduct. He appealed, and the Games Committee reinstated him, 
ruling that Stringfellow's second warning did not violate the 
unsportsmanlike conduct rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Lister said it was ``nervewracking'' to wait while Stringfellow  
finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I got the win, though,'' Lister added. ``I knew I had  
to get a big jump (in round six) to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's other winners were Tennessee's Tom Pappas in the  
decathlon with 8,184 points, SMU's Kajsa Bergqvist in the women's 
high jump at 6-2 3/4, UCLA's Seilalu Sua in the women's shot put at 
57-9, and Leigh Daniel of Texas Tech in the women's 10,000 meters 
in 34:01.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Pappas led virtually throughout the decathlon competition,  
despite being hobbled by a tender hamstring and a bruised heel. He 
won four of the 10 events -- the shot put at 50-5 1/2, the high jump at 
7-0 1/2, the 110 hurdles in 14.24 and the javelin at 211-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas State's Attila Zsivoczky also surpassed the 8,000-point  
barrier, finishing second with 8,129. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergqvist, the 1997 high jump champion, regained the title after  
finishing second last year. She and Dora Gyorffy of Harvard each 
cleared 6-2 3/4, but Bergqvist, a 1996 Swedish Olympian, won on fewer 
misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel fell nearly a half-lap back early in the 10,000 when she  
had to stop and put her shoe back on. Gradually, she worked her way 
back into contention and surged into the lead with two laps 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Sua's victory enabled UCLA to finish the decade the same way it  
started in the women's shot put in the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	She is the fourth shot put champion from UCLA during the 1990s.  
Tracie Millett was the Bruins' first winner of the decade in 1990, 
and was followed by Dawn Dumble in 1993 and Valeyta Althouse in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Sua, also winner of the NCAA discus title the past two years,  
will attempt to become the event's first three-time winner in 
Saturday's final. If she wins again, Sua would complete another 
bookend success for the Bruins. Millett won the discus in 1990 and 
Dumble won in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins junior also is the collegiate leader in the discus  
this season with a career-best 212-4. 
</P>
<P>
	The multitalented Sua also qualified in the hammer throw and  
javelin, but decided to compete in only two events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not go for a sure 20 points for my team when I know I can  
win the shot put and discus?'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Arkansas' Seneca Lassiter and Washington State's  
Bernard Lagat provided a preview of Saturday's men's 1,500-meter 
final. The two were paired in the same heat in Thursday's 
semifinals, and Lassiter edged Lagat with a late lunge -- 3:47.92 to 
3:47.96. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't necessarily matter who won because both qualified for  
the final, but Lassiter, the two-time defending champion, 
apparently wanted the psychological advantage by finishing first. 
Both, however, have great respect for each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturday is not going to be easy,'' said Lagat, who beat  
Lassiter in the NCAA indoors and will run the 5,000 final Friday. 
``I've got to be ready for whatever happens. He's a great 
competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lassiter: ``Bernard is a tough competitor. When the 1,500  
rolls around, he'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's Hazel Clark, winner of the 1998 title in the women's  
800, switched to the 1,500 this year, but was forced to drop out of 
her semifinal heat, apparently because of an ankle injury.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Pig Stamp Displeases One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura used a rubber stamp  
depicting a sitting pig to veto legislation, prompting a squeal of 
displeasure from one constituent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura wanted to send the message that the Legislature needs to  
avoid pork-barrel spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ramsey County prosecutor Susan Gaertner complained that the  
stamp of the pig was next to a $500,000 appropriation for a new 
domestic violence prosecution program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message that was received was one of insensitivity to the  
needs of women and children in crisis,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura spokesman John Wodele said the pig stamp was meant to be  
funny and was not necessarily a comment on the worth of the 
proposals.

<HEADLINE>  Women's Basketball Hall Is Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Women's Basketball Hall of Fame,  
opening Saturday as the first institution of its kind devoted to a 
woman's sport, is no shrine to the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``My joke is that it is more Disneyworld than it is a museum,''  
spokesman Jeff Simpson said Wednesday during a tour of the 
32,000-square-foot facility, with its 17-foot sculpture of leaping 
players at one end and a 30-foot-wide Baden basketball perched atop 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place is interactive. It is fun. It is playful. It is an  
entertainment destination as opposed to a museum with old balls in 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, old leather balls are here. Along with wool jerseys  
and bloomers from the 1920s, old sneakers and rule books and 
trophies recording the victories of long-forgotten AAU teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is more to this $9.3 million hall, funded partly by  
private and public donations and partly by corporate contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making it interesting,'' said John Gruber with 1220  
Exhibits of Nashville, which helped collect the memorabilia and 
write the story line of 107 years of women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be behind glass. Artifacts behind glass don't work,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of reading a panel about the birth of the sport, an  
animatronic Senda Berenson explains how she adapted Dr. James 
Naismith's boys' game for girls at Smith College in 1892. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basketball, strictly supervised and carefully coached, with  
high ideals of character-building in mind, is a game that develops 
a normal, healthy, enthusiastic girl who is glad to win a game, but 
most glad to play the game,'' the mechanical ``mother of women's 
basketball'' says in Berenson's own words. 
</P>
<P>
	A small theater gets the ball rolling with video clips of the  
sport's development in skills and attendance set to an 
inspirational musical theme, ``Hoopful of Hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a locker room of the past -- a custodian's closet. And a  
locker room of the present filled with jerseys from some of today's 
top college teams, including the six-time NCAA champion Tennessee 
Lady Vols, who play just down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Sit down on the bench and get a large-screen locker room speech  
by a coach of your choice. ``I think we lose sight too quickly of 
what it is that makes us good ...,'' Connecticut coach Gino 
Auriemma tells his Huskies. ``We are only good when we really work 
hard at being good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar interactive display has sculpted players in a huddle.  
Pick a coach for guidance. ``Let's get a little bit more 
aggressive,'' says Old Dominion's Wendy Larry. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a case filled with former Georgia star Teresa Edwards'  
four Olympic medals and the restored 36-foot-long, 15-passenger 
1966 Pontiac limo that the touring professional All-American Red 
Heads used to barnstorm the country. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a room to honor the players and coaches of the past,  
but also three indoor basketball courts to encourage the players of 
the future.

<HEADLINE> Gene Study Might Help Hemophiliacs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- For 43 years, Don Miller has been going to the  
hospital for treatment of hemophilia A, a disease that prevents his 
blood from clotting and causes severe bleeding in his joints and 
body cavities. 
</P>
<P>
	He lives carefully. He loathes his constant companion -- the  
needle-administered treatment that stops bleeding after it starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are  
testing a new therapy on Miller that could prompt his body to 
produce the blood-clotting protein it lacks before he bleeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``No needle sticks,'' Miller said Thursday. ``And I wouldn't be  
as afraid of hurting myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 50, is the first patient to use the gene therapy  
designed by California-based Chiron Corp. as part of a clinical 
test. The gene therapy is injected into the veins of the hand and 
travels through the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is for the ``friendly'' virus shell to carry the  
blood-clotting protein called factor VIII into the body, where it 
will take up residence in cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a virus that's gutted of all its junk,'' said Dr.  
Margaret Ragni, professor of medicine at the University of 
Pittsburgh and director of the Hemophilia Treatment Center of 
Western Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemophilia A is passed on genetically and affects only males.  
About one in every 10,000 men has the disorder, and pooling of 
blood in the joints often leads to crippling arthritis in later 
life when the enzymes in blood dissolve cartilage between the 
joints. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment has been tested on mice, rabbits and dogs. Some  
animals showed results just two weeks after receiving the 
treatment, and dogs showed continued production of the protein for 
a year after it was administered. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is the first of what researchers hope will be several  
human test cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``With humans, we don't really know, and that's why we're very  
interested to be starting these trials,'' Dr. Deborah Hurst, who 
designs clinical trial plans and protocol for Chiron.

<HEADLINE>  Hasek Has Everything But a Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek has won an Olympic gold medal  
and been the NHL's MVP the past two years. He's earned millions of 
dollars and the adoration of fans who marvel at his brilliant 
goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's one important thing missing from his resume -- the  
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change soon because his Buffalo Sabres are getting  
ready to play for the NHL championship against the winner of 
tonight's Game 7 in the Western Conference final between the 
Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hungrier than ever,'' Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley  
said. ``Nothing would compare to winning this thing, and it's nice 
to have him in there with that drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Stanley Cup championship would be a crowning achievement for  
Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us feel that there's always a little hole if you  
don't get it,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``He's going to feel 
that way if we don't accomplish what we set out to accomplish. You 
can't say it doesn't bother you if you don't win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has won a lot. He's the only goalie in NHL history to win  
two MVPs, and he's a contender to make it three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	His greatest achievement was leading the Czech Republic to its  
first gold medal in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He earned 
the right to be called the world's best goalie after beating 
Patrick Roy and Canada 2-1 in the semifinal and shutting out Russia 
1-0 for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he runs out of things to win, it seems Hasek never runs  
out of things to prove. The Stanley Cup might quiet critics who 
question his heart and tolerance for pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gold medal was something I did for my country and the  
Stanley Cup is something I want for all the Buffalo Sabres fans,'' 
said Hasek, who was bothered by a strained groin this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek sat out the first two games of the Eastern Conference  
finals against Toronto because of the groin injury, which also 
forced him to miss 12 games during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans wondered just how hurt Hasek really was. The goalie  
bristles at the suggestion that he was faking it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough to go to the coach and tell him that I could not  
play, but I'm glad I made the decision,'' he said. ``I could play 
hurt and maybe give up some bad goals and we could lose. I feel 
good about the decision I made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek remains sensitive on the subject. On Thursday, he snapped  
at a reporter who asked him about his exercise routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never ride the bike ... I hate the bike,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has the opportunity to answer one other nagging question:  
Who is the best goalie in the NHL? 
</P>

	Roy is the winningest goalie in playoff history, and Hasek rode  
the bench behind the other goalie he could face in the Stanley Cup 
final, Dallas' Ed Belfour, when both played for Chicago. Hasek 
spent two seasons in Chicago before the Blackhawks traded him to 
Buffalo in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Belfour is a great goaltender and Patrick has won three  
Stanley Cups,'' Hasek said. ``But it doesn't matter to me if we

you forget what you're doing, he'll tell you. He's the best I've 
ever seen and the best I've ever played in front of.''

<HEADLINE>  Hasek Has Everything But a Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek has won an Olympic gold medal  
and been the NHL's MVP the past two years. He's earned millions of 
dollars and the adoration of fans who marvel at his brilliant 
goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's one important thing missing from his resume -- the  
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change soon because his Buffalo Sabres are getting  
ready to play for the NHL championship against the winner of 
tonight's Game 7 in the Western Conference final between the 
Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hungrier than ever,'' Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley  
said. ``Nothing would compare to winning this thing, and it's nice 
to have him in there with that drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Stanley Cup championship would be a crowning achievement for  
Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us feel that there's always a little hole if you  
don't get it,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``He's going to feel 
that way if we don't accomplish what we set out to accomplish. You 
can't say it doesn't bother you if you don't win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has won a lot. He's the only goalie in NHL history to win  
two MVPs, and he's a contender to make it three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	His greatest achievement was leading the Czech Republic to its  
first gold medal in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He earned 
the right to be called the world's best goalie after beating 
Patrick Roy and Canada 2-1 in the semifinal and shutting out Russia 
1-0 for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he runs out of things to win, it seems Hasek never runs  
out of things to prove. The Stanley Cup might quiet critics who 
question his heart and tolerance for pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gold medal was something I did for my country and the  
Stanley Cup is something I want for all the Buffalo Sabres fans,'' 
said Hasek, who was bothered by a strained groin this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek sat out the first two games of the Eastern Conference  
finals against Toronto because of the groin injury, which also 
forced him to miss 12 games during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans wondered just how hurt Hasek really was. The goalie  
bristles at the suggestion that he was faking it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough to go to the coach and tell him that I could not  
play, but I'm glad I made the decision,'' he said. ``I could play 
hurt and maybe give up some bad goals and we could lose. I feel 
good about the decision I made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek remains sensitive on the subject. On Thursday, he snapped  
at a reporter who asked him about his exercise routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never ride the bike ... I hate the bike,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has the opportunity to answer one other nagging question:  
Who is the best goalie in the NHL? 
</P>
<P>
	Roy is the winningest goalie in playoff history, and Hasek rode  
the bench behind the other goalie he could face in the Stanley Cup 
final, Dallas' Ed Belfour, when both played for Chicago. Hasek 
spent two seasons in Chicago before the Blackhawks traded him to 
Buffalo in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Belfour is a great goaltender and Patrick has won three  
Stanley Cups,'' Hasek said. ``But it doesn't matter to me if we 
play Dallas or Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek's teammates are simply relieved he's playing.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to see that guy back in the net,'' Woolley said.  
``It just breeds confidence throughout our defense. 
</P>

	``Dom's our general back there. He's attentive, he's vocal. If  
you forget what you're doing, he'll tell you. He's the best I've

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Reporters Ordered Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge has ordered two Atlanta  
Journal-Constitution reporters to jail for refusing to disclose 
their sources for a story on Richard Jewell, an Olympic bombing 
suspect who was later cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper immediately filed a notice of appeal, blocking the  
jail sentence in the libel suit filed by Jewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell, who was working as a security guard at the 1996 Atlanta  
Olympics, was identified as a suspect in the fatal bombing in 
Centennial Olympic Park but was eventually cleared by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulton County State Court Judge John Mather ruled last year that  
reporters Kathy Scruggs and Ron Martz are not legally protected 
from naming their sources. In a March 16 order this year, he gave 
the reporters 60 days to disclose their sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defendants, through counsel, have conveyed their clear intent  
to continue to disobey the order of this court,'' Mather wrote 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court has shown defendants considerable patience, but  
there arrives a point at which the authority of the court and 
respect for the commands of that court must be vindicated,'' Mather 
said, ordering them jailed for civil contempt ``until such time as 
they disclose their confidential sources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Editor Ron Martin pledged the newspaper would challenge the  
order. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really an important issue for us,'' Martin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jewell sued in January 1997, claiming he was libeled ``in a  
series of false and defamatory articles which portrayed him as an 
individual with a bizarre employment history and an aberrant 
personality who was likely guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's attorney, Peter Canfield, has said the reporting  
was accurate and has asked that Mather dismiss the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of our defense is even leaving aside the  
constitutional protection for reporters and their sources, you 
should not even get to that issue in this because you need a false 
statement to get to a libel case,'' Canfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Journal-Constitution reporting was accurate,'' he said.  
``He (Jewell) was the focus of the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell attorney Lin Wood praised the order as ``clearly a  
significant victory for Richard Jewell in his continued pursuit of 
the truth from the Journal-Constitution and its reporters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's appeal ``will do nothing more than create more  
delay,'' Wood said. ``These reporters and their newspaper are going 
to face some very tough decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said Jewell recently started his own security firm and also  
serves as a fishing guide. The former security guard at first was 
hailed as a hero for spotting the knapsack that held the bomb that 
killed one woman and injured 111 people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Jenny Chuasiriporn, the amateur who  
forced a 20-hole playoff in last year's U.S Women's Open, had the 
early lead during her professional debut in the same major. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she got to the back nine at Old Waverly Golf Club on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Things started innocently enough when Chuasiriporn hit the  
fairway with her drive at No. 10, a 520-yard par 5. But her 4-wood 
approach went wide right, bounding hard off the cart path and going 
out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mishit on No. 10 shook me up,'' Chuasiriporn admitted.  
</P>
<P>
	And it affected her for several holes.  
</P>
<P>
	Her penalty shot at the 10th landed in the rough. By the time  
she got on the green and three-putted for a triple-bogey, 
Chuasiriporn had fallen back to even par and out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuasiriporn followed with a double-bogey at No. 11 after her  
second shot -- another 4-wood -- found Lake Waverly that borders the 
entire left side of the 408-yard hole. 
</P>
<P>
	After adding a bogey with a three-putt at the 151-yard 12th  
hole, Chuasiriporn was 3-over. She had another double-bogey and 
bogey before finally getting a 15-foot birdie at the 183-yard 17th 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuasiriporn had a 44 on the back nine to finish at 5-over 77,  
13 strokes behind first-round leader Kelli Kuehne. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two nines like that ... it's just mental, there's no excuse  
for it,'' Chuasiriporn said. ``But I had a good front nine to 
balance it out. I actually feel really good coming off the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CADDY SHARING:* Patty Sheehan isn't at this year's U.S. Women's  
Open, but her longtime caddie is. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Laib is on the bag this week for Beth Daniel, who said the  
caddie made a difference as she recorded an opening 1-under 71 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carl is always very prepared. He knows every detail about the  
golf course,'' Daniel said. ``He flew in here on Friday night and 
spent the whole weekend out here. Carl is a great caddie and I was 
lucky to get him this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Sheehan knew she wasn't going to play in this year's Open,  
she got her caddie and her friend in touch. Daniel and Laib now 
plan to also work together at the LPGA Championship in three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OPEN FIXTURE:* Carol Thompson is playing in her 29th U.S.  
Women's Open as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one woman in this year's 150-player field has been in more  
Opens. Three-time champion Hollis Stacy is playing in her 30th this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who shot a first-round 1-over 73 Thursday, got into  
this year's USGA championship only after an impressive shot in a 
qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing the qualifying tournament at her home course, the  
Allegheny Country Club in Sewickley, Pa., Thompson recorded an 
eagle on the par-5 18th hole to earn a spot into the Open. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LONE MISSISSIPPIAN:* The first major championship played in  
Mississippi has only one player with any ties to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1984-86, Kim Williams played at Mississippi State, which is  
in Starkville less than a half-hour from Old Waverly Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was the first-round leader at two U.S. Women's Opens,  
with sub-70 rounds to open the 1996 and 1998 tournaments. But she 
faltered in the second round of both, with an 81 last year and a 78 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Williams had an opening 2-over 74, 10 strokes off the  
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was struck in the neck by a stray bullet in 1994 while  
entering a drug store during the week of the Youngstown-Warren LPGA 
Classic. The bullet was removed in 1995, but now Williams is 
recovering from back surgery she underwent last September and is 
playing in only her fourth tournament this year.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Said Lagging on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department faces a backlog of up  
to 600,000 background security investigations that need to be done 
on Pentagon and contractor employees, USA Today reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said security inquires are made each year on tens of  
thousands of people who need access to sensitive classified 
material, a task handled for the past 27 years by the Defense 
Security Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent director of the agency, Steven Schanzer, was  
reassigned to a post in the Energy Department on Tuesday as USA 
Today was completing its look into the agency's practices, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre told the paper the agency's  
``management hasn't been as strong as we needed'' and that he has 
ordered aides to put in place a plan he hopes will resolve the 
backlog problem within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of that will involve hiring private investigative firms to  
help with the background checks, something strongly opposed by 
Schanzer. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said the workforce of the Pentagon security service  
has been cut by about 1,600 over the past decade, to 2,466 now, 
even though the caseload has remained steady. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper said the service does about 120,000 comprehensive  
investigations annually on military, civilian Defense Department 
employees, and contractor personnel needing top secret and secret 
clearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, it does 400,000 less-comprehensive inquiries a  
year on military recruits and personnel whose jobs are not so 
sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today said the backlog has been a problem for years.  
</P>
<P>
	About 2.5 million Defense Department employees and contractor  
personnel have security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Security Service also conducts investigations on  
contractor employees for 22 non-Defense Department government 
agencies.

<HEADLINE>  Women's Basketball Hall Is Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Women's Basketball Hall of Fame,  
opening Saturday as the first institution of its kind devoted to a 
woman's sport, is no shrine to the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``My joke is that it is more Disneyworld than it is a museum,''  
spokesman Jeff Simpson said Wednesday during a tour of the 
32,000-square-foot facility, with its 17-foot sculpture of leaping 
players at one end and a 30-foot-wide Baden basketball perched atop 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place is interactive. It is fun. It is playful. It is an  
entertainment destination as opposed to a museum with old balls in 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, old leather balls are here. Along with wool jerseys  
and bloomers from the 1920s, old sneakers and rule books and 
trophies recording the victories of long-forgotten AAU teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is more to this $9.3 million hall, funded partly by  
private and public donations and partly by corporate contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are making it interesting,'' said John Gruber with 1220  
Exhibits of Nashville, which helped collect the memorabilia and 
write the story line of 107 years of women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't be behind glass. Artifacts behind glass don't work,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of reading a panel about the birth of the sport, an  
animatronic Senda Berenson explains how she adapted Dr. James 
Naismith's boys' game for girls at Smith College in 1892. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basketball, strictly supervised and carefully coached, with  
high ideals of character-building in mind, is a game that develops 
a normal, healthy, enthusiastic girl who is glad to win a game, but 
most glad to play the game,'' the mechanical ``mother of women's 
basketball'' says in Berenson's own words. 
</P>
<P>
	A small theater gets the ball rolling with video clips of the  
sport's development in skills and attendance set to an 
inspirational musical theme, ``Hoopful of Hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a locker room of the past -- a custodian's closet. And a  
locker room of the present filled with jerseys from some of today's 
top college teams, including the six-time NCAA champion Tennessee 
Lady Vols, who play just down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Sit down on the bench and get a large-screen locker room speech  
by a coach of your choice. ``I think we lose sight too quickly of 
what it is that makes us good ...,'' Connecticut coach Gino 
Auriemma tells his Huskies. ``We are only good when we really work 
hard at being good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A similar interactive display has sculpted players in a huddle.  
Pick a coach for guidance. ``Let's get a little bit more 
aggressive,'' says Old Dominion's Wendy Larry. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a case filled with former Georgia star Teresa Edwards'  
four Olympic medals and the restored 36-foot-long, 15-passenger 
1966 Pontiac limo that the touring professional All-American Red 
Heads used to barnstorm the country. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a room to honor the players and coaches of the past,  
but also three indoor basketball courts to encourage the players of 
the future.

<HEADLINE> American Pilot Called a Good Aviator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Airlines pilot whose jet crashed in  
a thunderstorm in Little Rock, Ark., was considered a highly 
skilled professional who was unlikely to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, Capt. Richard Buschmann, 48, had been a chief  
pilot for American in Chicago, where he and three others were 
responsible for supervising 1,800 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Buschmann ``had an unblemished record, an outstanding record,''  
said Carl Price, who retired this year as a chief pilot for 
American. ``He was the type of pilot we put new co-pilots with, 
because he was so experienced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Slitt, an American spokesman, said chief pilots are  
required to fly planes for at least two months a year. They also 
are required to take yearly training, just as regular pilots do. 
</P>
<P>
	When Buschmann's jet crashed Tuesday night, he and the crew of  
the MD-82 had been on duty for 13 1/2 hours, having flown from Chicago 
to Salt Lake City and to Dallas before Little Rock. The airline's 
maximum is 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government does not specify a limit for duty time  
but caps pilots' actual flying time at eight hours in a day. They 
also must have eight hours of rest in a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight was two hours late leaving Dallas-Fort Worth, and  
passengers have questioned Buschmann's decision to land in the 
storm. Federal investigators said they want to know whether the 
desire to end a long day played into the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Spooner, who has flown MD-80s for American since 1988,  
suggested a sudden, unusual wind problem might have caused the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the wind shifts 180 degrees in minutes, just keeping the  
plane on the runway is tough,'' he said. ``It's one of those human 
factors of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Probably the 
fact so many survived is a tribute to Capt. Buschmann's 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buschmann was a 1972 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy,  
served in the Air Force Reserve and reached the rank of lieutenant 
colonel, academy spokesman John Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buschmann was married and had two children, a 20-year-old  
daughter and a 16-year-old son. Friends and neighbors in the 
Chicago suburb of Naperville said Buschmann was a marathon runner, 
enjoyed sailing and was a fixture on the sidelines of his 
children's soccer and baseball games.

<HEADLINE> ACLU: Race Profiles Used in Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The war on drugs has resulted in a sharp  
increase in the incidence of racial profiling by law officers 
patrolling highways across the country, civil rights activists say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Skin color has become a substitute for evidence in a way that  
really resembles Jim Crow justice on the nation's highways,'' Ira 
Glasser, head of the American Civil Liberties Union, said Wednesday 
as the group released its report on the controversial practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration's ``Operation Pipeline'' has  
trained at least 27,000 law enforcers to use race as a factor in 
spotting potential drug couriers, Glasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice is so common that the minority community has given  
it the derisive term DWB -- ``driving while black or brown,'' or 
stopping minorities for no reason other than their skin color. 
</P>
<P>
	DEA officials in Washington did not immediately return calls for  
comment on ``Operation Pipeline,'' launched in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU's report is largely a collection of case studies from  
23 states and not a statistical analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	``By laying out the facts in such detail in this report, we hope  
that we can now get beyond `Is there really a problem?' to `What 
are we as a nation going to do about it?''' said David Harris, a 
University of Toledo law professor and author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't suggest that this will be easy, only that it is  
necessary if we are to call ourselves a democratic nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU is calling on police departments to voluntarily begin  
documenting incidents of racial profiling. Some already have, 
including the forces in San Diego and San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, North Carolina became the first state to pass a law  
requiring data collection on all traffic stops. Similar bills have 
been introduced in Congress and in Arkansas, California, 
Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a young black man there's three things you can count  
on in your lifetime: death, taxes and police harassment,'' said 
ACLU lawyer Reginald Shuford. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU has pending lawsuits in Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey  
and Oklahoma regarding racial profiling.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michigan is inching closer to New Hampshire's  
place as the first presidential primary in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Both chambers of the Michigan legislature -- the Senate and the  
House -- have passed a law moving the state's Republican primary to 
Feb. 22, 2000, just one week after the crucial New Hampshire vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. John Engler is expected to sign the bill into

<HEADLINE> NYC Police Torture Case Nears Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Defense lawyers for officers charged in the  
beating of a Haitian immigrant accused prosecutors Thursday of 
using one crazed cop's actions to create a case of widespread 
police abuse that did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The case ``was not about a culture of police brutality. ... It  
was about one sick, depraved individual and the acts he 
committed,'' said lawyer Stephen Worth in his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Worth's client, Officer Charles Schwarz, is charged with holding  
down Abner Louima while an enraged Officer Justin Volpe sodomized 
the handcuffed prisoner with a broken broom handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other officers face lesser civil rights charges in a case  
that shocked the city and sparked demonstrations against police 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was to begin deliberating Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, in a mid-trial guilty plea, Volpe confessed he  
attacked Louima because he thought -- mistakenly -- that he had 
punched him in a melee outside a nightclub. The officer said 
another officer he didn't identify was in the bathroom; Schwarz 
claims he wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Abner Louima's been vindicated by Justin Volpe's guilty  
plea,'' Worth said. ``Now it's time to vindicate Charles Schwarz 
and stop this scurrilous accusation of him as a sex torturer and a 
member of police brutality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz, 33, along with Thomas Wiese, 35, and Thomas Bruder, 33,  
also is charged in federal court with joining Volpe in beating 
Louima in a patrol car on Aug. 9, 1997. A fourth defendant, Sgt. 
Michael Bellomo, 37, allegedly made false reports to cover up the 
assault on Louima and another Haitian man, Patrick Antoine. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Bellomo, Wiese and Bruder face up to 10 years in  
prison. Schwarz, because his charges involve a sexual assault, 
would face a maximum of life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Loretta Lynch accused Worth of trying to distort the  
evidence and distract the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very quick to dump on Justin Volpe now that he's no  
longer here,'' Lynch said in her closing statement. ``But that's an 
attempt to shift the focus away from the four defendants still on 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said that Louima, who recovered from severe  
internal injuries, has consistently told authorities that the 
officer who restrained him in the bathroom was the driver of the 
patrol car he was put in after his arrest; records show the driver 
was Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
	Two police officer witnesses testified that they saw Schwarz  
leading Louima in the direction of the bathroom on the morning of 
the attack.

<HEADLINE> Officers Blame Confessed Torturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawyers for police officers accused of beating  
Abner Louima say their clients were only put on trial because of 
their association with the ``monster'' who admitted torturing the 
Haitian immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Volpe, one of five officers charged in the 1997 assault,  
admitted during trial last week that he sodomized Louima with a 
stick in the bathroom of a Brooklyn precinct. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutality of the act shocked the city and raised tensions  
between police and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Wednesday and again today, lawyers for the  
other three officers tried their best to distance their clients 
from both the attack and Volpe. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that Thomas Wiese sits here because of  
what that monster Justin Volpe did to Abner Louima in that 
bathroom,'' said Wiese's attorney, Joseph Tacopina. ``And the 
government's argument is really one that says, 'Justin Volpe's an 
animal, convict everyone else.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Charles Schwarz, 33, is accused of holding Louima down  
during the stationhouse attack. Schwarz, along with Wiese, 35, and 
Thomas Bruder, 33, is also accused of beating Louima in a patrol 
car. The officers' supervisor, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, 37, is charged 
with covering it all up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to believe that something so depraved and so cruel  
could actually happen, let alone that it was two New York City 
police officers, in uniform, who did it,'' prosecutor Alan Vinegrad 
said in his summation. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Schwarz's attorney, Stephen Worth, took his turn to bash  
Volpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Worth portrayed his client as an honest cop who was swept up in  
Louima's face-saving lies about how many officers were involved -- 
lies which fueled an overzealous and misguided case against ``the 
culture of police brutality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case was really ``about one sick, depraved individual and  
the acts he did,'' he said. ``Abner Louima has been vindicated by 
Volpe's plea. Now it's time to vindicate Charles Schwarz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys for Bruder and Wiese argued Louima never  
identified the two as being among his four assailants, and that his 
version of when and where he was beaten was inconsistent with that 
of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	They also alleged that Louima and his family lied about the  
patrol car assaults to bolster his report of the bathroom attack 
and his subsequent $155 million lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was expected to get the case today, after attorneys for  
Schwarz and Bellomo present their closing arguments.

<HEADLINE> Foreman Seeks Bout Against Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The heavyweight fight picture is full of boxers  
wanting to fight each other. 
</P>
<P>
	George Foreman wants to fight Mike Tyson. And Evander Holyfield  
and Lennox Lewis both want a rematch of their controversial first 
fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But it remains to be seen whether a Foreman-Tyson fight is  
merely wistful thinking on the part of the aging former champions 
and those who see it as a rich spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's proposed November fight with Lewis is also looking  
shaky as the various parties try to work out a deal, despite 
promoter Don King's announcement last week that the fight would be 
held in November at a Las Vegas casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no deal,'' HBO vice president Lou DiBella said.  
``There are some problematic issues that need to be worked out. 
We're hopeful we can work them out, but they haven't been resolved 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Lewis and his promoter sent a letter to Park Place  
Entertainment on Wednesday telling the casino operator to stop 
giving the public ``a false impression that the fight is made, 
which is consistent with the current state of facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lewis and Holyfield have both agreed to $15 million  
paydays for the proposed November fight, and Park Place has signed 
a deal with King to hold it at one of its Las Vegas casinos, no 
contracts for the fight have actually been signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly concerned,'' Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas,  
said. ``Evander wants this fight to happen very badly and so, we 
think, does Lennox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main issue to be resolved is HBO's insistence that King step  
aside as the fight promoter if he were to be indicted on charges 
stemming from a number of ongoing investigations into boxing, 
sources close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, told The Associated Press. King, so far, has refused 
such a clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've settled basically on the money,'' Lewis attorney Milton  
Chwasky said. ``There's only one hindrance to this. It's Don's 
thing with HBO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Foreman adviser said he was trying to put together  
a Foreman-Tyson fight for December that would match the two former 
heavyweight champions in a bout that would pay Tyson $25 million 
and Foreman $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime Foreman adviser Ron Weathers and light heavyweight  
champion Roy Jones Jr. were trying to put together a deal for 
Foreman and Tyson to meet in a pay-per-view spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Showtime network, which shows Tyson's fights,  
said they were interested, and Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel did not 
discount the possibility of a matchup between the two former 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good story more than reality right now,'' Finkel said.  
``I've told them to have Foreman call me personally so we would 
know if he really wants to fight. So far he hasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, released last month from a Maryland jail, has been  
running and doing conditioning exercises since then, while Finkel 
and others try to put together a deal for his first return fight. 
</P>
<P>
	That would most likely be in September on Showtime, but not on  
pay-per-view, against the likes of Denmark's Brian Nielsen or 
Germany's Axel Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well in that fight, Tyson would fight in a  
pay-per-view bout in December. And his opponent could possibly be 
Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
	``From both of their standpoints, where else would they get this  
kind of money,'' said Fred Levin, who is Jones' lawyer and would 
co-promote the bout with the light heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike has got problems now and it would be George's swan song.  
People wouldn't buy Larry Holmes and George Foreman, but they will 
buy Mike Tyson and George Foreman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman would be 51 at the time of the fight, which would  
fulfill a goal he had when he came out of retirement 13 years ago 
to fight Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been his one goal in life to fight Mike Tyson,''  
Weathers said. ``It would be a great show with two guys who are 
huge punchers. Mike Tyson didn't want this fight for a long time, 
but I'm told he does now.''

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit police headquarters was evacuated briefly  
Thursday after a suspicious-looking briefcase was found in a van 
brought to the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb squad took the briefcase to police property nearby  
where it was ``opened carefully,'' Officer Claude Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wiring was found inside, but the bomb squad would not

	The briefcase, which was suspiciously taped, was found in a van

<HEADLINE> `Home Improvement' Goes Out on Top / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Allen's ``Home Improvement'' won the battle  
of the farewell episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	The final episode of the long-running ABC comedy was easily last  
week's most-watched show. Much to ABC's surprise and delight, it 
was the fourth-highest rated series finale of the 1990s behind 
``Seinfeld,'' ``Cheers'' and ``The Cosby Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NBC scored a narrow prime-time victory for the week and  
won the May ``sweeps'' period, when ratings are watched closely to 
set local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home Improvement'' drew an estimated 35.5 million viewers,  
Nielsen Media Research said Wednesday. The final episode of NBC's 
``Mad About You'' was fourth for the week with nearly 20 million 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The finale of Fox's ``Melrose Place'' had a more lackluster  
showing, finishing in 37th place for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one show -- ``Frasier'' -- from NBC's normally powerful  
Thursday night lineup made Nielsen's top 10 for the week. All were 
repeats as the long summer rerun season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, NBC had a 7.8 rating and 14 share. ABC and CBS  
both had 7.5 ratings and 14 shares, though ABC had the edge in 
total viewers. Fox had a 5.7 rating and 11 share, and the WB was at 
3.2 and 6. Struggling UPN had a 1.7 rating and 3 share, while Pax 
TV was at 0.7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the evening news competition  
with a 7.1 rating and 17 share. NBC's ``Nightly News'' was at 7.0 
and 16, while the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 5.7 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nightly News'' claimed victory during May sweeps, with its  
ratings up slightly from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of May 24-30, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``Home Improvement,'' ABC, 21.6; ``Spin City,'' ABC, 
14.3; ``Law and Order,'' NBC, 13.9; ``Mad About You,'' NBC, ``NYPD 
Blue,'' ABC, 13.5; ``Law and Order'' special, NBC, 11.9; ``Dateline 
NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 10.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 10.7; ``ABC Monday Night 
Movie: Cleopatra, Part Two,'' ABC, 10.0; ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox, 
10.0.

<HEADLINE> Life on Jovian Moon Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jupiter's moon Europa probably could not  
support life because oceans beneath the frozen surface could barely 
support single-cell organisms, let alone complex species such as 
those found on Earth, researchers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists had suggested oceans exist beneath the frozen  
surface on Europa, boosting theories that life could develop on 
Jupiter's fourth-largest moon. The ocean theory was suggested by 
data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	But a layer of ice at least 6 miles deep blocks the sun's  
life-sustaining energy from the water, according to a paper 
published in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to find fish swimming in the Europan ocean,''  
said Joseph Kirschvink, one of the authors and a professor of 
geobiology at the California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Organisms could live in the oceans heated by the strain of  
Jupiter's gravitational pull, researchers had said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hate to throw cold water on it, but ... it's basically a  
smothered planet,'' Kirschvink said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible that Europan organisms could derive their energy  
from rust, which is oxidized iron, or through some other source. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we are talking about very simple organisms that can live  
on these energy sources,'' said Eric Gaidos, the paper's lead 
author and a geobiologist at Caltech.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Americans Want Sex Ed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A survey suggests Americans reject the debate  
between teaching abstinence and sex education. They want both. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was commissioned by two groups that support  
comprehensive sex education -- including frank talk about condoms 
and intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine in 10 people said information about contraception, birth  
control and condoms should be given to 11th and 12th graders. And 
95 percent said those students should get information about 
abstinence. Nearly that many supported these messages for 9th and 
10th graders too, and solid majorities wanted that sort of 
education for 7th and 8th graders. 
</P>
<P>
	``For parents, it's not either abstinence or information about  
contraception. They want their kids to have both,'' said James 
Wagoner, president of Advocates for Youth, which co-sponsored the 
polls with the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative groups argue that teaching teen-agers about how to  
get and use birth control implies it is all right to have sex. They 
want clear messages given about the value of abstinence and the 
failure rates of condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for sex education note that many teens are already  
having sex, and they say it is imperative to tell them how to avoid 
pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy has tried to  
walk the line between the two groups, calling on communities to try 
a variety of approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey released Wednesday is the first look at American  
attitudes toward sexuality and abstinence since the 1996 welfare 
overhaul, which set aside $250 million over five years to promote 
abstinence until marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	That money is being matched by nearly as much in state and local  
dollars. States are using the money for a range of activities, 
including classroom lessons about delaying sex, media campaigns and 
after-school programs. It cannot be mixed with other programs that 
teach about contraception. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives note that there is other federal money that  
supports family planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no student in the United States that's being denied  
info about contraception because of this program,'' said Peter 
Brandt of the conservative Focus on the Family in Colorado Springs, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The national random telephone survey of 1,050 adults was  
conducted by Hickman-Brown Research in February and March. It has a 
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Texas Instruments Buying Telogy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas Instruments announced Wednesday it will buy  
Internet telephone company Telogy Networks to strengthen its 
position in Internet telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the acquisition seemed to be a good fit for the  
high-tech company but added that the price -- $435 million in stock 
-- was based on expectations of dramatic growth in Telogy's 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Glavin, an analyst in San Francisco for Credit Suisse  
First Boston, called the purchase ``a very nice complementary 
acquisition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telogy is a leader in embedded communications software. Combined  
with TI's programmable digital signal processors, or DSPs, its 
software can be used to send digital voice and data signals over 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``TI didn't have that software expertise,'' Glavin said.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the surface, it looks like a lot for a company that just  
has $14 million in revenue,'' said James L. Barlage, an analyst 
with Lehman Brothers in New York. ``But Telogy does have a dominant 
place in this embryonic market (for voice-over-IP). This could be a 
very huge market over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal is done and we're recommending the stock,'' Barlage  
added. ``I'm not going to change that opinion just in case they 
paid $100 million too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavin said the $435 million price was ``a nice valuation, given  
the potential for the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TI's stock rose $4.3125 to close Wednesday at $110.9375.  
</P>
<P>
	TI expects to benefit from a change away from circuit-switched  
telephone systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next decade, close to 700 million phone lines will  
transition to digital voice,'' said Mike Hames, TI vice president 
and manager of the company's DSP business. The acquisition, he 
said, ``will potentially put TI in every phone, every interface to 
the telecommunications infrastructure and every Internet appliance 
in the digital communications network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph A. Crupi, president and chief executive of Telogy  
Networks, said TI will be able to offer both hardware and embedded 
software with better quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which grew more than 400  
percent last year according to TI, allows voice and data to travel 
simultaneously over a single network line. 
</P>
<P>
	Telogy developed software to run on TI processors and compress  
voice, data and fax into small digital packets that travel across 
local area networks, intranets and the Internet. The software is 
used in products from Cisco Systems, 3Com, Nortel Networks.

<HEADLINE> Color Gives Charismatic an Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	If color has anything to do with it, Charismatic's chances of  
winning the Belmont Stakes are very good. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner is a chestnut. Eight of the  
25 horses to go into the Belmont Stakes with a chance of winning 
the Triple Crown were chestnuts. Six of them won, the last being 
Affirmed in 1978. The others were Sir Barton (1919), Omaha (1935), 
Whirlaway (1941), Assault (1946) and Secretariat (1973). 
</P>
<P>
	The two who failed were Pensive (1944) and Majestic Prince  
(1969), both of whom finished second. None of the seven who have 
tried and failed to complete the Triple Crown since Affirmed won it 
were chestnuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the winners of 130 Belmonts, 48 were chestnuts, second only  
to 51 bays. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic also should be a favorite of the cold-beer crowd.  
After all, Bob Lewis, the colt's owner, is the biggest beer 
distributor in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	But the suds crowd might prefer Silverbulletday, the sensational  
filly owned and named by a beer drinker named Mike Pegram, who's 
also in the fast-food business. A beer, a burger and a bet on 
Silverbulletday -- what a trifecta! 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody in racing has more fun than the 47-year-old Pegram, who  
grew up in southern Indiana and often went to Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	So he was thrilled when his Real Quiet won the Kentucky Derby  
last year, and he was just as thrilled when Silverbulletday won the 
Kentucky Oaks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was schoolboy, Pegram said, he enjoyed going to the Oaks  
on Friday more than going to the Derby on Saturday because you had 
to skip school to go to the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram, his family and friends, one of whom is Bob Baffert,  
trainer of Real Quiet and Silverbulletday, stayed near Belmont Park 
last year when Real Quiet tried to win the Triple Crown. He was 
nipped by a nose in the final stride by Menifee. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram and Baffert said Monday while watching Silverbulletday  
gallop that they would do their ``worrying'' about the filly's 
chances in the Belmont by staying in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to enjoy this Belmont,'' Baffert said. ``The last  
two years I went there under the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also missed becoming a Triple Crown trainer when Lewis'  
Silver Charm finished second in the 1997 Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan is quite a way from Belmont Park, but if  
Silverbulletday cocks an ear during the quiet of the evening, she 
might be able to hear the laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	One who sometimes fails to appreciate Pegram's humor is Buddy  
Bishop, who accepts or rejects suggested names of horses for The 
Jockey Club. Many of the names suggested by Pegram are suggestive, 
and a couple of risque ones have slipped by. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of names for one of Pegram's horses were  
rejected, Pegram submitted one that was accepted. It was Censored. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the matter of Button My Pants. That's the name of  
a fantasy horse that Pegram's 6-year-old grandson, Gator, uses when 
he plays at calling races. Another is Pay My Bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Pegram submitted Button My Pants as a name for a colt, but it  
was rejected. ``What is obscene about that?'' Pegram wondered, So 
he submitted it again, and again Bishop rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	The accepted name was Buddynamedme.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Lawmakers Void Gun Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Louisiana lawmakers have thwarted New  
Orleans' first-in-the nation lawsuit that claims gun manufacturers 
should be held liable for the costs of gun-related violence and 
accidental shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill preventing Louisiana cities from suing the gun industry  
breezed through the state Senate without fanfare or a dissenting 
vote Wednesday night. It had already passed the House, and Gov. 
Mike Foster said Thursday he will sign it ``as soon as it hits my 
desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with all the national gun legislation is that it  
won't stop violence,'' Foster said. ``The way to stop violence is 
to put people in jail who use guns. There's just not enough 
prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure has a retroactive clause nullifying the suit filed  
last fall by New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, who claimed that gun 
makers should be held responsible for making a product without 
adequate safety devices. The case was followed by several similar 
suits around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Morial said the city will proceed with its lawsuit and challenge  
the law in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Louisiana Legislature has taken a giant leap backwards by  
passing an ill-advised unconstitutional law that is nothing but a 
sad sellout to the money and power of the gun lobby,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill paralleled one approved in February in Georgia after  
heavy lobbying from the National Rifle Association. NRA President 
Charlton Heston dropped by the Louisiana Capitol to support the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the people who lobbied against the bill was Wilma  
Williams, whose 13-year-old son, Webster, accidentally shot himself 
to death in 1997 while he and his cousin were playing with a gun 
they didn't realize was loaded. The pistol did not have a built-in 
safety lock. 
</P>
<P>
	``No money can replace Webster, but it will draw attention to  
the fact that guns need to be made safer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Church, associate professor at the Louisiana State  
University Law Center, said the major legal question in the bill is 
whether it can be applied to a suit already filed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, attorneys in the Legislature said other product  
liability laws have retroactive clauses such as the one in this 
bill.

<HEADLINE> Tempo Key to Avalanche-Stars Finale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The first six games of the Western Conference  
finals have been as much about styles as they have scoring goals. 
</P>
<P>
	So with Game 7 looming Friday, the Dallas Stars and Colorado  
Avalanche know that whichever team can control the tempo the 
longest will likely be playing Buffalo for the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this series, there have been so many tempo changes and  
switches of momentum,'' Dallas forward Jamie Langenbrunner said. 
``It's going to come down to the team that sticks with it the 
longest and keeps battling the hardest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars play a plodding, defensive-oriented game with an  
emphasis on tight checking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche are an offensive-minded bunch who try luring  
opponents into a wide-open game by daring teams to try outskating 
and outshooting them. 
</P>
<P>
	The inherent pressure of a seventh game is somewhat to Dallas'  
advantage. Players tend to be tentative for fear of making the 
season-ending mistake, thus slowing the game's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado coach Bob Hartley is warning his players not to fall  
into that trap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't play cautious,'' Hartley said. ``Dallas plays for  
breaks and is very opportunistic. We have to use our speed to our 
advantage and we have to be on our best game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having the game in Reunion Arena is Dallas' reward for having  
the NHL's best regular-season record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars are 6-2 at home in the playoffs, with both losses in  
this series. Colorado is 8-1 on the road in the postseason, with 
the only loss in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	One theory behind the Avalanche's road success is that teams  
want to play exciting hockey for their home fans, so they end up 
playing to Colorado's strength. That's exactly what happened in 
Game 5 when the Avalanche won 7-5 and took a 3-2 lead in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	The pendulum swung back in Game 6, with Dallas forcing Colorado  
to scrounge for every opportunity. The Stars ended up winning 4-1 
in a game that was close until the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't do anything fancy, even though our fans would like to  
see that, because that's not our style,'' Stars defenseman Craig 
Ludwig said. ``We've got to keep things simple and not try to do 
more than what our team allows us to do. We've got to continue to 
play like that -- or at least start to play like that in this 
round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As much as forwards and defensemen try determining the game's  
flow, it really comes down to which goaltender is playing best. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this series, it's been a push.  
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Patrick Roy has shown flashes of why he's won more  
playoff games than any goalie in history. He's also shown flashes 
of vulnerability -- especially on shots above his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has a 2-3 record in Game 7s.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind big games. I feel comfortable,'' he said. ``The  
reason is it is easier for me to focus and concentrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' Ed Belfour has been superb throughout the playoffs, but  
won't be able to escape his choker reputation until he hoists the 
Cup -- even though he's 2-0 in Games 7s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a battling series all the way through,'' Belfour  
said. ``They feel they are right there and we have to keep doing 
what need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players on both teams are somewhat savoring the excitement of  
this game. They feel the pressure and understand what's riding on 
their next 60 minutes on the ice, but they know the reward is what 
they've been working toward since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set up a game plan Day 1 of training camp with the  
players,'' Hartley said. ``That ultimate goal is none different, 
but now there are 24 teams watching.''

<HEADLINE> WTO OKs Beef Sanctions Against EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization set up an arbitration  
panel Thursday to assess the losses incurred by the United States 
and Canada because of a European Union ban on hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel must report back by mid-July. At that point, the  
United States and Canada will be entitled to slap punitive 100 
percent duties against EU products ranging from chocolate to 
mineral water to offset losses incurred by the ban, which has been 
ruled illegal by the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	The go-ahead for both the sanctions and arbitration closely  
follows the U.S. imposition of $191 million worth of sanctions in a 
dispute over EU import restrictions on bananas distributed by U.S. 
multinationals like Chiquita and Dole Foods. 
</P>
<P>
	In the beef clash, Washington wants to slap punitive tariffs  
against $202 million of EU exports, while Canada has threatened 
sanctions on trade worth $51 million. 
</P>
<P>
	EU delegate Ian Wilkinson said the $250 million total ``exceeds  
by a long way any legitimate loss they might have suffered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said Washington would still  
prefer a negotiated settlement to avoid sanctions, but that the EU 
had shown this was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The EU must and should meet its WTO obligations,'' said Hayes.  
``To do anything less would jeopardize the credibility and 
integrity of the WTO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has drawn up a preliminary list of goods worth $900  
million, including Danish canned hams, foie gras, truffles, Belgian 
chocolates, French mustard, Perrier and other mineral waters, 
chestnuts and chewing gum. 
</P>
<P>
	The tariffs would double the price of the targeted products and  
make them prohibitively expensive for American consumers. It would 
also spell possible economic ruin for European manufacturers 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said once the WTO arbitration panel had set the amount of  
damages, then Washington would issue a final list of products for 
retaliatory duties. 
</P>
<P>
	EU delegate Jean-Jacques Buffet complained that Washington  
should narrow down the list now so European producers could prepare 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	But he indicated there was little chance of reaching a  
compromise -- for instance by resuming beef imports and labeling 
them as U.S. beef as Washington has suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU maintains that six hormones used -- three of which occur  
naturally -- may cause cancer. Pending the result of further 
scientific studies, due out by the end of this year, it is refusing 
to lift the ban even though it was supposed to do so by May 13 
under WTO rules. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have long accused Europe of acting for political  
rather than health motives. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``mad cow'' scare in Europe sent beef consumption plummeting  
and political leaders are worried about provoking a consumer 
backlash -- and upsetting the powerful farming lobby -- over 
hormone-treated beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Jitters about eating meat will likely increase because of this  
week's escalating scandal over cancer-causing dioxin in feed given 
to Belgian poultry and possibly pigs. The EU commission has imposed 
an Europe-wide ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 90 percent of the beef produced in the United States and  
Canada uses hormones approved by the regulatory U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration to make cattle grow faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. experts and evidence from numerous studies over the  
past four decades confirm very clearly that the six hormones cited 
are safe when used in cattle,'' said Hayes. ``There is no health 
risk from U.S. beef.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Study Examines Crash-Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The vulnerability of an airline landing was  
revealed in a recent study by the Boeing Co., the world's leading 
airplane maker. 
</P>
<P>
	While landing took only 1 percent of the average 90-minute  
flight between 1988 and 1997, landings accounted for 36 percent of 
the fatal accidents around the world during that span, the company 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, an American Airlines MD-82 became another crash  
landing statistic when it ran off a runway as it landed in Little 
Rock, Ark., striking a light stanchion and bursting into flames. 
The captain and at least eight others were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran pilots say planes are vulnerable at landing because of  
low airspeed, exposure to sudden winds and, of course, the 
closeness to the ground. Modern technology, such as devices that 
warn about dangerous bursts of wind, only slightly improves a 
narrow margin of error. In the end, a pilot's skill and judgment 
are key. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what pilots really get paid to do: Bring it back to the  
ground,'' said Michael Barr, director of the University of Southern 
California aviation safety program and a former Air Force fighter 
pilot who flew 137 combat missions in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots said investigators in Little Rock will focus on  
several areas: 
</P>
<P>
	--The weather. The plane landed in a gusty hail storm. Heavy rain  
and clouds reduce runway visibility, and water on a landing strip 
reduces braking. Pools can also cause an airplane to skid. 
</P>
<P>
	Local airport authorities decide whether to close a field for  
bad weather. Air traffic controllers, meanwhile, pass on weather 
alerts and clear a pilot to land. The pilot always decides whether 
to proceed with or break off an approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators will want to know about the airport's decision,  
what advisories the controllers gave and whether the pilots 
discussed making a new approach or diverting to another airport 
because of the bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	--Equipment performance. The MD-80 series, like other airliners,  
comes equipped with anti-skid brakes and airflow spoilers that flip 
up from the wings to slow an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines added systems that warn pilots of windshear, a  
burst of wind that can push a plane into the ground or cause a 
pilot to overcompensate for a change in attitude -- particular 
hazards near the ground. All of that equipment will be examined to 
determine whether was working properly. 
</P>
<P>
	An airline captain who flies the MD-88, a sister plane to the  
MD-82, said investigators should also look at the spoiler system, 
because it is hard to tell when it has been activated for landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines recently instituted a policy under which both  
the pilot and the co-pilot have to confirm that the spoiler lever 
has been put in the armed position. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's stowed you have to look at it carefully to make sure  
it's been armed,'' said this captain, who spoke only on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	--Crew performance. Capt. Richard Buschmann, who was flying the  
plane when it crashed, was a veteran American pilot with 5,500 
hours of flight time in the MD-80 series. But he was also the chief 
pilot in Chicago, meaning he was charged with overseeing the 
performance of other pilots and only flew passenger planes during 
two months each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-pilot, First Officer Michael Origel, was hired by the  
airline in February and had less than 200 flight hours. In essence, 
neither pilot had much recent time in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, new pilots are often reluctant to challenge more senior  
fliers, deferring to their experience. American, however, has led 
the airlines in developing Crew Resource Management techniques in 
which captains are taught to accept participation and co-pilots are 
taught to speak up assertively when they detect a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``If CRM is practiced appropriately by both the new guy and the  
very senior pilot, this in theory should not be a problem,'' said 
John Nance, an airline captain and aviation analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are heightened possibilities for communications  
problems between the two pilots when a brand-new pilot is flying 
with a highly respected senior pilot. It's hard to bring yourself 
to speak up when there's something going on that you may not be 
sure of.''

<HEADLINE>  Lopez Has High Hopes at Women's Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- If only the scene can be replayed for  
Nancy Lopez on Sunday -- and for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
	There Lopez was on the 18th hole of a U.S. Women's Open, pumping  
her fists in the air as a 12-foot birdie putt dropped into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But the reaction Thursday by Lopez at the end of her first round  
of the 54th Open was more of relief than celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez finished with an opening round 4-over 76 at Old Waverly  
Golf Club, a course where she believes she has her best chance to 
finally win an Open title. The birdie at No. 18 was her only one of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confused. I've been hitting the ball well and putting  
well,'' said the 42-year-old Lopez, who had top-20 finishes in the 
two events leading up to her 23rd Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``That bothers me because I didn't feel nervous. I felt  
confident. I felt good, I felt excited. And when you don't play the 
way you feel, that confuses you a little bit. Maybe I need to feel 
really bad tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is no secret that Lopez would like to face the same scene at  
No. 18 on Sunday -- only this time celebrating that elusive Open 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the first-round 76 and ever-weakening knees, Lopez  
believes she can still make a run this year. The Hall of Famer with 
48 career victories still feels good about her overall game. 
</P>
<P>
	And she knows the Old Waverly course probably better than anyone  
else in the field. She was part of the first official foursome to 
play there 11 years ago and is still an annual visitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to forget today, try to shoot 4- or 5-under Friday and  
hit the way I've been hitting. I'm not going to let the U.S. Open 
get me,'' Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take away two double-bogeys and things wouldn't have been so bad  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 4, a 390-yard par-4, Lopez hit a solid drive in the  
fairway. But her 6-iron approach landed in heavy rough to the right 
of the green. She had to punch a shot over a mound, and then 
three-putted from 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing a 6-foot par putt at No. 5, Lopez had 10 straight  
pars. She ran into trouble again at the 388-yard 16th hole -- again 
with a bad approach shot after a good drive and another three-putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 9-iron approach at No. 16 came up short of the elevated,  
two-tier green. The third shot landed above the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately I had two holes that just really kill you,''  
Lopez said. ``But I did feel good because I did birdie 18. That did 
make me feel like I was coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to take that attitude tomorrow and go out there and  
keep swinging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And swinging harder with her irons.  
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, former major-league player and manager Ray Knight,  
told Lopez after the round that her iron swings were lazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few weeks I have been playing well and made a lot of  
birdies. And today I had the opportunity to make a lot of birdies, 
but I didn't have the irons in my hand,'' Lopez said.

	After missing a 6-foot par putt at No. 5, Lopez had 10 straight  
pars. She ran into trouble again at the 388-yard 16th hole -- again 
with a bad approach shot after a good drive and another three-putt. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 9-iron approach at No. 16 came up short of the elevated,  
two-tier green. The third shot landed above the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately I had two holes that just really kill you,''  
Lopez said. ``But I did feel good because I did birdie 18. That did 
make me feel like I was coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to take that attitude tomorrow and go out there and  
keep swinging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And swinging harder with her irons.  
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, former major-league player and manager Ray Knight,  
told Lopez after the round that her iron swings were lazy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few weeks I have been playing well and made a lot of  
birdies. And today I had the opportunity to make a lot of birdies, 
but I didn't have the irons in my hand,'' Lopez said.

<HEADLINE> `Salesman' Vs. `Iceman' for Tonys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It says something about Broadway as a museum of  
American theater that the hottest race for 1999 Tony Awards is 
between venerable plays by theater icons Arthur Miller and Eugene 
O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
	Revivals of Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' and O'Neill's ``The  
Iceman Cometh'' and the competition between their two stars, Brian 
Dennehy and Kevin Spacey, promise the most suspense Sunday when the 
silver medallions celebrating the best of the theater season are 
handed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Both productions have received strong reviews. So have Dennehy's  
portrayal of Willy Loman, Miller's desperate believer in the 
American Dream, and Spacey's portrait of a man determined to 
puncture the alcohol-induced illusions of the down-and-out denizens 
of Harry Hope's bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The best new play? Most theater people expect a battle between  
``Side Man,'' a family play about jazz musicians in the 1950s, and 
``Not About Nightingales,'' Tennessee Williams' 1938 prison 
melodrama, unseen on stage until it was unearthed last year by 
Britain's Royal National Theater. But Patrick Marber's dark 
cyber-sex comedy, ``Closer,'' can't be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
	As for best musical -- don't ask. It has been a disappointing  
year, particularly after the excitement of ``The Lion King'' and 
``Ragtime'' the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fosse,'' an homage to choreographer Bob Fosse, is favored,  
although there is some sentiment for ``Parade,'' a serious love 
story set against the murder of a young girl in Georgia and the 
subsequent lynching of her accused killer. The show, unfortunately, 
closed in February, which will lessen its chances. 
</P>
<P>
	So what can one expect from Sunday night's extravaganza,  
celebrated with an hour of entertainment and interviews on PBS (8 
p.m. EDT), before CBS (9 p.m. EDT) takes over for two hours of 
major prize-giving and snippets from nominated shows, both plays 
and musicals? 
</P>
<P>
	This year's telecast has left the Broadway theater community  
nervous, despite record Broadway grosses of $588.5 million and an 
increase in productions -- 39 shows, compared with 33 the previous 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the show lost Radio City Music Hall, its home for  
the past two years, because of renovations to the hallowed hall, 
and now finds itself back in a traditional Broadway house, the 
Gershwin Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, popular host Rosie O'Donnell, who was credited  
with boosting ratings after a long decline, said she was too busy 
to run the show for a third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell will still be on stage, but only as one of many  
presenters, who will carry the show, two by two, instead of having 
a single host. 
</P>
<P>
	The twosomes will have some sort of link. Among them:  
</P>
<P>
	--Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker (they're married).  
</P>
<P>
	--Spacey and Jason Robards (both played the lead in memorable  
productions of ``The Iceman Cometh''). 
</P>
<P>
	--Julie Andrews and Carol Burnett (old friends since they played  
Carnegie Hall together). 
</P>
<P>
	--Angela Lansbury and Bea Arthur (co-stars in the original  
``Mame''). 
</P>
<P>
	--Chita Rivera and William Hurt (they were in stage and screen  
adaptations of ``Kiss of the Spider Woman''). 
</P>
<P>
	--Christine Baranski and David Hyde Pierce (talented second  
bananas on television sitcoms). 
</P>
<P>
	--O'Donnell and Elaine Stritch (huh? -- well, both are superb at  
spontaneous, acerbic quips that could give the show some extra 
zip). 
</P>
<P>
	As for entertainment, executive producer Walter Miller has a  
problem. The play was the thing during the 1998-99 season. A few of 
them -- such as ``Amy's View,'' ``Electra,'' ``The Blue Room'' and 
``The Iceman Cometh'' -- actually have made a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	That should be reason enough to celebrate, but how do you  
showcase them on the tube to best advantage -- particularly this 
year, when there will be moments from eight productions, in both 
the new and revival categories? 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, these scenes tended to be awkwardly inserted into  
the show and were hard to follow without the context of the entire 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Musicals don't have that difficulty. Song and dance are naturals  
for television, and usually the quality is a lot higher than what 
gets on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there were no musical smashes. In fact, several were among  
the season's biggest financial losers: ``On the Town,'' ``Parade,'' 
``Band in Berlin,'' ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What will the four nominated musicals do? ``Fosse'' wisely plans  
to reprise ``Sing, Sing, Sing,'' the big Benny Goodman show stopper 
from the master's 1978 revue ``Dancin'.'' It should look great on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parade'' and ``It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues'' will showcase  
their Tony-nominated performers. The first will feature Brent 
Carver and Carolee Carmello in ``This Is Not Over Yet,'' a stirring 
anthem of hope, while the second highlights Gretha Boston and Ron 
Taylor in the bitter hymn of exclusion ``Members Only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Civil War,'' the final musical nominee, will put its  
entire company on stage for ``Freedom's Child,'' a rousing chorale 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	For musical star power, the show will depend on Bernadette  
Peters who, along with co-star Tom Wopat, will deliver ``I've Got 
the Sun in the Morning'' and ``Old-Fashioned Wedding'' from ``Annie 
Get Your Gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' -- one new song  
(``Philosophy'') and one old (``Happiness'') will be sung. Martin 
Short, with a straw hat and French accent, will do ``Boom Boom'' 
from the revival of ``Little Me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And audiences will get the best moment from ``Peter Pan,'' Cathy  
Rigby and the children soaring across the Gershwin stage in ``I'm 
Flying.'' Right now, the television producers are hoping the 
ratings will soar just as high. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Predictions are inherently risky, usually biased and probably  
inaccurate. So let's proceed immediately with some serious 
guesswork on the 1999 Tony Awards to be handed out Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hottest contest, ``The Iceman Cometh'' will top ``Death  
of a Salesman'' as best play revival, and its star, Kevin Spacey, 
will edge ``Salesman'''s Brian Dennehy as best actor. Howard 
Davies, who directed ``Iceman,'' also will triumph for his flawless 
orchestrating of a large cast and an unwieldy play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman'' will pick up a Tony for Elizabeth Franz for  
featured or supporting actress in a play. Franz, who portrays Willy 
Loman's fiercely devoted wife, should have been nominated in the 
leading actress category, but the ``Salesman'' producers are no 
dummies. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz stood no chance against Dame Judi Dench, already an  
Academy Award winner this year for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and a 
likely Tony winner, too, for ``Amy's View.'' So the producers 
petitioned to have Franz placed in the supporting category, where 
she will win easily. 
</P>
<P>
	For featured actor-play, go with Frank Wood, the tortured father  
in the potent family drama, ``Side Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out-on-a-limb time: For best play, pick ``Closer,'' a smart,  
funny sexy comedy, by Patrick Marber; for musical, ``Parade,'' a 
serious new work by a promising young composer-lyricist, Jason 
Robert Brown, and Alfred Uhry, who wrote the book. They will take 
Tonys for best score and book of a musical. And its director, Hal 
Prince, will win as best director of a musical. 
</P>
<P>
	For best actress in a musical, go with Bernadette Peters, whose  
show, ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' also will win as best musical 
revival. Peters is a real star -- and only has one Tony Award 
(``Song &AMP; Dance''). Sunday should give her two. 
</P>
<P>
	Make that a double for Brent Carver, too. He has a Tony Award  
for ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' He should get another for his 
brilliant portrayal of an accused murderer in ``Parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for featured performers in a musical -- no contest. The  
delicious Kristin Chenoweth, who plays Sally Brown, and the jaunty 
Roger Bart, Snoopy in ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' have 
the prizes locked up. 
</P>
<P>
	May the best nominees win -- which, unfortunately, is not always  
the case. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Duncan Unfazed by MVP Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tim Duncan didn't win the MVP award many  
people thought he deserved. He didn't even finish second. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed hardly to care, though, as he and his San Antonio  
teammates prepared for Friday night's Game 3 against the Portland 
Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals. After all, the two 
players who finished ahead of him in the MVP voting, Karl Malone 
and Alonzo Mourning, are finished for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan and the Spurs are two victories away from the NBA Finals.  
That means a lot more than any MVP award, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be right here right now, I'll tell you that,''  
Duncan said. ``I'm very happy with the position that I'm in right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Mario Elie said such an attitude is typical for the  
team-oriented Duncan, who in just two years has become the Spurs' 
go-to player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of disappointed he was all the way down to third,''  
Elie said. ``I understand those other two guys had terrific years. 
But we had the best record in the league. We won all the big games 
we needed to win, and Tim was a big part of that. I guess a lot had 
to do with Tim being in his second year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize Karl Malone has a thousand games under his belt, but  
I felt this year Tim was the best player in the league. Karl Malone 
is out fishing or driving his 18-wheeler across the country. Tim is 
still in the hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan gives himself an average grade so far in the Western  
Conference finals, even though he's averaged 22 points and 11.5 
rebounds per game and shooting 61.5 percent from the field as the 
Spurs took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Average for him,'' teammate Sean Elliott said, ``but above  
average for anybody else. He can probably play better, but you've 
got to give credit to Portland, too. That's their defensive 
scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio is 4-0 on the road in the playoffs, and the Spurs  
are one of three teams to beat the Blazers in Portland this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is,'' Duncan said. ``In a hostile  
environment, we just get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The youthful Blazers, meanwhile, feed off the noise of the Rose  
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a dangerous team at home,'' Jim Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs are preaching teamwork, sacrifice and  
cohesiveness, the Blazers were weathering Damon Stoudamire's 
ill-timed outburst. The Portland point guard is unhappy about being 
benched in the fourth quarter in favor of Greg Anthony. Stoudamire 
lashed out at the situation after practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get over it, but I'm never going to forget it,'' he said  
in a wide-ranging conversation that also included a jab at his 
persistent critics in Portland, where he grew up and was a high 
school star. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Mike Dunleavy, who earned NBA coach of the year  
honors for dealing with such problems on a deep, talented and young 
team, downplayed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments don't bother me. The timing of it at this point  
maybe does a little bit,'' Dunleavy said Thursday. ``But it's 
nothing that major. I don't think it's going to affect the way he 
plays tomorrow night. It's not going to affect the way I coach 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day layoff has not erased the pain of Elliott's tip-toe  
3-pointer that beat Portland 86-85 Monday night in Game 2, a game 
the Blazers led by as many as 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``To wait this long, it eats at you,'' Jackson said, ``but you  
know you have a chance for it to set in and hurt, because you know 
you gave a game away, or maybe two away, and you've got to have a 
time period where you sit there and think about it, about the 
little things you did wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has shown a marked contrast between the high emotion  
of the fragile Blazers and the even, uncomplaining keel of the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're an older group,'' Elliott said. ``We've been through  
situations in our careers where maybe we were unhappy with our 
playing time or we were unhappy with the number of shots we got. 
But we're beyond that now. Guys here aren't trying to star in 
commercials. We're trying to win. We don't have a lot of time left 
on these legs, so we're trying to get it done now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, who played on two championship teams in Houston, senses  
that special something on this team, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident group. We've got a lot of trust in each  
other,'' he said. ``That's what I like. A guy can miss all day but 
if he's open, you get him the ball. That's what this team has been 
about all year, trusting each other, sharing the ball. We've got a 
bond right now that's hard to explain. We feel good about each 
other.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa GOP Poll To Show Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Iowa straw poll this summer will give an  
early indication of the strength of the Republican presidential 
field in a state that launches the nominating season, the state's 
GOP leader said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 12,000 Iowa Republicans will cast straw votes Aug.  
14 in Ames, Iowa. A strong finish can bring some attention to a 
campaign and offer an early measure of various campaign 
organizations' ability to deliver backers to events. 
</P>
<P>
	That's important in a caucus state like Iowa, where  
organizations next Feb. 7 will try to deliver backers to thousands 
of precinct caucuses, which are essentially neighborhood meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The track record of straw polls predicting results is mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	Televangelist Pat Robertson won one in 1987, giving a signal of  
some early strength among religious conservatives that hadn't been 
apparent earlier. And Texas Sen. Phil Gramm tied for the win in one 
during the last presidential election cycle, then bombed badly when 
real votes were cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain to win this poll is the state Republican Party, which is  
collecting $25 for each ticket that allows an activist to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge benchmark test,'' said Kayne Robinson, the Iowa  
Republican Party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Every major GOP candidate will be on the mock ballots in August.  
All will have time to make a 10-minute speech during the four-hour 
voting period. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the GOP presidential hopefuls have field operations  
running in Iowa, and they are focusing heavily on turning out 
backers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner in early  
polls, has yet to campaign in the state, and he's only recently put 
a campaign staff in place. Bush has not yet decided whether he will 
actively compete in or even attend the straw poll, said campaign 
spokesman Dave Beckwith. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision has not been made, and won't be made, until  
Governor Bush visits Iowa and gets a feel for it,'' Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
	One major change to the straw poll this year is that will be  
open only to Iowa residents. Previously, anyone of voting age who 
attended could cast a ballot, regardless of residency. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its inception in 1988, the Iowa straw poll has been a  
harbinger of what to expect in the other national primary races, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is, for anyone who comes in the top three -- that is  
a good indicator of how they're doing in Iowa and across the 
country,'' he said. In addition, he said, ``This event will be a 
fantastic test of who has a good organization. In Iowa, you have to 
have an organization on the ground to turn people out on Feb. 7.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson declined to say which candidate has the best  
organization in Iowa, saying, ``Most of the campaigns have the 
leadership horsepower to do very, very well in the caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Bush's prospects, Robinson said, ``There seems to be  
something about him that makes people think he's better able to 
connect with voters. People are interested in meeting him.''

<HEADLINE> Border Nations Near Deal on Trucking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney  
Slater wrapped up a two-day border conference Thursday with a 
pledge to resolve a four-year dispute over international trucking. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater was one of several high-level officials from both  
countries who attended the U.S. Mexico Border Infrastructure 
Conference to discuss the impacts of the North America Trade 
Agreement on border communities and how to handle future growth as 
free trade continues to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater briefly met with Mexican Transportation Secretary Carlos  
Ruiz Sacristan on Thursday to discuss allowing commercial trucks 
from both countries to freely cross the border, improving the flow 
of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-border trucking was to be permitted under the NAFTA, but  
the Clinton administration, citing safety concerns with Mexican 
vehicles, suspended that provision of the treaty in 1995 shortly 
before it was to go into effect. Trucking companies currently use 
third parties to drive goods across the international zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discussions are going very, very well and it is our hope  
that we will be able to move forth within a reasonable period of 
time to open up the border,'' Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater declined to speculate when an agreement would be reached,  
but said it would come before the end of the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made a commitment and we're trying to get it done,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Business leaders on both sides of the border have argued that  
the current rules hurt commerce and factor into the long delays at 
crossing points along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goals of NAFTA will not be fully realized if goods cannot  
be transferred from buyer to seller in a safe and efficient 
manner,'' said Sam Vale of the Border Trade Alliance, an advocacy 
group participating in this week's conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater and Commerce Secretary William Daley attended the  
conference along with Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, California 
Gov. Gray Davis and Mexico Trade Minister Herminio Blanco.

<HEADLINE> Landry Checks Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry has been  
released from a Dallas hospital after completing the first stage of 
his treatment for leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 74-year-old Landry left Baylor University Medical Center on  
Tuesday, his son, Tom Landry Jr., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Landry will spend the next 30 days convalescing at home, his son  
told The Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	Landry entered the hospital on May 4 after he was diagnosed with  
leukemia, a cancer that impairs the production of blood cells. He 
is scheduled to return to the hospital in a month to continue a 
90-day treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Treatment has progressed as outlined by his doctors,''  
Landry's son said. ``Certainly there is more time to go and 
treatment to continue. But to date, things have gone real well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning News said it received about 1,700 get-well faxes  
within a five-day span last month through its web site. Those 
messages were relayed to Landry while he was in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of my condition (isolated to avoid infection), I  
couldn't have flowers or visitors, so you can imagine how much it 
meant to me to receive so many cards, phone messages and all those 
e-mail letters,'' Landry told the newspaper from his residence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read all of them and was really touched by everyone's  
concern and prayers,'' Landry said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Canada Reach Salmon Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- After years of bitter feuding among negotiators  
and fishermen, the United States and Canada have reached an accord 
aimed at conserving and rebuilding their shared West Coast wild 
salmon runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't easy, but after five frustrating years of  
negotiating breakdowns we finally ended the stalemate,'' Washington 
Gov. Gary Locke said Thursday of the renewed Pacific Salmon Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations hit a low in 1997 when Canadian fishing boats  
blocked an Alaska state ferry from departing Prince Rupert, British 
Columbia, after fishermen there contended Alaskans were taking too 
many salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal divides up salmon among Canadian and U.S. fishermen  
only after ensuring that enough remain to reproduce healthy and 
growing runs, especially of wild chinook, sockeye and coho salmon. 
Increasing numbers of those runs are being listed as endangered or 
threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement gives Canada more Fraser River sockeye salmon at  
the expense of Washington and Oregon fishermen, but reduces 
Canada's catch of chinook salmon bound for Washington, Oregon and 
Idaho rivers, Locke said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Alaska has agreed to reduce its chinook and coho  
salmon catches, backers of the agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and  
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy called the accord ``a 
victory for all those on both sides of the border interested in 
salmon conservation and the long-term viability of our salmon 
industries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement requires Congress to appropriate $140 million to  
be used to restore salmon habitat and take other steps to rebuild 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government and Washington state are expected to  
appropriate another $30 million to $35 million to buy out the 
licenses of some U.S. fishermen who will lose a big chunk of their 
customary Fraser sockeye harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement will be in effect for 10 years everywhere but  
British Columbia's Fraser River, where it will last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixed harvest quotas will be replaced by an ``abundance-based''  
system. Harvest levels will decline when stocks are low and will 
rise when stocks are again plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be seeing thousands of additional wild chinook and coho  
salmon returning to rivers on Washington's coast and Puget Sound as 
well as the Columbia (River) each year as a result of this 
agreement,'' said Kelly White, chairman of the Washington state 
Fish and Wildlife Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement sets up two regional funds to be managed jointly  
by both countries to address restoration and salmon production 
enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Curtis of Trout Unlimited welcomed the agreement -- with  
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what we know about this agreement, it seems to be more  
about providing money for restoration than cutting harvests,'' 
Curtis said. ``We are worried that they are going down the road of 
trying to make more fish, rather than conserving the resource.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Provisions of the treaty, which dictate how many fish are  
allotted to U.S. and Canadian fishermen, expired in 1992 and 
negotiators have been working ever since to come up with a new 
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Antigay Slur Carved on Student </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A dispute over musical tastes drove two  
prep school students to carve an antigay slur into the back of a 
classmate, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Shapiro, 18 of Keene, N.H., and Matthew Rogers, 20, of  
Franklin, Tenn., are accused of using a pocket knife to cut the 
word ``HOMO'' into the back of a 17-year-old junior at Northfield 
Mount Hermon School. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Wednesday the victim was attacked because he liked  
the British rock band Queen, whose lead singer, Freddie Mercury, 
died of AIDS complications in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rogers called it a gay band,'' said Gill Police Chief David  
Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
	Both students pleaded innocent to charges of assault and battery  
with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to maim, and assault 
with intent to intimidate, resulting in bodily harm. They were 
released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Each could get up to 25 years in prison, as well as counseling  
and diversity training, if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, whose name was not released, initially kept quiet  
about the May 27 attack. He has since returned to his family's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastings described the wounds as ``deep enough to draw blood.''  
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw them they were three days old and they were still  
very visible,'' he said. ``The letters were 4- to 5-inches high and 
ran all the way across his back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers had accepted an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy,  
according to Karen Myers, an academy spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we are able to verify the charges we will have to  
reconsider the appointment,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Indian Jets Hit Guerrilla Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- Indian air force jets strafed bunkers in  
the craggy Himalayans in Kashmir today, supporting ground troops 
trying to evict intruders from Pakistan who have held the snowy 
mountain peaks for a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian military reported 31 militants and six Indian  
soldiers killed in ground fighting on the ninth day of a campaign 
that has intensified the longstanding hostility between the two 
nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan has proposed sending its foreign minister to India on a  
peace mission but the two countries were still wrangling today over 
when the trip will occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing what he called ``good will,'' Pakistani Prime Minister  
Nawaz Sharif today ordered the immediate release of a captured 
Indian pilot, shot down over Kashmir a week ago. The pilot was 
handed over to the International Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashmir, a former princely state, has been the cause of two wars  
between Pakistan and India since their independence from Britain in 
1947. Each country holds part of the region and claims the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim militants, who have been waging a bloody secessionist  
insurrection for more than one decade in Kashmir, want either 
outright independence or a merger with Islamic Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	India's air force concentrated its attacks on the Batalik  
sector, the isolated eastern perimeter where some of the heaviest 
fighting was underway. 
</P>
<P>
	Front-line officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
heavy shelling from Pakistan at Batalik was effectively blocking 
Indian troops from the approaches to the occupied peaks. 
</P>
<P>
	India has said it would consider giving the guerrillas safe  
passage to return to Pakistan if they sought it, but vowed to 
remove them -- one way or the other -- from the heights that dominate 
the northern highway. The road is the lifeline for the military 
guarding India's northern cease-fire line and for thousands of 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan, the umbrella group representing the militants said  
they would reject any offer of safe passage. The United Jehad 
Council, comprising 14 groups including four fighting in the Kargil 
mountains, said the guerrillas would not leave the area because it 
is their ``homeland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India accuses Pakistan of backing the guerrillas in a bid to  
change the cease-fire line through the territory. It says Pakistani 
army officers are commanding the militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The army claims the guerrillas have been pushed back from many  
positions and are holding only four or five key locations. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle zone is 440 miles north of New Delhi, the Indian  
capital. India claims it has killed 400 guerrillas so far, but 
admits that figure is an estimate based on radio intercepts. Before 
today's battle, India's losses were 46 dead and 12 missing.

<HEADLINE>  Tampa Bay, Florida Get Their Joshes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Florida Marlins  
each got the Josh they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay selected Josh Hamilton, an outfielder from Athens  
Drive High School in Raleigh, N.C., with the first pick in 
Wednesday's draft, while Florida took Josh Beckett, a right-hander 
from Spring, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton became the first high school player drafted No. 1 since  
the Seattle Mariners chose Alex Rodriguez in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen him over the last three years and we believe Josh  
Hamilton was the finest player in the draft this year,'' Tampa Bay 
general manager Chuck LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlins scouting director Al Avila was pleased to get Beckett.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the Josh we wanted,'' Avila said. ``Beckett has good  
size and has an overpowering fastball. He's a bulldog on the 
mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett was the first high school righty taken as high as second  
since Bill Gullickson in 1979. He was 13-2 with an 0.39 ERA and 178 
strikeouts in 89 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit selected Southern California catcher Eric Munson with  
the third pick. Arizona then unexpectedly chose shortstop Corey 
Myers of Phoenix. Minnesota chose outfielder B.J. Garbe, from Moses 
Lake, Wash., with the fifth pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is an outstanding hitter projected to be a right  
fielder, even though he has a 94 mph fastball. He hit .514 with a 
school-record 13 homers and 36 RBIs this season, and is also 
regarded as a sound defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess not going No. 1 wouldn't have totally destroyed me,''  
Hamilton said. ``But there's prestige going No. 1, and I'm 
certainly happy to be No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett, who does not lack confidence, constantly hears the  
comparisons to fellow Texas pitchers Roger Clemens and Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't done nothing yet,'' Beckett said. ``But I think one  
day, I'll live up to all of that. If someone told me different, I'd 
call them a liar. I think I'm going to be better than all those 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, who will be playing in the NCAA's super regionals  
against Stanford starting Friday, is hitting .338 with 14 homers 
and 40 RBIs. The left-handed power hitter missed 21 games because 
of a broken hand midway through the season, but picked up where he 
left off. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers hit .560 and set an Arizona high school record with 22  
homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Garbe, a two-sport star, hit .500 with six homers and 22 RBIs  
this season. He was the first high school quarterback in the state 
to run and pass for over 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal selected left-hander Josh Girdley from Jasper, Texas,  
with the sixth pick. Girdley struck out 29 in 10 innings earlier 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With the seventh pick, Kansas City chose North Carolina  
right-hander Kyle Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh chose high school right-hander Bobby Bradley with the  
eighth pick. Bradley threw seven one-hitters this season in 
Wellington, Fla., and was 12-1 with an 0.38 ERA and 156 strikeouts 
in 92 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland took Southern California left-hander Barry Zito, who had  
three 16-strikeout games this season, with the ninth pick. 
Milwaukee selected Northeast Louisiana right-hander Ben Sheets. 
Sheets, 14-1, had a 20-strikeout game against Louisiana Tech this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds selected Ronald LeFlore, son of former major  
league outfielder Ron, in the sixth round. LeFlore was an 
outfielder at Pinellas Park, Fla. Montreal chose Largo, Fla., 
shortstop Cletis Boyer, son of Clete Boyer, third baseman on five 
New York Yankees World Series teams, in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington right-hander Jeff Heaverlo, whose father, Dave,  
pitched in the majors for seven years, was taken by Seattle with 
the 33rd pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs, with the 26th pick, took Wichita State  
right-hander Ben Christensen, who was suspended by the Missouri 
Valley Conference for hitting Evansville's Anthony Molina in the 
head with a warmup pitch before their game April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch cut Molina over the left eye, broke his cheekbone and  
may have caused permanent damage. Before the suspension, 
Christensen was 9-1 with a 2.40 ERA for the Shockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he regrets the whole thing happening,'' Cubs general  
manager Ed Lynch said. ``In our judgment, he's an outstanding young 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, which had four first-round picks, took Clemson  
right-hander Mike Paradis with the 13th pick, left-hander Richard 
Stahl of Newton, Ga., with the 18th pick, Ball State outfielder 
Larry Bigbie with the 21st pick and Providence outfielder Keith 
Reed with the 23rd pick. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego had three first-rounders and took outfielder Vince  
Faison from Toombs County, Ga., with the 20th pick. With the 28th 
and 29th picks, the Padres took Gerik Baxter, a right-hander from 
Edmonds, Wash., and right-hander Omar Ortiz from Texas-Pan 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto signed third baseman-outfielder Alex Rios, a high school  
star in Puerto Rico, shortly after he was selected with the 19th 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teams -- Anaheim, Atlanta, Cleveland and the New York Mets --  
did not have any picks until the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami shortstop Bobby Hill, expected to be a first-rounder,  
slipped to the second as the Chicago White Sox took him with the 
66th pick.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Up 85.80 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks closed higher Thursday as  
strong sales at the nation's largest retailers reminded investors 
that economic growth isn't necessarily bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.80 to close at  
10,663.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index rose 4.73 to 1,299.54, but the technology-dominated Nasdaq 
composite fell 29.09 to close at 2,403.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock trading has been especially volatile since May 18, when  
the Federal Reserve warned it would raise interest rates if it 
determined that inflation is creeping into the booming U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that warning, the market has turned on every new sign of  
inflationary pressures. Continued signs of growth -- ordinarily a 
boon to stocks -- have spooked investors who fear higher interest 
rates will cut into the profits of major U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, investors welcomed good news from the  
nation's biggest retailers. Most reported stronger-than-expected 
sales in May, with specialty retailers and discounters leading the 
sector. Wal-Mart rose 1 1/8 to 45 1/2, and Gap Inc. gained 3 1/4 to 65 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also gained support from a Commerce Department report  
that showed orders to American factories for manufactured goods 
fell 1.2 percent. The decline suggested that if the Fed does raise 
rates, the increase will be a modest quarter of a percentage point, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Madden, chief investment officer for domestic equities at  
Federated Investors of Pittsburgh, said many market players have 
begun moving money under the assumption that rates will rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a growing consensus that the Fed will  
tighten rates in June,'' he said. ``Maybe that is helping calm the 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders remain focused on the Friday morning release of the  
Labor Department's unemployment data. The wage component of the 
report was expected to offer a more pointed indication of whether 
inflation has returned to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also expected to be moved by the surprise  
resignation of Alice Rivlin, the No. 2 official at the Fed. Rivlin 
announced after the close of the market Thursday that she is 
stepping down after three years as the Fed's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The volatile Internet companies that helped the Nasdaq Stock  
Market rally Wednesday headed lower again. Amazon.com led the 
decliners, and is now worth less than half its value in late April. 
It fell 7 1/16 to 105 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, investors turned to a broad-based range of  
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure looks like rapid sector rotation,'' said Madden. ``The  
market's tone is better, but there's no strong conviction for any 
sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies as diverse as American Express, up 2 15/16 to 121 3/8,  
Hewlett Packard, up 1 11/16 to 91 7/16, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, up 2 
to 93 11/16, led the Dow stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron fell 7/16 to 91 9/16 and Texaco dropped 2 3/16 to 62  
5/16 after the companies called off merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a perception that this might be the end of the giant  
oil merger talks,'' said Robert Stovall, president of 
Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. ``There aren't many other potential 
partners for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Market indexes held steady after the New York Stock Exchange  
announced it will not adopt extended trading hours until at least 
2000. The board that governs the Nasdaq Stock Market expects to 
start an extended schedule as soon as September.

<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the

<HEADLINE> Opposition Indonesia Leader Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of euphoric  
supporters of opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri paraded 
through Jakarta on Thursday, gridlocking the capital with one of 
the biggest rallies of Indonesia's election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans whooped, pounded drums and blew whistles. Horns bleated and  
engines groaned, dimming chants of ``Mega, Mega.'' Her party's 
color was everywhere -- red T-shirts, red jackets, red berets and 
red flags with the cartoonish symbol of a glaring black bull. A 
tractor-trailer rig towed a huge wood-and-canvas bull. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge turnout showed how much Megawati's fortunes have  
shifted since 1996, when the government of then-President Suharto 
engineered her ouster as the pro-reform leader of one of three 
officially approved political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	At one rally in Jakarta, which began with a band playing U.S.  
rap music, she reminded people that Suharto had tried to destroy 
her party. Suharto, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati also reiterated a call for supporters to stick around  
after casting their ballots, particularly in rural areas, to stymie 
vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make sure everyone only votes once,'' she said as a dozen  
parachutists landed in the crowd carrying large party flags. 
</P>
<P>
	With democratic change sweeping Indonesia, Megawati has emerged  
as a frontrunner ahead of Monday's parliamentary elections, 
expected to be the nation's fairest in 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-eight parties are vying for seats in Parliament, whose  
members will help choose a president later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign officially wraps up Friday, followed by a two-day  
cooling-off period. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati inspires adulation that owes much to the memory of her  
charismatic father, Indonesia's founding President Sukarno. He died 
in 1970 after losing his grasp on power to an ascendant Suharto, 
then an army general. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has been largely peaceful. On Thursday night, about  
300 supporters of the People's Democratic Party protested near the 
General Election Committee headquarters, demanding the release of 
their jailed leader. Budiman Sudjatmiko was sentenced to 13 years 
in 1997 for fomenting a riot. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested about 60 supporters of the ruling Golkar Party  
on Thursday, confiscating slingshots and arrows, after brief 
clashes with three other parties in the South Sulawesi provincial 
capital of Ujungpandang, about 900 miles northeast of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Police fired warning shots to disperse Megawati supporters  
beating up two Golkar backers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West Java town of Cirebon, dozens of people were injured  
in clashes Wednesday involving Golkar, Megawati's party and the 
Muslim-based United Development Party, the daily Kompas newspaper 
reported. Buildings, cars and motorcycles were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes also broke out Wednesday in the Bali capital of Denpasar  
between supporters of Golkar and Megawati's Indonesian Democratic 
Party for Struggle. Several people were injured, while one car was 
burned and some houses were damaged, including the local Golkar 
leader's home. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, throngs of Megawati revelers gathered at the pool  
surrounding the Welcome Monument, a tall pedestal topped by a 
statue of a waving young man and woman in the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 32 years of disruption and pain, I think this is the  
right time for Mega to show her power,'' said Ibeng Viki, a 
27-year-old member of Megawati's party.

<HEADLINE>  Tampa Bay, Florida Get Their Joshes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Florida Marlins  
each got the Josh they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay selected Josh Hamilton, an outfielder from Athens  
Drive High School in Raleigh, N.C., with the first pick in 
Wednesday's draft, while Florida took Josh Beckett, a right-hander 
from Spring, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton became the first high school player drafted No. 1 since  
the Seattle Mariners chose Alex Rodriguez in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen him over the last three years and we believe Josh  
Hamilton was the finest player in the draft this year,'' Tampa Bay 
general manager Chuck LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlins scouting director Al Avila was pleased to get Beckett.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the Josh we wanted,'' Avila said. ``Beckett has good  
size and has an overpowering fastball. He's a bulldog on the 
mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett was the first high school righty taken as high as second  
since Bill Gullickson in 1979. He was 13-2 with an 0.39 ERA and 178 
strikeouts in 89 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit selected Southern California catcher Eric Munson with  
the third pick. Arizona then unexpectedly chose shortstop Corey 
Myers of Phoenix. Minnesota chose outfielder B.J. Garbe, from Moses 
Lake, Wash., with the fifth pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is an outstanding hitter projected to be a right  
fielder, even though he has a 94 mph fastball. He hit .514 with a 
school-record 13 homers and 36 RBIs this season, and is also 
regarded as a sound defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess not going No. 1 wouldn't have totally destroyed me,''  
Hamilton said. ``But there's prestige going No. 1, and I'm 
certainly happy to be No. 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett, who does not lack confidence, constantly hears the  
comparisons to fellow Texas pitchers Roger Clemens and Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ain't done nothing yet,'' Beckett said. ``But I think one  
day, I'll live up to all of that. If someone told me different, I'd 
call them a liar. I think I'm going to be better than all those 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Munson, who will be playing in the NCAA's super regionals  
against Stanford starting Friday, is hitting .338 with 14 homers 
and 40 RBIs. The left-handed power hitter missed 21 games because 
of a broken hand midway through the season, but picked up where he 
left off. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers hit .560 and set an Arizona high school record with 22  
homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Garbe, a two-sport star, hit .500 with six homers and 22 RBIs  
this season. He was the first high school quarterback in the state 
to run and pass for over 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal selected left-hander Josh Girdley from Jasper, Texas,  
with the sixth pick. Girdley struck out 29 in 10 innings earlier 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With the seventh pick, Kansas City chose North Carolina  
right-hander Kyle Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh chose high school right-hander Bobby Bradley with the  
eighth pick. Bradley threw seven one-hitters this season in 
Wellington, Fla., and was 12-1 with an 0.38 ERA and 156 strikeouts 
in 92 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland took Southern California left-hander Barry Zito, who had  
three 16-strikeout games this season, with the ninth pick. 
Milwaukee selected Northeast Louisiana right-hander Ben Sheets. 
Sheets, 14-1, had a 20-strikeout game against Louisiana Tech this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Reds selected Ronald LeFlore, son of former major  
league outfielder Ron, in the sixth round. LeFlore was an 
outfielder at Pinellas Park, Fla. Montreal chose Largo, Fla., 
shortstop Cletis Boyer, son of Clete Boyer, third baseman on five 
New York Yankees World Series teams, in the seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington right-hander Jeff Heaverlo, whose father, Dave,  
pitched in the majors for seven years, was taken by Seattle with 
the 33rd pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs, with the 26th pick, took Wichita State  
right-hander Ben Christensen, who was suspended by the Missouri 
Valley Conference for hitting Evansville's Anthony Molina in the 
head with a warmup pitch before their game April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch cut Molina over the left eye, broke his cheekbone and  
may have caused permanent damage. Before the suspension, 
Christensen was 9-1 with a 2.40 ERA for the Shockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he regrets the whole thing happening,'' Cubs general  
manager Ed Lynch said. ``In our judgment, he's an outstanding young 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, which had four first-round picks, took Clemson  
right-hander Mike Paradis with the 13th pick, left-hander Richard 
Stahl of Newton, Ga., with the 18th pick, Ball State outfielder 
Larry Bigbie with the 21st pick and Providence outfielder Keith 
Reed with the 23rd pick. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego had three first-rounders and took outfielder Vince  
Faison from Toombs County, Ga., with the 20th pick. With the 28th 
and 29th picks, the Padres took Gerik Baxter, a right-hander from 
Edmonds, Wash., and right-hander Omar Ortiz from Texas-Pan 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto signed third baseman-outfielder Alex Rios, a high school  
star in Puerto Rico, shortly after he was selected with the 19th 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teams -- Anaheim, Atlanta, Cleveland and the New York Mets --  
did not have any picks until the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami shortstop Bobby Hill, expected to be a first-rounder,  
slipped to the second as the Chicago White Sox took him with the 
66th pick.

<HEADLINE>  Duncan Unfazed by MVP Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Tim Duncan didn't win the MVP award many  
people thought he deserved. He didn't even finish second. 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed hardly to care, though, as he and his San Antonio  
teammates prepared for Friday night's Game 3 against the Portland 
Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals. After all, the two 
players who finished ahead of him in the MVP voting, Karl Malone 
and Alonzo Mourning, are finished for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan and the Spurs are two victories away from the NBA Finals.  
That means a lot more than any MVP award, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be right here right now, I'll tell you that,''  
Duncan said. ``I'm very happy with the position that I'm in right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Mario Elie said such an attitude is typical for the  
team-oriented Duncan, who in just two years has become the Spurs' 
go-to player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of disappointed he was all the way down to third,''  
Elie said. ``I understand those other two guys had terrific years. 
But we had the best record in the league. We won all the big games 
we needed to win, and Tim was a big part of that. I guess a lot had 
to do with Tim being in his second year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize Karl Malone has a thousand games under his belt, but  
I felt this year Tim was the best player in the league. Karl Malone 
is out fishing or driving his 18-wheeler across the country. Tim is 
still in the hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan gives himself an average grade so far in the Western  
Conference finals, even though he's averaged 22 points and 11.5 
rebounds per game and shooting 61.5 percent from the field as the 
Spurs took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Average for him,'' teammate Sean Elliott said, ``but above  
average for anybody else. He can probably play better, but you've 
got to give credit to Portland, too. That's their defensive 
scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio is 4-0 on the road in the playoffs, and the Spurs  
are one of three teams to beat the Blazers in Portland this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it is,'' Duncan said. ``In a hostile  
environment, we just get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The youthful Blazers, meanwhile, feed off the noise of the Rose  
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a dangerous team at home,'' Jim Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
	While the Spurs are preaching teamwork, sacrifice and  
cohesiveness, the Blazers were weathering Damon Stoudamire's 
ill-timed outburst. The Portland point guard is unhappy about being 
benched in the fourth quarter in favor of Greg Anthony. Stoudamire 
lashed out at the situation after practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get over it, but I'm never going to forget it,'' he said  
in a wide-ranging conversation that also included a jab at his 
persistent critics in Portland, where he grew up and was a high 
school star. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Mike Dunleavy, who earned NBA coach of the year  
honors for dealing with such problems on a deep, talented and young 
team, downplayed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments don't bother me. The timing of it at this point  
maybe does a little bit,'' Dunleavy said Thursday. ``But it's 
nothing that major. I don't think it's going to affect the way he 
plays tomorrow night. It's not going to affect the way I coach 
tomorrow night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day layoff has not erased the pain of Elliott's tip-toe  
3-pointer that beat Portland 86-85 Monday night in Game 2, a game 
the Blazers led by as many as 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``To wait this long, it eats at you,'' Jackson said, ``but you  
know you have a chance for it to set in and hurt, because you know 
you gave a game away, or maybe two away, and you've got to have a 
time period where you sit there and think about it, about the 
little things you did wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has shown a marked contrast between the high emotion  
of the fragile Blazers and the even, uncomplaining keel of the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're an older group,'' Elliott said. ``We've been through  
situations in our careers where maybe we were unhappy with our 
playing time or we were unhappy with the number of shots we got. 
But we're beyond that now. Guys here aren't trying to star in 
commercials. We're trying to win. We don't have a lot of time left 
on these legs, so we're trying to get it done now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, who played on two championship teams in Houston, senses  
that special something on this team, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a confident group. We've got a lot of trust in each  
other,'' he said. ``That's what I like. A guy can miss all day but 
if he's open, you get him the ball. That's what this team has been 
about all year, trusting each other, sharing the ball. We've got a 
bond right now that's hard to explain. We feel good about each 
other.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Gets Case in Conspiracy Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- The conspiracy trial of five lawmen accused  
of railroading a man for the slaying of a 10-year-old girl went to 
the jury Thursday after defense attorneys said the man's testimony 
was riddled with lies. 
</P>
<P>
	Several jurors chuckled as attorney Brian Telander ridiculed  
Rolando Cruz for the many contradictions and admitted lies he was 
confronted with when he testified that he never made an 
incriminating statement to detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy lied so much that his name should be Pinocchio, not  
Rolando,'' Telander said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also highlighted Cruz's admission on the witness stand that  
he is seeing a psychiatrist and working on his problem with lying. 
</P>
<P>
	But special prosecutor William Kunkle argued that a history of  
questionable actions, nonexistent reports and evolving statements 
prove the four county sheriff's deputies and an ex-county 
prosecutor lied and concocted evidence against Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	He was twice convicted and spent nearly a decade on death row  
for the 1983 rape and bludgeoning death of 10-year-old Jeanine 
Nicarico of Naperville. 
</P>
<P>
	The authorities ignored evidence that another man may have  
committed the crime alone because it conflicted with their 
overzealous pursuit of Cruz, Kunkle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was acquitted in 1995 at his third trial, when a dramatic  
change in testimony by one of the deputies cast doubt on the 
contention that Cruz gave two sheriff's detectives incriminating 
details in a May 9, 1983, statement describing a ``dream'' or 
``vision'' about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	No police report was ever made on Cruz's alleged statement, and  
Kunkle contends the detectives made it up. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice  
and conspiracy to commit official misconduct. The deputies face 
additional charges, including perjury.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- A sickout by Cathay Pacific Airways pilots  
forced cancellation of another 42 flights Wednesday, with no end to 
the pay dispute in sight and dozens of frustrated passengers 
stranded at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong's commissioner of labor, has been  
trying to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table. He met 
behind closed doors with leaders of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers 
Association Wednesday, and said he would meet with management 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay has canceled a total of 187 flights -- including 42 on  
Wednesday. More than 20,000 passengers have been affected since 
Friday, when dozens of Cathay pilots, claiming they were under too 
much stress because of the company's layoff threats, began to take 
sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is putting passengers on other flights, including 20  
flights chartered from rival airlines. It also has stopped taking 
bookings for flights until June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay and its pilots have been locked in a dispute since the  
company asked its senior pilots to take an 8 percent pay cut in 
exchange for stock options, hoping to cut costs and return to 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the two sides deteriorated last week, when  
Cathay bosses gave the pilots until June 11 to either accept a 
revised offer, which includes a smaller pay cut and better stock 
options, quit or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association insisted  
that Cathay promise them pay increases after they take cuts for two 
years and pay freeze for another year. Cathay rejected their offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when the economy was going well, no company could promise  
its staff long-term pay increases,'' Cathay spokeswoman Quince 
Chong told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots say they will take a strike vote if anybody is fired,  
but Chong refused to disclose Cathay's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many passengers said Wednesday they had arrived the airport  
hours early to secure their seats. Others, having waited for days 
to leave, were angry and tired. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethany Stroh-Gingrich, 19, from Toronto, has been stranded  
since Saturday, when she lost her seat because she failed to check 
in two hours ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, 'You're stuck here until the 19th,' and I say, 'No,  
I'm not,''' said Stroh-Gingrich, who was teaching English in Hong 
Kong but wants to go home for college. 
</P>
<P>
	Chong would not say how many demands for compensation Cathay has  
received, but the airline insists it is doing all it can to get 
people to their destinations.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Drop 1.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to American factories for manufactured  
goods fell 1.2 percent in April, reflecting a big drop in demand 
for aircraft and other transportation products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the decrease in  
factory orders in April followed a 1.9 percent advance in March and 
was only the second decline in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the weakness was confined to the volatile  
transportation sector. Excluding transportation, factory orders 
would have risen by 0.5 percent, posting the fifth increase in the 
past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing has been the hardest-hit sector from the global  
currency crisis, suffering from a big drop in export sales and 
competition from a flood of cheaper imports coming into the 
country. Over the past year, more than 400,000 U.S. factory jobs 
have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many economists believe they are seeing signs of a  
turnaround, with orders starting to gain in recent months. A 
separate survey done earlier this week by the National Association 
of Purchasing Managers also reported strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets have grown jittery in recent days over  
concerns that with a rebound in manufacturing and other sectors 
showing continued strength, an expected slowing of overall growth 
this year may not occur. 
</P>
<P>
	If it does not, the Federal Reserve let it be known two weeks  
ago that it stands ready to raise interest rates to slow growth and 
keep inflation from becoming a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate report today showed that labor markets remain tight.  
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits 
rose, but only a slight 4,000 to 305,000 last week. This level is 
still reguarded as one signaling extremely low unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will release its estimate of unemployment for May  
on Friday and many economists believe the figure will remain at 4.3 
percent, near the lowest level in 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce report on factory orders showed that demand in  
transportation plummeted by 12.3 percent in April with the fall-off 
led by a $3.2 billion decline in orders for airplanes and parts. 
Orders for ships and military tanks were off by $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The report showed that orders for durable goods, items expected  
to last three or more years, fell 2.1 percent, slightly less than a 
preliminary report last week that had put the decline at 2.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for non-durable goods dipped a slight 0.1 percent in  
April with declines in food and paper offsetting increases in 
textile products. Non-durable goods orders had been up 0.7 percent 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for primary metals, including steel, showed an increase  
of 1.6 percent for April. The steel industry has been one of the 
hardest hit by the Asian crisis, suffering from a flood of cheaper 
imported steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelmakers have petitioned the government for the imposition of  
penalty tariffs on the imported products and have warned without 
the relief thousands more American workers will have to be laid 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for industrial machinery rose 3.6 percent in April, led  
by a huge 21.3 percent jump in demand for engines and turbines, the 
secong strong monthly increase in this sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic equipment rose by 0.5 percent with strong  
demand for electrical lighting and wiring equipment.

<HEADLINE> PBS Plans Late-Night Newscast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new late-night national newscast from the team  
behind public television's ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' is expected 
to make it on the air early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, about a dozen PBS stations have agreed to air the show,  
which is being developed with The New York Times, said Robert 
MacNeil, the former ``NewsHour'' anchor who is working on it for 
MacNeil-Lehrer Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil said the second newscast, to air at 11 p.m. ET, will  
provide a substantive alternative to the ``body bag'' journalism of 
late-night local news programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, MacNeil and Lehrer received Quinnipiac College's Fred  
Friendly First Amendment Award on Wednesday for their nightly 
newscast, which celebrates its 25th anniversary next year. MacNeil 
retired from the show in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting their awards, both men sharply denounced TV networks  
for viewing news as entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Friendly, the former CBS News president and Columbia  
University professor who helped put MacNeil and Lehrer together as 
a team, would be appalled at many news programs today, Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
	With their opinionated reporters, invasions of privacy and  
public leering, many news shows resemble professional wrestling, 
Lehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are on to what's going on in television  
news,'' he said, ``and television news is either going to change or 
become even more irrelevant than it already is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MacNeil suggested the lust for ratings makes public television  
news even more important than when ``NewsHour'' began in 1975. Even 
PBS is not immune, said MacNeil, who suggested the recent 
controversy about PBS's ``Washington Week in Review'' illustrated 
what happens when ratings become paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's former moderator, Ken Bode, walked away after he said  
new management there wanted ``more attitude'' at the program. 
Management denied the characterization, but it proved an 
embarrassingly public airing of differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``By dumbing itself down, by whoring just for numbers, public  
television will lose not only its numbers but its soul,'' MacNeil 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Spurs Head to Portland for Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs have beaten the  
Portland Trail Blazers five straight times. Of the three games 
Portland lost at home this season, one was to San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	So logic would dictate that the Spurs would be have some swagger  
as they approach Game 3 of the Western Conference finals Friday 
night at Portland's Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, though, are smarter than that.  
</P>
<P>
	They know how lucky they were to escape the Alamodome with a 2-0  
lead in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't played good basketball yet, not the way we  
want to,'' David Robinson said after the team held a final practice 
in San Antonio on Wednesday before flying to the Pacific Northwest. 
``We were really fortunate. We don't want to put ourselves in that 
position again, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson was even more emphatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going up there humbled,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson thinks he knows how tough the 80-76 and 86-85 losses in  
San Antonio were on the Blazers' psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went through the same thing last year with Utah, losing  
close games,'' Robinson said, ``and it hurts because you feel like 
you gave it away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have won eight playoff games in a row and are 4-0 on  
the road in the playoffs. They like some things about being away 
from the Alamodome and the Spurs-crazy city of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The road is excellent because you've got less distractions,''  
Mario Elie said. ``At home, you've got family members, people 
calling. You can't go to the store because people are telling you 
that you're great. We haven't accomplished anything yet. We've just 
won two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the road, it's just you and your teammates, and your  
concentration level is high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Isaiah Rider said after the Blazers practiced  
Wednesday that his right knee feels better and he expects to be 
ready Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The knee, originally injured against Phoenix in the first round,  
locked up in the third quarter Monday night, and Rider sat out the 
final period, much to his obvious disgust at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just really sore,'' he said. ``It just locked up on me. I  
popped it out and made it swell and made it really sore. It has a 
spot there that's really tender. It's just a freak thing, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider averaged 19 points in the Blazers' series victories  
against Phoenix and Utah. He's scored only 16 in the two San 
Antonio games. He said he accepts his more limited role against San 
Antonio as Portland focuses on the matchup advantages Rasheed 
Wallace has at forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I want the ball, that's just me,'' Rider said.  
``I'd like to turn it up at any point in time. But I don't want to 
go out there and take all kinds of crazy shots just because I did 
well in the first two series. I still want to play in the confines 
of our team and not be an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for Damon Stoudamire, who hates the fact  
that Dunleavy usually sits him in the fourth quarter in favor of 
Greg Anthony. When Stoudamire finally did get to play down the 
stretch in Game 2, he hit several jumpers, but also had a big 
turnover and missed a critical free throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I sit in the fourth quarter, I won't be happy. That's just  
the bottom line,'' Stoudamire said. ``I'm going to accept it, but I 
won't be happy about it. ... I'll get over this, but I'm never 
going to forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire wouldn't elaborate on whether his relationship with  
Dunleavy has gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a story for another day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, who won the NBA coach of the year award for keeping  
the multitude of big egos and emotional players on his roster 
together all season, said that matchups and how each player is 
playing will determine who goes at point guard in the fourth 
quarter Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, meanwhile, neatly wrapped up his team's situation in a  
single quote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably should be 1-1,'' he said. ``With a little luck, we  
could be 2-0. With a little luck, they are 2-0.''

<HEADLINE> Tiny Company Takes On Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- As Microsoft Corp.'s pivotal antitrust  
trial winds down in Washington, D.C., the big software maker faced 
a second judge and jury Thursday, but the issues were similar. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft stood accused of attempting to throttle a competitor.  
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements were heard in a civil suit filed by Bristol  
Technology Inc., a tiny software company that claims that the maker 
of the Windows computer operating system is improperly withholding 
programming code that Bristol needs to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	If Microsoft loses this trial, it would erode the company's  
contention in the larger case that its business dealings, while 
aggressive, are legal. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial opened in U.S. District Court, a lawyer for Bristol  
told the 10-member jury that Microsoft used Bristol as a business 
partner to move into the large corporate computing market, then 
reneged on its promise to continue to supply Bristol with 
technology it needs to make its main software product. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lawyer for Microsoft told the jury that Bristol's lawsuit  
is nothing more than an attempt by Bristol to force more favorable 
business arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	In the larger antitrust case in Washington -- brought by the  
Justice Department and 19 states -- the government contends that 
Microsoft illegally wielded monopoly power from its dominant 
Windows product to expand into new markets, such as Internet 
software, and thus crush competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs,  
such as word processors and spreadsheets, written to work with 
Windows to be converted to run on computers with different 
operating systems such as Unix. Operating systems are the central 
nervous system of computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Microsoft signed a three-year contract with Bristol  
giving the company access to software blueprints for Windows NT 
3.0, a version of its operating system designed to work with 
powerful corporate computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those blueprints allowed Bristol to make Wind/U, but the  
agreement expired in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol filed its lawsuit after the two companies could not  
reach a new agreement for access to the blueprints for the newer 
versions of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening arguments, Bristol attorney Patrick Lynch told the  
jury that Microsoft first approached Bristol in 1992 about working 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said Bristol executives were wary about becoming  
Microsoft's partner, because they realized they would be dependent 
on the Microsoft software blueprints, known as the ``source code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew that when an elephant asks a mouse to dance, it's a  
mouse that's in danger, not the elephant,'' Lynch said. But he said 
Bristol agreed to the deal after Microsoft made public statements 
indicating support for allowing programs to work on multiple 
operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said that when Bristol went to Microsoft and asked for a  
new contract, Microsoft offered only limited access to Windows 
source code. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft attorney David Tulchin told the jury that Bristol  
hired a public relations firm and attorneys months before it filed 
its lawsuit, while it claimed to be negotiating a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bristol chose litigation instead of negotiation,'' Tulchin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bristol rejected the new contract because Microsoft  
wanted more money. But he said Microsoft was able to negotiate a 
contract with similar terms with Mainsoft, Bristol's main 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol called one of its founders, Ken Blackwell, as its first  
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell, Bristol's chief technical officer, testified that  
Microsoft executives repeatedly said they were committed to 
providing Microsoft source code for future versions of Windows NT, 
beyond the three-year contract it had signed with Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Janet Hall told the jury that in order to  
find in favor of Bristol, that company must prove that Microsoft 
has monopoly power or a probability of obtaining monopoly power, 
and that it was willfully obtained by anti-competitive conduct. 
Microsoft has denied it is a monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. On Friday,  
Bristol is expected to play a videotaped deposition from Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates.

<HEADLINE> Five Dead After Interstate Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- A truck drifted off the highway, jumped an  
embankment and crashed on top of an oxygen tanker Thursday, 
exploding the tanker and killing five people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just like a bomb going off,'' said Albert Hart of  
Canton, Ohio. ``There were 75 feet of flames that went up in a 
mushroom cloud and black smoke so thick you couldn't see through 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the driver of a Ryder tractor-trailer apparently  
fell asleep at the wheel, and his truck drifted off the side of 
Interstate 40 west near a rest area where other trucks were parked. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck hit a depression, then jumped off an embankment and  
landed on top of an oxygen tanker. The tanker exploded, throwing 
the Ryder truck into an 18-wheeler, which in turn struck another 
tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Ryder and tanker trucks were destroyed in the fire. Two  
people died in each truck. It was unclear which truck the fifth 
fatality was in.

<HEADLINE> Pats Look To Buy Property for Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- The New England Patriots' plan to build a  
$225 million megaplex had better include $2 million if the team 
wants to buy Norman Lawton's little piece of land next to the 
current stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Lawton says, anyway. He's lived on the property,  
which his family has owned since 1720, for 70 of his 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some flowers and then some. It's a pretty little  
location and I'm used to being able to hit the driveway at night,'' 
the retired chicken geneticist said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of frustrating negotiations to build a stadium, the  
Patriots are moving quickly since the May 24 signing ceremony in 
which Gov. Paul Cellucci signed a bill giving $70 million in state 
money for the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil Campos, a real estate agent with RE-MAX Real Estate Center,  
said the Patriots asked him last week to visit Lawton and others on 
North Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was taking the temperature to see who was interested and who  
wasn't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots have four options for relieving traffic around the  
stadium, which would involve buying one to five homes nearby, 
Campos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to make it as least impactive as possible,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, said Campos, ``most people have said they'd prefer,  
obviously, not to move.''

<HEADLINE> Investigators Examining Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators say they'd like to  
interview all 136 survivors from the crash of an American Airlines 
jetliner at Little Rock National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The survivors have a question of their own: Why did the pilot  
try to land the plane during a hail storm? 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combination of weather and pilot error. He should  
have gone to another airport,'' said Richard Klamm, 49, of Pine 
Bluff, who was in the first-class section of the plane as part of 
its metal skin was sheared off by a light tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 145 people on board, including the pilot, were  
killed when Flight 1420 crashed while landing during a violent 
storm just before midnight Tuesday. The storm unleashed hail, 
lightning and wind gusts to 75 mph at the airport. The National 
Weather Service reported gusts of 87 mph nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should not have landed. He should have gone somewhere  
else,'' said passenger Mohammad Abdelkhali, 38, of Menlo Park, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Wednesday it was too early to say if the  
rapidly moving storm caused or contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ultimately a pilot's decision to land or not, but they  
have to base that on the information they have,'' said George 
Black, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said it felt like the aircraft never got a grip on  
the rain-slickened runway. Braking seemed useless, and the plane 
rolled off the runway and down an embankment, striking steel 
supports for approach lights and breaking apart. It also caught 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no traction,'' said Carla Koen of Little Rock. ``We  
started sliding sideways and the next thing I knew there were 
flames in the back of the plane and there was a pole in the side of 
the plane and people were jumping out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Buschmann, who was killed, was a veteran American  
pilot with 5,500 hours of flight time in the MD-80 series of 
aircraft, which includes the MD-82. As a chief pilot in American's 
Chicago operation, he supervised other pilots and flew passenger 
planes for two months each year. 
</P>
<P>
	First Officer Michael Origel should be able to explain what  
Buschmann was told about the weather, Black said. American Airlines 
executive vice president Bob Baker said regular weather updates 
were relayed to the captain. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB investigators hoped to talk to Origel today but were  
waiting for a doctor's authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines' chief pilot, Cecil Ewell, said he would not  
have attempted to land the plane if wind speeds exceeded 57.5 mph. 
He oversees all of American Airlines' pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB recovered the flight recorder and data box from the  
wreckage and was looking for clues for any mechanical problems. The 
Federal Aviation Administration said there was no distress call 
before the landing. 
</P>
<P>
	A check of the plane's maintenance records revealed no major  
problems. Twelve years ago, one of its engines lost power during a 
landing in Las Vegas because the housing around a part had worn 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also were looking into a power outage at the  
airport, which may have contributed to the crash or been caused by 
it, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, investigators will consider that the crew had been  
on duty for 13 1/2 hours, just short of the federal maximum of 14. 
They were on the last leg of a flight schedule that started in 
Chicago and stopped in Salt Lake City and Dallas before ending in 
Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft wound up 150 yards from the Arkansas River, where  
passengers, some drenched in aviation fuel, slogged through mud and 
weeds to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact on the left side of the cockpit killed Buschmann at  
the controls, then peeled away the airplane's metal skin down the 
left side of the first-class section. The back section of the plane 
whipped around and broke away from the front half as the plane went 
over a levee and struck the light rigging. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel spilling from the broken fuselage ignited a fire that  
burned about a third of the jet. Hospitals said they treated 83 
people for injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Some escaped through cracks in the fuselage and others through  
emergency doors so crumpled that only one person could slip out at 
a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Ozmun, an assistant professor at Ouachita Baptist  
University in Arkadelphia, said he and others jumped off a burning 
wing into shallow water. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, sad to say, it was all self-preservation,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities were the first aboard a U.S. carrier in nearly 1 1/2  
years. They also were the first in a commercial carrier at Little 
Rock's airport in its 82-year history.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Gets Top On-Time Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- For the first time since September  
1996, Northwest Airlines has earned a No. 1 ranking in monthly 
on-time performance among the nation's seven biggest carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the carrier also drew the highest rate of consumer  
complaints for April, according to the Transportation Department's 
Air Travel Consumer Report issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's on-time performance for April was 80.6 percent,  
slightly ahead of TWA at 80.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest drew 2.71 consumer complaints for every 100,000  
passenger boardings. That compared with 1.39 complaints per 100,000 
passenger boardings at Continental Airlines, Northwest's domestic 
alliance partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's consumer complaints for the month were only slightly  
worse than those at American Airlines and US Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	For two consecutive quarters in the middle of last year,  
Northwest ranked last among the nation's 10 largest carriers in 
on-time performance. The ratings coincided with a work slowdown by 
mechanics and other ground workers who were disgruntled by 
drawn-out contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest still hasn't settled contracts with its flight  
attendants and mechanics. The results of a strike authorization 
vote by flight attendants will be announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to promptly and expeditiously conclude those  
contracts on fair and equitable terms,'' said Richard Anderson, 
Northwest executive vice president and chief operating officer. ``I 
think we're anxious to have the flight attendant contract done.''

<HEADLINE> China to Banks: Close Yuan Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Trying to tighten control over foreign  
exchange, China has ordered the handful of banks abroad that handle 
its currency to stop, bankers and regulators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Administration of Foreign Exchange ordered foreign  
institutions to close yuan accounts after June 10, officials told 
Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese yuan doesn't trade on world markets, and it is  
illegal to take yuan out of China. But banks abroad were allowed to 
handle yuan in some situations, and regulators say about 3,000 
institutions -- mostly in Hong Kong -- were doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't clear how many yuan are held abroad. And while Beijing  
had seemed to ignore the foreign trading, the new ban suggests it 
was heavy enough to worry regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuan transfers from abroad before June 10 will be honored,  
according to a government document from the Bank of China, the main 
state foreign-exchange bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The yuan is convertible only to buy goods and services at  
government-controlled exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Those controls let China hold the yuan steady during the Asian  
financial crisis while traders drove down other Asian currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	China wants to keep the yuan out of foreign hands in order to  
avoid having to spend any of its $146 billion in foreign currency 
reserves to defend its value.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Rampage Leaves Four Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A former Marine dressed in camouflage blasted  
away with a pump-action shotgun as he roamed through a supermarket 
before sunrise Thursday, killing four employees and critically 
wounding one, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested the gunman in the parking lot after talking him  
out of killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were alerted by a 911 call from inside the Albertsons  
supermarket as shots were being fired. They confronted a man with a 
goatee and shaved head who walked out the door with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He placed the gun to his head and officers were able to talk  
him into surrendering,'' Lt. Rick Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were all shot at point-blank range, Officer Steve  
Meriwether said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zane Floyd, 23, who was honorably discharged from the Marine at  
Camp Pendleton, Calif., last July and worked part-time as a bouncer 
at a bar, was arrested for investigation of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were baffled as to what triggered the rampage,  
Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not found any connection between Floyd and the  
victims -- three men and a woman -- and there was no indication he 
had had any run-ins at the store. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing the gunman had an accomplice, police took at least three  
hours to search and clear the store, finding two employees hiding 
in a walk-in vegetable cooler. More than 20 people were in the 
store when shooting started. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which has 995 stores in 25 states, sent counselors  
to help employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, Floyd moved from an apartment into a guest house  
behind his parents' home just two blocks from the supermarket, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all they talked about is when he would be coming home  
from leave. They did everything they could for him,'' said neighbor 
Cathy Downey. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd served four years in the Marines. After the Marines, he  
started college but dropped out, Downey said. Floyd had worked one 
day a week for the past month at Sneakers, a sports bar in Las 
Vegas, said bar manager Tom Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a regular 23-year-old guy who likes to party and hang out  
just like me. I don't understand what happened,'' said Tony 
Marquez, a fellow bouncer.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavs React Quietly to Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- There was neither dancing in the  
streets nor an outpouring of grief Thursday after Belgrade 
residents heard that Slobodan Milosevic had agreed to NATO demands 
and Serb troops would be leaving Kosovo, Serbia's ancient 
heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Yugoslav government strived to present its acceptance of  
Western peace terms as a wise and timely decision, some wondered 
whether more than 2 1/2 months of NATO bombings were really necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I really wish is that this all ends as quickly as  
possible,'' said Draga Milosavljevic, a 56-year-old saleswoman in a 
Belgrade grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if what was accepted today is the same offer as two months  
ago, then it was criminal to let the country be crippled and 
devastated -- so many people got killed, for what?'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from the gloom that prevailed among lawmakers in the  
Serb parliament as it endorsed a peace plan brought here by Russian 
and European Union peace envoys, the deputies knew it was a 
capitulation. 
</P>
<P>
	On the surface, Thursday was no different from any other day  
since NATO airstrikes began on March 24 -- sonic booms from allied 
jets rocked the capital, and air raid sirens sounded daytime alerts 
and all-clears. 
</P>
<P>
	Night after night of air raids and bombings have frayed the  
nerves of Milosavljevic and others. Milosavljevic admits all she 
wishes for now is calm sleep for her granddaughter, awakened every 
time NATO blasts shake the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said they had seen the capitulation coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever tragedy is inevitable, he gets the parliament to do  
the dirty job for him,'' said Dusan Gajic, 29, a college student. 
``It's common knowledge Milosevic always ruled without consulting 
even his closest associates -- he decided the destinies of millions 
for them.''

<HEADLINE> Patrick Finally Gets Shot at Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- James Patrick was looking for a team. The  
Buffalo Sabres were looking for an experienced defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	So they got together when Buffalo signed Patrick as an  
unrestricted free agent in October. Now they're four victories away 
from a Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres haven't won a Cup since they joined the NHL in 1970.  
The NHL's top prize eluded them in 1975 when Fred Shero's 
Philadelphia Flyers beat them in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick also came close. The New York Rangers traded him to  
Hartford during the 1993-94 season before winning the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're a kid, you dream of playing in the NHL and winning  
the Stanley Cup,'' Patrick said Wednesday. ``Once you come into the 
league, you realize how hard it is to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, who defeated Toronto in the Eastern Conference  
final, will play the winner of the Colorado-Dallas series, which 
concludes Friday with Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick, a quiet and unassuming leader who fields more questions  
about the games from his 7-year-old daughter than he gets from the 
media, knows this could be his last shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely running out of time,'' he said. ``Right now I'm  
just thinking about right now and just trying to enjoy this 
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted in the first round by the Rangers in 1981, Patrick found  
his playing time cut dramatically in the 1993-94 season when he 
didn't get along with New York coach Mike Keenan. Then came the 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The frustrating part for me was wondering where my career was  
going and knowing that I no longer fit with the Rangers' plans,'' 
Patrick said. ``I wasn't being used and I started to question my 
ability. When I got traded, I was happy to move on and try to get 
my career back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers went on to win their first Stanley Cup in 54 years.  
Patrick went on to Calgary in a trade after spending just 47 games 
with the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	After five enjoyable but uneventful seasons in Calgary, Patrick  
signed with Buffalo as an unrestricted free agent before the season 
opener in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking for a little maturity and leadership in the  
back end,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, whose team lost to the 
Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference final last season. 
``We thought it was something that was lacking in the playoffs last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick, who turns 36 in two weeks, has done everything the  
Sabres have asked, and that has included sitting down. He played in 
45 games during the season and was a healthy scratch for 33 more. 
</P>
<P>
	A healthy corps of younger defensemen, including newcomer Rhett  
Warrener, made Patrick seem expendable, and the veteran didn't play 
in 16 of the last 18 games of the regular season. He also sat out 
the Sabres' first playoff game, a 2-1 win over Ottawa that saw the 
Senators score a power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff turned to Patrick for his experience and penalty-killing  
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great penalty killer and doesn't tighten up in key  
situations,'' Ruff said. ``He's the type of player you want to 
surround your young guys with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick secured a spot with Jason Woolley. Patrick plays the  
role of the steady, stay-at-home defenseman. That allows Woolley, 
the Sabres' leading scorer in the playoffs, to charge out 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does a great job killing penalties and moving the puck out  
of the zone, whether it's banking it off the glass or making a nice 
pass,'' Sabres wing Dixon Ward said. ``He rarely gets caught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not flashy, not a big hitter and not a big shooter, but  
he plays the game smart and he's always ready,'' Ward said. ``He 
stepped into the second game of the playoffs and I thought he was 
our best defenseman after playing two games in a month and a 
half.''

<HEADLINE>  Spurs Head to Portland for Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs have beaten the  
Portland Trail Blazers five straight times. Of the three games 
Portland lost at home this season, one was to San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	So logic would dictate that the Spurs would be have some swagger  
as they approach Game 3 of the Western Conference finals Friday 
night at Portland's Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, though, are smarter than that.  
</P>
<P>
	They know how lucky they were to escape the Alamodome with a 2-0  
lead in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't played good basketball yet, not the way we  
want to,'' David Robinson said after the team held a final practice 
in San Antonio on Wednesday before flying to the Pacific Northwest. 
``We were really fortunate. We don't want to put ourselves in that 
position again, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson was even more emphatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going up there humbled,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson thinks he knows how tough the 80-76 and 86-85 losses in  
San Antonio were on the Blazers' psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went through the same thing last year with Utah, losing  
close games,'' Robinson said, ``and it hurts because you feel like 
you gave it away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have won eight playoff games in a row and are 4-0 on  
the road in the playoffs. They like some things about being away 
from the Alamodome and the Spurs-crazy city of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The road is excellent because you've got less distractions,''  
Mario Elie said. ``At home, you've got family members, people 
calling. You can't go to the store because people are telling you 
that you're great. We haven't accomplished anything yet. We've just 
won two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the road, it's just you and your teammates, and your  
concentration level is high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Isaiah Rider said after the Blazers practiced  
Wednesday that his right knee feels better and he expects to be 
ready Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The knee, originally injured against Phoenix in the first round,  
locked up in the third quarter Monday night, and Rider sat out the 
final period, much to his obvious disgust at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just really sore,'' he said. ``It just locked up on me. I  
popped it out and made it swell and made it really sore. It has a 
spot there that's really tender. It's just a freak thing, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider averaged 19 points in the Blazers' series victories  
against Phoenix and Utah. He's scored only 16 in the two San 
Antonio games. He said he accepts his more limited role against San 
Antonio as Portland focuses on the matchup advantages Rasheed 
Wallace has at forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I want the ball, that's just me,'' Rider said.  
``I'd like to turn it up at any point in time. But I don't want to 
go out there and take all kinds of crazy shots just because I did 
well in the first two series. I still want to play in the confines 
of our team and not be an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for Damon Stoudamire, who hates the fact  
that Dunleavy usually sits him in the fourth quarter in favor of 
Greg Anthony. When Stoudamire finally did get to play down the 
stretch in Game 2, he hit several jumpers, but also had a big 
turnover and missed a critical free throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I sit in the fourth quarter, I won't be happy. That's just  
the bottom line,'' Stoudamire said. ``I'm going to accept it, but I 
won't be happy about it. ... I'll get over this, but I'm never 
going to forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire wouldn't elaborate on whether his relationship with  
Dunleavy has gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a story for another day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, who won the NBA coach of the year award for keeping  
the multitude of big egos and emotional players on his roster 
together all season, said that matchups and how each player is 
playing will determine who goes at point guard in the fourth 
quarter Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, meanwhile, neatly wrapped up his team's situation in a  
single quote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably should be 1-1,'' he said. ``With a little luck, we  
could be 2-0. With a little luck, they are 2-0.''

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Leader Gets Mixed Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Teamster's union dispute with trucking  
companies that haul new cars to dealerships ended with no strike 
and a relatively unremarkable settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But because it was new union president James P. Hoffa's first  
performance at the bargaining table, the negotiations attracted 
unusual attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa won fans and critics, while champions of the broader  
causes of both labor and management agreed the interest he drew was 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hoffa negotiated hard in this case because he was the new kid  
on the block, but in the end both sides got a little something they 
wanted,'' said Randy Johnson, vice president for labor policy for 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``This shows how the law seems to 
protect both sides at the bargaining table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His presence raised the visibility of the issue, of the  
subject of unions, and all of this is positive,'' Democratic Party 
consultant Victor Camber said of Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract with 17 trucking companies that hauled  
more than 15 million cars from assembly plants, ports and rail 
yards to dealerships last year was originally scheduled to expire 
at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Tuesday. But union negotiators led by Hoffa 
twice agreed to delay the strike deadline so that talks could 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday morning, after working most of the night, the two  
sides announced a settlement that included better retirement 
benefits for workers and some new scheduling flexibility for 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which still must be ratified by union members,  
covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics and yard and office workers. 
Auto industry analysts said a strike would have directly affected 
consumers as well as car companies, causing long waits for 
new-vehicle buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hoffa himself was the clearly the main attraction. In  
addition to the usual press corps, a documentary film crew trailed 
him throughout the talks, which were concluded at an Arlington, 
Va., hotel just outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The new union leader is being closely watched in part because he  
has pledged to restore unity in Teamsters' ranks in the wake of a 
divisive campaign finance scandal. Also, he is the son of one of 
the Teamsters most famous former leaders, Jimmy Hoffa, who was sent 
to prison for jury tampering and misusing union funds, then 
disappeared after his release and is presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as talks were in progress Tuesday, AFL-CIO President John  
Sweeney issued a statement praising Hoffa for refusing to consider 
a proposal by the trucking companies to use Mexican drivers to 
deliver vehicles in the United States after the border opens up 
Jan. 1 under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators for the National Automobile Transporters labor  
division, which represented the companies, bristled, saying they 
had dropped the idea weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider that ... to be a bit of 11th-hour political  
grandstanding,'' spokesman Steve Duchesne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark A. de Bernardo, managing partner of the Washington office  
of the employment law firm Littler, Mendelson, said the limelight 
on Hoffa seemed to bring ``a different style'' to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually the bargaining ends with both sides being gracious.  
This time there's a little too much gloating on the part of the 
Teamsters. I think the grandstanding is going to be a little 
unsettling for future negotiations,'' de Bernard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said the Teamsters had ``swept the board'' in the  
settlement, which did not include major elements employers had 
wanted, such as lower wages for newly hired drivers. He predicted 
the new contract would be endorsed easily within the next few weeks 
by union members in a mail ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	But some complained that Hoffa gave away too much.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's made such a big test of this and now he's flunked his  
test to give concessions in a booming auto industry,'' said Ken 
Paff, national organizer for Teamsters for a Democratic Union, an 
internal faction that opposed Hoffa's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed contract, additional full-time mechanics  
hired by the trucking companies could be scheduled to work flexible 
shifts to help cover weekend hours -- for example, four 10-hour 
rather than five 8-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the union traded a raise for drivers this year for a  
one-time $1,500 bonus. In each subsequent year of the four-year 
contract, wages will rise by 50 cents an hour. Union haulers 
currently earn about $68,000 a year in wages and benefits, with 
salaries of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pension benefits would be improved for workers who choose to  
retire after 25 years of work.

<HEADLINE>  Spurs Head to Portland for Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs have beaten the  
Portland Trail Blazers five straight times. Of the three games 
Portland lost at home this season, one was to San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	So logic would dictate that the Spurs would be have some swagger  
as they approach Game 3 of the Western Conference finals Friday 
night at Portland's Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, though, are smarter than that.  
</P>
<P>
	They know how lucky they were to escape the Alamodome with a 2-0  
lead in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't played good basketball yet, not the way we  
want to,'' David Robinson said after the team held a final practice 
in San Antonio on Wednesday before flying to the Pacific Northwest. 
``We were really fortunate. We don't want to put ourselves in that 
position again, obviously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery Johnson was even more emphatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going up there humbled,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson thinks he knows how tough the 80-76 and 86-85 losses in  
San Antonio were on the Blazers' psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went through the same thing last year with Utah, losing  
close games,'' Robinson said, ``and it hurts because you feel like 
you gave it away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have won eight playoff games in a row and are 4-0 on  
the road in the playoffs. They like some things about being away 
from the Alamodome and the Spurs-crazy city of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	``The road is excellent because you've got less distractions,''  
Mario Elie said. ``At home, you've got family members, people 
calling. You can't go to the store because people are telling you 
that you're great. We haven't accomplished anything yet. We've just 
won two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the road, it's just you and your teammates, and your  
concentration level is high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Isaiah Rider said after the Blazers practiced  
Wednesday that his right knee feels better and he expects to be 
ready Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The knee, originally injured against Phoenix in the first round,  
locked up in the third quarter Monday night, and Rider sat out the 
final period, much to his obvious disgust at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just really sore,'' he said. ``It just locked up on me. I  
popped it out and made it swell and made it really sore. It has a 
spot there that's really tender. It's just a freak thing, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider averaged 19 points in the Blazers' series victories  
against Phoenix and Utah. He's scored only 16 in the two San 
Antonio games. He said he accepts his more limited role against San 
Antonio as Portland focuses on the matchup advantages Rasheed 
Wallace has at forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I want the ball, that's just me,'' Rider said.  
``I'd like to turn it up at any point in time. But I don't want to 
go out there and take all kinds of crazy shots just because I did 
well in the first two series. I still want to play in the confines 
of our team and not be an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same could be said for Damon Stoudamire, who hates the fact  
that Dunleavy usually sits him in the fourth quarter in favor of 
Greg Anthony. When Stoudamire finally did get to play down the 
stretch in Game 2, he hit several jumpers, but also had a big 
turnover and missed a critical free throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I sit in the fourth quarter, I won't be happy. That's just  
the bottom line,'' Stoudamire said. ``I'm going to accept it, but I 
won't be happy about it. ... I'll get over this, but I'm never 
going to forget it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire wouldn't elaborate on whether his relationship with  
Dunleavy has gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a story for another day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, who won the NBA coach of the year award for keeping  
the multitude of big egos and emotional players on his roster 
together all season, said that matchups and how each player is 
playing will determine who goes at point guard in the fourth 
quarter Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunleavy, meanwhile, neatly wrapped up his team's situation in a  
single quote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably should be 1-1,'' he said. ``With a little luck, we  
could be 2-0. With a little luck, they are 2-0.''

<HEADLINE> Cathay Cancels Many of Its Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled nearly half its  
flights on Thursday, but hired more charter services to try to keep 
passengers moving as a sickout by pilots entered its seventh day 
with no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay bosses said they expected to ground 56 of the company's  
117 scheduled flights, though they were bringing in help from other 
airlines who have been hired to fly 27 services Thursday as a pay 
dispute with cabin crew continues. 
</P>
<P>
	The sickout has brought chaos to Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok  
airport, where Cathay is by far the biggest carrier. More than 
20,000 travelers have been inconvenienced, and some have waited for 
days trying to get out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay angered the pilots by demanding pay cuts averaging 8  
percent in exchange for stock options to help cut costs. The 
situation deteriorated last week when the company gave the pilots 
until June 11 to either take its offer or lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots began phoning in sick, saying the layoff threats had left  
them too stressed-out to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots say they will call a strike vote if anybody is fired  
in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay says it needs to cut costs after losing millions as a  
result of the Asian economic crisis and Hong Kong's recession.

<HEADLINE> Another Good Month for Retailers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans' shopping spree extended into May,  
boosting sales at the nation's biggest retailers to 
better-than-expected levels for the fourth straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued strength of the U.S. economy combined with warmer  
weather through much of the country encouraged consumers to do lots 
of buying in May -- from sundresses to patio furniture to beach 
towels. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers for May are extremely strong and that's because  
the consumer is very confident about their current economic 
situation and the outlook for the coming months,'' said Kurt 
Barnard, who heads the retail consulting firm Barnard's Retail 
Trend Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The robust U.S. economy, as well as low unemployment and  
inflation levels have made consumers confident about their personal 
finances and has raised their eagerness to spend. 
</P>
<P>
	And their spending didn't slow last month even with the extreme  
volatility on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 
to a record high of 11,107.19 on May 13, but then fell by about 5 
percent by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that the vibrant and value-conscious American  
consumer is still very much alive,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, managing 
director at Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners in May were specialty clothing chains, while  
department stores also fared well. Discounters were strong, as 
shoppers turned to stores like Wal-Mart and Target for their wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The strength in sales came despite being compared with the very  
strong performance of May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some merchants -- including Kmart and J.C. Penney -- were  
hurt by the late Memorial Day this year. Most retailers ended their 
fiscal month of May on the 28th or 29th, which meant that much of 
the buying over the holiday weekend will be included in June's 
sales figures. Memorial Day was observed on May 31 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 4.8 percent in May. It rose 6.4 percent in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 7.7 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 14.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 1.9 percent, total sales down 2.8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 3.7 percent, total sales up 5.6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales up 2.2 percent,  
same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores rose 13.4 percent, total 
sales rose 9.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 6.3 percent, total sales up  
10.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 4.1 percent, total sales up  
14.9 percent. Federated's total sales included revenues from the 
Internet and catalog seller Fingerhut, which it acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 2.9 percent, total  
sales up 7.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 10 percent, total sales up 8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 8 percent, total sales up 28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Retail Mutual Fund Assets Rise / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds increased by $837.7 million to $860.57 billion , the 
Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category  
decreased by $84.5 million to $713.81 billion for the week ended 
Wednesday, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. 
Tax-exempt fund assets increased by $922.2 million to $146.76 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds increased by $4.30  
billion to $594.76 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets increased by $3.24 billion 
to $544.50 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds increased by $1.06 
billion to $50.26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.455 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.450 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.32 percent from 4.27 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield held steady at 4.29 percent from the previous week, 
IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.42 percent from 4.36  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield was 
unchanged at 4.39 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
59 days, down from 60 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts remained unchanged from 
the previous week at 2.06 percent as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts also was unchanged from the previous week at 0.91 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.13 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.12 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.42 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.39 
percent; 4.56 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.51 percent; and 
4.73 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.68 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hasek Has Everything But a Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Hockey has thrown more than pucks at  
Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek. He's gotten adoration, millions 
of dollars, an Olympic gold medal, recognition as the league's MVP 
the past two years, even criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing eludes him: The Stanley Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has a place set aside in his heart for hockey's biggest  
prize. ``Right next to the gold medal,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres won the Eastern Conference championship and await the  
winner of Friday's Game 7 of the Western Conference final between 
the Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, almost recovered from the chronic groin injury that  
sidelined him for the first two games against Toronto in the 
conference final, is determined to scoop the only thing that's 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hungrier than ever,'' Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley  
said. ``Nothing would compare to winning this thing and it's nice 
to have him in there with that drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is the only goaltender in NHL history to twice be selected  
the league's MVP. He did so in each of the last two seasons and is 
a candidate for a third in a row. Last year he was voted top goalie 
for the fourth time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	His greatest achievement was leading the Czech Republic to its  
first gold medal in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He earned 
the right to be called the world's best goalie after beating 
Patrick Roy and Canada 2-1 in the semifinal and shutting out Russia 
1-0 for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he runs out of things to win, it seems Hasek never runs  
out of things to prove. The Stanley Cup might quiet critics who 
question his heart and pain threshhold, not to mention filling a 
void in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us feel that there's always a little hole if you  
don't get it,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``He's going to feel 
that way if we don't accomplish what we set out to accomplish. You 
can't say it doesn't bother you if you don't win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy is the winningest goaltender in playoff history. Hasek rode  
the bench behind the other goalie he could face in the Stanley Cup 
final, Dallas' Ed Belfour, when both played for Chicago. Hasek had 
spent two seasons in Chicago when the Blackhawks traded him to 
Buffalo in August 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie Belfour is a great goaltender and Patrick has won three  
Stanley Cups,'' Hasek said. ``But it doesn't matter to me if we 
play Dallas or Colorado.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the Sabres' three playoff series have pitted Hasek  
against another good goalie. Ottawa's Ron Tugnutt led the league's 
starters with a 1.79 goals-against average. Hasek, second with a 
1.87 GAA, made 40 saves in a 2-1 victory in the opener of 
quarterfinal series against Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dom won that first game on his own and since then has just  
made the key save,'' Buffalo's Joe Juneau said. ``We don't need a 
guy who's going to steal a game every night. We just need key saves 
at the right time, and that's what Dom gives us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Byron Dafoe ranks third among playoff goalies with a  
2.03 GAA but couldn't beat Hasek's Sabres in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dafoe was in the running for the Vezina (trophy as top goalie)  
and really issued a personal challenge,'' Ruff said. ``He thought 
he could outplay Dom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anticipated duel between Hasek and Toronto's Curtis Joseph  
in the conference final fizzled due to a groin injury that kept 
Hasek out for two games and Joseph's own shaky play. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek bristles at the suggestion that he was tanking it.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough to go to the coach and tell him that I could not  
play, but I'm glad I made the decision,'' he said. ``I could play 
hurt and maybe give up some bad goals and we could lose. I feel 
good about the decision I made.''

<HEADLINE> Tax Cut Linked to Insurance Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It may amount to just a few dollars a month,  
but millions of Americans are getting an income tax cut this year 
because of a change in how the federal government values group life 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The net effect for workers is a reduction in the taxes they  
pay for the benefit,'' said Carroll Campbell, president of the 
American Council of Life Insurance, which represents 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulations released Thursday, which take effect July 1, are  
based on updated mortality estimates showing that people are living 
longer and that women now make up roughly half the U.S. work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service considers group life insurance a  
benefit to the worker that is taxable like regular income, with the 
first $50,000 in coverage exempt. The income shows up each year on 
W-2 forms under code ``C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line of the change: An estimated 163 million workers  
with group term life insurance provided by employers will see cuts 
of 11 percent to 52 percent on the taxable income derived from that 
coverage, depending on a person's age. 
</P>
<P>
	It is difficult to show how the change will lower the amount  
someone might owe Uncle Sam, given the many variables in an 
individual's tax picture. But here are two examples of how it will 
reduce taxable income: 
</P>
<P>
	--Under current regulations, a 45-year-old worker who has  
$100,000 in death benefit protection pays taxes on $174 in annual 
income from that insurance policy. The new rules will cut that 
taxable income to $90, a reduction of 48 percent. 
</P>

	--A 55-year-old with $200,000 in group coverage will see taxable  
income for that policy reduced from $1,350 to $774, a cut of 43 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Total death benefit coverage by group term life insurance  
provided by employers is estimated by ACLI at about $6.2 trillion. 
Typically, employees get coverage worth at least twice their annual 
salaries.

<P>
	While sales of individual policies have been dropping, group  
coverage sales grew 6.5 percent in 1997 compared with the year 
before. They have become one of the most popular benefits offered 
by companies because of relatively low costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The table the IRS now uses to figure the value of the insurance  
to an individual is rooted in mortality estimates of the 1970s. In 
the early 1990s, the life insurance companies began a campaign to 
modernize the table as it became clear that societal and 
demographic changes were lowering the costs of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies knew the government calculations weren't fair,  
said Laurie Lewis, senior counsel for federal taxes at ACLI. 
``There aren't many times when government lowers taxes just because 
it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of study, the Treasury Department and IRS developed  
a new table to reflect today's longer life expectancy, which is 
about 2.5 years longer than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The new table also raised the ratio of women in the work force  
from 15 percent to 50 percent. Because women live longer on average 
than men, that was an additional factor in the longer life 
expectancy estimate.
