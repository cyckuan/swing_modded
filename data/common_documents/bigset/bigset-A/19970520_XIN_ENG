<HEADLINE> Tonkov Wins Third Stage of Giro d'Italia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Pavel Tonkov took
the overall lead in the Giro d'Italia Monday with a dominating
performance in the cycling race's third stage.
</P>
<P>
The Russian completed the mostly uphill, 18-kilometer
individual time trial from Santarcangelo, Italy, to San Marino in
31 minutes 42 seconds.
</P>
<P>
His teammate Eugeni Berzin, the 1994 Giro winner and a
specialist in against-the-clock races, was second-fastest on the
day, 21 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
That set up what's likely to be an ongoing duel throughout the
22-leg contest, with Berzin just one second behind Tonkov in the
overall standings.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Roberto Petito was third Monday, 32 seconds behind
Tonkov, and sits third overall, 12 seconds off the pace.
</P>
<P>
Juan Carlos Dominguez, a rising star in the sport, had a better
time than Tonkov through 8.5 kilometers. But the Spaniard tumbled
on a tough curve, was forced to change bicycles, and finished in
33:04.
</P>
<P>
Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini was 40th Monday in 34:29 and
relinquished the leader's pink jersey, which he had held for two
days. Cipollini won each of the first two stages, both flat, in
closing dashes.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's fourth stage is an up-and-down route from San Marino
to Arezzo, Italy, covering 156 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Job Boom Appears in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Colleges, universities and
professional schools throughout the United States are reporting
record numbers of recruiters on campus, which is described as "a
product of today's soaring economy and large-scale layoffs."
</P>
<P>
This is a stark contrast to the early 1990s when all the
down-sizing happened, and teen-agers saw the parents, uncles,
friends laid off.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Colleges and Employers said the
best opportunities are in high-technology industries, especially
in hardware and software development and computer consulting,
which are hiring new graduates in computer science, computer
information systems, computer engineering and electrical
engineering. Business administration, economics, finance and
marketing graduates are also in extraordinary demand.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the current job market, the New York Times in a
report today said that the boom in the job market reflects the
upswing in the overall economy with unemployment now below 5
percent. The surge also reflects the years of layoffs for which
many companies are now frantically trying to compensate, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe that companies laid off too many employees
in the early 90s and now that business has boomed beyond
expectations, they are recruiting college students for sales,
managerial, technical and support positions.
</P>
<P>
The job boom is also attributable to Internet job searches
which have become the rule on campuses and have made the process
of seeking employment much more efficient.

MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Two players from Russian first

The two clubs were each fined 10 million roubles (about 1,700

<HEADLINE> Regional Police Officers Challenged on Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Home Affairs Secretary Tinay
Chigudu said here today police officers in the southern African
countries should come up with proposals for dealing with problems
affecting their work across borders.
</P>
<P>
He was opening a two-week regional Interpol training workshop for
police officers in southern and eastern Africa aimed at countering
cross-border criminal activities such as drug trafficking, money
laundering, vehicle theft and computer fraud.
</P>
<P>
Chigudu said the seminar had come at a time when there was growing
concern over the increasing transnational dimension of crime in
Africa and the world.
</P>
<P>
He said it was up to police officers to come up with appropriate
recommendations during negotiations on extradition treaties and
similar agreements geared at making multilateral and bilateral police
cooperation a reality.
</P>
<P>
ICPO-Interpol General Secretariat Regional Co-ordinator Stuart
Cameron-Waller said a lot of technological progress had been made
over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of the automated search facility allowed
one to conduct checks on international criminals in minutes and not
days or weeks as was the case years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the secretariat was now equipped to provide Interpol
membership with the speed and quality services it needed and
deserved.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which has attracted 36 participants from 16
countries, will examine trafficking in firearms, drugs and
endangered species, money laundering, motor vehicle crime and
offences against minors among others. enditem

<HEADLINE> U.N., Greece Meet on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Undersecretary-General Sir Kieran Prendergast today met with Greek
Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou to discuss the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The two examined how Cyprus' entry into the European Union (EU)
could react positively on the problem of the island's division, as
well as on Greek-Turkish and European-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Prendergast, who arrived here Sunday, also discussed with Greek
Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis the possibility of
success, under U.N. auspices, of talks between Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said he wanted
to invite President Clerides and Denktash to New York in early
June for direct talks.
</P>
<P>
But the Greek government today expressed concern about whether
there could be a positive outcome of such talks on the Cyprus
issue. It claimed that Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash had called
for direct talks while not showing "any inclination whatsoever for
rapprochement."
</P>
<P>
Greek government Spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that this
should be taken into consideration by the U.N. if the proposed
direct talks were to make any headway.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
took control of the northern third of the island, following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The problem has remained unsolved despite all U.N. and
international peace efforts for the past 22 years.

<P>
SANAA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has provided an aid of 5 million U.S. dollars to
the Yemeni government to help carry out projects for maintaining
and developing the special environmental heritage of the Yemeni
island of Socotra.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release published by the U.N. Information

unified development strategy based on solid environmental, social
and economic foundations.
</P>
<P>
In view of the physical, social and economic environment of the

that the land and maritime areas of Socotra need to be
reorganized completely to diminish the negative effects of the
process of environmental development.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni government asked the UNDP to help it work out the
principal plan for the environmental development of Socotra to

HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Tour and Safari operators in Zimbabwe's
Victoria Falls said armed Zambians are occupying one of the
disputed islands on the border with Zimbabwe, along the Zambezi
River, and have put up temporary tourist structures, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The operators said originally, the Tongavezi Island, which
attracts a lot of tourists, was on the Zimbabwean side but a new
Zambian map puts the island on the side of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
An official in the Department of National Parks and Wildlife
Management of Zimbabwe confirmed there were several disputed
islands, but denied the armed people were from Zambian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The official said the surveyor general's offices of the two
countrties were currently handling the diputes which have become an
international issue.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, security chiefs and immigration officials from
both countries held a closed door meeting in the Zambian boder town
of Livingstone to try and iron out the differfences over the islands,
but the tour operators believe the meeting was about the alleged
military occupation of the island, the news agency said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warms Up for Aida Opera Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Still five months ahead, Egypt is
already up to necks with preparations for the performances of the
Aida Opera Festival, touted as its major tourist-cultural
spotlight this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture is speeding up its coordination with
other state authorities concerned to make a smashing hit of the
event, which will be staged on October 12-17 in Egypt's
archeological gold mine Luxor city, about 700 kilometers south of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri has allocated 6.6
million Egyptian pounds (1.9 million U.S. dollars) as additional
appropriations for Luxor in its 96/97 budget for the preparation
work.
</P>
<P>
The opera, which was based on a love story between Egyptian
queen Cleopatra and Roman warrior Anthony by William Shakespere,
will be performed on a huge open-air stage in front of the
magnificent temple of Pharaoh Hatshepsut.
</P>
<P>
The extravaganza coincides with two occasions, the 125th
anniversary of the composition of the Aida Opera and the 75th
anniversary of the discovery of King Tutakhamen's tomb.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee vowed to do its best to try to avoid
the mistakes and problems that marred the last performances in
Luxor and near the Giza Sphinx in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Bent on a selling pitch, the committee will go farther this
month to Geneva, London, Frankfurt, Madrid and some glitzy
U.S. cities, holding press conferences and setting up ticket
booths.
</P>
<P>
The ticket, according to the committee, will range between 200
to 300 dollars, a price well beyond the reach of average Egyptians
whose monthly income barely top 100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority said recently that it is preparing
six major tourist airports nationwide, in Cairo, Alexandria, Sharm
el-Sheikh, Hurghada, Aswan and Luxor, to receive charter flights
carrying thousands of opera fans from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Besides continuous consultations with the hotels chamber and
the travel agencies to regulate the reservations, agreements will
be reached with oil companies in Egypt to use their aircraft for
carrying the viewers to the site of performances.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Higher Council of Luxor Mohmed Yousef said
Monday that preparations are going on full swing for the occasion.

<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said here today that he and Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe had discussed the situation in Zaire and hailed the
peaceful march into Kinshasa by forces loyal to Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here today for a three-day state visit,
told journalists after meeting Mugabe and members of the ruling
ZANU (pf) Politburo that Kabila will enter Kinshasa on Tuesday
and his troops have been acknowledged as being disciplined and
courteous.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who led his forces against former Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko, has declared himself head of state and
renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela described the protracted trade negotiations
between Zimbabwe and his country as a "sensitive issue" which he
will discuss with Mugabe during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations to update an expired 1964 trade protocol have
gone on since 1992 with Zimbabwe accusing South Africa of
dragging its feet over the issue.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is Zimbabwe's biggest trading partner in Africa
but trade is heavily slanted in South Africa's favor.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rejects Establishment of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu today categorically rejected the establishment of a
Palestinian state in the West Bank, saying such a state is
dangerous to Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a policy statement at the opening of the Summer session of
the Knesset (Israel's parliament) this afternoon, Netanyahu said
that such a state would pose danger not only to Israel, but to
other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister said that "unlimited self
determination was not accepted by most of the world, because it
would cost fragmentation and destruction of many states."
</P>
<P>
"There is certainly no role for such a state between Israel
and Jordan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that Israel did not want to run the daily
life of the Palestinians in the West Bank, but his government will
not give away Israel's vital territories needed for its security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu called on the Palestinians to resume
peace negotiations with Israel, which have been deadlocked since
March when Israel started to build a controversial Jewish
neighborhood at Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Netanyahu declared that there would be no
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, namely, the Israeli
self-declared security zone in the south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel did not want one millimeter of Lebanese
territories, said Netanyahu, the Lebanese army would have to take
control of the "terrorists" first.
</P>
<P>
As for Syria, the premier said that he would not accept
dictation from Damascus, capital of Syrian.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also criticized the opposition for its automatic
support for the Palestinians, and called for unity and civilized
public debate.
</P>
<P>
In response, opposition leader Shimon Peres accused Netanyahu
of creating nothing but an atmosphere of hatred both inside
Israel and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Peres, former Israeli prime minister, said that Netanyahu and
his government are destroying the Middle East peace process,
while bringing no security to Israel.

<HEADLINE> Syria Says Mideast Economic Summit Violates Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Syria opposes the
convention of the scheduled Middle East and North African
Economic Summit but is for having serious discussions on
upgrading the Arab economic ties, visiting Syrian Vice President
Abdel Halim Khaddam said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Kuwait News Agency and Kuwait
Television upon his arrival, Khaddam said the attempt to
convene the Middle East and North African Economic Summit
originally scheduled in Doha, Qatar in November was "violating
Arab resolutions" on the peace process in the region because
the meeting is supposed to be attended by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said "any dealing or contact or violation to Arab
resolutions on dealing with Israel would inflict great damages to
the Arab nation."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "there should be serious discussions
on taking Arab ties from one phase to another and work to
realize gradual serious steps on the way for building Arab
economic and the Arab common market."
</P>
<P>
"At this time Israel is refusing to pull out from the
occupied Arab territories, escalating its aggressions on Lebanon,
Judaizing Jerusalem and encouraging and expanding settlement in
it," referring to the Israeli insistence on construction of
the new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Syria, whose official standing is to seek other options for
the holding of the summit, is in a drive to drum up
support for the Arab parties in the peace process against
the Israeli policy. As part of the drive, Khadaam visited
Qatar and Saudi Arabia Sunday for talks relating to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
In Doha, Khaddam asked Qatar to delay the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Qatar reportedly said the conference would be held as
scheduled but gave no assertion whether Israel would be
invited. Israel is keen to attend the proposed economic
meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Qatari official said his country "did not yet send any
invitation to any country to attend the conference," apparently
indicating Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers meeting held in Cairo, Egypt
last March decided to freeze the process of normalizing
relations with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit hosted by Egypt in mid 1996 also issued
a resolution on freezing ties with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Complains About Lack Of U.S. Pressure On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat said in Gaza today that the deadlock of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is exacerbated by a lack of
U.S. pressure on Israel, reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the statement when he was speaking to reporters
before meeting the EU special envoy to the Middle East peace
process, Ambassador Miguel Angel Moratinos.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the troubled peace process can only be
saved by U.S. pressuring Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat sent a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton last
week declaring U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross's
latest mission a failure and asking him to dramatically
intervene in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the suggestion was rejected by the Clinton
Administration. "Presidential involvement is happening every
day," said U.S. National Security Adviser Samuel Berger on
CNN. "The point here is not dramatic moments; the point here is
progress in the peace process. And the parties themselves have to
be prepared to make the kinds of compromises, the kinds of
commitments, that would make a dramatic moment."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Arafat convened a Fatah central committee
meeting to discuss the Israeli settlement drive and a
government plan of destroying Palestinian homes in the West
Bank. Last week, Arafat presented Ross a list of 1,300
families who had received demolition orders from the Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos appeared to concurred with Arafat's pessimistic
statement. he told reporters after the meeting that "We have
to save the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The European Union wants to work closely with the U.S.. I
think, we are now in a very difficult situation," he said.
"EU is working together with all parties, all the peace-makers.
That's the reason why I am going to Moscow tonight in
order to address to the other peace sponsor the need to work
together."

<HEADLINE> IRA-Hit Tower Renamed IFC of the Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The NatWest Tower, the tallest
building in the City of London, was renamed as the International
Financial Center (IFC) today.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, as a result of a major terrorist incident in the City,
the NatWest Tower had to be vacated. National Westminster Bank has
spent 100 million pounds (160 million US dollars) repairing and
renovating the 42-storey building.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the tower has undergone a radical transformation. A
dynamic and highly flexible business environment where a variety
of business can flourish has been created.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Lord Alexander, chairman of
NatWest Group, said, "Once again the building is set to play an
important role in ensuring that the City retains its position as
one of the world's business and financial centers."
</P>
<P>
The IFC will be ready for occupation in October this year
following an extensive, four-year redevelopment program, according
to Alexander.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first time that this prestigious building,
with its 29,530 sq meters of high quality office space in the
heart of the City, has been available to the international
business community," he said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that tenants receive the highest levels of service,
the IFC has established a new company to manage the building.
</P>
<P>
Top City rents are 45 pounds per sq ft and rising and NatWest
could expect annual rental income of more than 14 million pounds
(22.4 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
National Westminster Bank is pledged to keep ownership of the
office building as a property investment.
</P>
<P>
However, City experts expect a rebranded and fully let the IFC
to attract offers of up to 200 million pounds (320 million US
dollars) from overseas investors, particularly German funds.

<HEADLINE> Exporters Put UK Behind China But Ahead of France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- In world export markets, Britain is
behind China, and is only on par with South Korea, according to
the DHL Quarterly Export Indicator (DHL QEI) released here today.
</P>
<P>
Exporters who took part in the May DHL QEI were given a list of
14 countries and asked whether each country was stronger, weaker
or the same as the UK in world export markets.
</P>
<P>
The 14 countries were Britain's six partners in the G7 club,
China, Russia, India, South Africa, and three "Asian Tigers" --
Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In the survey of 800 British exporters, the United States and
Japan are seen as the most powerful in world export markets.
</P>
<P>
Only 4 percent of the exporters think that Britain is more
powerful, giving the USA a score of 74 percent. Japan follows
closely behind with a score of 71 percent, with Germany trailing
in third place (37 percent). China scores 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
One-third of British exporters (34 percent) think that South
Korea is stronger than the UK in world export markets, with
exactly the same number saying that Britain is ahead. This puts
South Korea and Britain on an equal footing, ahead of Singapore
(11 percent), France (15 percent) and Canada (25 percent).
</P>
<P>
According to British exporters, India, South African and Russia
are bigger long-term threats to the UK than France or Italy.
</P>
<P>
"There does seem to be a feeling among some exporters that the
UK will soon be overtaken by Asian tigers such as Singapore, South
Korea and Malaysia," said Nick Butcher, managing director of DHL
International (UK) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"However, judging from the results, the majority view is that
the UK is managing to hold its own in world export markets,"
Butcher adds.

HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean official today said
Zimbabwe is facing a serious problem of land degradation which
needs immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
Environment and Tourism Deputy Minister Edward
Chindori-Chininga said land degradation is one of the country's
major environmental problems which have to be resolved urgently
and effectively.
</P>
<P>
He was opening a non-governmental organization (NGO)
desertification workshop which, among its objectives, seeks to
raise awareness within the NGO community on environmental, health
and socio-economic problems resulting from the twin problems of
desertification and drought.
</P>
<P>
He said desertification combating strategies need to be
pursued, including the rehabilitation of degraded and partially
degraded lands and providing alternative means of livelihood
among rural communities to reduce dependence on land resources.
</P>
<P>
He said a changing global environment with unfavorable
development practices might spell doom to some nations.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, the process of desertification, if not controlled,
creates doom and poverty in affected countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Troops killed More PKK Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Turhan Tayan
announced today that until this morning, the Turkish troops have
killed 1,142 rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
in the Turkish cross-border military operation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency said that Tayan made
the announcement at the airport in Bursa, western Turkey, on
the way to participate in a ceremony of the celebration of
the Turkish Youth and Sport Holiday.
</P>
<P>
The minister claimed that Turkey respected Iraq's sovereignty
and territorial integrity during the cross-border campaign against
the PKK, which is still going on in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With the support of air bombing and artillery fire, the
cross-border assault against the PKK this year is significantly
different from the previous ones. The Turkish military
operation, the largest in scale over the past few years,
followed a request for help by Iraq' Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) Chairman Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The KDP gave the best guidance ever to the Turkish
security forces against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish forces, who have pushed 40 kilometers deep
inside northern Iraq, fanned out into the Iraqi mountains,
hunting for the PKK guerrillas, who are seeking shelters after
the six-day strong strikes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a statement issued today by the
office of the Emergency Regional Rule, the Turkish security
forces killed 17 PKK militants in southeastern Turkey over the
past four days and captured six in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the PKK rebels launched attacks in
southeastern Turkey Sunday night and today as a Turkish
contingent of about 25,000 to 50,000 troops has crossed the
border into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels blocked Sunday night for several
hours the southeastern Mardin-Sirnak main road by burning two
oil tanker trucks, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, the PKK guerrillas launched a dozen
of rocket attacks against the government buildings on the town
of Derik in nearby Mardin province, but caused little damage,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war which has claimed
over 23,000 lives in eastern and southeastern Turkey since August
1984.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Urges Efforts to Free Mideast of Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
today called on the regional countries to make efforts to turn
the Middle East into a region free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
During a cabinet session today, King Fahd made the appeal and
said that his country pays special attention to efforts in this
respect, Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The king also warned the countries and people against the
dangers of refusal "by some states in the Middle East region" to
sign a document banning the use of such weapons.
</P>
<P>
The agency cited Israel which has refused to sign an
international treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons
and rejected placing its nuclear installations under international
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which endorsed the treaty, has refused to sign another
accord concerning a ban on chemical weapons unless Israel signs
the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
It said King Fahd also asserted that Jerusalem is the crux of
the Arab-Israeli conflict and that it will continue to be the
center of Saudi attention.
</P>
<P>
He also said that any settlement of the issue must take the
U.N. resolutions into consideration, especially the U.N. Security
Council's resolution 242 which stipulates an Israeli withdrawal
from the Arab territories it occupied during the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Israel and the Arabs have been stalemated because
of Israel's refusal to stop constructing a new Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Kohl to Meet on EU Institutional Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will meet here Tuesday to coordinate
their position on the European Union (EU) informal meeting on its
institutional reform to be held Friday in Noordwijk, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In order to coordinate the position between France and Germany
on European integration and security, Chirac and Kohl have been
having a series of informal summits, the latest of which was held
on April 10 in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
At their last meeting, the two leaders pledged to launch the
European single currency, the euro, by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Noordwijk meeting, called by the Netherlands, which is the
current chairman country of EU, will kick off a new round of
negotiations among the 15 EU members on the revision of the
Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation is supposed to be completed by the time when
the EU holds its summit in Amsterdam on July 16 and 17. But
differences persist among EU countries over the institutional
reform.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted diplomatic sources as
saying that the two leaders also will talk about the signing on
May 27 in Paris of an agreement by Russia and NATO on bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, baptized "Founder Act," is supposed to alleviate
the dispute between Russia and NATO over the eastward expansion by
the trans-Atlantic Western military alliance toward former Warsaw
bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
During his brief stopover Sunday in Moscow on his way home from
a four-day state visit in China, President Chirac said that the
agreement will "rub out Yalta (agreement) and confirm peace for
the future."
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Kohl are expected to meet again on June 3 in
Futuroscope near Poitiers in central France to pursue their
concertation over EU problems, said AFP.

<HEADLINE> SADC Needs Shared Future Vision: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries should
aim to develop a vision of a shared future in efforts to improve
the standards of living of their people, Zimbabwe's Higher
Education Secretary Michael Mambo said here today.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, there is need for the functionaries within
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to understand
the regional body, its background, vision and structures and
principles, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to provide for a framework of cooperation
providing for common cultural and social affinities, historical
experiences, common problems and aspirations," said Mambo.
</P>
<P>
He was opening a 10-day induction training program for SADC
organs.
</P>
<P>
Mambo said such a firm foundation is necessary for the
attainment of the people's cherished ideals of economic
well-being, the improvement of the standards and quality of life,
freedom and social justice and peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The peoples of southern Africa should also commit themselves
and participate fully in the process towards regional
integration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 people from 11 SADC countries except Angola are
attending the workshop and will discuss the developments leading
to the formation of SADC, SADC institutions, procedures and
co-ordination and organizational culture, among other issues.

three top terrorists whose heads are worth 4,500,000 dinars
(80,000 dollars).

<HEADLINE> German Firm Admits Melting Down Holocaust Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The German chemicals corporation
Degussa today said its wartime files showed that the company
"apparently" melted down gold and silver looted by Nazis from Jews
during the Holocaust, said reports reaching here from Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the documents did not specify origins
of the metals and Degussa officials were currently discussing ways
of making this point clear.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made in response to a report today by
Germany's ARD public television claiming that dental gold and
jewelry from Holocaust victims were delivered to the company.
</P>
<P>
The TV report came after the United States and Britain called
for holding of an international conference to help the Tripartite
Gold Commission identify and distribute the treasures looted by
Nazi Germany and held in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
The commission consisting of Britain, France and the United
States first met in 1946 and proposed that neutral countries such
as Switzerland, where the Nazis stored much of their loot, return
to governments and individual victims or their heirs the property.
</P>
<P>
New evidence however showed that the Swiss banks might have
deliberately held back some of the assets.
</P>
<P>
In light of this, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a joint statement
in Washington, "The Tripartite Gold Commission should complete its
work as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
They proposed to convene an international conference in London
before the end of this year to discuss the new evidence.

"The new authorities (in Kinshasa) have not made contact with

French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He called Zaire "the Democratic Republic of Congo", the former
name of Zaire rehabilitated by Kabila, and said the situation in
Kinshasa "is moving toward normality."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed that France would judge the new
authorities of Zaire on its acts, especially in its concerns for
national reconciliation involving all political forces, and its
respect for the human rights of refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said France remained worried over the humanitarian situation
of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
A report published today by the international humanitarian
group, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), said 190,000 Rwandan Hutu
refugees had disappeared from eastern Zaire over the past several
months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Agence France-Presse quoted an authorized source
in Paris as saying today that Mobutu had not asked to go into
exile in France.
</P>
<P>
The source said that if Mobutu made the request, the French
government would examine it.
</P>
<P>
Morocco and South Africa have agreed to receive Mobutu, who is
now staying in Togo and is reportedly "extremely tired."

NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The General Motors of the U.S.
reached an agreement with the Chinese government to make the No.1
auto maker the leading candidate to win a car-making project in
China, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for GM said that if the company's participation was

year. But he said production could be increased to as much as
100,000 units annually down the road, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper said GM's Germany-based Adam Opel AG unit would
operate the project and would use the plant to build small
passenger cars. The model GM will build was not identified, but it
is likely to be variant of the Opel Corsa or Astra or possibly an
ultrasmall car planned for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the venture will likely be located in
Guangzhou in southern China, where there is already a joint
venture manufacturing Peugeot cars with a French partner.

</P>
<P>
The cultural relics, which have been dated from between 400

France, United States, and other Western nations over subsequent
years.
</P>
<P>
The Dunhuang Relics are now scattered across at least 13
countries, in addition to China.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Releases Fund for Anti-Poverty Drive in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today announced the release of 534 million pesos (203,800 U.S.
dollars) for the government's poverty alleviation program in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The president made the announcement when delivering a speech at
the multi-sectoral assembly in Iligan city, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, the money would be sourced from the Office
of the President and the Department of Public Works and Highways
and used for road construction, road repair and flood control
projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos also announced the release of 23 units of
ambulances to some health offices and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The development of Mindanao was very important to the
Philippine government. Government troops and the Moro National
Liberation Front rebels ended a 24-year-old war in the region last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, some rebels, discontent with Manila's steps to develop
this area, had said they would join other rebel groups like the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front which were fighting against the
government.

<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A five-year-old buffalo has given
birth to a 3.5-kilogram male calf in Beijing Zoo, the first
buffalo calf born in the zoo in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
The vets and animal keepers, who have been fully prepared for
the birth of the calf, helped the mother buffalo through a
difficult labor. Her baby is healthy and growing well.
</P>
<P>
Buffalo, or bison, is a large wild animal, the habitat of
which is in western Canada.
</P>
<P>
The mother buffalo was bought from the Shanghai Zoo in 1994. It
was the first time it produced a calf.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Zoo, the largest of its kind in China, has more than
6,000 animals of some 600 species.
</P>
<P>
The zoo failed to reproduce any buffalo during the past 24
years because of a lack of suitable couples and due to other
technical problems.

<HEADLINE> Manila Declaration Good for Global Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Tourism Organization said
here today that global tourism is all for the better after world
tourism officials emerge with a Manila Declaration on the Social
Impact of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
The declaration is an expected result of the meeting of some
150 tourism officials from 60 countries and regions during the
World Tourism Leader's Meeting to be held here on May 22-23.
</P>
<P>
Organizer said at least 23 ministers of tourism and commerce
are among the participants of this meeting.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General Francisco Frangialli of the World Tourism
Organization said there is now more pressure to address the social
impacts of tourism as the world tourism industry growth doubles in
the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
"The issues of spreading the gains of tourism to more people in
communities hosting, tourist attractions, the respect and regard
for traditions and cultures of places tourists visit and the
effective combat of crime, drugs, prostitution and child abuse,
are among the most important issues facing tourism today," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Frangialli said tourism is a powerful tool for economic and
social development as it has a tremendous capacity to create jobs
and raise the standards of those living in poor and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged at the same time that in the past, mass tourism
had been allowed to develop with scant consideration for the
possible negative impact and little thought about the future.
</P>
<P>
"The resulting Manila Declaration on the Social Impact of
Tourism will help guide us in the future so that our already
successful tourism sector becomes more equitable and more socially
responsible," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Sign Russia-NATO Treaty in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua)_ Russian President Boris Yeltsin will
travel to Paris to sign the treaty with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) on May 26-27, Yeltsin's spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters at a press conference that
Yeltsin will deliver a speech on European security at the signing
ceremony on May 27.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Yeltsin is to meet French President Jacques
Chirac, and possibly United States President Bill Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "The signing of the treaty is not the end,
but the beginning of its life -- it begins the struggle over its
interpretation."
</P>
<P>
The Russia-NATO agreement is intended to assuage Moscow's
opposition to the alliance's plan to invite several ex-Soviet
allies in Eastern Europe to join its ranks. Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic are expected to be invited to join NATO this
summer.
</P>
<P>
The agreement gives Russia a consultative voice _ but not a
vote _ in NATO affairs, and offers Moscow some assurances on
limiting military operations on the territories of new members of
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that Russia and Ukraine will sign a
political accord during Yeltsin's visit to Ukraine on May 30-31,
following his Paris trip.

setting up four camps along the north ridge. However, they had to
return to the base camp on May 14 due to bad weather.

According to the weather forecast, the bad weather will last
for about one week.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- CitiBank NA is smoothly developing
its business in RMB yuan, which started more than a month ago, the
head of the bank's Shanghai branch said here today.
</P>
<P>
Bell Chong, head of the CitiBank Shanghai branch, revealed that
RMB business, mainly in liquidation for overseas-funded
enterprises and inter-bank lending, now accounts for almost five
percent of the branch's overall business.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite some restrictions for the experimental
period, RMB business for foreign banks in Shanghai develops quite
well, and enjoys bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
He has been in Shanghai for five years, and was able to see
that China's financial circle has become more and more open
through reforms, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that in the near future, overseas-funded banks could
be allowed to accept deposits from local residents and Chinese
enterprises as the Chinese banks do.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, China's central bank, approved last
December nine foreign banks in Shanghai to do business in RMB yuan
on an experimental basis. To date, six of them have started RMB
business.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the central bank's rules, CitiBank NA moved
its Shanghai branch to the Pudong New Development Area, and
formally started business in RMB yuan on March 31.

SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials meeting in
Langkawi, Malaysia, ahead of the Fourth ASEAN (Association of
South East Asian Nations) Regional Forum (ARF) in July have agreed
to include maritime security on the agenda, local television
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Kishore Mahbubani, permanent secretary of the
Singapore Foreign Ministry, stressed that the move was sooner than
expected and was very significant.
</P>
<P>
Maritime security would go a long way, he said, to minimize
potential territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
Mahbubani also said that the senior officials had agreed that
the ARF should include meetings among defense ministers and senior
defense officials as well. Peace and security were something that
could not be undertaken by foreign ministry officials and
ministers alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that for the first time the defense representatives of
all 21 member countries had sat together in one room to chat at
the Langkawi meeting. This was not easy, he commented.
</P>
<P>
They had good discussions and it was a successful meeting,
Mahbubani said, although he did not disclose what was exactly
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Singapore will co-host a security forum on preventive diplomacy
with the United Kingdom here in September. The forum is
significant as it shows the ARF is slowly evolving from promoting
confidence-building to preventive diplomacy, Mahbubani said.

BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 Chinese and British
scientists and doctors gathered here today to discuss the issue of
AIDS prevention and care.

Participants from both countries delivered reports on their
latest achievements in immunity, diagnosis, care, education, and

</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui, vice-minister of public health, said that like
elsewhere in the world, China is also facing the challenge of the
spreading of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
A total 5,990 incidences of HIV infection in China have been

according to Yin.
</P>
<P>
"The growing speed of HIV infections in China has accelerated
in recent years," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), by the turn
of the century, the number of HIV infections in Asia is estimated
to reach over 10 million people, and the region will become one of
the world's most prevalent areas of HIVs.
</P>
<P>
"The spread of AIDS worldwide is not only a major health issue,
but a political, social, and economic one," Yin said, adding that
the social and economic loss caused by AIDS is "disastrous" to all
the countries around the world, especially to some of the
developing countries.

Chinese and British scientists sat together in China to have a
large-scale academic exchange.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will lay a solid foundation for further exchanges
and cooperation between the two countries in the field, and for
the formation of a new "Great Wall" curbing AIDS spread in China,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Martin Gordon, chairman of the British SBC Warburg Asia
Holdings and Barry &AMP; Martin's Trust, also spoke at the opening
ceremony of the symposium, saying that as a banker, he has visited
China more than 100 times over the past 20 years, and he has found
that both the central and local authorities have been active in
educating doctors and people to take measures to curb the spread
of HIV/AIDS, and they have shown great concern for the lives of
people who are infected by HIVs.
</P>
<P>
Gordon expressed his hope that the two sides will increase
their cooperation and exchange of doctors and nurses in the future
and make contributions for the prevention and treatment of AIDS.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Philippines to Stop Invasion of China Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that the Philippine
government will have a correct understanding of its restraint, and
proceed from the overall situation of maintaining Sino-Philippine
friendship and the stability of the South China Sea to halt any
act of intrusion into its territory.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sheng Guofang made the statement
when asked to comment on some Philippine Congressmen and
Philippine navy personnel landing on Huangyan Island, one of
China's islands in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Huangyan Island has been China's territory since
ancient times, and the international community does not hold any
disagreement on this fact, Shen said, its legal status has long
been defined and is therefore irrefutable.
</P>
<P>
The island is not within the territorial boundary announced by
the Philippines, and the Philippines' official documents and
relevant international laws are explicit on this point, and this is
undeniable fact, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made a serious representation with
the Philippine government over on the recent intrusion of China's
Huangyan Island, Sheng said. The re-landing on the island by the
Philippines side is an open provocation, and the Chinese
government is greatly concerned about this.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Philippines government will understand
China's restraint correctly and proceed from the overall situation
of maintaining Sino-Philippine Friendship and stability in the
South China Sea to stop any act of invasion of its territory, the
spokesman said.

cause, and his fine morality of hard work and fairness.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Afghan Kunduz Province Falls to Taliban: TV Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Islamic militia Taliban
and allies are now in control of the northern province of Kunduz
bordering Tajikistan, Pakistan Television (PTV) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) quoted a Taliban
spokesman as saying that the Islamic student militia are now
heading south to the neighboring Baghlan province, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
However, the reports could not be independently confirmed by
other news agencies, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that the Taliban have made some gains
along the strategic Salang Highway which links Kabul with the
northern Afghanistan, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
The AIP also reported that the provinces of Baghlan and
Samangan were to fall shortly, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control more than two-thirds of the Afghan
territory, reportedly launched today a major offensive in the
center of the country following the outbreak of a revolt against
their northern-based opposition, said reports reaching here today
from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched a strong attack near the strategic Shibar
Pass, which opens out to Bamyan province, the stronghold of the
Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat faction led by Karim Khalili, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The Shibar Pass, which also provides access to Baghlan and
Samangan provinces controlled by Afghan northern warlord Rashid
Dostum, is an important doorway to the 10 provinces in northern
Afghanistan controlled by the anti-Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forces loyal to general Abdul Malik, right-hand man
of Dostum, who staged a strong revolt in provinces of Faryab,
Jozjan and Samangan as well as Dostum's stronghold, Mazar-e-Sharif
in Balkh, early Monday, continued their fighting with Dostum's
troops.
</P>
<P>
The report of revolt coincided with massing of Taliban forces
in central Afghanistan to prepare for a major assault on the
north.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militia have vowed to take northern provinces
controlled by Dostum, Khalili and former military chief of the
ousted Afghan government Ahmad Masood and other opponents to set
up a pure Islamic state.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police to Investigate Busang Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A special team formed by
Indonesia's state police will soon leave Jakarta for Muara
Ancalong in East Kalimantan to begin investigations on the Busang
gold scandal, Antara News Agency quoted an informed source as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
The team will look into collusion and data manipulation as the
possible roots of the scandal, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Busang mine, deep in the jungles of East Kalimantan, was
touted by the tiny Canadian mining company, Bre-X Minerals, to be
the gold find of the century as it contains 71 million ounces of
gold.
</P>
<P>
However, a report done by independent auditor Strathcona
Minerals declared early this month that the Busang mine was a
hoax.
</P>
<P>
On May 6, the Indonesian government freezed the operations of
Bre-X Minerals in the country.
</P>
<P>
The source said the investigations will focus on how Bre-X's
gold samples were transferred from the exploration sites to the
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
Two Bre-X geologists along with 12 other employees were already
questioned by the local police Monday, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bre-X finance control manager Bernhard Leode said
here today that the company will give a total compensation of
740,000 U.S. dollars for all its employees facing lay-off.
</P>
<P>
Bre-X company and its subsidiaries in Indonesia have been
forced to lay-off at least 549 Indonesian employees and 14
expatriates.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Asks Scholars to Adhere to Marxism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has urged
that Marxism be upheld in the research of philosophy and social
sciences.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting to mark the 20th anniversary of the
founding of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, State
Councillor Li Tieying said that a correct political orientation
must be maintained in the academy, the top seat of the country's
liberal arts and social sciences.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that researchers should learn Marxism, Leninism and
Mao Zedong Thought, as well as Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Philosophies and social sciences must serve the socialist
modernization drive, he said, adding that the doctrine of "Let A
Hundred Flowers Bloom and Let A Hundred Schools of Thought
Contend" should be carried on.
</P>
<P>
The famous statement was set forth by late Chairman Mao Zedong
in the 1950s for the development and prosperity of theatrical arts
by encouraging variety.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Communist Party committees and governments at
various levels should care for and attach great importance to
social sciences research, and study their suggestions and
proposals, thus letting the decision-making process become a
scientific and democratic one.
</P>
<P>
The academy was created in 1977 based on the Philosophy and
Social Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It
now has 31 research institutes with more than 4,000 researchers.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on HK's Return Praised in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A major photo exhibition on Hong
Kong's Return to China has been widely praised in Macao as useful
for boosting Macao residents' confidence.
</P>
<P>
The photo exhibition, which displays 320 photos on Hong Kong's
history and the process of Hong Kong's return, has attracted
thousands of viewers here since it was opened on May 18 for a
four-day run.
</P>
<P>
"The exhibition is documentary and instructive," said Lei Hong,
 secretary-general of the Macao Association of Neighborhood
Committee, in a discussion today. "It helps the youth know history
 like a vivid classroom."
</P>
<P>
He said the photos on display sketched the blueprint for Hong
Kong in the next 50 years, and will boost Macao residents'
confidence in their future as Macao will implement the same policy
 of "one country, two systems" and a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Lei's remarks were echoed by Yang Yunzhong, a professor with
the University of Macao, who attended today's discussion together
with more than 20 scholars and heads of local communities.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the photos depict a bright future for both Hong
Kong and Macao in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
What happened in Hong Kong has proved that the policy of "one
country, two systems" has great vitality and feasibility, and that
 the Chinese government's promise of "a high degree of autonomy"
and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" has been kept to the
full, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's successful transition has set a valuable example
for Macao," said the professor, who participated in the drafting
of the Macao Basic Law. "It is also an immediate model to copy and
 a great encouragement to Macao."
</P>
<P>
Others concluded that the key to the success of Hong Kong's
transition lies in two facts -- an ever stronger China and the
correct policy of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
They pledged that they will do whatever they can to help
contribute to a smooth transition in Macao, as "what happens in
Hong Kong today will happen in Macao tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> Investors Rush to Buy Odessa City Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Odessa's first issue of city bonds
appears to have been a success, the mayor Eduard Hurvits said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The mayor's promise of a "no risk, high return" investment in
Odessa, Ukraine's largest seaport, prompted a rush of buy offers
from individuals as well as corporate investors.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures indicated that investors placed orders for
almost all the 61 million hryvnas (33.5 million U.S. dollars)
worth of bonds on sale.
</P>
<P>
The securities first went on sale on May 1. Six million hryvnas
(3.2 million dollars) worth of low-denomination bonds were
transferred to the State Savings Bank in Odessa for sale to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Big investment businesses are expected to get the chance to
make purchases on June 1 when the next issue of city bonds is due.
</P>
<P>
The Odessa Mayor's office and bonds underwriter, the Porto
Franco Bank, is currently accepting purchase applications. Several
large orders from foreign investors are said to have reached the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Odessa bonds issuers are offering dividends as high as 50
percent, to mature a year later, on May 1 and June 15, 1998. The
city administration plans to earn the money for dividends by
plowing bond revenues into high-profit construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Yields on Odessa city bonds are considerably higher than those
on national internal loan bonds, which yield dividends ranging
from 24 percent a year for three-month bonds, to 34 percent a year
for 12-month bonds.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Ukraine predicted inflation in 1997 at 25
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor and Minister in
charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy Li
Tieying met in the Great Hall of the People today with a
delegation from the nationalist groups in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Li told the Japanese guests that Sino-Japanese relations should
be further developed this year, the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of bilateral diplomatic relations. He said that
relations between the two countries have seen rapid development in
the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Japan are good neighbors separated by a
narrow strip of water. They share a long tradition of friendly
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Japanese guests will see more
places and make many friends in China so as to improve their
understanding of the country. Nothing can replace the means of
direct, face-to-face contact, he said. Li noted that such contact
will improve understanding and help to eliminate misunderstanding
and therefore promote friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the two countries should treasure their friendly
relations that are won after struggles. They should resolve
existing disputes through dialogue and friendly discussion.
</P>
<P>
Li said that militarist Japan's aggression against China had
not only caused a catastrophe for the Chinese people, but also had
a tragic impact on the Japanese people. On the issue of history,
China always holds the view that "the past, if not forgotten,
provides a guidance for the future." Japan should squarely face
this painful part of history, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the two countries will maintain their
friendship through generations to come. This is not only in the
interests of the two peoples and serves as a basic principle of
bilateral relations, but also contributes to the peace and
development of the world.
</P>
<P>
Sumino Syuji, head of the Japanese delegation, said that their
visit is designed to improve understanding and eliminate
misunderstanding through direct contact with Chinese friends, and
to contribute to the promotion of the friendly bilateral relations
and the maintenance of world peace.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Recaptures Town of Huddor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Somali faction, the
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) has today claimed to have
recaptured the northwestern town of Huddor after heavy fighting
with the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid last night.
</P>
<P>
The political leader of RRA, Mr Ali Aden Margus has today
announced what he called an 'unforeseen victory' for his forces
since they started fighting nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists in north Mogadishu today, Mr Margus
has also claimed that his men have snatched two armed wagons,
two civilian lorries and two field radio communications from the
loyalists of Hhussein Aidid who are now forced to retreat back
to Baidoa, 145 kms west of Huddor. However, Mr Margus declined to
comment on the casualty figures his men have sustained during the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
In response to the claim of the RRA, the government of Hussein
Mohamed Aidid has dismissed the claim characterizing it as
baseless and misguiding lie. A spokesman for the security forces
of Hussein Aidid here in south Mogadishu said today that this new
claim is not any different from those hundred claims earlier made
by the RRA men. However, the spokesman admitted that government
forces patrolling the areas around Huddor were ambushed by
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he's inviting any journalist who is
interested to know about the reality of the situation in the
region. Likewise, the spokesman declined the casualties they have
sustained during the ambush he spoke about or the fighting in
the town. Independent sources said the military situation of the
town has been uncertain since yesterday afternoon. Nevertheless,
the only two privately owned field radios in the town have also
been out of the air since late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The claim of Huddor's recapture by the Rahanwein men is coming
only four days after the political leader of the RRA, Mr Ali
Aden Margus was released from his captivity in north Mogadishu by
militiamen claiming to owe him money which came from looted
sorghum and a lorry in Baidoa town last year.
</P>
<P>
Nine days ago, fighting was also reported in the towns of
Huddor and Wajid and the RRA forces had claimed to have captured
the two places. Nevertheless both towns have been retaken back by
the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid after receiving
reinforcement battle wagons and militiamen from the town of
Baidoa and Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The instability in the region of Bakol has increased after
south Mogadishu faction leader, Hussein Mohamed Aidid has left
the capital for possible reconciliation with rival factions
outside the country. The regions of Bay and Bakol have fallen
for the forces of late general Aidid who invaded the regions in
September 1995 and January 1996 respectively.

<HEADLINE> China, Portugal Reach Consensus on Macao's Entry into World Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China and Portugal have reached
consensus on Macao's renewal of member status to over 30 world
bodies, a top Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an, head of the Chinese side of the International
Organization Working Panel under the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG), said that the 30-plus world bodies include both
governmental and non-governmental ones.
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door meeting with his Portuguese counterparts,
Wang told reporters that the two sides exchanged views on Macao's
renewal of member status to international statistical and sports
organizations in today's discussion.
</P>
<P>
But he passed on the questions of how many international bodies
Macao has joined and how many of them Macao will have to get its
renewal to his Portuguese counterpart, Jorge Mendes, saying that
Macao is now under Portuguese administration and the Chinese side
is unaware of the numbers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang said that the Chinese side is making a study
into a list of international conventions applicable to Macao,
which was provided by the Portuguese side last year.
</P>
<P>
The list consists of 205 international conventions applicable
to Macao, involving human rights, copyrights, industrial property
rights and environmental protection, among others. Portugal joined
117 of them, and out of the 117 international conventions China
has joined 75, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The two sides today exchanged documents on their reservation
and explanations to some conventions applicable to Macao, which
Wang described as laying a basis for further studies.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side is willing to discuss the issue with the
Portuguese side, and hopes that those which benefit Macao, are
needed by Macao and are in accordance with the principle of
national sovereignty, will get their renewal in the territory,"
Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"China's reservation and explanations to some of the
conventions are based on Chinese laws, the principle of national
sovereignty, the specific conditions in China and articles of
international conventions," Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese side will continue informal meetings with the
Chinese side to quicken the pace in handling the issues since the
number of conventions applicable to Macao is too big, said Jorge
Mendes, head of the Portuguese side of the working panel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges India to Change Patent Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to India Frank
Weisner today urged India to change its patent law so as to
continue scientific and technological cooperation between
scientists of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a joint meeting of Indo-U.S. officials to work out strategy
for a new science and technology agreement between the two
countries here, Weisner said that the U.S. would have to stop
collaborating with Indian scientists in certain areas of research
if the Indian government failed to change its patent law.
</P>
<P>
The existing Indo-U.S. Cooperation Agreement comes to an end in
December this year.
</P>
<P>
"The fact remains that until our scientific communities are
protected by an equitable intellectual property rights (IPR)
distribution and protection regime, we will be unable to negotiate
a formal science and technology agreement and some areas of
research and training will be closed to cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that future of Indo-U.S. science and
technology cooperation rested on the Indian government and
depended on how it resolved issues like IPR which inhibit
scientific cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Commends Arrest of Six Kidnap Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
commended the Philippine National Police (PNP) for the arrest of
six kidnap suspects last week.
</P>
<P>
The president made the commendation after receiving reports on
the apprehension of the six suspects who were believed responsible
for the abduction of a businessman, his wife and a housemaid on
April 8.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos urged all law enforcers to maintain the
relentless anti-kidnapping campaign the government launched early
this year and punish "scalawags in uniform" especially.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the kidnap gang was headed by a senior
police officer who had been absent without office leave since
March.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that some policemen are kidnappers or
protectors of kidnappers. To fight abductors in uniform, the PNP
launched a drive against scalawags in the police last year and so
far had expelled at least 1,200 policemen.
</P>
<P>
However, kidnapping was still rampant in the country. It was
reported that on the average, there were 20 people taken hostages
every month last year.

<HEADLINE> Financial Services Talks Top Priority for WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
saw the current financial services negotiations as its top
priority this year and expected them to be concluded by the
yearend, WTO Director General Renato Ruggiero said here today.
</P>
<P>
The WTO targeted July 14 as the date for receiving the offer
from various WTO members and the yearend as the date for
concluding all the negotiations on open financial services among
its members, Ruggiero told reporters after addressing the 30th
international general meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic
Council (PBEC).
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero, in his speech to the PBEC meeting on the progress of
the WTO, described the financial services talks as an undeniable
priority for the world body in the coming months after it forged
the agreements on the telecommunication services and information
technologies early this year.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero said financial services is vital for the world
economies since the sector provides the essential means for
settling the day-to-day transactions of the global economy and for
meeting the financial needs of all economic agents around the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said the WTO is organizing several regional seminars to
provide technical assistance for 89 countries in order to clarify
the issues regarding financial services and to prepare these
countries for the negotiations in this area.
</P>
<P>
Other priorities for the WTO this year include the expansion of
its membership and a conference on the least developed countries,
according to Ruggiero.
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 countries and regions, including Russia and
China, have applied for membership of the WTO, which is now
composed of 131 members.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to China last month, Ruggiero said he had
"a very positive impression of the Chinese government's commitment
to WTO membership."
</P>
<P>
To give a significant contribution to the fight against
marginalization, Ruggiero said that the WTO will hold the High
Level Conference on the Least Developed Countries at the end of
this October.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero is here attending the three-day annual PBEC
international general meeting, which opened here Monday to discuss
a wide range of issues pertinent to free and open trade and
investment in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, the PBEC is composed of over 1,200 companies
from its 20 member economies in the Asia-Pacific, including China,
the United States, Russia and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive's Office Spokesman on Chief Justice Recommendation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chief
Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) said here today that the Judicial Officers Recommendation
Commission (Designate) had discharged its first task in an
independent, conscientious and methodical manner.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the commission's recommendation that Andrew K.N.
Li be appointed chief justice of the HKSAR, the spokesman said the
fact that the commission was left to get on with the job in the
way it thought best was the clearest indication of the respect for
and determination to uphold the independence of the Judiciary and
the rule of law in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa announced the
membership of the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission
(Designate) -- JORC (Designate), which would take effect on July
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the relevant ordinances on the appointment of the chief
justice do not come into effect until July 1, 1997, the JORC has
informed the chief executive that preparatory work has to be done
before July 1, 1997 in order to ensure the timely establishment of
the HKSAR Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Its first task was to make recommendations to the chief
executive in respect of the appointment of the chief justice of
the Court of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
The JORC has advised the chief executive that it considered
over 140 people possessing the qualifications laid down in section
12 subsections (1) and (2) of the CFA Ordinance, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that these included serving Justices of Appeal, serving
High Court Judges, barristers who have practiced as a barrister or
solicitor in Hong Kong for at least 10 years, and retired chief
justices, retired justices of appeal and retired judges of the
High Court who qualify under the terms of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Sounding were taken from senior members of the Judiciary and
the legal professions and there has been a systematic narrowing of
choice, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that JORC members relied upon their own assessments and
made up their own minds, but pointed out that their views
coincided with the main drift of the views they obtained.
</P>
<P>
The final recommendation was unanimous, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "Article 90 of the Basic Law requires the
Chief Executive to obtain the endorsement of the Legislative
Council on the appointment of the Chief Justice of the Court of
Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
"To have the chief justice and the HKSAR Judiciary in place on
July 1, 1997, it is essential that a number of procedural steps be
taken in the early hours of that day."
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that these steps can be successfully taken within
the time constraints, it is necessary to obtain in advance a firm
indication from the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of its
intention as to the endorsement of Mr. Li as Chief Justice of the
Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the Secretary of Justice (Designate) will move a
motion on May 24 to seek support from the PLC for Mr. Li to be
appointed as Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added, "This preparatory work is being undertaken
to ensure a smooth transition for the Judiciary. Due process as
stipulated in the Basic Law and the laws of Hong Kong will take
place on July 1, 1997."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Britain in Talks on Mutual Air Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Britain entered new
negotiations on Monday in London, in an effort to end the latest
conflicts between them caused by mutual air ban.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian reported that the British Department of Transport
and the Federal Ministry of Aviation of Nigeria were involved in
the talks coordinated by the British Civil Aviation Authorities.
</P>
<P>
Sources were quoted as saying that there was high optimism
that the talks would yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
But a manager of the British Airways Office in Lagos described
the dispute as a "political affair" that demands much greater
will than just the reconciliation of technical terms.
</P>
<P>
The British government announced the ban of all
Nigeria-registered planes from flying to London on safety reasons
on May 16, only to be followed by a similar ban from the Nigerian
side on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The blow on the Nigerian side is furying, as its national flag
carrier, the Nigerian Airways, has been banned from flying to
London since February on alleged insurance fraud and was just
ready to resume its flights.
</P>
<P>
But the British Airways was even hurt worse. On the day of
the ban, one of its Lagos-bound flight had to be averted to
Accra, Ghana. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of Filipinos who died of
AIDS has reached 158 since the dreaded disease was first reported
in the country in 1984, the Department of Health said today.
</P>

making sexual transmission the leading cause of the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Other modes of transmission such as blood transfusion,
injecting drug use through needles and syringes, prenatal
infection from infected mother were also reported in the
department's AIDS Registry.
</P>
<P>
As the country's HIV infection cases nearing a thousand mark,
the department said it is seeking new approaches in combating the
spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Among these approaches are the declaration of this year's
National AIDS Prevention Year to drum up AIDS education and
awareness, and the country's hosting of the Fourth International
AIDS Congress in Asia and the Pacific on October 25-29.
</P>
<P>
The congress, with the theme Partnership Across Borders Against
HIV/ AIDS, will tackle latest advances in HIV research, treatment
and prevention in the Asia-Pacific region.

HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A through train from China's
metropolis of Shanghai pulled into the Kowloon (Hung Hom) Station
at 1:10 PM today after a 29-hour maiden journey.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-Kowloon through train, which had traveled some

<HEADLINE> Taliban Launch Massive Attack in Central Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Islamic militia Taliban
have launched a major offensive in the center of the country
following the outbreak of open revolt against their northern-based
opposition, said reports reaching here today from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control more than two-thirds of the Afghan
territory, launched a strong attack near the strategic Shibar
Pass, which opens out to Bamyan province, the stronghold of the
Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat faction led by Karim Khalili, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Shibar Pass, which also provides access to Baghlan and
Samangan provinces controlled by Afghan northern warlord Rashid
Dostum, is an important doorway to the 10 provinces in northern
Afghanistan controlled by the anti-Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have already gained some territories and some local
commanders of the opposing factions have declared support for
Taliban, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forces loyal to general Abdul Malik, right-hand man
of Dostum, who staged a strong revolt in provinces of Faryab,
Jozjan and Samangan as well as Dostum's stronghold, Mazar-e-Sharif
in Balkh early Monday, continued their fighting with Dostum's
troops.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zaire's New Leader to Arrive in Kinshasa Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's new leader Laurent Kabila
is expected to arrive here today to form "a broad-based unity
government".
</P>
<P>
"A broad-based national unity government would be formed from which
all mobutists will be excluded," said Grattas Bugera, General
Secretary of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation
of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) led by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Though Kabila declared earlier that followers of exiled former
President Mobutu Sese Seko would be excluded from the new government,
but diplomats said a couple of cabinet positions might be reserved for
them only to show that the government is "broad-based".
</P>
<P>
Asked if Etienne Tshisekedi's sacred heart alliance, a major
opposition party during Mobutu's rule, would be given a place
within the government, Bugera replied: "they might be."
</P>
<P>
"The new government will take up the challenge left by Mobutu's
decaying regime to re-build this country which has been crushed to
pulp," said Bugera, Kabila's second man who is now in Kinshasa to
prepare for Kabila's arrival.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, having won a civil war to topple Mobutu, has announced
himself president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the new
name of Zaire, which was given by Mobutu in 1971.
</P>
<P>
He promised to hold the general elections in the central Africa's
largest nation within two years, arguing that the Zairean people will
have to be senticized about and prepared for democracy first.
</P>
<P>
Kabila will fly to the capital from Zaire's second largest city of
Lubumbasi, which now serves as his military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Kabila's forces captured Kinshasa, the capital
of the mineral-rich African country.
</P>
<P>
The country fell to the hands of Kabila's troops within only
seven months.
</P>
<P>
And Mobutu, who was in the Togolese capital of Lome on Sunday and
Monday, is believed to be flown to Morocco in exile. enditem

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Introduce New Tax System: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
introduce a new tax system in the budget of the next fiscal year
starting from July 1, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering proposals to establish a check
base where tax evasion can be reduced to the minimum, Aziz said in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"We are developing a comprehensive data base and the details of
all the registered vehicles, phone connections and properties will
be fed in computers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said every person owning a car, phone or house would have to
file tax returns.
</P>
<P>
A 50 percent increase was expected in the number of tax payers
on this ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz said all banks were preparing reports under the
supervision of the State Bank of Pakistan to point out certain
bank branches which were not earning profit.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal is under consideration to close down the branches
running in loss," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rice Price Up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The price of rice has gone up by
about two U.S. Dollars for a 50-kg bag of rice one day
after the announcement of rice import ban, the Daily Nation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a 50-kg bag of rice was sold at about 27
Dollars on Sunday and some 29 Dollars on Monday in Nakuru, 165
kilometers northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Zahir Gilani of Gilani's Supermarket said that the prices were
likely to hit the ceiling due to high demand in rice in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
Wholesaler Muna Kiratu said that the prices would continue
rising because local production was not adequate.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced on Sunday a ban on
rice imports to ensure a steady and ready market for the local
crop.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, John Kariuki, an official of Kirinyaga District
where Moi slapped the ban, said the ban would save the local rice
sector from collapse.
</P>
<P>
He noted that farmers in Mwea, a rice-producing area, have
been unable to sell rice in the local market because of cheaper
imported rice.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, thousands of tons of rice have been lying at the
National Irrigation Board as buyers prefer imported rice," the
official pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Toppled president of Zaire, Mobutu
Sese Seko, who is staying in Lome for a "technical stopover,"
the capital of Togo, was too sick to meet Togolese President
Gnassingbe Eyadema.
</P>
<P>
Eyadema had planned to visit Mobutu after he returned to Lome
from his home village of Pya Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese government is looking for a plane equipped with
medical facilities to fly Mobutu to Morocco since he was unable
to climb onto the Antonov plane on which he fled Zaire, the Agence
France-Presse quoted a reliable source in Lome as saying.
</P>
<P>
Because of the situation of his health, Mobutu is prolonging his
stay in Togo, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu is staying in a room of the presidential palace of Togo,
and several of his family members who fled with him are occupying
about 30 rooms in a luxurious hotel in the Togolese capital.
</P>
<P>
The final destination of exile for Mobutu is either Morocco or
France.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Summit to Fix New Date for Liberia's Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- West African leaders are scheduled
to decide a new date for Liberia's elections at a summit on
Wednesday in the Nigerian capital of Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The polls was earlier set on May 30 with the elected
government to be inaugurated on June 15, according to a peace
agreement signed in Abuja last year.
</P>
<P>
But the original date was no longer tenable, Nigeria's Foreign
Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi said Monday night at an extraordinary
ministerial session of the Committee of Nine on Liberia under the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The latest development follows the request by the Liberian
political parties for postponing the elections in order to be
better prepared.
</P>
<P>
A decision was already made to shift the elections to July at
a meeting over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, Ikimi cautioned that in recommending a new date, the
summit should "take into account the actual time the Liberian
independent election cimission needs to execute the various
phases of the election process both sequentially and
concurrently."
</P>
<P>
The summit was also called on by a special representive of the
U.N. secretary-general to handle the remaining part of the
transition program so as to consolidate the gains of the peace
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old conflict in Liberia has claimed the lives
of more than 150,000 people, leaving hundreds of thousands
refugees and more than one million displaced.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Welcomes Clinton's Decision to Renew China's MFN Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Shen Guofang said here today that China welcomes the US President
Bill Clinton's announcement to extend most-favored-nation (MFN)
trade status to China for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Shen told a routine press conference here this afternoon that
granting MFN status to each other on an equal footing, as a normal
and mutually beneficial trade arrangement, is the basis for the
expansion of Sino-US economic and trade ties, and is in conformity
to the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people.
</P>
<P>
This decision of President Clinton's is "wise," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shen noted, it should be pointed out that, however,
the annual deliberation by the US side on the renewal of China's
MFN status is not conducive for the two sides to build long-term,
normal and stable trade relations, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Shen expressed the hope that the US side should take active
measures for resolving the MFN issue thoroughly in a bid to create
a good atmosphere and positive conditions for the smooth
development of Sino-US trade relations.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton announced his decision to extend MFN status
to China during a meeting with business leaders at the White House
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Approved Investment in Indonesia Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Investment commitment in Indonesia
in the first four months of this year declined by 17.3 percent to
reach 31.8 billion U.S. dollars, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Reports published by the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM)
Monday said the investment figures reflected a drop both in value
and the amount of projects.
</P>
<P>
It said the number of domestic and foreign investment projects
declined by 34.4 percent and 31.1 percent respectively from the
corresponding period of last year, while the value of domestic and
foreign investment decreased by 16.9 percent and 18 percent each.
</P>
<P>
The declining investment commitments indicate a slowdown of the
national economy, as predicted by economist Rizal Ramili of the
Ecomit Advisory Group late last year, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Rizal, president director of the think tank once said
Indonesia's economy was expected to slow down due to political
uncertainties following the main national agenda, namely the
general election in May 1997 and the presidential election by the
People's Consultative Body (MPR) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Investors, especially foreign ones, will wait and see the
results of the events," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the BKPM reports, the amount of domestic
investment by April 1997 was mostly earmarked for projects in
chemical industry, electricity, gas and drinking water as well as
non-metal mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investors preferred to invest their capital
in the chemical industry, paper industry and metal goods industry.
</P>
<P>
The list of foreign investors shows that Japan still placed
first, with investment worth 2.7 billion dollars: Taiwan, with
investment at 2.6 billion dollars and the United Kingdom, with 1.7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown in investment, the government expressed
its optimism that the country's economy was still in stable
condition, as reflected by the improving inflation figures in the
first four months of this year and increasing trade surplus as of
February this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Harmoko reported following a limited
meeting of economic ministers earlier this month, that the
inflation rate reached 2.8 percent by April this year,
significantly lower than 4.5 percent in the same period of 1996.
The trade surplus continued to increase, from 575.4 million
dollars in January to 964.3 million dollars.

CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nervousness about the future
direction of U.S. interest rates hit Australia's financial markets
today, leaving the local currency slightly weaker.

<P>
The Australian dollar closed today at 77.37 U.S. cents, from a

Marquarie Bank Foreign Exchange Manager Mark O'Leary said the
U.S.'s next rate move was weighing heavily on the interest-rate

A decline in the interest rate differential between the two
countries, was likely to have a negative impact on the Australian
dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
O'Leary said the U.S. dollar had fallen quite dramatically
against the Japanese yen today, and this had been behind the
Australian dollar's fall against the yen.

The U.S. dollar closed at 1.6964 German marks compared with its
close at 1.6931 locally Monday, and it fell to 113.06 Japanese yen

<P>
ANKARA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government troops have
killed more than 1,300 rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) during the cross-border military operation which
started Wednesday in northern Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that with the support of air bombing and
artillery fire, the Turkish government troops have destroyed the
PKK camps in Pirbela, Avagoze, Haftanin, Sinat, Hakurk, Sivi, Zap
and Kani Masi in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish village guards in the towns of Yekmal, Dagdibi,
Senoba, Yemisli, Ortabag, Gulyazi and Ortasu joined the military
campaign against the PKK, which attacked the Turkish military and
civilian targets in eastern and southeastern Turkey from northern
Iraq, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
A large group of PKK militants have fled to seek shelter in
the city of Sulaymaniyah controlled by Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) led by Celal Talabani near the Iranian border and
another PKK group are escaping to the camps in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military operation this year is significantly
different from the previous ones. This operation, which is
continuing in the region, followed a call for aid by Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war, which has claimed
over 23,000 lives in eastern and southeastern Turkey since
August 1984.

MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Press Secretary Hector

Villanueva said an old man, apparently mentally deranged, was

What really happened, he said, was that when the presidential

leave the slaughterhouse immediately.
</P>
<P>
"You can never call that an assassination attempt," Villanueva
said.

Mubarak said, adding: "Israel must fulfill the agreements reached

<HEADLINE> Growth of Israeli Economy Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Israeli economy
slowed down to an annual rate of 2 to 3 percent during the year
ending March in comparison with those around 7 percent in late
1980s and early 90s.
</P>
<P>
According to initial estimates published this week by the
Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, Israel's economy grew at an
annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing consensus amongst forecasters that
growth this year will only reach 1-2 percent," said Hebrew
University professor of Public Finance Eytan Sheshinski, who
maintained the economy was not yet in recession but in serious
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
There must be an immediate joint cut in Bank of Israel
interest rates by at least 1 percent and a budget cut of 700
million to 800 million shekels (some 206-232 million U.S. dollars),
according to Sheshinski.
</P>
<P>
Among the major changes in the economy in the first quarter
was a substantial increase in exports, and a 50 percent decline
in government-sponsored housing investments.
</P>
<P>
The export of goods and services showed a 13-14 percent rise
on the previous quarter, while exports grew 6 percent during the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports, excluding military purchases, ships and airplanes
increased 5-6 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption expenditure rose at an annual rate of 7
percent following a considerable reduction in per capita private
consumption between October and December.

<HEADLINE> China to Start Deep-Sea Exploration in Eastern Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese vessels will leave
the capital of Guangdong Province in south China tomorrow to
explore for mineral resources in the eastern waters of the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The half-year expedition will look for polymetallic nodule
resources in an area belonging to China, Jin Jiancai,
secretary-general of the China Ocean Mineral Resources Research
and Development Association, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"The exploration is aimed at doing a thorough survey in the
pioneer area, and a study of its physical, chemical, biological
and geological properties," said Zhang Guozhen, one of chief
scientists in the expedition.
</P>
<P>
Deep-sea surveys began in the late 1950s and by now scientists
have done studies on the ocean beds under nearly half of the
earth's surface, and have discovered petroleum and natural gas
reserves equal to two times those on land.
</P>
<P>
Scientists around the world have found large mineral and
biological resources under the sea which might be used by human
being in the next century. It is estimated that there would be
more than 70 billion tons of polymetallic nodules 4,000 to 6,000
meters deep.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Ocean is regarded as one of the best sites for
commercial exploitation in the future.
</P>
<P>
The China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development
Association was registered in the United Nations in 1991 as a
pioneer in international sea-bed exploration, acquiring the rights
to polymetallic nodule areas covering 150,000 sq km in the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, China has sent four vessels to the area
to study hundreds of sites, and has discovered reserves of
manganese, copper, nickel and cobalt, which can be exploited for
20 years.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Cooperate with New Zairian Government: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to continue
consolidating and developing Sino-Zairian friendly and cooperative
relations with the new Zairian government on the five principles
of the peaceful co-existance as it has had long-term friendly and
cooperative ties with Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made this remark in
response to a question concerning the latest developments in Zaire
at a routine press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the Chinese government has always concerned itself
very much with the development of the situation in Zaire, and held
that the domestic affairs of any country should be resolved by its
own people.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Kabila, leader of the Alliance of the Democratic Force
for the Liberation of Congo, declared taking the position of state
leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo on May 17, Shen noted.
"We are glad that the situation in Zaire is moving towards
relaxation."
</P>
<P>
"China respects the choice of the Zairian people, and sincerely
hopes that Zaire will restore its overall stability as early as
possible so as to devote itself to developing the national economy
and improving its people's living standards," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Welcomes Samphan's Move to Form New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh extended welcome Monday to a move by nominal
Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan to launch a new party, the
Cambodia Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome his new party, " said Ranariddh in a speech in
Kompong Thom province.
</P>
<P>
May Sam Oeun, an adviser to Ranariddh, said the prime minister
came to know the inauguration of the new Party for Khmer
Solidarity through Khmer Rouge radio broadcasts monitored last
week.
</P>
<P>
During the speech, Ranariddh also announced that he welcomed
the request of his half brother and long-time rival, Prince
Norodom Chakrapong, to join Ranariddh's Funcinpec.
</P>
<P>
"While I was in France, (Prince) Chakrapong called to me
requesting to join Funcinpec. I welcome this," the daily quoted
Ranariddh as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chakrapong fled to France after his failure in leading a coup
d'etat in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the second biggest party of Cambodia, the
Cambodia People's Party (CPP), said the two welcomes announced by
the first prime minister showed his weakness.
</P>
<P>
"I believe he has lost his good friends, so now he has to find
allies," said Om Yentieng, an adviser to Hun Sen, the CPP chairman.
</P>
<P>
CPP, which formed a coalition government with Ranariddh in 1993
after U.N.-run elections, will be the biggest rival of the
Funcinpec in the coming legislative elections due to be held in
1998.

<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- UK water companies, industry and farmers face curbs and
higher charges on water pumped from rivers and lakes under
proposals outlined Monday by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott
at a water summit in London.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The UK does not appear to have met all the preconditions for
lifting the European Union's export ban on British beef, according
to Emma Bonino, the European commissioner responsible for food
safety.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- A ban on the sponsorship of sports events by the tobacco

smoking.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:

</P>
<P>
-- Seven out of every ten people arrested in Britain tested
positive for drugs, according to the results of an unpublished

<HEADLINE> Uproar Continues About Jordan's New Press, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new Press and Publication
Law has continued to arouse uproar, with demonstrations and
resignation of more journalists to come.
</P>
<P>
With the new amendments, the Press and Publication Law
primarily prohibits publication of material offensive to the
royal family, information about the Jordanian Armed Forces and
Jordan's military arsenal, and articles that offend "the dignity
or personal freedom of individuals."
</P>
<P>
The government defends the new law as safeguarding the
country's interests while the press said it will endanger the
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Press Association (JPA), after its board submitted
resignation Sunday, organized a sit-in Monday to protest the law
that raises fines on each violator from about 21,186 U.S dollars
to 35,311 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Professional Association also announced Monday
that presidents of all 12 professional associations would resign
as of Saturday unless the government rescinds the amendments that
they think will kill press freedom by forcing in effect most
weekly tabloids to close down.
</P>
<P>
But Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe
said on Jordan's Television Channel Two Sunday that "we found
ourselves committed to saving the country's national fabric and
(then) took the decision."
</P>
<P>
The amendments demand that weekly newspapers raise their
capital from about 21,186 dollars to 423,729 dollars and that
the dailies raise theirs from some 70,621 dollars to 847,458
dollars.
</P>
<P>
While the daily newspapers can easily accommodate this
requirement, majority of the weeklies can not withstand such a
steep increase and therefore have to close down.
</P>
<P>
Now, the government controls two of the three most important
Arabic dailies and the only English daily Jordan Times through
holding shares in concerned equity companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 after wide spread riots demanding for more
democracy, Jordan passed the Press and Publication Law to free
journalists at state-controlled publications and allow independent
newspapers to have autonomy in publishing modest criticism about
the government.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots-Police Clash Occurs During </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Clashes occurred here at the small
hours today between the police and young Greek Cypriot
demonstrators following a U.N.-sponsored bicommunal concert by a
Greek and a Turkish pop singers.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested about 20 people, and three police officers
were reported injured, two of them slightly, as a result of the
clashes with demonstrators opposing the bicommunal concert, who
were throwing stones, burning rubbish and breaking shop windows.
</P>
<P>
The concert started at 11 pm Monday local time (20:00 GMT) in
a specially-arranged football court in the U.N.-controlled
buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Greek pop star Sakis Rouvas and Turkish popular singer Burak
Kut were cheered by over 2,000 spectators from the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this day will mark the beginning of a new era for all
of us," Rouvas told the audience, who responded with cries of
approval "we want peace."
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere was very charged, as the long-separated Greek
and Turkish Cypriots left the concert area. The audience parted
in tears and expressed the wish that they could meet again soon.
</P>
<P>
This bicommunal concert, for which U.N. gave out some 6,000
free tickets to both communities, was attended by political
leaders or representatives from both communities, foreign
diplomats and U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel, along with other U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
Strict measures had been taken by the U.N. to safeguard the
security of all those who were present.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. concert took place with the full backing of the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides announced Monday
that the Cypriot government would not attend the concert but would
support the holding of the event.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the government's political decision for the
Cypriot president and other officials not to attend the concert
because they wanted the concert to be purely a "U.N. and young
people's gathering."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that similar concerts will be held
in the future, covering the island's population.
</P>
<P>
However, a counter-concert, in opposition to the U.N.
sponsored one, was organized by the Cyprus Motorcycle Federation
and the Pancyprian Anti-occupation Movement at Eleftheria Square
in down-town Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the gathering, some young demonstrators, who
left Eleftheria Square in an attempt to get close to the venue
of the U.N.-sponsored concert, clashed with the Cypriot police.
</P>
<P>
They threw stones, set fire to rubbish and broke shop
windows, and police responded with tear gas trying to disperse
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from the scene said a couple of people were
injured and were rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to issue
invitations to the leaders of the two communities on the island
for a face-to-face negotiation by the middle of this year.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Join Efforts to Eradicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- All African countries have
been urged to join efforts to remove estimatedly 50 million
landmines on the continent and to accept a total ban on them,
local daily the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki and Truth and Reconciliation Commission Chairman Archbishop
Desmond Tutu at Africa's first government-sponsored anti-landmine
conference, which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, being attended by about 250
delegates from 41 African nations, was organized by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the South African
government.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said meaningful development, security and stability were
inconceivable without a complete ban on anti-personnel landmines
in Africa, citing Africa is the world's most impoverished, but
most heavily mined continent.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 African countries, including South Africa, have so far
signed a treaty banning the use of anti-personnel landmines in their
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tutu said governments should make a public
commitment to support the Ottawa treaty which called for the
banning of production, distribution, stockpiling and usage of
landmines.
</P>
<P>
"These diabolical, indiscriminate killers can't tell the
difference between friend or foe, war and ceasefire," said Tutu.

<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Three express trains that transport
fresh and frozen foodstuff to Hong Kong and Macao were honored
today in Beijing for their 35-year contribution to supplying Hong

The three trains help maintain the long-term prosperity and
stability of the Hong Kong and Macao economies, and economic
cooperation and trade exchanges between China's inland areas and
the two regions, she said, noting that the return of Hong Kong
will place new demands on the three express trains, as exchanges
become more frequent.

<P>
She pledged that her ministry will increase the importance of
the three trains and bring their active role into full play.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, the minister of railways, also made a commitment to

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African government,
troubled with mounting crimes and overcrowded prisons, has
announced it will invite the private sector to help build new
jails.
</P>
<P>
Tender documents asking companies to bid for the financing,
design, construction and operation of four new prisons will be

Many existing prisons in South Africa are reportedly in bad
conditions and overcrowded. The number of prisoners in some jails
exceeds by about 50 percent compared with what it should be,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners in the country rose from 125,000 at the end of
1996 to more than 130,000 currently while escapees reach about 100
a month, one of the highest in the world.

<HEADLINE> Australian Farmers' Group Blasts Hanson's Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Xenophobic policies advocated by
independent MP Pauline Hanson could have a disastrous effect on
Australia's exports to Asia, the head of the country's leading
farm lobby group warned here today.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) Donald
McGauchie said misinformation was being used by extreme elements
in the community to create fear, loathing and suspicion,
particularly of Asians.
</P>
<P>
In her maiden speech to parliament last September, Hanson
called for an end to immigration, saying that Australia risked
being swamped by Asians.
</P>
<P>
"Xenophobic policies in all areas, whether that be economic,
trade, immigration or race, have the capacity to damage
Australia's interests very much," the president told the NFF
annual conference.
</P>
<P>
"For the rural sector, committed as it is to pursuing and
capturing emerging Asian markets particularly through partnerships
with Asian companies, the public canvassing of such extreme
jingoism can have disastrous effects," McGauchie said.
</P>
<P>
He said the comments came at a time when food exports to Asia
were growing at an annual trend rate of 19 percent, with
Australian products making up six percent of total food imports
into Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We must never forget that when we target Asia, we are
targeting very sensitive communities, with disparate beliefs and
customs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very easy for Asian buyers to favor suppliers with
no apparent history of racism, because they hold all the cards in
trade negotiations and they are not about to do any favors for a
nation they perceive to support xenophobia."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister
Tim Fischer described Hanson's policy as morally wrong and warned
Australia's 38.5 billion US dollars exports to Asia would be
placed in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Other community and business leaders, including tourism,
education and trade, have also voiced their concern over Hanson's
policies during the past several months.

<HEADLINE> Regional Tariffs Study to Start in East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A study for tariff harmonization
in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda is scheduled to start later this
month in a bid to facilitate adoption of uniform taxes in the
region, the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily paper quoted Sam Turyamuhika, Chairman of Uganda
Revenue Authority, as saying that each of the three countries
would have the same tariffs on the harmonization court, adding
that tariffs in the region should be reduced as of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He noted: "Free trade and a common market are inevitable.
The sooner we create a common market the better for us.
protectionism will be unsuitable."
</P>
<P>
The three countries, which set up the East African Cooperation
(EAC) last year, is to meet here this week to review the progress
in harmonizing regional standards and to recommend a list of
products that can now be freely traded within the region.
</P>
<P>
The harmonized standards are expected to remove delays caused
by inspection and testing, making it easier for products of the
three countries to trade within the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenya Bureau of Standards (KBS), requirements in
import of animals and plants have already been harmonized.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala secretariat of the regional standards body has put
out agreed specification for 40 items of products.
</P>
<P>
Works on 28 standards and codes of practice has been
completed, including those for edible food-grade salt, raw sugar,
dry primary cells and batteries, and hot rolled mild steel bars
for reinforcement of concrete.

<HEADLINE> Sight-Restoring Project in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Lions Club International has agreed
to donate 15 million US dollars for a sight-restoring project in
China.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed here today by Augustin Soliva,
president of Lions Club, and Deng Pufang, Chairman of the China
Disabled Persons' Federation. It is the largest Sino-foreign
co-operative project ever for helping people with disabilities in
China.
</P>
<P>
The five-year program, which will start July 1, will include
operations for 1.75 million people suffering from cataracts,
establishing eye clinics in 100 county hospitals, training 11,000
ophthalmologists for rural areas, and educating the general public
on how to prevent and treat blindness.
</P>
<P>
Offices of Lions Club International can be found in 185 nations
and regions and it is a major global charity. The non-political,
non-profit organization began its worldwide Sight-First program in
1991, Soliva explained.
</P>
<P>
Lions has supplied eye surgery equipment to seven county
hospitals in six provinces, provided 25,000 cataract victims with
sight-restoration operations, and donated for a training center
for cataract treatments in Shunyi county on the outskirts of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China has the world's largest number of blind people, with
about nine million people suffering from some sort of visual
impairment, with cataracts being the leading cause of
blindness. About four out of every ten blind people are victims of
the disease, said Wang Longde, vice-minister of public health.
</P>
<P>
He said that China launched a large-scale sight-restoring
program for cataract sufferers in 1988 and more than 1.75 million
cataract operations have been done over the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, there are 400,000 new cases reported
each year, and the incidence of cataract-caused blindness has not
been brought under control since most of the victims cannot afford
surgery or other treatment, and nearly 500 county hospitals have
no ophthalmology department, and there is a shortage of equipment
and instruments as well as expertise.

<HEADLINE> Zambia May Face Maize Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambia may have a shortfall of between
500,000 and two million bags (90 kilograms per bag) of maize this
marketing season, the Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Ajay Vashee, President of the Zambia
National Farmers Union, as saying at the weekend that one of the
reasons for a possible maize deficit is that maize production is not
as profitable as other cash crops.
</P>
<P>
Other factors included the lack of proper storage facilities
for the crop throughout the country. "Every season maize is
soaked because of lack of proper storage facilities and this in
turn brings weevils which attack the crop," Vashee said.
</P>
<P>
The larger grain borer is another problem as it is costly
for farmers to procure chemicals to fight the weevils.
</P>
<P>
Vashee said that organizing proper storage facilities for crops
is a costy exercise and farmers need an injection of enough cash if
they are to overcome the problem. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Largest Platinum Mine Project Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The developers of Zimbabwe's
largest platinum mine said Monday their pre-production start-up
costs have increased the total cost of the project up
from the original 287 million U.S. Dollars to 364 million.
</P>
<P>
In a report released here, Delta Gold NL of Australia said the
unexpectedly slower production build-up of the Hartley mine was
likely to cause a hike in the working capital and pre-completion
operating costs.
</P>
<P>
The report said the construction of all surface facilities has
been completed under world class standards in keeping with the
long-term running of the platinum project.
</P>
<P>
The company said as of March 31 this year, a total of 2,950
workers had been employed at the mine. The figure was estimated
to rise to 3,125 when full production is achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Hartley mine is expected to produce 150,000 ounces of platinum
per year when it reaches full production of 180,000 tons of ore
per month by September next year. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli Researchers Find Gene Linked to Breast, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A new gene mutation causing
breast and ovarian cancers has been found in Israel, local English
daily The Jerusalem Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The gene, discovered for the first time, was found by
researchers at Sheba hospital at Tel Hashomer, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the hospital said the new mutation was found
to appear in Jewish women originating in Iran and Afghanistan,
although women from these communities have been long considered at
low risk to develop these diseases.
</P>
<P>
In families of Iranian and Afghan origin, where the diseases
have struck several women, the mutation has been found in all the
women examined so far.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Eitan Friedman, director of the once-genetic unit at
the Tel Hashomer hospital, said that those found to bear the
mutation should undergo periodic examinations to detect the
disease early if it does appear.
</P>
<P>
Friedman said his hospital has developed a technique that
allows the accurate diagnosis of the mutation without the use of
the radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
Until now, some of the women who were examined to have the
mutation and who were past their child-bearing age have had
their ovaries removed as a preventive measure, the report
added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Starts to Reverse Downwards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
started to reverse its downward trend as non-oil domestic exports
increased on a monthly basis for the first time in April after
five consecutive months of declines, the Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB) announced today.
</P>
<P>
However, the TDB noted that on a three-month moving average
basis, total traded at current prices in April this year decreased
marginally by 0.9 percent, with non-oil domestic exports declining
by one percent, while re-exports increasing by four percent in the
month.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, non-oil domestic exports rose by 5.9
percent in April, due mainly to an increase of 13.4 percent in
domestic exports of semiconductors following five months of
continued declines.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports also went up, by 11.7 percent as a result of
stronger demand for electronics and related products. Imports in
April recorded an increase of 2.5 percent due partly to the
delivery of ships during the month, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
However, it cautioned that as monthly trade data tends to be
volatile, "It is too early to conclude on the basis of April's
figures that the recovery in global electronic demand has begun."
</P>
<P>
On a three-month moving average basis, non-oil domestic exports
fell by one percent to a level of 7.7 billion Singapore dollars
(about 5.38 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that in line with the economic recovery in the
European Union, non-oil domestic exports to the EU went up by 3.7
percent in April, while that to Malaysia recorded a positive
growth of 7.1 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports declined by 10.3 percent in April because
of the softening of oil prices as well as a drop in volume due to
lackluster demand from Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports recorded an increase of four percent to reach a
level of 6.6 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.62 billion US
dollars). The increases were mainly in re-exports of integrated
circuits, computer parts and peripheral, disk drives, radios and
parts, and other electronics products.
</P>
<P>
Imports in April decreased by 1.9 percent to 15.9 billion
Singapore dollars (about 11.12 billion US dollars) and the
decreases were reflected in imports of parts of diodes, photocells
and transistors, parts of video cassette recorders and capacitors.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the TDB noted that there were increases in
imports of computer parts and peripherals, disk drives,
transmitters and transmitter-receivers and other products.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Leads China in CAD Technology Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, a leading heavy
industrial center in northeast China, was recently designated as
China's pilot area for the use of Computer Aided Design (CAD)
technology.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission made the decision
for two reasons: One is Liaoning's place as an old industrial base
with 1,426 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises,
accounting for a tenth of the national total. The other is that
Shenyang's New-Alpine Software Co. Ltd is largest of its kind in
China.
</P>
<P>
Local industry is welcoming the decision. Over 130 enterprises
have signed technology transfer contracts with 11 CAD agents, with
a value of 30 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Huang Guoping, chief engineer of the Anshan Bicycle Group, said
that if the traditional practice of manually-operated design
continues, their products will be eliminated by the fierce
competition on both domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, the group has signed a contract for CAD
technology costing 600,000 yuan even though it is short of funds,
Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
The province will build three CAD development centers, one for
software development, one for hardware research, and the other for
personnel training, located in Shenyang, Dalian and Jinzhou.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, CAD technology will be used by 70
percent of the large and medium-sized machine manufacturers in
Liaoning, approaching the level of developed countries in the
early 1990s. Technology will be introduced at all design
institutes, according to a local government official.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe, Mandela Call for Improved Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and South Africa have
resolved to strengthen cultural and economic ties so as to enhance
growth and development in the two countries and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and his visiting South
African counterpart Nelson Mandela made the remarks last night
at a banquet in honor of Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that "trade between our countries continues to
flourish."
</P>
<P>
"History has decreed that the trade balance is skewed in our
favor. But we have it in our power to achieve a more equitable
trade relationship, and South Africa is committed to working
towards that goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we reinstated the negotiated preferences on
textiles and clothing, as we move carefully towards our shared
goal of reducing internal barriers to regional trade," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called for an effective strategy for sustained
regional growth and balanced development which would empower the
southern African region further as a trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he was glad that strong economic relations had
been established between his country and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Our two governments have also concluded a number of
agreements in such areas as transportation, defence and trade,"
said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
During Mandela's visit, businessmen of the two countries
also held talks together, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that at that forum you will hear, first hand,
the concerns of Zimbabwean businessmen and women on matters
regarding trade between our two countries and the urgent need to
complete the negotiation process on some trade issues," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Animal Feed Group to Boycott EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Animal Feed Association
has agreed to stop importing the ingredients for animal feed
production from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made Monday after Thai shrimp raisers request
to try to prevent the EU from further cutting tariff privileges
for shrimp imports from Thailand under its generalized system of
preferences (GSP).
</P>
<P>
Thai shrimp exports are set to lose more of their previous
benefits under the EU's GSP program.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a 50 percent cut in the preferential tariff
benefits for shrimp imported from Thailand on January 1. Tariffs
are now between 8.1 percent and 9.7 percent, compared with 4
percent to 4.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will be removed from the program entirely in January
1997, and tariffs will range from 12 percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The EU claims that Thailand's economy has reached a level where
it no longer needs full assistance granted to poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
Prasit Damrongchietanon, president of the Thai Animal Feed
Association, was quoted today by local press as saying that his
association understood the needs of local shrimp raisers and would
persuade its members to stop importing additive vitamins and
medicine for aquatic feed from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Thai animal feed producers last year imported ingredients worth
two billion baht (80 million US dollars) from the EU.
</P>
<P>
Prasit said animal feed producers could import the same
ingredients from Asia, the United States and non-EU members in
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka's Troops Launch Major Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Since Sri Lankan government troops
launched the Operation "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory) on May 13,
they have advanced about 24 kilometers into the rebel-held
territory and recaptured three towns including Nedunkerni and
destroyed four camps of Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
They have met with heavy resistance from the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), killing over 200 and injuring more than 300
of them during the past six days, while the government side
suffered less casualties with 54 dead and over 80 wounded out of
the 20,000 military personnel participating in the operation,
according to military figures.
</P>
<P>
The operation, conducted with air support, is aimed at securing
a safe land route from Vavuniya to Kilinochchi area in the north
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Vavuniya Town, 254 kilometers north of Colombo, is considered
the gateway to the Northern province and the key town serving the
needs of the community extending from Mannar in the West to
Mullaitivu in the east.
</P>
<P>
At the outset of the operation, the troops advanced unopposed
except for small arms and mortar fire from small groups of the
LTTE, according to a military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Later, however, the LTTE offered heavy resistance as the troops
neared Omanthai Town, the gateway to the LTTE-dominated areas in
the north and where their defense begin.
</P>
<P>
Advancing troops had to fight pitched battles amidst heavy
mortar and artillery fire. The rebels were using the artillery
which had been seized from the army when they over-ran Mullaitivu
last July, according to informed sources.
</P>
<P>
To distract the military offensive, the rebels have been
triggering off incidents outside the war zone. They attacked the
Morawewa police station, killing 25 persons, mostly policemen, and
then, they destroyed a radar station at Kayts and sent infiltrates
into Jaffna peninsula, who launched hit-and-run attacks to keep
the troops bogged down there, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Since the military recaptured the LTTE-held northern Jaffna
Peninsula last May, the LTTE shifted its base southwards and now
command a huge belt of territory running right across the country
from the West coast to the East coast in north-central Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the government has been ferrying supplies to the
north from the mainland by air and sea because the only land route
was under LTTE control.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted the main objective of the operation was aimed
at recapturing a 75 kilometer highway that runs through the
LTTE-held territory to open a land route to northern Jaffna
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, if the military succeeds in opening up the main
highway to the north, the military cost will be greatly reduced
for the government, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
However, LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is unlikely to
commit his forces head on to resist the conventional advance of
the army with superior numbers and equipment, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he is likely to attack military targets in the east,
which have been depleted in order to boost the strength of the
on-going operation "Jaya Sikuru".
</P>
<P>
The observers believe the government's conduct of the war was
taking the country nowhere on the road to end the 14-year-old
ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
They also believe that the military operation was more to goad
the LTTE into peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Increase Diesel, LPG, Kerosene Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
proposed to increase the prices of diesel and cooking gas (LPG) by
15 percent each and that of kerosene by 20 percent in a bid to
make up huge oil pool deficit in the country, a government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, it will propose that the subsidies on diesel
and LPG be phased out in two and three years respectively.
</P>
<P>
The government's proposal will be put before the 13-party
United Front Steering Committee on May 25 for consideration.
</P>
<P>
The government has firmed up the proposal to hike petroleum
products prices after a meeting presided over by Prime Minister
I.K. Gujral last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The price hike is aimed at reducing subsidies on petroleum
products and correcting the serious distortion in the relative
prices of the various products, while reducing the oil pool
account deficit, the same official said.
</P>
<P>
The oil pool account had run up an accumulated deficit of 155
billion rupees (4.366 billion US dollars) as on March 31, 1997
because the cost of supplying petroleum products far exceeded the
revenue realized from sale of these products to consumers.

"Liaoning welcomes Hongkong investors to be more actively
involved in the technical transformation of old enterprises," said
Fu Wanzhong, director of the provincial department of foreign
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Fu, the province plans to choose 100 existing
enterprises for using overseas funding and technology for
revamping.
</P>
<P>
"We offer very flexible arrangements for Hongkong investors to
take part in the scheme," Fu noted, explaining that they can
either choose a workshop, a production line, or production for
investment.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the eight cities of Shenyang, Dalian,
Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Jinzhou, Yingkou, and Dandong have been
designated pilot cities for experimenting with capital structure,
and that those who invest in these cities will enjoy preferential
treatment.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to create an ideal environment and necessary
conditions for Hongkong investors", he said, adding that the
transfer of shareholding rights is another form for
Liaoning-Hongkong cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are being made to transfer part of operation
rights for the Shenyang-Dalian Superhighway and for issuing shares
by major industrial enterprises like Anshan Iron and Steel Works
and the Panjin Ethylene Industry Corporation on the Hongkong Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Further cooperation in foreign trade, especially in technology,
is also being welcomed, as is Hongkong investment in the
province's 20 high-tech zones, and the province will look for ways
to set up high-tech enterprises in Hongkong.
</P>
<P>
The province badly needs the support of the financial sector of
Hongkong, Fu said.

<HEADLINE> Mid-term Polls Inevitable in India: Left Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- India's left political parties
have foreseen mid-term polls six to eight months from now and have
asked the state party units to remain alert for such an
eventuality.
</P>
<P>
Both the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) and the
Communist Party of India (CPI), two constituents of the 13-party
United Front, in their recent meetings to evaluate the current
political situation, were not at all optimistic that the present
I.K. Gujral government would survive at the center.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a miracle if the government survives for long. We
give at the most six to eight months to this government," said a
senior left leader said.
</P>
<P>
"Much as we want this government to survive, everything is not
in our hands," a senior CPI-M politburo member said.
</P>
<P>
The fear of elections has, to some extent, forced the left
parties to distance themselves from the Congress party, the main
supporter of the United Front. At the same time, apprehending
further realignment in the United Front, the left parties have
called for an agitation against the union government's economic
policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province,
a major force in the country's rapid economic development, has
made a great effort to develop its agriculture as well by
investing more than 10 billion yuan over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The heavy input has resulted in the afforestation of 33.3
million hectares of land, the cultivation of 53,000 hectares of
wasteland, and the use of 660,000 hectares of reclaimed land or
pond areas.
</P>
<P>
The province has also transformed more than 610,000 hectares of
low-yielding farmland by almost doubling per unit rice yields to
5,550 kg per hectare, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
To develop a more market-oriented agriculture, Guangdong
introduced over 200 varieties of fruits, vegetables, flowers, and
fish and established production bases for high-quality products.
</P>
<P>
Using more than 600 million U.S. dollars in overseas investment
and an additional two billion yuan in local input, the province
increased facilities for processing and preserving agricultural
products, which sell well in both domestic and overseas markets,
local officials said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Dollar to Be Traded on NY Cotton Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore dollar will make
its debut on the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE) next month in a
landmark development that is not too welcoming to the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Singapore dollar, three other ASEAN
(Association of South East Asian Nations) currencies, the
Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah, and the Thai baht, will
also be traded against the US dollar from the end of June, the
report said, citing NYCE senior vice-president Charles Miner as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite its name, about 40 percent of the trading volume of the
125-year-old exchange is in financial futures products. A futures
contract is an agreement for sale and purchase of a commodity or
financial product at a pre-determined price but for delivery
sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Time report noted that the MAS is unlikely to be
happy with this development. For years, it has argued against the
internationalization of the Singapore currency because this would
amount to a loss of control of a critical instrument of economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
The MAS thus has a long-standing policy of controlling bank
lending of Singapore dollars to non-residents, and to residents if
the funds are used outside Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Miner said that the MAS is certainly not going to bless it. But
it would be pointless to oppose it, he added, noting that the MAS
and the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission had a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) on the regulation of futures markets.
</P>
<P>
"We are under US jurisdiction, but the MOU means Singapore
could have some sort of interest and influence. They can express
any concern that want at that level but so far we haven't heard
anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that having financial futures contracts would
not encourage excessive speculation in the four ASEAN currencies.
It is simply an added avenue for hedging, in addition to the
interbank currency market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bonded Zone in North China, Ideal Place for Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Hao Yongkuan, a Hongkong
businesman, made a fortune by becoming one of the earliest
overseas investors in a bonded zone in the Chinese port of
Tianjin, where he started a cashmere production business.
</P>
<P>
Hao put 1.5 million US dollars into the zone five years ago,
and each subsequent year had substantial earnings and annual
profits ultimately of more than three million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He has been so successful that his enterprises group now has
four subsidiaries and a dozen cashmere production bases.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Bonded Zone, by attracting two million US dollars
worth of overseas investment daily, has become one of the most
dynamic open areas in north China.
</P>
<P>
Since it opened six years ago, the zone has attracted over
3,000 enterprises from 73 countries and regions and 25 Chinese
provinces, with two billion US dollars worth of overseas
investment and a total pledged investment of 3.17 billion US
dollars, putting it first among 14 counterparts in China.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, the zone has had a GDP of 1.83 billion
yuan (220.48 million US dollars), conducted foreign trade worth
1.9 billion US dollars, and paid 407 million yuan in taxes.
</P>
<P>
The zone has established trade contacts with over 100 countries
and regions, trading in more than 1,000 commodities with overseas
trade partners.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Wants Local Polls to Be Nulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition party
will urge the government to invalidate the local elections held in
West Nepal on Saturday, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of the Nepali Congress (NC) party made the decision
Monday at an emergency meeting here after preliminary election
results indicated the party was losing majority control of the
country's local administration bodies, according to sources close
to the party.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called in order to decide the NC party's
strategy in the second phase of the local elections in Central and
East Nepal, scheduled for the coming Sunday, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
NC party leaders Monday also repeated their claims that the
government failed to maintain security and order during the local
polls on Saturday with a view to giving an advantage to the major
ruling partner, the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
Reports of vote counting results from West Nepal showed that
the CPN-UML has comfortably overtaken the NC, which held about
two-thirds of the country's all local administrations before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The NC party has accused the government of tacitly encouraging
CPN-UML activists to carry out violence against NC workers while
motivating voters during the Saturday polls at about 1,800
villages and 24 municipalities in West Nepal.
</P>
<P>
An NC delegation is expected to formally inform the government
of the alleged widespread violence by CPN-UML workers and ask the
Election Commission to declare the polls invalid and call
re-elections, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, the NC's arch rival in parliament, joined Prime
Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's ruling coalition when an NC-led
government collapsed last March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chand Monday appealed to all the
people in the country to show up for the local elections, assuring
that the government has made proper arrangements for law and
order.

<HEADLINE> Drug Suspect to Be Extradited to U.S. from Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Criminal Court of Thailand has
ordered the extradition of drug suspect Li Yun-Chung to the United
States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Li, also known as Pongsak Rojanasaksakul, waived his right to
fight extradition proceedings brought against him by Thai public
prosecutors on the request of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Li has been accused by the U.S. of importing 486 kilograms of
heroin into California in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The extradition verdict was handed down to him on Monday,
following his re-arrest in Myanmar and return to Thailand on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Li was arrested in July last year in Thailand but he jumped
bail in February this year and fled to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Li told the court that he had waived all rights to fight the
extradition proceedings and requested that he be quickly sent to
stand trial in the U.S. for the sake of his safety.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to be afraid of being killed by his former drug
smuggling associates and those who were involved in granting him
bail to stop him from revealing their names and misconduct.
</P>
<P>
An investigation was going on into allegations that he had
bribed his way to freedom following his first arrest with another
suspect.
</P>
<P>
Li has 15 days to make an appeal against the extradition order.

BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Canadian warships will visit
Thailand later this month to hold joint military exercises with
the Thai navy, scheduled for May 26, according to the Canadian
ambassador to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The visit, by HMCS Huron and Vancouver, will be the third of an
annual program launched by the Canadian navy in 1995, said
ambassador Manfred Von Nostitz.
</P>
<P>
The visit will also cover other members of the seven-member
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Brunei, Indonesia,
Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, with the only exception
of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The HMCS Vancouver is a Halifax-class patrol frigate equipped
with sophisticated anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons and
warfare systems. It carries one sea king helicopter.
</P>
<P>
The HMCS Huron is an Iroquois-class air-defense destroyer
equipped with sophisticated anti-air weapon systems and an
improved propulsion system. It carries up to two sea king
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The sea king helicopter is a five-bladed, twin-engine,

<HEADLINE> Telecommunications Vital Link in Chinese Disaster Relief Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 people trying to
survive a typhoon in Qiantian County in Zhejiang Province in east
China were rescued thanks to information transmitted over a mobile
phone.
</P>
<P>
The case demonstrated the role played by modern
telecommunications in disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang suffers from a large number of natural disasters, like
floods and typhoons. So, when the province was building its
telecommunications network, authorities put a great deal of effort
into constructing it in coastal, mountainous, or remote areas to
try to keep the losses that often occur at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Now, all 1,843 towns and townships are linked up by a unified
telephone network. With the comprehensive net covering the whole
province, even fishermen in the East China Sea are in contact with
their family members via mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
The telecom network has even, in certain cases, been involved
in directly saving lives. Three years ago, when a severe typhoon
wreaked havoc in Wenzhou, a coastal city, the 114 Inquiry Line
handled 3,200 calls in less than 12 hours, and was praised for
being a "lifeline" for local people.

DHAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina left here for southern Chittagong and adjourning areas hit
on Monday by a cyclonic storm, which might left 500 people dead,
over 300 missing and several thousand injured.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that about 400 people were feared
killed in Cox's Bazar district and more than 100 fishermen
reported missing in Patuakhali area while five deaths were
confirmed in this country's biggest port city of Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who postponed her scheduled state visit to
Spain Monday, has directed all civil departments and armed forces
to join the people to combat the first-ever severe cyclone this
year and take all-out measures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader
Khaleda Zia will also visit the cyclone-hit area today and she has
instructed her party leaders and workers to stand by the affected
people and join rescue and relief operations in those areas.
</P>
<P>
The storm, within 74 kilometers of its epicenter, struck the
coastal belt of Bangladesh at a speed ranging from 180 to 200
kilometers per hour on Monday, tearing and twisting everything
that came in its way.
</P>
<P>
Most deaths were feared caused by storm, tidal surge and house
collapse, said a local police official.
</P>
<P>
The casualties are likely to be less than feared as massive
evacuation operations were conducted by the district
administration and volunteers to transfer over one million people
from vulnerable areas to cyclone shelters during the last two
days.

BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's capital city collected a
record 950 million yuan in individual taxes during the first four
months this year, a surge of 210 million yuan, or 29 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This made the individual earnings tax a major item in the
municipal tax revenue, accounting for 17 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The success came from the redoubled efforts from the local
taxation officials, who have forged stable relationships with all
the working units in Beijing and collected the revenue from the
payroll to a large extent.
</P>
<P>
Specific regulations were unveiled to tighten tax
collection from self-employed workers, architects, performers, and
people working in the catering and entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
China's tax revenue from individual earnings has surged to
19.306 billion yuan from five million yuan in 1981, when such taxes
were first imposed, and is expected to reach 20 billion yuan this

WELLINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 260 delegates from 43
countries are meeting in New Zealand's South Island city of
Christchurch to map out the future of Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
A media release issued by the Foreign Ministry today said the
two-week-long meeting will be formally opened next Monday and will
be addressed by NZ Prime Minister Jim Bolger.
</P>
<P>
But an Antarctic Treaty consultative meeting began yesterday
and delegates will spend the first week on details, particularly
in the environmental area, before considering big policy issues
next week, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The gathering is currently in four parts. There is a liability
group, which is working on drafting an annex to the Environmental
Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty. This will answer questions about
who should be held liable for damage to the Antarctic environment
through human activities.
</P>
<P>
Another team is the Transitional Environmental Working Group,
which is looking in detail at environmental matters.
</P>
<P>
The other two working groups in Christchurch are examining
policy matters and scientific operations.
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic Treaty, involving over 40 countries including
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Chile, China, France,
Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia and the US, is a unique
international agreement charged with the management of the whole
continent. It is based on the three pillars of peace, the
management of scientific investigation and protection for the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Japan Should Speed up Deregulation: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan should speed up its economic
reforms and deregulation and reduce its high-cost industrial
structure to make the country more attractive to overseas
investors, an annual government report said today.
</P>
<P>
"It is an urgent task for Japan to be at the core of the
international division of labor by remaining as a place where
industries are highly concentrated," a white paper for fiscal 1997
released by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
</P>
<P>
"To that end, it is essential for Japan to reconstruct human
resources, research capability and other foundations for
industrial development by accelerating economic structural
reform," said the report for the fiscal year ending in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
An increase in direct foreign investment would have a favorable
impact on Japan's economy, creating jobs and raising income while
at the same time transferring technologies and know-how to Japan,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, direct foreign investment in Japan has been "extremely
sluggish," creating a wide gap between it and Japanese investment
in foreign countries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, foreign investment in Japan was one-thousandth that in
the United States and one-50th that in Taiwan, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Japanese direct investment in foreign countries was
13 times higher than investment in Japan by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The white paper attributed the wide imbalance mainly to Japan's
high wage and real-estate costs as well as heavy corporate tax
burdens.
</P>
<P>
To attract more foreign investment, Japan has to reform its
high-cost industrial structure by promoting deregulation and also
to make administrative procedures more transparent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper called on Japan to reconstruct human resources
and other foundations for long-term economic growth, noting that
Japan's total factor productivity (TFP) is now lagging far behind
that of the U.S. and Germany.
</P>
<P>
TFP measures a nation's long-term growth potential that cannot
simply be found by an increase in production factors, such as
capital and labor, and covers human resources, research
activities, and economic infrastructure and systems.
</P>
<P>
The white paper also called on Japan to encourage research at
universities and to improve its infrastructure, such as
distribution and telecommunications to boost economic growth.

KIEV, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin will
visit Ukraine at the end of May, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Valery Serov, visiting Russian deputy prime minister, said Yeltsin
will pay his first official visit to Kiev on May 30 and 31.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will arrive in Kiev
on May 28 and 29 to prepare for the visit, Serov said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's visit has been put off several times due to
persistent disagreement over the sharing of the former Soviet
Black Sea fleet and the status of its base of Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
Stanislav Lzyebnik, an official from the Ukrainian Foreign
Ministry, said that four agreements will be signed during
Chernomyrdin's visit, covering economic cooperation, tax matters,
computer development and mercury processing.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two countries will collaborate in
customs, education and immigration by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
But no progress has been made on the sharing of the Black Sea
fleet and other former Soviet assets abroad, sources said.

CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The federal budget announced last

The budget, which is under parliament deliberation, forecasts
an economic growth of 3.75 percent for the fiscal year 1997-1998,
a inflation rate of two percent through the year to June 1998, and
an unemployment rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the proposed budget, the government offers tax rebate of a
maximum of 450 Australian dollars (346 US dollars) on individual
savings in an attempt to reduce its reliance on foreign debt and
boost economic development, and plans to eliminate the 10.3
billion Australian dollar debt from Paul Keating's Labor
government by the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party attacked the government last week for its
failure to offer solution to the nation's unemployment issue. The
jobless rate was as high as 8.7 percent at the end of April.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reiterates Commitment to Admit Chile to NAFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley today reiterated his government's commitment to
admit Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
As for the "fast-track" issue, the U.S. commerce secretary told
reporters after a meeting with President Eduardo Frei at the
Moneda Palace, that he personally felt optimistic that it would be
approved in the near future.
</P>
<P>
At a Latin American summit in Miami in 1994 the three partners
in the NAFTA -- the U.S., Mexico and Canada -- offered Chile the
chance to become the fourth member of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., however, has not been able to make good on that
invitation because it lacks "fast-track," a key authorization from
Congress to negotiate new trade deals.
</P>
<P>
Treaties signed under that legislation cannot be amended by
Congress, which must vote them up or down in a short time.
</P>
<P>
During President Frei's visit to the U.S. late February, U.S.
President Bill Clinton said he was seeking the "fast-track" trade
negotiation authority from Congress to conclude new trade
agreements that "open markets to America's products."
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Daley, who arrived last Saturday together
with more than 30 business executives for a four-day visit, said
he also discussed with Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza issues
on trade cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reassured Ukraine on Monday that the Russian-NATO deal reached in
Moscow last week would strengthen European stability and
"positively affect the general political climate in Europe."
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, Yeltsin said
Ukraine's interests were taken fully into account during talks
between Russia and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) on
the pact, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Ukraine's security was not threatened by the
agreement Russia was to sign with NATO later this month.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine had worried that Russian-NATO relations might result in
new division of spheres of influence in Europe, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The country initially opposed NATO expansion, but indicated in
recent months that it might be interested in joining the alliance
at some point.
</P>

Yeltsin is expected to make a long-delayed visit to Ukraine
next week for talks with Kuchma.

Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
EU advisor Armando Jose Ortiz and his driver Leonel Rizo
Espinosa were freed on Sunday in the department of Matagalpa and

5,000 dollars in cash.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Vows to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- New rules forcing civil servants,
lawmakers, local officials and wealthy Russians declare their
"economic interests" is a key part of the government's
anti-corruption drive, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nemtsov said today.
</P>
<P>
Fighting corruption was included in a far-reaching seven-point
program of economic and social reform unveiled today. The program
also includes paying wage arrears to public workers within 12
months, ending tax evasion and making the government more open.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference attended by Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to launch the program, Nemtsov said the decree signed
by President Boris Yeltsin on April 8 ordering government
officials to declare their income and property must be implemented.
</P>
<P>
He said all government personnel, parliamentary members, local
officials and wealthy citizens are required to "declare their
economic interests."
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov added that the State Duma (lower house of parliament)
approved a Law on Income Declaration on May 16, which is expected
to help tighten control of state officials and "cut away at the
roots of corruption".

<HEADLINE> China's Demand For Deluxe Tourist Buses Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The need for deluxe tourist buses
is expected to be more than a thousand in China this year to deal
with the increasing number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
The figure is an increase from last year, market analysts say,
without saying how great the increase is. Luxury tour buses now
mainly operate on China's expressways between tourist cities.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, domestic production can now basically
satisfy demand, but the country imports some deluxe buses.
</P>
<P>
By now, China has set up some ventures with leading foreign
car-manufacturers like Mercedes Benz and Volvo and some local
manufacturers to produce the coaches. One joint venture in Xi'an
with Volvo is expected to produce 400 tourist buses this year, and
the joint venture with Mercedes Benz to produce another 400.

<HEADLINE> China's Nut Export Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's peanut exports are expected
to decrease by more than one third this year, mainly because of
failed harvests last year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking of peanut acreage and the growing of domestic
demand also contributed a lot to the drop of peanut exports,
according to the Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Food
Stuff, Native Produce and Animal By-Products.
</P>
<P>
Peanuts are one of the most important oil-bearing crops in
China, whose output accounts for one third of the world's total,
chamber President Wang Xiaorong said.
</P>
<P>
Wang is scheduled to convey the message when delivering a
speech to the 10th World Peanut Forum on May 21-23 in Italy.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's exports of shelled peanuts reached to
330,000 tons last year according to Chinese customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 tons of shelled peanut were sold to Europe,
100,000 tons to Southeast Asia, 20,000 tons to Japan and another
40,000 tons to other parts of the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the failed harvests of peanut was due to
droughts in major peanut-growing areas, and rainy weather in
latter part of the growing period.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Seeks 4.6b Dollar Investment in Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) - Bangladeshi Energy Minister Nooruddin
Khan Monday told a donors' meeting that his country need at least
4.6 billion U.S dollars of investment in the power sector by the
year 2000 when the country would need 3,100 megawatt power
generation capacity, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the four-day meeting of the donors beginning here
Monday, the minister said Bangladesh would need 4,600 megawatt
power generation capacity by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
To meet this huge demand the government has already initiated
and adopted private power generation policies, said the minister,
who also highlighted the tremendous potential in the untapped coal
and gas fields in the country.
</P>
<P>
The donors' representatives in the meeting said that Bangladesh
would need to efficiently handle tariff collection, and establish
and maintain the planned infrastructure in the energy sector to
smoothly carry out development actions.
</P>
<P>
The donors also said Bangladesh in the future should find out
ways to utilize hydro power instead of over-depending on natural
gas for power generation.
</P>
<P>
Leading donors, including the World Bank, the Asian Development
Bank, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and Norway, joined the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PLA General Visits Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov today expressed satisfaction over the development of
Russian-Chinese relations and said he would further promote such
friendly cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
A number of factors have contributed to the growth of bilateral
relations, Rodionov told visiting Chinese General Yu Yongbo,
member of China's Central Military Commission and director of the
General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Yu, who arrived here Sunday, said that China and Russia are
friendly neighbors, and the two peoples enjoy profound traditional
friendship.
</P>
<P>
During the exchange of visits between Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his Russian counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, they formulated
the policy of developing strategic coordination partnership
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China will firmly develop Sino-Russian
relations in accordance with the policy, so that the two countries
can become really good neighbors, friends and partners.
</P>
<P>
At a separate meeting with the Chinese general, Chief of
General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Viktor Samsonov said the
Sino-Russian joint statement on world multipolarization and a new
international order, and the agreement on the reduction of armed
forces on the border areas between China and the four countries,
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, are of historical
significance.
</P>
<P>
The statement and agreement, which were signed during Jiang's
Russia visit late last month, conform with the wills of the two
peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides should continue to develop relations
between the two armies and the two countries so as to contribute
to the stability in the Asia-Pacific region and to world peace.
</P>
<P>
Yu expounded China's views on the current international
situation. He said that while the world is developing toward
multipolarization, hegemonism and power politics still threaten
world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
While world economy witnesses a sustained growth, the gap
between the poor and the rich is widening, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a result, safeguarding world peace and
promoting world development still constitute the major tasks of
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Secretary of Russia's Defense Council Yuri Baturin
met with Yu and his entourage at the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Baturin said that leaders of the two countries have laid down
the policy of developing strategic coordination partnership
between the two countries into the 21st century, which is a
guideline for developing bilateral friendly cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He added that the accord on reducing forces on the border areas
between China and the four countries, Russia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, is a good example of consolidating
regional security through reducing, instead of increasing, armed
forces.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Election Campaign to Go on Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite heightening tension and
widespread fears of more violence, the Indonesian government will
not stop the current general election campaign activities, an
official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hsa Yusacc, chief information officer of the Home Affairs
Ministry, quoted Home Minister Yogie S. Memet as saying here on
Monday that violence and anxiety prevailing during the election
campaign has gone "beyond the limits of propriety."
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, the government would not terminate
the campaign activities before their scheduled conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The campaign activities were launched nation-wide on April 27
and were scheduled to terminate on May 23 or six days before the
polling day on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said at least 73 people had already died in
more than 900 violent incidents across the country in the last
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
In this year's campaign, the country is divided into three
groups of campaign areas where the three parties -- the ruling
Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI)-- could do their campaign activities in
turn.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Makes New Moves to Hit at Baht Speculators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has ordered
all 29 local banks not to buy back baht-denominated commercial
papers from their offshore counterparts as part of a strategy to
cut off the baht supply to foreign speculators.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also closed the baht swap market, where
trading is delivered at a specific time in the future, until it
has rewritten permanent rules on how to prevent the currency from
future speculative attack, according to dealers at foreign bank
branches in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The baht was stable on Monday and trading remained quiet
because the central bank had asked for cooperation in not quoting
baht rates to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In the spot market, US dollar/baht trading was quoted in a
range between 25.82 and 25.90, while the Bank of Thailand fixed
its mid-rate at 25.78, down from Friday's 25.82.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency speculators, who have lost badly in the
currency battle because the swap market was closed, are struggling
to borrow the baht from the onshore market in order to close their
positions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign speculators' attack last week sent the baht to an
11-year-low in foreign money markets.
</P>
<P>
Since they have been denied access to the baht in the swap
market, they have tried to get hold of the currency by selling
Thai commercial papers such as bills of exchange or floating rate
notes.
</P>
<P>
Foreign speculators are paying a high price to buy the baht in
order to settle their positions.
</P>
<P>
However, trading has almost stopped as most players were
adopting a wait-and-see strategy until they were sure the central
bank could prevent further attacks on the currency.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, dealers hope that the trading control should
not last too long as the trickle of foreign capital flowing into
the country might dry up.

</P>
<P>
The 467 kilometer-long pipeline will transport 10 million cubic

<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentine exports to Brazil rose 37 percent to
711.4 million U.S. dollars in April, against 518.7 million dollars
in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the first four months of this year, Argentine exports to
Brazil soared to 2.53 billion dollars, a new record in trade with
Brazil for the period.
</P>
<P>
Brazil exported 1.81 billion dollars of goods to Argentina in
the first four months of this year, up 30 percent over the same

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Increase 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in the first
quarter this year were valued at 365.4 billion baht (14.6 billion
US dollars), an increase of 3 percent over the same period last
year, according to the figures issued by the Thai Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's imports totaled 452.2 billion baht (18.08 billion US
dollars), an decline of 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's trade deficit in the first quarter this year was
down 23.3 percent to 86.8 billion baht (3.47 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in the first three months in 1996 amounted to
113.09 billion baht (4.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry attributed the increase in exports to the
strong growth in the manufactured goods sector which accounted for
63.6 percent of the total export value in the first quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
The high performers in the manufactured goods sector included:
computers and parts, integrated circuit boards, televisions and
parts, air-conditioners and components, canned seafood, vehicles
and parts, and electronic transformers and parts.
</P>
<P>
But the value of farm products exports fell 12.2 percent to
50.2 billion baht (2.008 billion dollars), agroindustrial goods
fell 9.5 percent to 35.4 billion baht (1.41 billion dollars), and
fuels and minerals dropped 9.7 percent to 1.7 billion baht (68
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee was quoted today by
local press as saying that the quarterly trade performance showed
the export sector was on the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has forecast export value to reach 1,550
billion baht (62 billion dollars) this year, up 10 percent over
last year when growth was almost zero.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Situation Static Despite Violence, Says Italian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite the violence in the southern
port of Vlore this morning and the political stalemate over
electoral reforms, the situation in Albania remains essentially
static, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say that the situation is deteriorating," Dini told
reporters who questioned him following a violent gang shoot-out in
Vlore that left several dead.
</P>
<P>
But "it's not surprising that there are reactions of this kind
at a time when there is disagreement at the central government
level," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tensions underscore "the urgency for an accord on all
the arrangements that will lead to elections, not just an
electoral law, so that the elections can be carried out by the
expected date and with transparency," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Italy, heading a multinational military mission in Albania
after violence gripped the Balkan country in March following the
failure of investment schemes, is pushing hard Albania's main
political parties for an accord for elections on June 29.
</P>
<P>
But its efforts failed after the Albanian parliament passed an
electoral law last week without the consent of the opposition
parties, who threatened to boycott the elections.

<HEADLINE> East China's Farmers Building More Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in east China's Zhejiang
Province have built 480 million sq m of housing in the past 16
years, bringing per capita living space of rural residents to
27.68 sq m., five sq m more than the national average, and putting
the province in first place.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang and the neighboring Jiangsu province have been
especially busy at developing rural industry since China started
its reforms and opening-up in 1979, and farmers have become some
of the biggest beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
By 1996, farmers in Zhejiang had a per capita net income of
2,996 yuan, far surpassing their counterparts in other parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers used to use their new wealth to build
lavishly-decorated villas to show off their new riches, but now
have changed to more economical and practical houses using designs
provided by professional architects or designers, and paying
special attention to providing better facilities such as bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
One result of this is that farmers here now have a more orderly
and hygienic environment, much like that of urbanites, local
officials say.

<HEADLINE> Medi-insurance Face Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Many workers in China who are used
to resorting to the state for coverage of medical expenses now
find their traditional treatment being discontinued, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Individuals are required to pay 10 percent to 20 percent of
their medical bill, which is a big change from the traditional
practice of state employees paying a symbolic registration fee
while all other charges for treatment and medicine are covered by
the state,
</P>
<P>
Though the state is still paying the larger portion of medical
expenses, even the small share that should be paid by individuals
may prove more than they can afford.
</P>
<P>
Establishing and improving a comprehensive medical insurance
has been advocated by many experts as a solution. While the
insurance market in China has been swelling in recent years,
medical insurance seems to be left out in the cold.
</P>
<P>
The present medical insurance includes only "medical insurance
for hospitalization" and "collective insurance for serious
illness." Drawbacks such as limited coverage, low premiums and the
absence of lifelong insurance contribute to medical insurance's
falling into disfavour.
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons why Chinese insurance companies hesitate
to take medical insurance as a top option which include
irregularities in hospital management and doctors lacking
professional ethics.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies should also work more closely with
hospitals. Only a more perfect system will guarantee the insurance
companies' business being carried out in line with international
practice, the paper said.

contacted relevant countries to push for an early opening of the
Eurasia Continental Bridge. They have also been lobbying and
preparing for the building of the 1,000-kilometer Xi'an-Nanjing
Railway, which will give the regions a shortcut to the coastal
cities.
</P>
<P>

MANILA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will resume their talks today
in Cotabato City, the southern province of Maguindanao, to resolve
alleged ceasefire violations in the province.

<HEADLINE> Dishing Up Healthy Diet for Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nutritionists are working on
a national strategy that aims to provide a healthier diet for 230
million-plus school-children in China, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 nutritionists and officials in charge of health
and education affairs from across the country will gather in
Chongqing today -- National Student Nutrition Day -- to devise a
perfect menu for the future.
</P>
<P>
The theme for the year is "nutrition gives you health, wisdom
and strength."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Society for Student Nutrition Promotion (CSSNP),
entrusted by the Ministry of Public Health and the State Education
Commission, is currently drafting a national regulation on the
provision of nutritious meals for students, said Guo Jieyi, an
official with the society.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, which is expected to come into force within the
year, will urge governments at all levels to support nutritional
improvement for students.
</P>
<P>
CSSNP also plans to set up a foundation to fund publicity and
training of staff working in nutritional improvement for
students. The society also aims to boost the development of
nutritional meals for students and subsidize research in the field.
</P>
<P>
It will also specify duties of different State departments in
the task, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
The physical condition of Chinese students has greatly
improved over the past decade as a result of improvements in
living conditions. But there are still cases of malnutrition and
low body weight in some areas of China, said Guo.
</P>
<P>
The latest national survey on students' health indicated that
32.9 percent of male students have problems with under-development
and malnutrition, and the rate for girls is 43.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
A lack of calcium, vitamins and minerals affect the growth of
many children, the survey revealed. The problems are not caused
by lack of food, but by ignorance of a proper diet.
</P>
<P>
Children eat too many between-meal snacks, say food experts,
adding that students should stay away from foods high in calories
and fat, which have caused too many children to become
overweight.

CANBERRA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A sleep monitoring system
developed by an Australian group will soon be introduced by the
United States to keep astronauts off dream on the job, the
national newspaper the Australian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will
be using technology developed by Melbourne group Compumedics to
ensure that astronauts do not fall asleep on the job when its
international space station is launched in 1999, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Compumedics, which designs and makes sleep monitoring systems
for medical purposes, has devised a sensing system that is able to
withstand the pressures and heat of space travel and meet NASA
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted David Burton, managing director of the group,
as saying the contract for the prototypes is worth more than
500,000 US dollars, but failed to say when and where the contract
was signed and the number of the system involved.
</P>
<P>
The company has joined with a consortium, including aerospace
giant Lockheed Martin, which is building the human research
facility for the multi-billion-dollar space station project.
</P>
<P>
The controller, which is about the size of a video cassette,
will provide the capability to collect, format and store data.
</P>
<P>
"A range of physiological sensors monitor neurological,
cardiac, muscular, sleep, gastro and other functions. They are
recorded over periods as short as an hour or up to eight hours.
Data is then transmitted back for analysis."

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua to Step Up War Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua is to launch a national
program to fight drug trafficking next month and the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) is setting up an office in the
country to back the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's vast Atlantic coastline has become a popular
transit route for drug trafficking, Interior Minister Jose Antonio
Alvarado said today when he announced the program.
</P>
<P>
The country is being used as a corridor, he said. Small
amounts of drugs are being left on the path and Nicaraguans are
using them and getting addicted.
</P>
<P>
The new program will give additional support to the national
police to fight drug use and trafficking and promote the
rehabilitation of addicts.
</P>
<P>
A "say no to drugs" education campaign for children and young
people will run in parallel with the main program.
</P>
<P>
An average of 16 tons of cocaine crosses Nicaragua's
territorial waters on the Atlantic coast every month, according to
a recent report by the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 22 kilos of the drug have been seized by
police in Nicaragua's autonomous northern Atlantic region. But
the police say thousands of kilograms slip through the net because
they don't have enough resources.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. DEA will start operating next month to provide
logistic and technical back up which is increasingly important in
the war against drugs, Alvarado said.
</P>
<P>
The DEA will invest about 100,000 U.S. dollars on information
gathering technology and put four ships and speedboats into
operation along Nicaragua's Atlantic Ocean coastline.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called for urgent reform of the judicial
system. He said the police reported that none of the 156 people
arrested on the Atlantic coast this year for drug possession had
been sentenced, they were all free.

<HEADLINE> Hopeful Revival Dawns on China's State-Owned Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- China's torpid state-owned sector
is expected to slightly revive this year, as the country's economy
enters a new round of economic growth and thus give the
loss-ridden state-owned enterprises an active domestic market,
said a number of optimistic economists and officials here.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from State Statistics Bureau show that in
the first quarter of this year, the added value generated by
state-owned enterprises went up by 5.1 percent over the same
period of 1996. This increase margin climbed to 5.8 percent, with
the industrial added value of state-owned sector hitting 83.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Such a slight but hopeful rebound has kindled optimistic ideas
in the country's economic circle. The presidents of some
large-sized state-owned companies, including the Baoshan Steel and
Iron Group Company, Chunlan Air-Conditioner Company, and Little
Swan, the washing machine maker in Wuxi City, announced that their
production gained momentum, since the central government decided
to focus on 1,000 large-scale enterprises and provide the small
ones with more freedom in capital management.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned sector of Shanghai, the leading industrial
powerhouse of China, began to make profits in the first quarter
of this year after a three-year-long stagnation. The profits of
Shanghai's state-owned enterprises stood at 394 million yuan,
raising the number of profitable state-owned economies of province
level to seven, including Shandong, Liaoning, and Henan.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of State Statistics Bureau, said
that the first hopeful trace of revival emerged in the state-owned
sector in late 1996, when the proportion of loss-making
enterprises dropped from the year's highest of 45.6 percent to 37
percent and 32 percent in last November and December, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said that the state-owned sector will achieve a slight but
stable growth throughout this year, because a packet of
preferential policies will take effect, and the rapid growth in
national economy guaranteed by a healthy domestic market.
</P>
<P>
However, a legendary "overnight revival" is still doubted by
many Chinese economists.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Haihang, research fellow of Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that lasting development of state-owned enterprises
should be based on establishing a modern enterprises system, which
is now far from replacing the old ones in China.
</P>
<P>
But, a senior expert on China's enterprise system reform
suggested that the loss of state-owned enterprises could be
alleviated this year, as long as the national economy maintains a
stable growth in wake of the successful soft landing in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The central government has readjusted its enterprise policies
by focusing on large state-owned enterprises instead of the
whole sector, and recognizing the stock holding system as an
effective means of enterprise overhaul. Both changes in the
country's decision-making will help make greater enterprise
reforms this year.

<HEADLINE> Bank Offers Four Billion Yuan in Mortgage Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) will grant four billion yuan (about 480 million US
dollars) in mortgage loans to Chinese house buyers this year,
Today's China Daily quoted an ICBC spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
ICBC, one of the four largest commercial banks of China, will
not only provide mortgage loans directly to individuals, but also
receive "wholesale customers", the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The "Wholesale customers" refers to employers who act as
guarantors for their employees and handle the repayment of loans
for them, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank will promise customers with flexible and
convenient services, to secure a solid position in the booming
businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
Housing has long been believed as a hot item for Chinese
consumers, as China is trying commercialize its housing system. It
is also an easy outlet for Chinese banks to generate interests for
its money, by providing such financial aids to potential house
buyers.
</P>
<P>
The bank official said that the bank will serve people whose
employers have opened public housing reserve accounts in ICBC,
contributed by both employees and their employers as a low-cost
financial source for house-buyers.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
has adopted rules for the mortgage businesses.
</P>
<P>
The China Construction Bank (CCB) immediately responded with a
four-billion-yuan mortgage provision plan this year.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (93-94) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (93-94) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Who will handle foreign government applications for
opening consulates in Hong Kong? Who will approve such
applications? And what are the stipulations of the Basic Law in
this regard?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to the Basic Law, establishment of foreign
consulates and other official or semi-official missions in the
Hong Kong SAR must have prior approval from China's central
government.
</P>
<P>
There are at present 96 foreign consulates in Hong Kong. After
1997, the following three policies will apply to foreign missions
in Hong Kong:
</P>
<P>
-- all consulates and other official missions established in
Hong Kong by states having formal diplomatic relations with China
may remain;
</P>
<P>
-- consulates and other official missions set up in Hong Kong
by states having no formal diplomatic relations with China will be
permitted either to remain or change into semi-official missions;
</P>
<P>
-- and states not recognized by China can establish only
non-governmental organizations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Question: What provisions govern the Hong Kong SAR for joining
international organizations and participating in international
meetings?
</P>
<P>
Answer: As an open international economic city, Hong Kong has
extensive ties with countries and regions throughout the
world. Its existing international status will further consolidate
and develop after 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law contains detailed stipulations with regard to
Hong Kong's participation in international organizations and
international meetings: representatives of the government of the
Hong Kong SAR may, as members of delegations of China, participate
in international organizations or conferences in appropriate
fields that are limited to states and that affect Hong Kong, or
may attend in some other capacity permitted by the central
government and international organizations or
conferences. Representatives of the Hong Kong SAR should express
their views using the name "Hong Kong, China."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR may, using the mane "Hong Kong, China,"
participate in international organizations and conferences that
are not limited to states.
</P>
<P>
The central government will take necessary steps to ensure that
Hong Kong SAR continue to retain its status in appropriate
capacities in international organizations in which Hong Kong is a
participant in one capacity or another and of which China is a
member.
</P>
<P>
The central government will, where necessary, facilitate the
continued participation of the Hong Kong SAR in appropriate
capacities in international organizations in which Hong Kong is a
participant in one capacity or another and of which China is not a
member.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Adopts New Name for Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on Monday
that it will banish the name of Zaire and adopt the new name of
Democratic Republic of Congo, used by the new leader in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"We will no longer be calling this country Zaire... That
country has vanished, and obviously, a new country -- a new
government -- is now being established under different people,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters at a
briefing. "We will refer to this country as the Democratic
Republic of Congo."
</P>
<P>
Burns said U.S. ambassador in Kinshasa, Daniel Simpson, moved
quickly on Monday to established links with the new leadership,
meeting with two senior advisers of the government now being set
up in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The two advisers to Laurent Kabila, who has led alliance forces
to oust former President Mobutu Sese Seko within seven months,
agreed to establish "ongoing contacts" between the U.S. embassy in
Kinshasa and the new leadership of the central African country,
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The United States expects Kabila, who now proclaimed president
of the new Democratic Republic of Congo, to arrive in the capital
of Kinshasa and establish a government within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned that
the new government of the central African country could only
acquire U.S. support on the condition of the criteria set up by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeatedly called for elections to be
held in this central African country, but Kabila has yet to make
any response for that commitment as the Untied States wished.
</P>
<P>
The United States also expressed displeasure at the way
Kabila's forces have treated Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Fails to Overrule British Parliament Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, failed today to overturn a ruling of the
parliament to bar them from using offices there unless they swear
allegiance to Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
During their visit to the parliament, Sinn Fein party leader
Gerry Adams and chief negotiator Martin McGuinness, who won seats
in Britain's May 1 election, failed to remove a ruling that
prohibits them from using the facilities of parliament without a
British oath of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
Adam and McGuinness, who have tried to end British rule of
Northern Ireland, refuse to swear allegiance to the Queen because
they do not recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But Commons speaker Betty Boothroyd last week ruled that the
two Sinn Fein leaders could not use parliamentary offices or
facilities unless they joined other MPs in swearing allegiance to
the queen before taking their seats.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with House of Commons authorities, Adams
told reporters he did not achieve its purpose but still opposed
the ban which he called unilateral and arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
"I am a political leader with a political mandate. I live in
Ireland. I want to see an end to the British occupation of my
country... We will continue with that until we succeed. We will be
coming back here," he said.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair offered last week to ease a
ban on official contact with Sinn Fein without precondition of a
ceasefire from the IRA, in a positive sign of finding a political
settlement to the Northern Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness said today in London that Sinn Fein would take up
within two weeks Blair's initiative on the Northern Ireland
settlement.

<HEADLINE> Washington D.C. Reinforces Police on Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Police Department of the
nation's capital is reducing staff at its administrative offices
to put 500 more officers on the streets as the Summer tourist
season begins.
</P>
<P>
An additional 1,300 officers will be redeployed to local
stations over the next several months, police officials said
Monday. Some of them will come from downtown headquarters to local
stations.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of an overhaul launched in February after a
report found that crime had risen dramatically, officers were
demoralized and residents were fearful. Police Chief Larry D.
Soulsby redeployed 400 officers onto streets and imposed a
zero-tolerance policy that got tough on even the most minor
offenses.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Monday, Soulsby said he was taking the
plan even further. "We are refocusing our people, putting them in
the field," he said.
</P>
<P>
Half the officers doing desk work in the city's seven police
districts will be reassigned to the streets, Soulsby said.
One-fourth of officers working in headquarters will be moved to
local districts.

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts to Protect Oriental Pyramid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese experts will
co-operate to conserve the "Oriental Pyramid" -- the imperial
mausoleum of the Western Xia Dynasty (1038-1227).
</P>
<P>
Early this month, a Japanese team made a close inspection at
the site which is located some 40 km to the west of this capital
city of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 50 sq km, the mausoleum contains nine tombs
for emperors and more than 200 tombs of nobles.
</P>
<P>
The most unique structure found at the mausoleum is a
nine-storey-high, octagonal tower which resembles the Egyptian
pyramid and has been called "Oriental Pyramid".
</P>
<P>
The Western Xia Dynasty, co-existing with Song (960-1279) and
Liao (916-1125), was set up by a nomadic tribe "Dangxiang".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces to Extend MFN to China (updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced on Monday to renew China's Most Favored Nation (MFN)
trade status for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided, as all my predecessors have since 1980, to
extend Most Favored Nation status to China for the coming year,"
the president told business leaders at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's the best way to integrate China further into
the family of nations and to secure our interests and our ideals,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the MFN status to China was only the normal trade
treatment "that virtually every other country on Earth receives
from the United States."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also confirmed the
president's decision in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
She said: "Our long-term interests are best served by a
strategic dialogue with the Chinese leaders on a full range of
issues."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that suspension of the normal trade
relations between the United States and China could do harm to the
United States more than to China.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to revoke their normal trading status, it would
close one of the world's most rapidly growing emerging markets,
one that already supports 170,000 American jobs and doubtless will
support more in the years ahead," Clinton told the business
leaders who strongly advocated the extension of the MFN status to
China.
</P>
<P>
Albright held the same view and she said the United States
would risk isolation by ending the MFN status to China.
</P>
<P>
"A further objection to ending normal trading relations is that
it would do more to isolate the United States than China. We could
expect virtually no support from our friends and allies in Europe
and Asia, all of whom support our policy of seeking China's
integration into regional and global institutions," she said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of State warned those who object to extend the
MFN status to China that China will certainly a rising force in
Asian and world affairs", whether or not the United States revoke
the MFN trade states, which is enjoyed by all but very few
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hoped the business leaders at the White House gathering
would express their views on the normal trade relations with China
to Senators and House Representatives.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Unveils U.S. New Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen today unveiled a new U.S. defense plan, proposing military
personnel cut, base closings to save more money to build a more
modernized force for next century.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of global war has receded...but there are dangers
that remain, and some are changing and growing," Cohens told a
news conference at the Pentagon today.
</P>
<P>
The plan, or the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), proposes
the U.S. keep the ability to fight two regional wars almost
simultaneously despite the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"The QDR calls for a defense strategy that balances continued
American engagement today with a focused modernization effort to
meet tomorrow's challenges," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is the most important strategic move by the
U.S. after the end of the Cold War, describes the military
capability and forces the U.S. needs to carry out its strategy
throughout 1997-2015.
</P>
<P>
Cohen summed up the U.S. defense strategy as "shape, respond
and prepare."
</P>
<P>
"Whether we're talking about 1997 or the year 2010, shape,
responding and preparing is going to be part of that overall
strategy," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2003, the total active duty end strength will be
reduced to 1,360,000 with 835,00 in the Reserve forces,
respectively down 36 percent and 29 percent from 1989. Civilian
personnel will decline to 640,000, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The Army will retain 10 active, combat-ready divisions while
the navy will retain 12 carriers battle groups and 12 amphibious
ready groups, but will reduce the number of surface combatants in
the fleet from 128 to 116, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan also recommends two round domestic base closures and
establishing a panel on reforming the Pentagon while keeping its
100,000 troops in Asia and 100,000 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Our combat forces are headed towards the 21 century, but our
infrastructure is stuck in the past. We must shed more weight,"
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
To modernize the force, the Pentagon established a goal of
increasing procurement funding to roughly 60 billion U.S.
dollars by the fiscal year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Cohen admitted that the plan will not easily get the approval
of Congress, calling for a bipartisan commitment to stable
defense spending and increased modernization.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Ends Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Expectations of higher U.S.
interest rates helped the U.S. dollar stop its continuous slippery
and overcome a selloff from Japan's increased trade surplus
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The improvement came a day before the Federal Reserve's policy
makers decide on rates changes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Traders bought dollars on the assumption that an increase of 25
basis points, or a quarter percentage point, was possible. The Fed
last raised that rate on March 25 by 25 basis points to 5.50
percent.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled in New York at 115.68 yen, up from 115.55
yen Friday, the first time since May 2 that the dollar hasn't
ended lower against the yen. The dollar cost 1.7083 marks, up from
1.6925.
</P>
<P>
The pound cost 1.6393 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6367 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar initially dropped after Japan's Finance Ministry
reported the Japanese trade surplus in April rose 163.7 percent
from a year earlier to 831.48 billion yen.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday:
1.4270 Swiss francs, up from 1.4208; 5.7565 French francs, up from
5.6995; 1,675.00 Italian lire, up from 1,669.25; 1.3715 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.3735.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Treasury Takes New Measure to Crack Down on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury announced new
measures today to stem illicit drug profits flowing to Colombia
and other trafficking centers, requiring new forms from people
wiring as little as 750 U.S. dollars abroad.
</P>
<P>
Anyone wiring that amount or more through transmitters such as
thousands of independent storefront operations would be required
to supply the government with driver's license or passport or face
stiff penalties. Currently, reports must be filed only for
transactions of 10,000 dollars or more.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said they are a strike at the
"Achilles heel" of organized crime -- the need to convert illegal
and unusable proceeds into usable funds.
</P>
<P>
"While the drug kingpins and other bosses of organized crime
may be able to separate themselves from street-level criminal
activity, they cannot separate themselves from the profits of that
activity," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
The proposal builds on a special emergency order in effect
since August for wire transfers from the New York City area to
drug lords in Colombia, which Rubin said once amounted to as much
as 800 million dollars and now have "virtually dried up."
</P>
<P>
It would expand the order to all the United States and to wire
transfers to all other countries, not just Colombia. But it would
not apply to regular banks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Department will make the final decision after
receiving public comments on the proposal for 90 days.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Kill 2, Wound 7 in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Two unidentified gunmen today
killed two passengers and wounded seven others in a passenger bus
in southeastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the gunmen strafed the passengers in the
bus going from Diyarbakir, center of southeastern Turkey, to Hani
town with automatic weapons at 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT),
killing one passenger on the spot. Another passenger died in the
Diyarbakir State Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Those passengers wounded in the bus were rushed to the hospital
for treatment, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security forces started a large scale operation in
southeastern Turkey in a bid to capture the attackers, who
escaped soon after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Rebels of the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) launched
shocking attacks in the region as a Turkish contingent of 25,000
to 50,000 has crossed the border into northern Iraq, trying to
wipe out the PKK militants based there.
</P>
<P>
The PKK guerrillas fired a dozen of rockets on the government
buildings in the town of Derik in nearby Mardin province early
today, without causing casualties, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the PKK militants blocked the
southeastern Mardin-Sirnak main road for several hours Sunday
night, when they checked IDs and burned two oil tanker trucks.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan announced in Bursa,
western Turkey, earlier today that until this morning, the Turkish
government troops had killed 1,142 PKK rebels in the continuing
Turkish military operation, which was launched Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the PKK rebels also ambushed village
guards in Kahrama Maraj in eastern Turkey, killing one and
wounding several others.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war which has
claimed more than 23,000 lives in eastern and southeastern
Turkey since August 1984.

Addressing Zimbabwe's parliament, Mandela assured that Kabila
is a capable statesman.
</P>
<P>
"As one who has been involved in the negotiating process, I
want to assure you that President Kabila is handling the
situation of transition excellently," Mandela told Zimbabwe's
150-member house.
</P>
<P>
The South African president, who started a three-day state
visit to Zimbabwe today, had lately brokered peace talks between
Kabila and former Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, who fled
the country before Kabila's forces took over the capital Kinshasa
at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said, "we have striven to the best of our ability to
make a contribution in finding a truly African solution to the
problems in Zaire and the Great Lakes region. It is given that
complex problems spanning decades will not lend themselves to
easy solutions."
</P>
<P>
"But the time has come for Africa to take full responsibility
for its woes, use the immense collective wisdom it possesses to
make a reality of the ideal of the African renaissance whose time
has come," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Such a renaissance, he said, must mean that Africa refuses to
be a passive onlooker in the changing world, hapless victim to
modern machinations of the forces historically responsible for
their woes.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Zimbabwe is his country's largest trading
partner on the continent, although the trade is weighed heavily
in favor of South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Niger Deny Violating UN Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Niger today denied
knowingly violating United Nations sanctions against Libya by
allowing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to fly to their
territories from May 8 to 10.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council's committee investigating
the flights, Nigeria's permanent mission to the UN said that the
country was under the impression that Gaddafi and his entourage
would travel to Nigeria by road from a third country.
</P>
<P>
The mission also said that the visit was for a religious
purpose, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, issues of common concern were put under
discussion, "such as terrorism and the need for peaceful
resolution of international conflicts and disagreements," the
mission said.
</P>
<P>
In a similar letter, Niger's permanent mission said that the
information available to its government indicated that the
aircraft would originate from "a country that was a neighbor of
Libya".
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking a Security Council condemnation
of the flights, which it said violated an air embargo imposed on
Libya by the UN in 1992 over the bombing of Pan Am flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 and the bombing of a French Uta
airliner over Niger a year later.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that although Libya has warned the council
against getting involved in "the religious issues", the sanctions
committee is expected to continue discussing the issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Addis Ababa regional
administration today ordered "illegal businessmen" who failed to
pay rent to "move out their property and hand over the shops".
</P>
<P>
In a statement quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency, the Addis
Ababa administration said illegal businessmen in the capital,
whose shops were sealed up for failure to abide by the decision
it passed earlier, should move out their property and hand over
the shops by tomorrow 4:00 pm to government bodies with whom they
have signed rent contracts.
</P>
<P>
The administration ordered executive bodies to take legal
measures against those businessmen who fail to hand over the
business outlets within the deadline.
</P>
<P>
It is recalled that the Addis Ababa regional administration
announced last year the increase of the rent of government-owned
shops. But the decision was rejected by many businessmen who held
demonstrations here after the announcement of the decision.

<HEADLINE> UK to Take Tough Measures to Tackle Drought Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The British government has promised
to take tough measures to tackle the worsening drought crisis,
including stringent mandatory leakage targets as part of its
action plan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's so-called "crisis conference" on water
supply, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said: "I have asked
(industry regulator Ofwat) to start immediately by setting
demanding targets for next year as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"It's (water) not being used efficiently and effectively and
what we've got to do is bring in the proper regulatory form and to
be quite tough with the industry," Prescott said.
</P>
<P>
Prescott noted that Ofwat chief Ian Byatt had assured the
government that his powers, including preventing price increases
and seeking authority to appoint an administrator in extreme
circumstances, were enough to penalize companies which failed to
meet targets.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals in the 10-point action plan include a review of
the charging system and the process by which river water is
diverted to supplies.
</P>
<P>
The government will also give water companies a statutory duty
to conserve water in carrying out their functions and ensure they
promote efficient use of water by customers.
</P>
<P>
Britain is facing its worst drought for 200 years with rainfall
well below average in most of the country, but it was reported
around 800 million gallons (3.6 billion litres) of water leaks out
of the pipeline system every day.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Provide Telecom Service in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Ministry of
Communications is seeking ways of funding the provision of
telecommunications services in the rural communities.
</P>
<P>
The services will be provided by using the village
satellitization scheme among other appropriate technologies,
Communications Minister Tajudeen Olarenwaju said, according to
today's reports by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Satellite communication has played a significant role in the
co-ordination of relief operations during periods of disaster,
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In an address over the weekend in Abuja, capital of Nigeria to
mark the 29th World Telecommunications Day, the minister said
efforts in this regard would be stepped up through the
development and application of radio communication, telephones
and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has deregulated the country's
telecommunications sector by introducing private participation in
the provision of telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the minister, the provision of services
following the deregulation will go a long way in saving the lives
and easing the suffering of people in distress.

<HEADLINE> Cook Visits U.S. for Stronger Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook today said that Britain's new commitment to
playing a leading role in Europe should help strengthen the
British-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who is paying his first one-day visit to the U.S., made
the remarks at a press conference after meeting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
"A Britain that is a leading player in Europe will be a more
useful and a more valued ally of the United States than a Britain,
which, under the previous government, was drifting into a
marginalized offshore island," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party, which won Britain's election on May 1,
promised to play a more prominent role in an increasingly
integrated European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Though the talks between Cook and the U.S. officials are
harmonious, Cook's statement over Bosnia shows London's
differences with Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has repeatedly insisted that the international
peacekeeping force should pull out of Bosnia by a July 1998
deadline. But Cook doubted it.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnia peace agreement signed in 1995 in Dayton, the U.S.,
could not be judged a success without fulfilling one of its key
provisions, the integration of the Bosnia, Serb and Croat ethnic
nationalities, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "At the present time we have to be quite frank and
recognize that we have not made the progress towards that (that)
we would wish."
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed that we must redouble our efforts" to achieve
the integration envisaged in Dayton, he said. "Without that, I
must say quite frankly, it may be difficult for us to contemplate
a military withdrawal by the middle of next year."
</P>
<P>
Cook also reiterated the policy of "together in, and together
out", saying that if the United States pulled its forces out,
Britain and its European partners would definitely withdraw as
well.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and European countries will gather at the end of this
year to discuss the situation in Bosnia and decide whether the
peacekeepers can withdraw or not.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun's supreme court has less
than 20 days to give definite results of the just ended May 17
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
As the votes counting continues, the Cameroun Radio and
Television reports today that confirmed sources say the ruling
party, Cameroun People's Democratic Movement (CPDM), has so far
taken more than half of the 180 seats in the national assembly,
closely followed by the Social Democratic Front (SDF).
</P>
<P>
The National Union of Democracy and Progress (UNDP) has put up a
poor show in this year's elections, getting only 10 seats as compared to
its performance in March 1992 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago when the first legislative elections were held in
Cameroun, the ruling DPDM won 88 out of the 180 seats, the UNDP had 68,
the Union for the People of Cameroun (UPC) had 18, while the Movement
for Democracy and Republic (MDR) had six. The main opposition party
SDF boycotted the 1992 legislative elections. enditem

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Expected to Make Big Shift in Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The McDonald's Corporation, the
largest fast-food company in the United States, is expected to
make sweeping changes in the top management structure of its
United States in what is called an attempt to jump-start its
profitability.
</P>
<P>
According to some of Mcdonald's 2,000 American franchise
operators who spoke with Mcdonald's vice chairman, Jack M.
Greenberg, the possible changes will involve the most significant
shake-up of the company's top-heavy U.S. management.
</P>
<P>
The company's 5,000 headquarters and regional employees are
assured of no dismissals, layoffs or whole sale relocation.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's has come under pressure recently as analysts and
franchisees have questioned the profitability of Campaign 55,
Mcdonald's new 200 million U.S. dollars national price-cutting
promotion that offers a 55-cent Big Mac when bought with soda and
fries. There are 12,094 Mcdonald's restaurants across the country.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Currency Introduced into E. Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 19 (Xinhua) - The introduction of Croatian currency
into Eastern Slavonia region began on Monday, with residents there
able to convert Yugoslav dinar, the money they currently hold,
into kuna.
</P>
<P>
About 50 exchange offices set up by the Croatian government
were opened this morning and during the next three days, all
Eastern Slavonian residents with Croatian documents will be able
to exchange for up to 2,000 kunas.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate is one dinar for one kuna.
</P>
<P>
Starting tomorrow, the Croatian money will be the official
means of payment in the region, with wages, prices, and other
financial transactions to be expressed and paid in kuna.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, a swath of land on the Croatian bank of the
Danue river, was seized in 1991 by Croatian Serbs who opposed
Croatia's independence from the then-Yugoslavia. Under an
agreement signed in late 1995, the region, which is now under UN
administration, will return to Croatia by the middle of July this
year.

NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rose modestly
today in quiet trading before Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting on
inflation and interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 34.21 points to
7,228.88.
</P>
<P>
Traders were cautious, with few investors making big bets in
advance of Tuesday's Federal Reserve strategy meeting.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 4-to-3
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling
345.13 million shares as against 485.78 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 3.52 points to
833.27, and the NYSE composite index rose 1.70 to 434.14.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.50 to 1,341.23, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.76 to 587.48.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, stocks pulled back sharply, slicing nearly 140
points off the Dow, as some surprisingly strong economic readings
forced investors to reconsider their recent optimism that the Fed
won't boost the central bank's lending rates to ease inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
In late March, Fed policy makers raised a key short-term
lending rate to slow the consumer spending.
