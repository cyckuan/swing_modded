<HEADLINE> British Telecoms Firms Call Off Merger Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications (BT) and
Cable and Wireless (CW), Britain's two largest telecoms companies,
called off merger talks unexpectedly late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which could have resulted in the world's third
largest telecoms operator valued at some 34 billion pounds (51
billion U.S. dollars), foundered on price and a mismatch between
risks and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The deal faced a barrage of regulatory, political and business
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
BT said Thursday night described the risks at this stage as
"outweighing" the prospective opportunities. Meanwhile, CW said
"the concept of a merged global business had commercial and
industrial merit" but "numerous problems" could not be solved in a
"reasonable timescale."
</P>
<P>
The companies have been talking to little effect for five
months.
</P>
<P>
Rod Olsen, CW's acting chief executive, said the failure of the
talks would affect the company's plans for stability, growth and
development.
</P>
<P>
Both companies face the immediate prospect of a collapse in
their share prices.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Spending, Personal Income Up in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The increases of U.S. consumer
spending and personal income both slowed down in March, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that consumer spending in the month rose
0.6 percent, just half of the February pace. The spending totaled
a seasonally adjusted 5.1 trillion dollar annual rate, up from
5.07 trillion in February. The 1.2 percent jump in February was
revised up from the 1.1 percent initial estimate.
</P>
<P>
The department also reported that personal incomes rose 0.5
percent in March to a 6.33 trillion dollar annual rate, slower
than the 0.8 percent advance a month earlier when incomes totaled
a 6.30 trillion rate.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending -- two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity -- was credited with helping spur economic growth at a
2.8 percent annual rate during the first three months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department reported Thursday that personal
consumption expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the first
quarter, far ahead of the modest 1.2 percent rate in the fourth
quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods rose at an 8.8 billion dollar rate
in March, considerably less than the 27.4 billion dollars in
February.
</P>
<P>
Outlays for nondurable goods such as clothing and chemicals
increased at a 4.1 billion rate after jumping 16.9 billion a month
earlier. Spending on services rose at a 19.6 billion rate compared
to 17.2 billion in February.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose 0.4 percent on
top of a 0.7 percent gain in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
saving rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- was
4.5 percent, down slightly from 4.7 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The income and spending figures were not adjusted for inflation.
When adjusted, disposable income edged up just 0.1 percent after
rising 0.5 percent in February. Spending rose 0.4 percent, down
from 1.1 percent in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Critical of Delay of Hebron Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials today
sharply criticized the Israeli government for failing to make a
decision on immediate withdrawal from the West Bank city of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Executive Committee, expressed his regret at
Israel's decision today to put off its redeployment from Hebron,
saying that the decision is not helpful to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that there must be withdrawal due to the agreement
and the timing we are talking about and have already agreed upon,"
Husseini told reporters when he was having a meeting with visiting
Qatari Minister of Justice Najeeb Mohammed al-Naeemi in the
Orient House in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I believe any kind of delay is not a good sign and
not helpful."
</P>
<P>
Hassan Asfour, member of the Palestinian Council and senior
negotiator, said that the postponement will not serve the
interests of the peace process, charging Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres for bowing to the rightwing extremists.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, Palestinian mayor Mustafa Natshe also strongly
criticized the delay. "We are disappointed from the decision,
which indicated Mr. Peres despises the peace process in general,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Peres had postponed the redeployment in Hebron
again and again, making people in the city frustrated. "Nothing
has improved since (the signing of) Oslo 2 accord, even Oslo 1
accord. The situation of the paralyzed economy in all daily life
in the city is continuing," he said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed a suggestion that the delay was decided on out of
the consideration of security in the city, saying when the
Palestinian National Authority comes to the city the security
situation will be much better.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Reporting Guide In Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Environmental journalists in
southern Africa are to produce a media guide to help strengthen
reporting on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The undertaking was made by 17 journalists from Southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries who completed a
week-long reporting workshop in Kariba of north Zimbabwe today.
</P>
<P>
The guide will give reporters indicators on environmental
terms, international and regional conventions and agreements on
resource utilization and environmental management.
</P>
<P>
The journalists expressed hope that the guide would make it
easy for environmental reporters to identify and report
accurately and informatively on resource utilization and
management in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The guide, which should be out by August, was also expected to
help inspire journalists to link reports on other aspects of life
with the environment.
</P>
<P>
It would be produced by organizers of the workshop, the World
Conservation Union (IUCN), SADC environment and land management
sector and Africa Information Afrique (AIA).

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb PM Urges Political Solution to Brcko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Rajko
Kasagic today called for a political settlement to the disputed
city of Brcko ahead of an international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dayton peace accords reached last November,
the status of Brcko should be decided through international
arbitration within a year. Both Muslims and Serbs made a claim to
Brcko, a city in a narrow corridor in northern Bosnia which
connects the eastern and western parts of the Serb entity.
</P>
<P>
"The arbitration will formally sit while, ahead of its sitting,
we should engage many friendly countries to help us towards a just
solution of the Brcko question," said Kasagic in his statement to
the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
"If the Muslims could get an eight to 15 kilometer wide
corridor for Gorazde, why should the passage for the Serbs be cut
and the question of Brcko resolved differently," Kasagic said.
</P>
<P>
Gorazde is a Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia which gets a wide
corridor linking the capital city of Sarajevo under the Dayton
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The Serb official recalled that the narrowest stretch of the
Serb territory at Brcko is six to eight kilometers wide and since
the peace accords had many interpretations, the border between the
Serb entity and the Muslim-Croat federation was disputable.
</P>
<P>
"After all I am confident that the controversial Brcko issue
should anyhow be specified at some higher level and only then
should arbitration start," the Serb prime minister said.

JERUSAlEM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from more than 50
countries who are here attending the European regional conference
of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are, among
other things on their agenda, preparing for the first World Food
Summit.
</P>
<P>
Israel is hosting the conference for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 heads of state are expected to attend the planned
five-day summit, which is to open in Rome on November 17.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming summit's secretary-general, Kay Killingsworth, was
quoted by the local press today as saying that by the year 2030,
there will be 3 billion more people on earth, most of them in the
developing nations, and without concerted global action the number
which is undernourished will not substantially diminish.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is a landmark event. For the first time, the heads
of government will make a concerted effort to eradicate hunger and
ensure universal food security," she said. "The responsibilities
of the individual nations and international bodies will be
defined. We have to put the food issue back at the top of the
international political agenda."
</P>
<P>
According to an FAO report released at the conference, nearly
800 million people in the world are chronically undernourished and
some 200 million children under the age of five are in jeopardy
because of chronic protein or calorie deficiencies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li Peng have expressed deep concern over the plight of the
earthquake victims in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
They have also been paying close attention to the progress of
the ongoing relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale struck the

<HEADLINE> WHO Reports Further Decline of Polio Cases Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The world has moved a step closer to
the target of eradicating poliomyelitis by the year 2000 as last
year's reported polio cases worldwide fell to just above 6,000, a
28 percent decline from the 8,600 cases reported in 1994, the
World Health Organization (WHO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 figures also represented an 82 percent decline of
reported polio cases from the 31,000 cases registered in 1988 when
the eradication target of the year 2000 was set by the World
Health Assembly, the supreme decision-making body of the
Geneva-based WHO.
</P>
<P>
According to data received by WHO as of April 15, a total of
150 countries reported zero cases of polio in 1995. Twenty seven
countries reported from one to 10 cases and 30 countries reported
more than 10 cases. Seven countries failed to report.
</P>
<P>
The American region, covering the whole of the Western
hemisphere, is the only polio-free geographic region where the
last polio case was reported in August 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, because epidemiological surveillance is incomplete in
many polio endemic countries, WHO estimated that approximatedly
80,000 cases of paralytic polio occurred in 1995 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Polio is an infectious viral disease that attacks the central
nervous system, causing permanent paralysis of the muscles and
frequently death.
</P>
<P>
In order to eradicate the disease, the naturally occurring wild
polio virus must be destroyed. Because man is the only host of the
virus which can survive in the environment for about two to three
months, mass immunization is the only tool for breaking the virus
transmission, the WHO said.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the year 2000 target of eradication, the
WHO, along with some other international agencies, have made
consistent efforts to help countries to maintain the highest
possible immunization coverage.
</P>
<P>
One of their campaigns is to promote the so-called National
Immunization Days (NIDs) during which host countries deliver Oral
Polio Vaccine (OPV) to all children under five years of age.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO estimates, the global immunization coverage
for 1995 was about 83 percent. Coverage in Africa is significantly
below that of other regions, but rose above 50 percent for the
first time in 1994. Last year it climbed to 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1995 the number of countries which conducted at least
one NID rose to 62. Of these, 25 countries had their first NID in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 300 million children, representing 47 percent of
the world's children under five years of age, received OPV during
National Immunization Days. The first half of December 1995 saw
195 million children immunized during NIDs in China, India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that by the end of this year, all
polio-endemic countries in Europe and Asia and half the countries
in Africa will have conducted at least one NID.

<HEADLINE> US To Pay UN Its 1995 Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBNURG, May 2 (Xinhua)-- The United States would pay its
regular annual assessment for 1995 to the United Nations to
alleviate the UN's cash-flow crisis, Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State Melinda Kimble said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Ninth Session of UN Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) held in midrand north of Johannesburg, Kimble
said: ''This hard-won budget agreement is only a first step and in
no way lessens the need for reform of the world body.''
</P>
<P>
Kimble said the US would not be able to sustain political and
financial support for the UN if it was not genuinely reformed, she
said.
</P>
<P>
''Without reform the UN cannot fulfil its mission of promoting
a democratic, peaceful and prosperous world community.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today called on the United Nations to play a more effective
role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
discussed current developments in the Middle East, including the
forthcoming Israeli-Palestinian "final status" talks and the
situation in Lebanon at a working luncheon today.
</P>
<P>
When he sat down to meet the secretary general, Arafat said,
"We are looking from his excellency to continue to push the peace
process in all the tracks."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, he said that he came here to
express thanks to Boutros-Ghali for the position of the United

<P>
The United Nations has been active in helping Palestinian
refugees and adopted resolutions critical of Israel's occupation

together, Arafat replied they were neighbors. "Now there will be
two states. A Palestinian state beside its neighbors, the
Israelis."

<HEADLINE> China Expected to Ease Loan Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China will relax its tight control
on bank loans somewhat in the coming eight months, with 953
billion yuan in bank loans to be released this year, economists
here forecast today.
</P>
<P>
They told a seminar on the forecast and analysis of China's
economy, which was held at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
(CASS), that the recent canceling of inflation-beating subsidy
rates and the lowering of bank interest rates might have signaled
the start of the relaxation of the control over bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The country's banks issued a total of 797.1 billion yuan in
loans last year.
</P>
<P>
China's increase in bank and rural credit co-operatives'
deposits has surpassed that of bank loans over the past two years,
they noted.
</P>
<P>
A research report by the CASS and the State Planning Commission
also shows that the country has a great potential to be tapped in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The country had witnessed an annual increase rate of 12 percent
in gross domestic product over the past five years, with the total
fixed assets investment exceeding six trillion yuan. This
investment has eased the "bottlenecks" in China's economy, a CASS
economist said.

<HEADLINE> US Post Service Issues Olympic Stamps Despite Organizers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Post Service unveiled
its 1996 Olympic stamps Thursday to commemorate the summer Atlanta
Olympic Games, despite the disagreement from the Games' organizers.
</P>
<P>
The 20 stamps designed by Richard Waldrep of Sparks, Maryland,
capture athletes at the height of performance in 20 Olympic
events. Subjects of the stamps are from Men's Cycling, Women's
Diving to Men's Hurdles.
</P>
<P>
However, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG)
boycotted the ceremony as it said on Thursday it was ready to sue
the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) unless it stopped a line of
T-shirts and other souvenirs bearing images of Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
ACOG said it was consulting its lawyers over the post office's
plans to license "Olympic wannabe products" ahead of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"The USPS has declined to provide post offices at key Olympic
venues in Atlanta...(but) while declining to provide these needed
services, the USPS has decided to go into the souvenir business,
selling Olympic wannabe merchandise -- T-shirts, pins and plates,"
ACOG said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Since Atlanta in 1990 won the right to stage the Olympic Games,
ACOG has been extra vigilant in protecting Olympic material.
</P>
<P>
The post office has licensed a company to produce T-shirts and
other products bearing the image of a set of commemorative stamps.
</P>
<P>
The stamps were approved by ACOG and bear the official Olympic
rings, a symbol which can cost sponsor companies up to $40 million
to use in advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The T-shirts and other memorabilia display the stamps without
the rings, but Olympic organizers say the post office "would have
consumers believe the T-shirts have a direct, legitimate
connection to the Olympic Games and the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
But the Post Service said it had licensed an outside company to
make T-shirts bearing the image of the Olympic stamps and denied
any attempt to mislead the public.

Baltic Sea States.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia To Issue Big Denomination Bank Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua)-- The long awaited big denomination bank
notes of 10,000 Kwacha, 5,000 Kwacha and 1,000 Kwacha (1,200 Kwacha
equals one U.S.Dollar) will be in circulation soon, Bank of Zambia
Governor Jacob Mwanza announced today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing here, Mwanza said the initial
consignment of the notes would be introduced on the market within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mwanza said higher denominations of money would reduce the
public's risks of carrying big bundles of money which can easily be
identified by thieves.
</P>
<P>
It would also save time when effecting transactions at banks, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He advised the public to closely examine the features of the new
bank notes, which would be displayed on posters, to avoid being
cheated with forged notes.
</P>
<P>
As lower denominations of money went back to the Central Bank,
higher denomination notes would merely be replacing them in
circulation and there would be no increase in money supply, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
At present, the biggest denomination note is 500 Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The total cost in both printing and freight fees of the higher
denomination notes amounted to 857,600 British pounds.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Economy Grows in First Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's economy saw a good growth
rate in this year's first four months, official report here said
today.
</P>
<P>
in agriculture, 2.5 million ha of winter-spring rice were
transplanted, which accounts for 104 per cent of the same crop
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
By mid-April, farmers in southern provinces had harvested
nearly 1.2 million ha out of the total 1.3 million ha of rice,
while those in northern provinces were concentrating on caring for
rice.
</P>
<P>
Subsidiary crop acreage increased by 11.6 per cent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output in the period was up by 10.8 per cent
compared with that of last year, with central industrial output
increasing by 12.5 per cent, and locally-run industrial output up
by nine per cent.
</P>
<P>
Products with good growth rate included electricity (more than
5.1 billion kwh, up by 14.8 per cent), coal (more than 2.5 million
tonnes, up by 24.2 per cent), rolled steel (125,000 tonnes, 12.6
per cent), fertilizer (330,000 tonnes, 16.6 per cent) and paper
(70,000 tonnes, 20.7 per cent) .
</P>
<P>
However, some products decreased in their output compared with
that of last year, including crude oil with only 2.59 million
tonnes, down by 5.9 per cent, due to the influence of strong winds
and damaged vessels in April, and cement, down by 1 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The price index for commodities and services in the past four
months increased by 4.3 per cent since December.
</P>
<P>
The country's total export value was 1.44 billion US dollars in
the first four months this year, representing 22.2 per cent of the
yearly plan. Meanwhile imports were valued at 2.86 billion
dollars.

first quarter of 1996.
</P>

The United Arab Emirates, one of the Gulf Arab countries, has
one of the highest number of cars in the world relative to its
population.
</P>
<P>
Police figures for 1994 showed only Abu Dhabi had more than
150,000 vehicles for a population of around 800,000 -- one car for

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ships More Heavy Oil to DPRK Under Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has shipped
another 44,000 tons of heavy oil to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) as part of a 1994 nuclear accord, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The oil arrived at the ports of Son Bong and Cheng Jin in
dispatches on April 22 and 29, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between the DPRK and the U.S.-led
Korean Peninsular Energy Development Organization (KEDO) in New
York in October 1994, Washington agreed to provide two light-water
reactors and heavy oil as fuel energy to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In return, the DPRK promised to phase out its graphite reactors
capable of producing materials that can be used to make nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is to ship an annual 500,000 tons of heavy oil to the
DPRK until the first light-water reactor is finished and begins to
generate power.
</P>
<P>
So far the United States has provided 320,000 tons of heavy oil
to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, other reports said American technicians, under
the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, have
removed some 8,000 waste nuclear fuel rods from nuclear facilities
in Nyong Byon to the north of Pyongyang. The action is also a part
of the New York agreement.

<P>
VISBY, Sweden, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Countries bordering the Baltic
Sea started a two-day summit in Sweden today on a wide range of
issues from the environment to democracy and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The heads of government of 11 member countries of the Council
of the Baltic Sea States will also discuss the findings of the
recent Baltic Sea Business Summit.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini, whose country holds the
rotating European Union (EU) presidency, and Jacques Santer,
president of the European Commission, are also attending the
Summit on the island of Gotland off the south east coast of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The Council of the Baltic Sea States, established in
Copenhagen, Denmark in 1992, groups Sweden, Finland, Russia,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, Denmark, Norway and
Iceland. The Council has close cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, en route to the summit, said today he did not
believe the three Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania
would join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) but ruled
out any military action against them if they did.
</P>
<P>
"We are categorically against the expansion of NATO
(eastwards)," Chernomyrdin said, adding that he had raised what
he called mistreatment of Russians in Estonia and Latvia during
talks with Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson.
</P>
<P>
Both Estonia and Latvia have large Russian minorities who were
mostly denied automatic citizenship of the newly-independent
countries in 1991.

ULAN BATOR, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's foreign trade volume
rose 15 percent to 191 million U.S. dollars in the first quarter
of 1996 against the same period last year, the State Statistics
Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly caused by a 61 percent rise in imports
from 58 million dollars to 91 million dollars, while exports
increased by just one percent to 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned the government that if exports remain
stagnant, foreign reserves will fall and could lead to a trade
deficit.

Russia remained Mongolia's main trading partner, followed by
Japan, Switzerland, China and Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plane Spied on French Military Facilities: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The French Defense Ministry has
dismissed allegations that a U.S. spy plane flew over several
sensitive military installations in France in March.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. U-2 spy plane flew over and photographed a nuclear
warhead assembly plant, a tank testing ground and an airbase, a
front page report in the French newspaper Liberation said today,
quoting "reliable military sources".
</P>
<P>
French military officers were angered by the U.S. action,
saying Americans should not believe that they can do whatever they
want in France.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. plane took off from the Fairham
military base in Britain and flew over the nuclear center in
Valduc, where France produces its nuclear warheads, an air base in
Dijon and a tank testing ground Roanive.
</P>
<P>
French air force radars followed the plane for several hours,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
But both the French Defense Ministry and the U.S. Embassy in
Paris have denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Liberation claims U.S. intelligence agencies became interested
in the French sites after they found two British Hercules cargo
planes flew to Dijon on March 16, picked up cargo and flew back to
Britain, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Americans suspected that the cargo might be nuclear
equipment for Trident missiles needed by Britain, which the United
States had refused to supply.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been keeping a close eye on intensified
Franco-British nuclear weapons cooperation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. air force was quoted in the article as saying the
plane's pilots were just burning fuel before landing, but the
French air force was not satisfied with this excuse.
</P>
<P>
France pulled out of NATO's integrated military structure in
1966. But in 1994, France for the first time allowed five U.S. air
refueling planes to be deployed in its Istres air base in southern
France. At the start of this year it permitted three U.S. U-2 spy
planes to be deployed in the base to supervise situations in
Bosnia and Liberia.

CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A Russian official asserted here today
that his country is keen to play a more effective role in the
Middle East peace process, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Vidinov, director of the Middle East and North Africa
affairs in the Russian Foreign Ministry, said upon his arrival

During his stay here, Vidinov said, he will participate in the
final stage talks between the Palestinians and Israel which are
scheduled to start Sunday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba
as Russia is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moscow would continue to exert efforts to make the peace
process successful, the Russian official said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important for Israel to lift the closure on the
Palestinian self-ruled areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Russia attributes great importance to the expansion of
cooperation and consultation with Egypt as it is a fundamental
power in the peace process, Vidinov said.

<HEADLINE> Limits on Anti-Personnel Landmines Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 3 (xinhua) -- Fifty-five countries today approved
unanimously a protocol further limiting the use and transfer of
anti-personnel landmines, which includes a total ban on
non-detectable mines and requirement for mines' self-destruction
and self-deactivation.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five parties to the Convention on Conventional Weapons
(CCW), which attended the session here on strengthening limits on
landmines, the second of its kind this year, also agreed in this
revised protocol of the CCW to extend its coverage to include
internal military conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the April 26-May 3 landmine session is viewed as
a significant step forward in global humanitarian efforts to save
civilian lives, as well as towards the goal of eventual
elimination of all mines.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 500 people in developing countries
are killed or maimed each week by mines. At present, 110 million
landmines remain to be located and cleared in 64 countries.
</P>
<P>
The revised protocol bans the use and transfer of
non-detectable anti-personnel mines, and demands as of January
1997, all mines should contain a certain amount of metal enabling
them to be detected.
</P>
<P>
Unless laid in clearly marked areas guarded by military
personnel, it states, all mines should be constructed to
self-destruct within 30 days after emplacement, and meanwhile to
self-deactivate within 120 days so that combined, under one per
thousand mines will still be able to explode 120 days after being
planted.
</P>
<P>
A deferral period of nine years from the protocol's entry into
force -- coming six months after the 20th country notifies its
accession -- is allowed for countries to render existing
stockpiles of mines detectable, self-destructing, and
self-deactivating.
</P>
<P>
Signatories are committed not to transfer any mine, the use of
which is restricted by the protocol, to non-state recipient
unauthorized for receiving, nor to state which does not apply the
protocol.
</P>
<P>
Stricter use of booby trap weapons is also spelt out in the
protocol, the draft text of which was formally put forward
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Economy Strong, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Saudi Arabia has
kept a strong increasing momentum in the last couple of years, a
report reaching here from the Saudi city of Jeddah said today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an economic report, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA)
reported from the city that the gross national product (GDP) in
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia increased from 111 billion Saudi
riyals (29.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1992 to 435 billion riyals
(116 billion dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the average income of the Saudi citizen,
according to the statistics of the World Bank, has amounted to
about 7,500 riyals, or 2,000 dollars. But according to some other
statistics, the per capita income of the country has amounted to
10,000 riyals, or 2,666 dollars. The report did not give the
figures for 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the value of the Saudi exports amounted to about 47.5
billion riyals (12.6 billion dollars). In the same year, imports
dropped to about 35.7 billion riyals (9.5 billion dollars),
leading to a surplus in the commercial balance of about 3.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it was reported that the kingdom does not face the
problem of unemployment and, unlike most of the countries of the
world, its inflation was kept low as the average annual rate has
been staying at around 1.9 percent.

</P>
<P>
MIDRAND, South Africa, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to
strengthen its functions as a major component of global
multi-lateral trade system.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of Chinese Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, made the call at the ministerial
round-table meeting on "the future function and institution of
UNCTAD" held in Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Long said as an inter-governmental organization on trade
and development with universality, UNCTAD should enhance its
mandate as an advocate of developing countries in globalizing and
liberalizing world economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the completion of the Uruguay-round negotiations and the
establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) had provided
new mechanism and impetus for cementing and improving the global
multi-lateral trade system.
</P>
<P>
Commenting UNCTAD's future functions and institutions, Long
said special attention should be paid to the relationship between
WTO and UNCTAD. The two groups should form a new relationship in
multi-lateral trade system through effective cooperation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Long emphasized that UNCTAD would have to become a part of the
global multi-lateral trade system, otherwise, it would remain an
"on-looker" of the multi-lateral trade system.

<HEADLINE> NATO: Some 10 States Submit Discussion Paper on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 10 countries of Central and
Eastern Europe have apparently submitted to NATO their "discussion
paper" which constitutes the basis of individual dialogue between
countries applying for NATO membership and NATO authorities.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the 16 NATO countries proposed, while
meeting in December 1995, devoting the year 1996 to intensified
dialogue with the countries concerned on the basis of a "paper" in
which the latter would indicate their position concerning
accession and raise questions on problems to be clarified.
</P>
<P>
According to NATO sources, one can therefore say that dialogue
began in April, as scheduled last December.
</P>
<P>
The sources said NATO is examing these documents and will then
hold an exchange of views with the representatives of the
countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that, on the basis of this individual dialogue,
the ministerial meeting in December 1996 of the North Atlantic
Council may adopt a clear line concerning pursuit of the process
and start to tackle the questions of "who" and "when."
</P>
<P>
The general feeling is that NATO could send invitations as of
1997 to the countries likely to be in the first group of the new
members, possibly Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Slovakia.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- TRW Inc. announced here today that
it has joined hands with China in manufacturing auto engine
valves, switches, control systems and other electrical and
electronic products.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Joseph T. Gorman, chairman and
chief executive officer of TRW Inc., the world's fourth largest
independent producer of automotive components.
</P>
<P>
Two joint ventures, one with Jinan Auto Accessories Works, and
the other with Suzhou Auto Electric Factory -- which increase
TRW's presence in a market where vehicle production is expected to
grow from 1.4 million in 1995 to 2.6 million by the year 2000 --
have been approved by the Chinese government, according to the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the joint ventures, there are 12 initiatives
under way, Gorman revealed in a news briefing that took place in
Regis hotel here today.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that his company had close contacts with Chinese
airspace authorities in the 1980s. This relationship should
continue to grow, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's economy is developing vigorously and
rapidly, and China is bound to become a big economic power. So, he
said, TRW Inc. wants to increase its presence in a market with a
1.2 billion population.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the strained relations between the governments of
the United States and China have produced any impact on TRW's
business in China, Gorman replied that so far such ties have not
had any adverse impact on his company.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "I would hope that our government and the Chinese
government can find the way to settle their differences, as it is
important both geopolitically and economically."
</P>
<P>
"I, in fact, regularly build my influence in Washington to
bring about a compromise," he added.
</P>
<P>
Based in Cleveland, Ohio, TRW provides advanced technology
products and services for the automotive and space and defense
markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua)-- The South African government today
suspended the use of anti-personnel landmines by the
South African National Defence Force (SANDF).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, foreign affairs official Abdul
Minty said the decision was made at the conclusion of the first
review conference on the 1980 convention on certain conventional
weapons in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Minty said the SANDF was in the process of re-evaluating the
future military utility of anti-personnel landmines and would soon
report to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
As part of its support for the global elimination of
anti-personnel landmines, the south african government had been
reviewing steps to address the ''massive landmine problem which
besets our region, the African continent and other parts of the
world'', the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had adopted the September 1995 export moratorium on
landmines, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
This had also been extended to a prohibition on the export of
so-called long-lived anti-personnel landmines and their phasing out,
and a prohibition on the export of all types of landmines.
</P>
<P>
Minty said the government would support efforts to achieve an
international prohibition on the production, stockpiling, transfer
and use of anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
''The number of casulties caused by the indiscriminate use of
landmines, especially anti-personnel landmines, is particularly
depressing,'' he added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Liberian Warlords To Hold Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Liberian warlords are expected o
hold peace talks in Ghana next week, according to a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
It said a United States military helicopter had flew Krahn
faction leader General Roosevelt Johnson out of Liberia's capital
Monrovia today to enable them to take part in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
John has been at the center of fighting that erupted in
the city on April 6, when the ruling council of state ordered
his arrest on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
''He left this afternoon with four of his political and
military advisors,'' Edward Farley, his spokesman, told
reportors today.
</P>
<P>
Official sources in Ghana said a Ghanian plane would fly to
the Sierra Leone capital Freetown to collect Johnson, whom
the ruling council sacked in March as rural development
minister.
</P>
<P>
The report said gunmen loyal to Charles Taylor and Alhaji
Kromah, both Vice-Chairmen of the ruling council which was
established in August in accordance with the peace accord signed
in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, have been fighting johnson's
supporters since the failed attempt to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who launched the civil war in 1989 from Cote d'Ivoire,
vowed to storm the Krahn stronghold in the Barclay Training
Center barracks in central Monrovia. His immediate whereabout
were not known but he has said he will attend the peace talks in
Accra, capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The Krahn have agreed to respect a ceasefire in the city,
following the collapse of an April ceasefire accord which ended
two weeks of clashes and looting in Monrovia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
''We think that there should be a ceasefire while the meeting
is going on in the city,'' said taloy's apokesman.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Ghanian government said a delegate
from the Liberian Peace Council, another Krahn faction which
backed Johnson after the April 6 showdown, is also expected to
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said George Boley, leader of the counil who was already
in Accra.
</P>
<P>
Boley is a member of liberia's six-men transitional
ruling council along with Taylor and Kromah. The other three
members including Council Chairman Wilton Sankawulo, are
all civilians.

<HEADLINE> ANC To Go Ahead With Planned Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, My 3 (Xinhua)-- The deadline for the adoption of
South Africa's new constitution would remain unchanged, even if
there was no consensus, African National Congress (ANC) Chief
Negotiator Mohammed Dalli Moosa said today.
</P>
<P>
Moosa confirmed that the ANC and the National Party (NP)
remained deadlocked on the education, lock-out and property
clauses in the bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
However, he could not say when the Constitutional Assembly's
Constitutional Committee (CC) would meet again because the
negotiations between the ANC and the NP on outstanding issues
continued behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the schedule, South Africa's new constitution has
to be finalised on friday so it can be tabled in the 490-member
constitutional assembly on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Friday's CC meeting was postponed to allow further negotiation
between the ANC and NP on the three deadlocked clauses in the
bill of rights, said Moosa.
</P>
<P>
He said the CC had not reconvened since its adjournment on
Tuesday because there were ''indications that the possibility
exists for agreement''.
</P>
<P>
The object of doing this would be to secure a two-thirds
majority in favour of the constitution. The ideal would be to
have consensus on the constitution.
</P>
<P>
''My own assessment is there is every possibility to reach
agreement,'' said Moosa, adding the bill would have to be
finalised even if no agreement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's new constitution is scheduled to be adopted on
may 8, one day ahead of the may 9 deadline set by the interim
constitution two years ago. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa discussed here today refugee problems with officials of the
World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
He praised the WFP for securing adequate food for Rwandan and
Burundin refugees who are now in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He told WFP Executive Director Ms. Catherine Bertini that if
there was no enough food supplies for the refugees the refugee
camps and nearby villages would be plunged into havoc.
</P>
<P>
The WFP official, who arrived here on Thursday for a two-day
visit, briefed the president about her fact-finding mission in
the refugees camps in Kagera region.
</P>
<P>
She praised the Tanzanian government for facilitating smooth
passage of food to the refugees camps.
</P>
<P>
She also agreed with Mkapa's suggestion that the international
community including U.N. agencies should work together with the
countries of the great lakes to help the refugees return home
especially those from Rwanda because the situation of the country
now is relative stable.

<HEADLINE> Fake US Bills Seized in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A large amount of bogus U.S. bills
have been confiscated by Greek police in a raid in Athens, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some 26,500 fake 100 U.S. dollar bills, as well as other
currencies were found in a residence in southern Athens Thursday
after a tip-off from German authorities. The "funny money" was
destined for circulation both in Greece and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Police said that 51-year-old German national Hassels Frobin
delivered the shipment of counterfeit money to Ioakim Kalymnios,
50, a permanent resident of Germany, who in turn hid the bills in
his sister's home in Athens. the suspect's sister denied knowing
of the existence of the stash in the residence.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated the quality of the bogus bills confiscated as
excellent, saying high-tech technology was used in reproduction
and the "off-set" method for printing.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are continuing by police in cooperation with
Interpol and other law enforcement agencies in countries where
some of the counterfeit notes may have already been circulated.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Britons Out of Job Due to Beef Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Six weeks of the mad cow disease
crisis have led to more than 10,000 lay-offs and redundancies
among a range of ancillary trades, in addition to the financial
disaster for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Now the beef crisis has entered its seventh seek, its impact
was continuing to spread far and wide, affecting may industries
beyond the farming of cattle, said a report in the Daily Telegraph
newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
This week's failure by the European Union to fix a timetable
for lifting its worldwide ban on Britain's beef exports has served
only to make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
A backlog of more than 100,000 cattle has built up on arms,
causing a big headache to the slaughtering and rendering
industries.
</P>
<P>
And lorry drivers, who transport cattle, food processing
plants, feed suppliers, farm machinery manufacturers and those who
supply everything from sophisticated veterinary medicines to grass
seed are all reeling from the impact of the beef crisis as they
see the livestock industry's cash flow drying up.
</P>
<P>
With more uncertainty over new plans to cull selected cattle,
there is still no end in sight to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock is now political rather than scientific and there
were growing fears in the meat industry that it will take many
months to break.
</P>
<P>
Nobody is sure when the EU's ban will be lifted. Some people
predicted that the ban would still be in place in the autumn, but
beef exporters claimed that the embargo could last a year or more.

<HEADLINE> Kwazulu/Natal Violence Organised, Says Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua)-- The ongoing violence in South
Africa's most strife-torn Kwazulu/Natal province was organised
and not merely the result of fighting between individual members
of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African National
Congress (ANC), Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an ANC briefing in Durban, Mbeki said
investigations into the violence should be intelligence-driven to
establish who was fomenting it.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said investigations showed that those involved in
fuelling violence included ANC and IFP members, as well as
security force elements, the rightwing and criminals who stood to
gain from instability.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that intelligence-driven investigations could,
among other things, help establish who was responsible for the
weapons influx into South Africa as well as who was behind the
planning of massacres.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the May 29 local government elections in
Kwazulu/Natal, Mbeki said if the poll were not seen to be free
and fair, it would bring into question the legitimacy of
structures elected in areas where free political activity was not
possible.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in durban, IFP Secretary-General Ziba
Jiyane said the delay of the planned elections would fan
political tension in the province, ravaged by political violence.
</P>
<P>
Jiyane called on Mandela to end uncertainty about whether or
not the local poll would go ahead on May 29, saying the IFP was
''deeply concerned at the continuing presidential delay'' over
the decision of the poll date.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that President Nelson Mandela had called for an
extraordinary cabinet meeting next monday to discuss the
proposals made by the presidential elections task team on the
feasibility of going ahead with the poll.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party election task team, handed a report to the
president on tuesday, was appointed by Mandela on April 19 to
investigate whether or not it was possible to go ahead with the
elections on May 29 as scheduled. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (xinhua) -- The U.N. Commission on
Sustainable Development concluded its fourth session today,
calling for continued use of fish stock in the future.
</P>
<P>
Rumen Gechev, chairman of the commission, said at a press
conference that although intergovernmental organizations have
formed an agreement on conservation of straddling and highly
migratory fish stock, member countries are still concerned about
continuing over exploitation of the fish stock.
</P>
<P>
He said that correct action is urgently needed to rebuild
depleted fish stock and ensure their continued use in the future.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over-fishing by high-tech, commercial
"factory" ships has put the world's oceans on the brink of
ecological catastrophe, and the world's human population on the
brink of a global food crisis.
</P>
<P>
An astounding 70 percent of the all commercial ocean fish stock
species are now listed as either "threatened," "endangered" or
"over-fished."

<HEADLINE> Pak to Set Record in Wheat Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will set a new record in
wheat production by harvesting over 18 million tons of wheat this
year, said Federal Minister for Food and Agriculture Yousuf Talpur
here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local press, the minister said as harvesting of new
wheat begins throughout the country, the government expects a big
headway towards self-sufficiency in wheat.
</P>
<P>
He said that there would be at least seven percent increase of
wheat production this year compared with 17.1 million tons of
wheat produced last year.
</P>
<P>
The achievement in the field of agriculture was made possible
because of an attractive agriculture policy, in addition to timely
rain, the minister claimed.
</P>
<P>
"We are concentrating on efficient and fair distribution of
irrigation water and timely availability of agriculture inputs,
particularly fertilizer, certified seeds and provision of
unadulterated pesticide."
</P>
<P>
The government, Talpur said, has reasonably increased the
support price of agriculture crops so that farmers could get due
returns for their hard work.
</P>
<P>
The real achievement in wheat production is the increase of per
acre yield, which jumped from 18 mound per acre to 22 mound per
acre last year.
</P>
<P>
Now the Food Minister expects the per acre yield to be at least
23 mound.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the target, Talpur said, "we are looking for
27 mound of wheat per acre," which will be achieved within the
next two to three years with efficient and fair use of irrigated
water.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the country can get rid of wheat import, the minister
said if government organizations purchase seven million out of 18
million tons of wheat, this could be possible next year.
</P>
<P>
After having sufficient stock of wheat, the country could
easily meet the needs of the people, said Talpur.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, private parties purchase wheat on higher price,
more than what is officially offered, and smuggle it abroad for
personal gains, the minister pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Suburban Beijing Residents Use More Methane, Solar Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Dwellers in the suburbs of this
capital of China are able to save three million tons of coal each
year by tapping sources of methane and solar energy, the "Beijing
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the traditional energy structure in the rural
areas of Beijing is undergoing changes, and the emission of waste
gases and disposal of waste materials have been markedly reduced.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 73,000 rural households have
built methane-generating pits, and the methane produced from them
gives off energy equal to the burning of 12,000 tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
The local farmers use human and animal waste directly as
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, large methane-generating pits have been
constructed in factories to deal with waste materials, and the
methane in turn is used for heating and cooking.

<HEADLINE> Baltic Sea States Wrap up Summit on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VISBY, SWEDEN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Government leaders of the 11
Baltic Sea nations concluded their first ever summit here today
with a declaration calling for stability, prosperity and
solidarity in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, member countries of the Council of the
Baltic Sea States (CBSS) agreed on a range of initiatives to bring
about cooperation and integration in the region.
</P>
<P>
The countries are facing a unique opportunity to make the
Baltic Sea region prosperous, stable and safe, it said.
</P>
<P>
Government leaders called on business and industry to help
bring about an economic boom in the region and urged international
financial institutions to step up participation in funding
infrastructure and economic development.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to reinforce cooperation between police, border,
customs, immigration and coast guard authorities to ensure
citizens' security and combat organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to intensify cooperation on energy
supply, nuclear safety, nuclear waste disposal and the
environment. The Baltic Sea is one of the most polluted in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The summit also added its support for Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland's membership of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
A wide range of issues from the environment to democracy and
international cooperation were covered during the two-day summit
held on the island of Gotland off the southeast coast of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The CBSS, set up in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1992, groups Sweden,
Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany,
Denmark, Norway and Iceland. It has close relations with the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The summit here will be followed by a meeting of CBSS
diplomatic heads in Sweden, on July 2-3, to study the
implementation of Saturday's agreements.

<HEADLINE> Iodine Deficiency Again a National Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iodine deficiency among children has
again become a hot issue in China as National Iodine Day
approaches this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that 425
million Chinese people are living in iodine-deficient areas,
accounting for 42.5 percent of such people in the world.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the 10 million mentally-retarded people in
China are victims of iodine deficiency, which can affect the
development of the brain of a fetus and hinder children's physical
and mental growth.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng signed the World Declaration on
Children's Survival, Protection and Development in March 1991,
promising that China would eliminate iodine deficiency by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Already a lot of work has been done on the prevention of
iodine deficiency, with the number of endemic goiter patients
shrinking from 35 million to seven million and cretinism
caused by iodine deficiency brought under control.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese scientists say that iodine deficiency still remains
a big threat.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the average iodine content in the urine of
Shanghai residents is about 0.09 mg per liter, the highest in the
country. But this is 0.11 mg less than the WHO's world standard
for iodine content in urine.
</P>
<P>
Scientists suggest that immediate action be taken throughout
the country to protect children from iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
China's scientific institutes and medical enterprises are now
trying hard to develop new ways to supply iodine besides the
traditional methods of iodized salt and edible oil, and a group of
high-quality iodine products have already been put into
production.

The Washington Post:

<HEADLINE> China's Star Runners Fail to Qualify for Olympic 800-meter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nanjing, May 4 (Xinhua/OANA) -- China's world record holder Qu
Yunxia and world junior record setter Wang Yuan failed to qualify
for the women's 800-meter final here on Sunday in the opening day
of the Chinese national Olympic track and field trial.
</P>
<P>
Qu and Wang's chances of making the Olympic team now depend
on the 1,500 meters race on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Wang Junxia, who set the women's 3,000 meters and 10,000
meter world record in 1993, strolled into the 5,000-meter final
easily in today's heat.
</P>
<P>
Qu, world 1,500-meter record setter and world champion in
1993, made her first appearence after the 1994 Asian Games, but
failed to live up to her reputation when the ace-runner of the
"Ma Family Army" finished a distance sixth in the second heat in
two minutes and 7.75 seconds. The time was about 10 seconds out
of her best mark. Wang Yuan, who set world junior records both
in 800-meter and 1,500-meter three years ago in Beijing, also
lost her edge in another heat gruop, finishing sixth in 2:06.67.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Chinese's best time is 1:57.18, almost 10
seconds faster than today's result. "We are not satisfied with
their results. I am surprised by their poor performance," said
Guo Fengjin, one of Ma's army's coaches.
</P>
<P>
"But Qu and Wang still have chances to qualify if they run
good enough in the 1,500 meters," added Gu.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren, who has been lying at a hospital in Beijing for 50
days due to illness, intended to come to Nanjing for the trial,
but doctors refused his request. It is said that Ma has to stay
in hospital for another two months.
</P>
<P>
The fastest 800m runner today was Yan Wei, who clocked
2:05.46. The 50th best mark last year in the world was 2:01.93.
</P>
<P>
In the 5,000 meters heat, Wang Junxia, who broke away
from coach Ma three years ago, easily rolled into the final with
a clocking of 16:03.14.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, world junior 5,000-meter record holder who ranked
fourth in the world last year, also qualified in 15:59.31, behind
Wei Li, the fastest runner in the heats in 15:58.20.
</P>
<P>
Wang Junxia and Jiang Bo, China's Olympic hopefuls, will have
a showdown in the final tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
In the day's two finals, Zhang Yu finished first in the
women's 100-meter hurdles in 13.05 seconds while Bi Zhong won the
men's hammer with a loss of 69.36 meters.
</P>
<P>
The competition, which will last five days, drew 707 athletes
and about 150 journalists.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Afghan government jets bombed
positions of the Taliban religious student militia in the south of
Kabul in a series of air strikes today, said reports from the
Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
Three fighter jets dropped at least five bombs on the Taliban
positions, Defense Ministry spokesman Amrullah was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
No information on casualties and damages caused by the air
strike is available so far.
</P>
<P>
The jet attack was in response to Taliban maneuvers, according
to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban have brought extra troops up to the front lines
and are threatening Kabul," Amrullah said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters retaliated this afternoon, firing several
rockets that hit a residential district in southern Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was hurt in the attack, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a four-party opposition alliance held a meeting in
Peshawar, Pakistan, Friday, and agreed to hold direct talks with
President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Taliban leaders, however, have refused to participate in talks
with either the alliance members or Rabbani's representatives.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has vowed to topple Rabbani's government in Kabul
and install strict Islamic rule throughout Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Opposition Threaten to Boycott New Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's two main opposition
parties today threatened to boycott the new parliament if the
ruling New Korea Party (NKP) continues to woo independent
lawmakers into the party to secure a majority.
</P>
<P>
The two parties issued the warning at the start of a joint
political offensive against President Kim Young-sam's government,
following a meeting between Kim Dae-jung, leader of the National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP), and Kim Jong-pil, leader of the
conservative United Liberal Democrats (ULD).
</P>
<P>
The NCNP is the largest opposition party in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition leaders, who were meeting formally for the
first time in seven years, branded as "undemocratic" the move by
Kim Young-sam's NKP party to woo independents into its fold.
</P>
<P>
In last month's general election, the NKP lost its overall
majority and, with only 139 out of the 299 seats in the National
Assembly, is 11 short of a simple majority. The NCNP, the ULD and
the minor Democratic Party (DP) trail with 79, 50 and 15 seats
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 16 seats are held by independents and the NKP has
been trying to win over the independents to form its majority in
the new Assembly due to open next month. Six independents have
already joined the ruling party, giving the NKP 145 seats, but
it's still five short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition leaders condemned the April 11 parliamentary
elections as "totally rigged by money and the government," and
called for impartial and thorough investigations of campaign
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
They accused the state investigation into election violations
of targetting their probe only at opposition members. The state
prosecution is believed to be investigating more than 100
newly-elected members of parliament on suspicion of breaking
election rules.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil said the ULD and the NCNP will cooperate in their
dealings with the government and will stick to the decisions made
at their meeting.
</P>
<P>
But the two Kims also said they will cooperate with the
government if it wants a dialogue because they do not want to
create "political unrest."

<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 600 primary school students
spent an unforgettable day with Hong Kong's leading soccer
professionals when they attended the "Coca-Cola" Schools Soccer
Star Parade 1996 at the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) here
today.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the HKSI, the Hong Kong Football Association
(HKFA), the Hong Kong Schools Sports Council (HKSSC) and the Swire
"Coca-Cola" HK ltd., the Parade featured players of newly-crowned
Football Association Cup champions South China demonstrating their
skills in front of the kids.
</P>
<P>
They first enjoyed an exhibition match between South China and
the HKSI Scholarship side. Students were thrilled at the skills
displayed by such South China stars as team skipper Lee Kin-wo,
Leslie Santos, Yau Kin-wai and Au Wai-lun.
</P>
<P>
The kids were then divided into 20 groups for a two-hour soccer
clinic hosted by South China players.
</P>
<P>
"The Parade provided an excellent opportunity for students to
learn technique from those leading professionals and to develop
their potential in the sport. Although this is only a beginning
for many of them, it is encouraging to see their enthusiasm and
eagerness to learn about the sport. I believe that some of them
will no doubt be our stars of tomorrow," said Kwok Ka-ming, head
soccer coach of the HKSI.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the clinic, an outstanding young player was
selected from each of the 20 groups and a soccer ball was awarded
to them by the organizers.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official today
called on the young people in Hong Kong to unite for promoting
Hong Kong's smooth transition and maintaining its prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
At an evening party to mark the 77th anniversary of the May 4th
 Movement, Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Resume Oil-for-Food Talks with UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi delegation headed by Abdul
Amir al Anbari will arrive in New York in two days to hold the
fourth round of talks with U.N. on an oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Anbari said today in a statement to the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) that Iraq had participated in the previous three rounds of
talks in a serious and sincere manner and both sides could have
reached an agreement on April 10.
</P>
<P>
But the talks had ended in failure because of the intervention
of U.S. and Britain, he said.
</P>
<P>
On his way to New York, Anbari paid a visit to France and
Russia, where he briefed the leaders of the two countries on what
has been achieved so far in the Iraq-U.N. talks. He was seeking
support for the forthcoming talks from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted a U.N. source as saying that France, Russia and
other U.N. Security Council members will coordinate their stance
in a bid to make the fourth round of Iraq-U.N. talks successful
and prevent possible intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis, who have suffered from U.N. sanctions for more than
five years, are anxious for a positive outcome of the
Iraqi-U.N. talks, which will allow a partial sale of Iraqi oil in
exchange for food, medicine and other humanitarian needs.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no indication that the two sides will
reach an agreement in the fourth round of talks due to the
unsettled problems between them, of which the most
thorny one is the distribution of food and medicine for the Kurds
in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Quake Relief Work in Full Swing in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Relief work has gone into full swing
in Baotou City, in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
where an earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale
struck at 11:32 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local official sources said people in the quake-stricken area
have recovered from the shock, society is in good order and most
enterprises are operating normally.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the relief headquarters of the city show
that by 8:00 a.m. today the quake had caused 15 deaths, 33
serious injuries and 208 light injuries.
</P>
<P>
All the major hospitals in the city have been mobilized for the
relief work, sources at the headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Information from the seismology bureau of the city says that up to
8:00 a.m. today 390 aftershocks had been recorded.
</P>
<P>
The quake has cut off supplies of electricity and water to the
Baotou Steel and Iron Company, the most important industrial
establishment in the city. As a result, the whole plant was
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
However, by 5:00 p.m. today the company had partly resumed its
production, according to Deputy Manager Xu Wancheng.
</P>
<P>
Xu expected that by Sunday morning the production of the
company would be completely recovered.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the quake the city government set up a relief
headquarters and dispatched 10 working groups to investigate the
situation and organize the relief work.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingzu, secretary of the autonomous region's committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, and Ulgi, chairman of the regional
government, rushed to Baotou City from the the Hulunbir and Xilin
Gol leagues, where they had been organizing the fight against the
forest fire that had spread there from the Republic of Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese seismic experts have excluded the possibility of a
stronger quake in the area, but said that strong aftershocks
measuring four to five on the Richter scale are possible.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Redoubles Efforts On Development of Solar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel, poor in coal and oil
deposits, has paid great attention to tapping the country's rich
solar energies and the efforts have been paid off.
</P>
<P>
Israel is no longer content with the popularization of the use
of thermal water devices in households. Now the goal is aimed at
industrial applications.
</P>
<P>
The Weizmann Institute of Science has played a leading
role. It's solar research complex, known as the Canadian
Institute for the Energies and Applied Research, is one of the
world's most advanced facilities for designing methods to exploit
concentrated solar energy. Several technologies developed at the
complex are now ready to be scaled up for industrial
applications.
</P>
<P>
Technology transfer is already being implemented
within the framework of Consolar Ltd., a consortium of Israeli
companies and academic institutions created for this purpose
together with Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium entitled "From Basic Research to Industry" held
at the Weizmann Institute recently, scientists, industrialists
and government officials heard reports from experts on their
achievements and explored a long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
The process of harnessing concentrated solar energy begins with
a receiver -- a device that collects concentrated sunlight in
order to heat a gas which can then drive a turbine to generate
electricity or be converted into energy-rich chemical
fuel. However, the efficiency of systems based on standard solar
receivers has been low because these receivers are unable to
operate at the high temperature and pressure required by modern
power generation equipment.
</P>
<P>
A dramatic increase in efficiency has now been attained with a
new receiver developed by Weizmann Institute's Dr. Jacob Karni,
Dr. Abraham Kribus and Rahamim Rubin, in cooperation with a team
headed by Dan Sagie of Rotem Industries Ltd. Sunlight enters the
device -- referred to as the Directly-Irradiated Annular
Pressurized Receiver (DIAPR) -- through a special cone-shaped
window made of quartz that can withstand five times more pressure
than steal.
</P>
<P>
The rays are absorbed by hundreds of ceramic pins
which line the receiver's inner walls, pointing toward the
incoming light.
</P>
<P>
This light-absorbing matrix -- nicknamed "Kippod," the Hebrew
word for porcupine -- is designed in a sophisticated manner to
absorb maximum sunlight while preventing cracks resulting from
expansion and contraction caused by extreme changes in
temperature.
</P>
<P>
Gas, which fills the entire device, flows across the
pins and removes the heat at around 10 times the rate achieved
in existing receivers. The unique elements of the new receiver's
design, which now make it possible to reach extremely high
temperature and pressure, open the way to major industrial
applications.

<P>
Most turbines used today to produce electricity run on
steam. In order to improve efficiency, electrical companies have
recently started replacing steam with gas.
</P>
<P>
However, state-of-the-art gas turbines require high-pressure air at
temperatures exceeding 1,000 degrees centigrade. Heating air to
such temperatures with solar energy -- rather by burning fossil
fuels -- demands a ten-thousand-fold increase in the
concentration of sunlight reaching the earth.
</P>
<P>
Weizmann Institute researchers have developed optical "funnels"
with a unique geometrical structure. These funnels collect the
sunlight and concentrate it to levels approaching the feasible
maximum. With the transition to industrial development, experts
have also begun to test the optical devices involved at all
stages of solar collection and concentration systems with the
goal of increasing the overall efficiency of such systems.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, a major obstacle to the exploitation of solar
energy on the industrial scale has been the need to store and
transport it over long distances. Israeli researchers have
accomplished these goals by converting the sun's radiation into
energy-rich chemicals in a closed-loop, environmentally-friendly
system.
</P>
<P>
Known as the chemical heat pipe, the system has three
stages:
</P>
<P>
-- Sunlight collected in desert areas is concentrated
and used to drive chemical processes that run only at high
temperatures;
</P>
<P>
-- The gases formed during this processing are
cooled and then stored or transported to areas where the energy
is needed;
</P>
<P>
-- Once these gases reach their destination, the
chemical processes are reversed, releasing heat that can be used
to produce steam for industry or to power electricity-generating
turbines.
</P>
<P>
This approach, pioneered by Weizmann Institute professors Israel
Dostrovsky and Moshe Levy, is currently being implemented by a
team headed by Engineer Michael Epstein.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the concept was advanced with the construction of a
chemical heat pipe that has the ability to absorb 500 kilowatts
of power. The first stage of the system, known as reforming
technology, is currently being considered for scaling up to suit
various industrial applications.

Although there are some difficulties in the Middle East peace
process, Qian said, he believed that the difficulties could be
overcome.

China wishes to see the realization of a comprehensive and fair

achievements.

East peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned Over Liberian Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration has urged
Liberian factions to the Liberian civil war to participate in the
Ghana peace talks mediated by the U.S.and several west African
states.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the U.S.Informaion Agency
today, Clinton's special representative, ambassador Smith, will
attend the west African summit aimed at re-establishing a
ceasefie in war-torn Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government appreciated the efforts of Ghanian
President Jerry Rawlings, who is also Chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWS), for his drive to
resolvethe Liberian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings' representative, Kojo Tsikata, earlier met
with Clinton's National Security Advisor, Anthony Lake, to
examine the situation in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Charles Taylor, Libearia's major warlord and also
Vice-Chairman of the Transitional Cabinet, said in a broadcast to
the nation via his private radio that ''ceasefireis not a proper
thing.''
</P>
<P>
''There will not be a ceasefire until Johnson surrenders to the
government or some authority such as ECOWAS, U.N. or OAU,'' said
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a general of the former administration of President
Samul Doe, is leader of the Kharn faction.
</P>
<P>
An attempt to arrest Johnson on murder charges sparked the
current facional fighting in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
A day-old lull in shooting in the capital continued through
Friday, although the streets remained empty despite the apparent
relative calm.
</P>
<P>
''To reach a ceasefire, the Barclay Traininl Centre barracks
(which is Johnson's headpuarters in Monrovia) must be accessible
to the west Afrcan peacekeeping forces,'' said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
''If peace is to come to this country, there must be law and
order and anyone challenging the government will be dealt with,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said his troops and the African peacekeepers are
determined to ''move street by street'' to clear around the
barracks before storming the home of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Observers say it is not sure whether the faction leaders would
heed to the calls made by the Clinton aministration to hold the
''special session'' to be participated by the heads of state of
west African countries.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian factional leaders signed a peace accord in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria, in August, 1995, but fighting broke out last
month, arousing fears over whether peace will come to the
war-torn west African state following six years of civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- There are 268 expatriate teachers
currently working in secondary schools throughout Zambia, ''Zambia
daily mail'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Deputy Education Minister Sammuel Miyanda as
saying that the government would continue to employ expatriate
teachers for secondary schools because many Zambian teachers
resigned from their posts due to poor conditions of service.
</P>
<P>
The other reason was inadequate places for teacher training at
the University of Zambia and secondary school teachers colleges
in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured the nation that the new education policy was
putting in place new measures to ensure that teachers were given
better conditions of service.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he disclosed that a total of 3,556 secondary school
teachers had retired from the profession in the past four years.

<HEADLINE> Mineral Exports Decrease In Tanzania Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Refusal by the Bank of
Tanzania to buy gold for most of last year, together with
investors fears on the outcome of the general elections held last
October, led to a reduction in small scale mining and a decline
of mineral exports by 20 million U.S. Dollars, a mining sector
official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Adressing the second annual general meeting of the Tanzania
Chamber of Miners (TCM) here on Friday, TCM Chairman Samuel
Lwakatare said that mineral exports last year earned only 15
million U.S. Dollars as against 35 million U.S.Dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said that suspending gold purchasing by the Central Bank
occasioned a big drop in gold exports through formal channels,
from 24.1 million U.S. Dorlars in 1994 to 3.3 million U.S.
Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Suspension led to most gold exports going through informal
channels, he said, noting that official gold exports in the last
two years had substantially fallen behind the level realised in
1993, standing at 31 million U.S.Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The TCM chairman said, owing to uncertainty gripping the
investor community prior to the general elections, few companies
made substantial new investments in the sector. "As a result the
country experienced an obvious slack in mineral exploration with
a number of companies suspending field activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, investors confidence was presently being
restored and exploration activities are reported to be gaining
momentum in several areas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Cameroon Trade Charges On Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Cameroon on Friday traded
charges on agreession in the dispute Bakassi Peninsula, as
officials of both countries parleyed in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried by the Guardian newspaper,
Cameroonian Charge D'affairs in Lagos, Prosper Bomba Ngong, was
summoned to the Nigerian capital Abuja by Director-General of the
Nigerian Foreign Ministry, Jibril Chinade, for talks over the
border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ngong said after the talks that both countries agreed to
explore ways of settling the border feud through the mediation
and arbitration of the United Nations and The world court.
</P>
<P>
''Nigeria has been under attack from Cameroon for the past
week and, as a result of this, we instruted our permanent
representative at the United Nations to report to the Security
Council,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
''And Nigeria is most unhappy with the developments in the
last few days in the peninsula,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinade stressed that Nigeria's policy of
friendliness with its neighbors would not change, saying that ''
Cameroon's recourse to military action in sttling the border
dispute was a betrayal of the principle of good neighborliness''.
</P>
<P>
the Nigerian official said his government was determined o
maintain its excellent relationship with neighbors but would also
maintain security at its borders always.
</P>
<P>
''Nigeria can not watch idly while Cameroon continues to
unleash violence on our territory and people,'' said Chinade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Nigerian military also stated that it would be
''duty-bound'' to protect the Nigerian territory and would ''take
all necessary measures to do so.''
</P>
<P>
"From Friday on April 26, till today, May 3, 1996, Nigeria's
positions have come under heavy bombardment," said a military
statement read by the defence spokesman, Fred Chijuka.
</P>
<P>
Chijuka said the Cameroonians used heavy artillery weapons, in
addition to helicopers and gunboats, in their attack against the
Nigerian military positions at the border.
</P>
<P>
This was refuted on Friday by Cameroonian Information Minister
Augustine Mkonchu. ''The truth is that since less than 10 days
now, the Nigerian army has been attacking Cameroonian forces on a
daily basis, and we are astonished that every time they attack
us, they are the first to go on the media, accusing Cameroon,''
said the Cameroonian minister.
</P>
<P>
''Since the beginning of this conflict, we have never attacked
the Nigerian forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''But since you know that our elements are on the field, on
Cameroon territory to defend the terrtory, they cannot be ther
watching to receive bullets. So, from time to time, they have to
respond. and that is what is going on in bakassi now,'' said
Mkonchu.
</P>
<P>
The Cameroonian minister also downplayed expectations from
Friday's parley in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula is claimed by both Nigeria and
Cameroon. The land dispute led to a border war in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Official On Depreciation Of Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua)-- Zambian Deputy Finance Minister Koshita
Shengamo has revealed that the continued depreciation of local
currency Kwacha was caused by the sharp demand for foreign exchange
and emergency maize imports.
</P>
<P>
Shengamo told parliament on Friday that the sharp devaluation of
local currency had led people to keep savings in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons were the decline in foreign exchange earnings from
copper exports and shortfalls in donor funds inflow, he added.
</P>
<P>
The export value of copper and its by-product cobalt accounts for
85 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
International donors provide Zambia with various assistance
totalling some one billion U.S.Dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
In the past four months, Zambian Kwacha has been devaluated by
some 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Pays Tribute To Tanzania's Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR ) has once again extended its
gratitude to Tanzania for its humanitarian policy to host a lot
of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi despite her economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
The head of UNCHR sub-office in Ngara district, north-western
Tanzania, on Friday expressed his appreciation for Tanzania's
humanitarian move to allow into Tanzania asylum seekers from
Burundi recently despite the closure of its boarder.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR sub-office head, Mr. A. Chaponda, said on Friday
that Tanzania was currently hosting 477,727 refugees in Ngara and
Biharamulo districts in Kagera Region, 409,071 of them from
Rwanda and others from Burundi, according to a report reaching

have returned to their homes voluntarily.

<HEADLINE> EU Could Play Major Role in Bosnia Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) could play a
major role in forming a military peacekeeping force in Bosnia next
year when the NATO-led peacekeeping mission pulls out, a senior EU
official has indicated.
</P>
<P>
"Without a military presence in Bosnia after the end of 1996,
the civilian reconstruction of Bosnia will be threatened," the
Financial Times quoted EU External Affairs Commissioner Hans Van
den Broek as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek urged the EU to urgently consider the
constitutional arrangements needed to provide the authority for a
new European peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
One of the Commission's options is to assemble a totally new
European force, which would come under the EU or the 10-member
Western European Union (WEU) military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Another alternative, proposed by Van den Broek, is a new
formula for US-European military cooperation under which European
military forces would shoulder the main responsibility with the
United States providing air cover and logistical support.
</P>
<P>
Local political commentators predict the new proposal is
unlikely to be accepted either by Europe or the Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Americans could regard the plan as leaving them with too
much involvement in Bosnia, while the European countries would
fear a repeat of the problems faced by the EU-led United Nations
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Germany, France and Britain have recently made it clear that
they will pull their military forces out of Bosnia when the United
States does at the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Foreign Debt Totals 80 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's total foreign debt
amounted to 78.98 billion U.S. dollars at the end of last year, up
38.9 percent from the end of 1994, the Bank of Korea said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Short-term debts rose 49.4 percent to 45.41 billion dollars
last year, representing 57.5 percent of the total, while long-term
debts also climbed 26.8 percent to 33.57 billion dollars,
according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's total foreign debt fell from a peak of 46.76
billion dollars in 1985 to 29.37 billion dollars in 1989, before
climbing back to 31.7 billion dollars in 1990, 42.81 billion
dollars in 1992 and 56.85 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Net foreign debt, namely, the gross foreign debt minus the
country's overseas assets, jumped 76 percent to 18.19 billion
dollars last year, a record high in the past eight years, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the increasing foreign debt to the
expanding current-account deficit, the private sector's increasing
demand for foreign exchange funds and an extended period of
payment for imports on a credit basis.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign debt will surpass the 80-billion-dollar mark and
the net debt the 20-billion-dollar level by the end of this year
if the present pace of increase continues, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
But the country's total foreign debt still accounts for only
four percent of the gross national product (GNP), about half of
the 7-8 percent registered in developed countries, the official
said, adding that the official debt is by no means a worrisome
amount.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Promote Small-Scale Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
embarking on a program to stimulate the emergence of new
entrepreneurs in a bid to reduce poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Population Haryono and Minister of Industry
and Trade Tunky Arivibowo signed here Friday a memorandum of
understanding to develop small-scale industry in rural areas,
sources from the office of the Population Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on developing skills of the rural poor
to run small-scale industry and work as traders.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum, the Ministry of Industry and Trade
will provide technical assistance while the Population Ministry
will finance and coordinate the program.
</P>
<P>
The program will start in South Sumatra and East Java by
launching 510 very-small business units there.
</P>
<P>
The program will eventually cover all provinces in the country,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to develop 230,000 new business units in
the current five-year development plan (1994-1999).
</P>
<P>
At present, 56 percent of the 39.4 million families in
Indonesia do not have an adequate standard of living, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The poverty alleviation program has so far extended 23 billion
rupiah (one billion US dollars) to 11.5 million families in the
form of savings accounts of 2,000 rupiah (85 US cents) for each,
said the sources.

<P>
SEOUL, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's overseas investments
rose 55.6 percent to 1.47 billion U.S. dollars in the first
quarter of this year, the Bank of Korea said here today.
</P>
<P>
The investments went to 425 projects, an increase of 10.1
percent over the same period last year, according to the central

</P>
<P>
The January-March overseas direct investments averaged 3.5

</P>
<P>
However, the proportion of investments by small-and
medium-sized enterprises fell to 17.8 percent or 262 million

<P>
The manufacturing sector topped the list with 617 million
dollars spent on 278 projects, followed by trading with 274

dollars, were made in Asia. 369 million dollars went to north
America, 190 million dollars went to Europe and 153 million
dollars went to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, South Korea's actual
overseas direct investments stood at 1.58 billion dollars, which
included projects that were previously approved, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The country's cumulative overseas direct investments approved
had climbed to 15.13 billion U.S. dollars for 6,558 projects by
the end of last March, while actual investments totaled 11.52
billion dollars for 5,657 projects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Marksman Bears Olympic Torch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The 1996 Olympic Torch Relay
reached a new climax on Friday when Xu Haifeng, China's first-ever
Olympic gold medalist, carried the torch through San Francisco's
Chinatown aboard a cable car.
</P>
<P>
Xu, 39, was the first Chinese to take part in the flame relay
and he was given a warm reception as a returned hero.
</P>
<P>
American torchbearer Daniel Lavar, escorted by motorized
policemen, brought the flame to Xu at 7:30 p.m. at the center of
the city.
</P>
<P>
Xu stepped aboard the cable car, holding high the burning
torch, onlookers on street sides gave him a loud applause, waving
national flags of both China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Xu won a pistol gold medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic
Games and now is head coach of the Chinese women' national team.
</P>
<P>
Climbing over a sloping street, the tram turned left and
stopped in front of a big waiting crowd. Xu was instantly
surrounded by enthusiastic Chinese, amid the noise of the drums
and three dancing lions, a traditional Chinese way of celebration.
</P>
<P>
Xu passed the flame to American Japanese Kristi Yamaguchi, the
women's figure skating winner at the 1992 Winter Olympic Games in
France.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day's torch relaying, all the carriers
gathered at the Justin Herman Plaza with local citizens,
celebrating the arrival of the Olympic flame, a symbol of strength
and peace.
</P>
<P>
Torch relay was originated in ancient Greece, which called a
sacred truce encouraging athlete to compete peacefully at the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The tradition was revived in 1936, adding the symbolism of a
torch lit in Olympic by the rays of the sun. The torch relay has
preceded every Olympic Games since then.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 people have transferred the flame since the torch
relay started April 27 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
But Xu was the only one among the total 10.000 bearers to stand
aboard a cable car, a special transport mean in San Francisco,
according to officials from the Coca-Cola company, the presenter
of the 1996 Olympic Torch Relay.
</P>
<P>
Xu, still suffering from his nagging eye ailments, said he
hoped that the team under his direction will be successful at the
upcoming Olympics in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loan Expected to Improve Water Quality of Lijiang River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in
southwest China will invest 100 million US dollars to improve the
water quality of the Lijiang River, in the area of its major
tourist city, Guilin.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region expects that the World Bank will be able
to provide half of the money in loans. A delegation from the bank
recently visited Guangxi to assess the project.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990 the government of Guilin City has spent 21.6 million
yuan on 81 industrial pollution-control projects and has shut down
or relocated 38 factories. It has also taken measures to protect
the forests in the upper valley of the river.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have returned the river to its former pristine
state. However, as the water consumption by urban citizens as well
as by industry and agriculture keeps growing, the water of the
Lijiang River and the city's old waste-water processing facilities
are no longer enough to meet the demand, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The program planned by the government includes diverting water
from two rivers and a reservoir nearby, promoting water-saving
measures and building more waste-water processing plants.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to start next year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's UMNO to Nominate Mahathir For Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) Supreme Council today decided that
UMNO divisions can only nominate Mahathir Mohamad for the post of
presidency and Anwar Ibrahim for deputy presidency at the UMNO
elections in October this year.
</P>
<P>
After chairing a UMNO Supreme Council meeting here today,
Mahathir, the prime minister, told the press that any other
candidates nominated for the two top posts will be disqualified.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was in line with the resolutions of the
last UMNO General Assembly which decided there should be no
contest for the party's two top posts.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is the current UMNO president and prime minister of
Malaysia, while Anwar is incumbent UMNO deputy president and the
country's deputy prime minister and minister of finance.
</P>
<P>
"As such, there is no need for registration of the candidates
for president and deputy president," Mahathir said, adding there
would be no registration for the two top posts and if there were
any, they would be rejected."
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysia's news agency Bernama, This also means
that Mahathir and Anwar have actually retained the post of UMNO
president and deputy president respectively for another three
years.
</P>
<P>
However, Bernama quoted Mahathir as saying that the UMNO
divisions still need to nominate him and Anwar for the two top
posts in line with the aspiration of the last General Assembly
which was held here on November 24-25, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that today's decision was consistent with UMNO's
constitution, as the supreme council could make decisions if there
was no general assembly of the party.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Exiled Group Plans to Launch Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Accord (INA), an
exiled group opposed to the regime of Saddam Hussein, was
planning to launch a weekly newspaper this month, Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Haron Mohammad, an INA spokesman, as saying that
"Iraq Al Mustaqbal" (Iraq of the Future) will cover Iraqi internal
affairs and will work on "exposing the immoral practices of the
Iraqi regime."
</P>
<P>
"We will also cover the news of Iraqi opposition groups
everywhere," he said, stressing that the paper will be the first
publication to represent various Iraqi opposition factions.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said he expected the majority of the 15,000 copies of
the weekly to be distributed inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the INA launched a daily four-hour Arab radio
service from the kingdom via satellite.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi opposition is composed of four main groups: the National
Secular Group led by Sunni Moslems, the Kurdish movement, the
leftist movement composed of the Iraqi Communist and Baath parties
and the Shiites.
</P>
<P>
While the leftist and religious groups are historically
affiliated with Syria, the INA, which its members say, was
established by former Iraqi army generals and diplomats in the
early 1990s, is the only group with offices in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Another 20-25 Iraqi opposition groups are still awaiting
approval from the government to open offices in the kingdom,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government says it will grant permits to them on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local press today reported that a delegation
representing the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) will visit Jordan
this month for talks with Jordanian officials on the situation
in Iraq and the KDP's quest to open an office in Amman.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also discuss with the INA coordination
between two factions and "efforts to speed up political change
in Baghdad."
</P>
<P>
The team's visit to Amman is the second by Iraqi opposition
group in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
A delegation representing the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK), visited the Kingdom last month and was granted the
permission to open an office here.
</P>
<P>
A PUK team is expected to arrive this month to open an
office here.

<P>
KATHMANDU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has set a
plan to develop Lumbini, the birthplace of lord Buddha Sakyamuni,
in western Nepal as a pilgrimage and tourist spot, Prime Minister
Sher Bahadur Deuba said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public meeting held here to observe the 2540th
birthday of the Buddha, Deuba said the teachings of Sakyamuni,
founder of the Buddhism religion, had served to establish
widespread religious tolerance in Nepal which does not
discriminate people on the religious basis.
</P>
<P>
The world as a whole should acknowledge the teachings of the
Buddha which could serve to establish peace everywhere, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the discovery of
Lumbini as the Buddha's birthplace this year, and the government
plans to develop the western Nepali town as a Mecca for Buddhism
followers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a festival for Buddha's birthday celebration began
Friday in Lumbini with large numbers of people from Nepal and
neighboring Indian areas visiting there.

<HEADLINE> Wheat-Grass Juice Tested in Israel for Treating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The juice of the wheat-grass
plant, which can be found in health food stores, is being tested
as a possible treatment for ulcerative colitis, The Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The clinical trials are being carried out at the Hadassah
University Hospital in Jerusalem and are open only to sufferers
of the disease who are in the midst of an acute attack.
</P>
<P>
The disease is a severe, chronic inflammation of the large
intestine and rectum.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary study of 10 patients was completed, with eight of
them reporting improvement in their condition even though
wheat-grass juice was the only change in their diet and their
drug treatment had not been amended.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eran Ben-Arye, who is coordinating the research, said that
the juice will be fresh and prepared by squeezing the
wheat-grass. It is rich in chlorophyll, vitamins A, C and E,
iron, calcium and magnesium.
</P>
<P>
A control group will receive a green-colored juice with the
same taste but not made from wheat-grass; in the double-blind,
two-month study, no one will know who is getting the real thing
until the results are disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The condition is usually diagnosed between 10 and 30, with
profuse waterly diarrhea containing varying amounts of blood,
mucus and pus.
</P>
<P>
The cause is not known. Other symptoms are weight loss, anemia,
pain, fever, sever intestinal pain and chills, and some patients
cannot function normally. Children may suffer retarded physical
growth.
</P>
<P>
Treatment with steroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs may
help control the symptoms but can be dangerous in themselves. The
other permanent cure is removal of the affected parts of the
intestine.

<HEADLINE> Academic Activities of Senior Sociologist Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Veteran Chinese sociologist Fei
Xiaotong now focuses his eyes on the development of the Yangtze
River Delta and central parts of China following decades of
academic activities, according to a signed article in today's
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Feng Zhijun, vice-chairman of the China
Democratic League (CDL) Central Committee, made an overall review
about Fei's dedication to China's economic and social development
over the past 60 years. Fei, 86, now serves as vice-chairman of the
National People's Congress standing committee and chairman of the
CDL Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
During a talk with general secretary Jiang Zemin in the early
1990s, Fei proposed faster development in the Yangtze River
Delta. The delta area, he said, plays a vital role in drawing
China and the whole world together, and the establishment of a
large-scale economic development zone in the delta will spur
economic expansion along the entire Yangtze River valley.
</P>
<P>
According to Fei, the delta can promote the overall growth of
China's economy with Shanghai playing a leading role, Jiangsu and
Zhejiang provinces acting as two wings, and the Yangtze River
valley as a vast hinterland. The arteries of railway and water
transportation will link up raw material producers in western
China with technological powers in eastern China, he said.
</P>
<P>
His proposal won high praise from Jiang Zemin, the article said.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, Fei made repeated investigation
tours in central China. In 1995 alone, he spent 148 days in the
rural areas, doing on-the-spot investigations.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the Euroasian Continental Bridge -- a railway
connecting Lianyungang City in China's eastern coast with
Rotterdam in the netherlands -- should serve as a backbone of an
economic corridor, so that the bridge's transportation advantage can
bring about considerable economic returns.
</P>
<P>
According to the sociologist, the economic corridor not only
links up eastern and western parts of China, but extends to the
Pacific region to the east and Arab countries to the west. With
it, Fei said, central China will be better prepared for an
economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the senior sociologist has put forward
suggestions on how south China can maintain healthy growth, how
the Bohai Sea-rim areas step up development, how north China areas
become an economic center, and how northeast China areas make new
economic breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just 86 years old and will continue to go around," the
article quoted Fei as saying recently.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The crude palm oil (CPO), tin
and rubber markets in Malaysia ended the week mixed with CPO
prices higher while tin and rubber prices lower.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian crude palm oil physicals prices closed the week
higher on expectation that Pakistan may tender next week. The news
helped the market.
</P>
<P>
The price for May South closed the week at 1,305 Malaysian
ringgit (about 522 U.S. dollars) per ton, or 12 ringgit higher
than last week.
</P>
<P>
Tin prices on the Malaysian tin market closed the week lower on
lack of buying support. Tin prices closed 12 sen lower at 16.08
ringgit (about 6.43 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
This week's turnover was at 251 tons from last week's total of
615 tons. The week's market closed for public holidays on Monday
and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market next week will deeply depend on the
closing of the London Metal Exchange this week. However, they said
the Japanese buyers may return next week and this will help the
market.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices on the Malaysian market closed the week lower on
lack of enquiries from overseas.

<P>
The price for June RSS1 dropped six sen to 356.6 sen (about

sen (about 1.28 dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said the lack of enquiries from overseas dampened
sentiments on the three-day trading week, and said the lack of
buying from overseas will continue next week as buyers were
waiting for an even lower price.

NEW DELHI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Union Industry Minister and
Congress Working Committee (CWC) member K. Karunakaran has said
that Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao would have to quit
as president of the Congress in order to strengthen the party.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to find a new party president after the general
elections. If Rao does not agree with this demand, the party
cannot surrender," Karunakaran said in an interview with Friday's
English newspaper the Times of India.
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling in the party that it has failed to cash in
on the good performance of the Congress government, this is
primarily due to organizational weaknesses. The prime minister
did not have time to pay attention to the party's work..., so some
rethinking is needed. One person should not hold both the posts
of Congress president and the prime minister," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must learn from our past. Even Pandit (Jawaharlal) Nehru
and Mrs. (Indira) Gandhi had to give up the party presidentship
when they realized it was needed to strengthen the organization,"
the minister stressed.

HANOI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's economy saw a good growth
rate in the first four months, official report here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, 2.5 million ha of winter-spring rice were
transplanted or 104 per cent of the same crop last year. By mid
April, farmers in southern provinces had harvested nearly 1.2
million ha out of the total 1.3 million ha of rice, while those in
northern provinces were concentrating on caring for rice.
</P>
<P>
Subsidiary crop acreage increased by 11.6 per cent over the
same period last year.

</P>
<P>
However, some products decreased in their output compared with
that of last year, including crude oil with only 2.59 million
tonnes, down by 5.9 per cent, due to the influence of strong winds
and damaged vessels in April, and cement, down by 1 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The price index for commodities and services in the past four
months increased by 4.3 per cent since December.
</P>

JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Film Censorship Board
(LSF) has urged private television stations to reduce the airing
of violent and pornographic films on TV, the Antara news agency

LSF Vice Chairman Soekanto said here Friday that the board will
provide clear-cut definitions of violence and pornography on

He said some private TV stations continue to show indifference
towards the kind of films they broadcast despite measures imposed
by the LSF, and many video clips shown on television are against
the country's religious norms.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Hindu religious leaders had filed a protest
against the rock group "Saigon Kick" whose performance has
insulted the Hindu community.

The LSF also called for deeper involvement of relevant
institutions, especially those in charge of foreign films, in

<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Thai Chamber of
Commerce will meet Peru's gold industry leaders to discuss
possible joint ventures to mine Peruvian gold, the Bangkok post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Patima Srichoomsiri, director of the Chamber's committee on
small and medium-sized enterprises, will visit the Peruvian
capital Lima at the head of a delegation next week and attend
Peru's Second International Gold Symposium there.
</P>

A press release from the Peruvian Embassy in Bangkok said the
gold mining industry has grown by leaps and bounds in recent
years, prompting Peru's National Mining and Petroleum Society to
organize the first international gold symposium in 1994. That
meeting drew more than 800 participants.
</P>
<P>
Next week's symposium will highlight the current state of gold
resources in the country and promote new investment in the

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Continue to fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- New York share prices continued to
fall today as traders fear that more jobs created in April
may enhance consumers' spending power and hence drive up inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.24 points to close
at 5,478.03. For the past week, the blue-chip index was down
89.96 points mainly due to the heightened fear of renewed
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues led advancers by a small margin and the
trading volume totaled more than 400 million shares.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Dow's average tumbled 77 points in response to
the country's rosy economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department announced that day that the GDP in
the first quarter grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, five
times as much as it was in the last quarter of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Makes Further Efforts for Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
is making further efforts for the release of the hostages who
have been held in a village in Irian Jaya since January 8, local
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The ABRI is appealing to the public in Irian Jaya to give
whatever assistance it can offer to secure the release of 11
hostages kidnapped by the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the reports
quoted Maulud Hidayat, an information officer of the Irian Jaya
Military Region Command, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI now opens the opportunity for and invites the public to
participate in the efforts to free the hostages," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ABRI is still trying to persuade the captors to
free the hostages and the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) is now acting as a mediator, said the officer.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, there had been no contact between the ICRC
and the abductors since early April and the ABRI now needed the
assistance of local public figures and tribal leaders.
</P>
<P>
The 11 hostages, including four Britons and two Dutchmen, were
part of the 26 people abducted by the OPM on January 8 when they
were conducting scientific research in the area. The OPM later
released 15 hostages.

<HEADLINE> Guan Wins Three Golds at Women's Weightlifting Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China's world champion Guan Hong won
three gold medals in the 46-kg category on the opening day of the
World Women's Weightlifting Championships here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guan, 22, successfully defended the snatch, jerk and total
titles won at last year's world championships in Guangzhou, China.
</P>
<P>
She lifted 77.5-kilogram in snatch and 95-kg in jerk for a
total of 172.5-kg, beating down challenges from Chinese Taipei's
Tsai Huey Woan.
</P>
<P>
But Guan, who had 80-kg for snatch and 100-kg for jerk at
Guangzhou, was not satisfied with her results here.
</P>
<P>
"I could not find my best form either physically or
technically," Guan said. "I had shaky legs in clean and jerk,
which I had never seen before."
</P>
<P>
Her coach Xi Hanxiang attributed these to the jet lag and the
foods.
</P>
<P>
Xi said Guan, returning from April's Asian championships, could
not accustom herself to the western foods here and failed to sleep
well.
</P>
<P>
In the World Youth Weightlifting Championships staged along
with the women's championships Friday, China's Luo Zongnan matched
Guan's feat by having a clean sweep of the men's 54-kg golds.
</P>
<P>
Luo registered 105 kilograms for snatch, 135 kilogram for jerk
and 240 kilogram for the aggregate.
</P>
<P>
About 400 weightlifters from 50 countries and regions took part
in the two championships held in a gymnasium at the Warsaw
Military Technology University.

<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Results of the "1995 Ten Major
Awards for Science and Technology in the Electronics Industry
Contest" of China were revealed here Friday, with four rewards
going to computer and software research.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, the results indicate China's
acknowledgement of the importance of computers and computer
software in the information buildup of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The four projects include a new software development
environment called "Qingniao", a neuro-computer in digital analog
processing mode, the Chinese Operation System Alliance (a software
platform) and the Dawning 1000 Massively Parallel Computer System.
</P>
<P>
China's information industry has maintained an annual growth
rate of 20 percent over the past few years, hitting 23.5 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
The sector has also become a "battleground" for overseas
electronics giants, one in which they can make substantial profits.
</P>
<P>
Six other awards covered breakthroughs in high-definition TV
(HDTV), satellite telecommunications, and the manufacturing
technology of 0.8 micron CMOS integrated circuit chips and liquid
batteries.
</P>
<P>
All of these projects have reached the world standards of the
1990s, and were developed independently by Chinese researchers,
said experts.
</P>
<P>
The results of the contest also showed a trend toward firming
co-operation among Chinese research institutes, the organizers
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Maritime Courts Keep Sea Transport Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China's maritime courts, set up 10
years ago, have helped keep sea transport in order and promoted
foreign trade, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme
People's Court, as saying that the courts had provided judicial
guarantees for the smooth operation of ocean shipping by equally
protecting litigants' rights and punishing unaffair competition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities like Guangzhou, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin,
Dalian, Wuhan, Haikou, Xiamen and Ningbo opened such courts in
November 1984, following a decision by the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
They handle the initial trials of cases on maritime rights
infringements, maritime trade contracts, and maritime affairs and
trade enforcement. Between 1985 and 1995, the courts dealt with
11,300 first trials concerning maritime affairs and trade
involving 7.3 billion yuan (880 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of these cases, 1,860 involved litigants from Hong Kong, Macao,
Taiwan and 54 foreign countries and regions, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the number of cases handled by the maritime courts
had risen sharply since the country's maritime law was promulgated
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the nine courts handled nearly 2,850 first trials,
up 14.5 percent from the previous year. About 18 percent of these
cases involved litigants from foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
They have a staff of 400, including professional technicians
from harbors and the shipping sector, judicial officers from local
courts and university graduates, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Thai Oil Firm Sees Philippines as Regional Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Petroleum Authority of Thailand
(PTT), the national oil firm, plans to establish a major base in
the Philippines as part of its drive to expand business abroad,
according to PTT officials.
</P>
<P>
The move into the Philippines forms a key part of the
authority's plan to become a world-class petroleum business taking
advantage of the pending deregulation of that country's oil
market.
</P>
<P>
It was also aimed at creating an additional oil supply base in
the region, reducing its reliance on Singapore as a regional oil
center, the officials were quoted by today's Bangkok Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
When Thai cabinet approval is given, the Thai national oil firm
will establish four joint-venture companies and a wholly-owned
subsidiary to handle a broad range of oil operations, including
retailing, in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The four joint-venture companies are Subic Bay Petroleum
Products (Cayman Islands) Ltd, Subic Bay Petroleum Products
(Philippines) Inc, The Pipeline and Clark Depot Co, and Subic
Petroleum Distribution Inc.
</P>
<P>
The PTT has also formed PTT Philippines Inc to establish 140
service stations under the PTT brand in the Philippines by 2001.
</P>
<P>
PTT is also expanding its business in other countries such as
Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and
India. It expects to invest 13 billion baht (520 million US
dollars) in projects valued at 23 billion baht (920 million US
dollars) in these countries in five or six years.
</P>
<P>
Most schemes initially involve oil retailing, and investment is
made either directly or through joint ventures.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Attorney General Surrenders to Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's Attorney
General Orlando Vasquez Velasquez surrendered to police today, one
day after the Supreme Court ordered his arrest on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
He surrendered to Bogota police chief, General Luis Ernesto
Gilibert, at a police training school in the northwestern
outskirts of the capital and was then handed over to secret
service agents.
</P>
<P>
The country's top judicial official was accused of accepting
200,000 U.S. dollars from the Cali cocaine cartel to finance his
failed bid for a Senate seat in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of Vasquez were unknown when an arrest warrant
was issued by Prosecutor General Alfonso Valdivieso Thursday.

<P>
Vasquez, who also served in the past as interior minister and

</P>
<P>
He was suspended from office for three months by the Supreme
Court last week for trying to undermine a probe by Valdivieso into
drug corruption at the highest levels of the Colombian government.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada edged Russia on penalty
shootout and the Czech Republic whitewashed the United States 5-0
to sail into the final of the World Ice Hockey Championship here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Canada tied Russia 2-2 after regulation and a 10-minute
overtime, but outlasted its opponent 3-2 in the penalty shootout.
</P>
<P>
Russia had a quick start as Dmitri Kvartalnov scored at 4:29 in
the first period to jump to an 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Brylin made it 2-0 for Russia at 16:32, when he blasted
a backhand shot past the Canadian goalie.
</P>
<P>
But Olympic runner-up Canada managed to level the score in the
second period through Jason Dawe and Steve Duchesne, who scored at
1:40 and 11:36.
</P>
<P>
After the goal-less third period, the Russians mounted constant
attacks upon the Canadians in the overtime but were in vain,
setting up the deciding shootout.
</P>
<P>
In the other semi-final, the Czechs led the first period 3-0 on
goals from Otakar Vejvoda, Martin Prochazka and Jiri Kucera.
</P>
<P>
Prochazka scored his second goal and Pavel Patera added another
in the final period to complete the mauling.

The Czech Republic will meet 20-time champion Canada in
Sunday's final, while Saturday's play-off for the bronze medal
will pit the United States against Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO used chemical and radioactive
weapons in its bombing of the Bosnian Serbs last year, an official
newspaper alleged today.
</P>
<P>
After months of investigation and analysis, Bosnian Serb
military experts have found that rockets used by NATO in last
year's bombing of Bosnian Serb targets contained uranium, the
"Politika" newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the experts as saying that the core of the rockets
was made from radioactive nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Serb military experts as claiming that
the United States was testing a new weapon in Bosnia and its
after-effects will only be known in several years' time.
</P>
<P>
The paper alleged that NATO forces also used toxic chemical
weapons that can incapacitate people.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombarded military and civilian installations in
Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia last year to force Bosnian Serb
leaders to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
According to "Politika", all kinds of bombs and rockets,
including cruise missiles, were used in the bombardments that
killed 152 people and wounded 272.

<HEADLINE> Sino-African Economic, Trade Co-operation Entering New Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade co-operation
between China and African countries, which has increased rapidly in
the past few years, has entered a new stage of an overall and
rapid development.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign trade and Economic
Cooperation, the Sino-African trade volume last year was 3.9
billion US dollars-worth, up 48.3 percent over 1994 and more than
four times the figure for 1990.
</P>
<P>
Of the total trade volume, China's exports to Africa were
valued at nearly 2.5 billion US dollars last year, an increase of
42.6 percent, while China's imports totalled 1.4 billion US
dollars-worth, representing an increase of 59.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's export commodities are mainly textiles, garments,
machinery and electronic products, tea, light industrial products
and goods for daily use. Goods imported by China from Africa
include mineral products, petroleum, timber, chemical fertilizers,
cotton, cocoa and coffee.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are some 150 Chinese trading companies and
agencies operating in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese government initiated the practice of
government-subsidied soft loans for African countries in 1995,
China has signed agreements with 11 African countries in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
With this practice China has aided construction of some 600
projects in Africa, covering agriculture, fisheries and animal
husbandry, textiles and light industry, energy resources,
communications and transportation, broadcasting and
telecommunications, water conservancy, electricity, machinery,
construction of dwellings and office buildings, education,
handicraft and food processing.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1984, China and several African countries tried to
improve economic efficiency of projects with Chinese aid, through
various forms of cooperation including leasing and joint
management.
</P>
<P>
Now some 2,100 Chinese experts in 105 separate groups and more
than 800 Chinese medical workers in 35 medical teams are working
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Entering the 1990s, China's labor contracts signed with African
countries also reached a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that from the late 1970s to the end of 1995
Chinese companies signed a total of 5,494 labor contracts in
Africa, with a total contracted volume of seven billion
US dollars, 5.2 billion US dollars of which has been realized.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 China's project engineering in Africa ranged from the
building of houses, highways, bridges, harbors and water
conservancy projects to well-drilling, agriculture, light industry
and textiles, and co-operation in the areas of building materials,
machinery, environmental protection, natural gas, peaceful use of
nuclear power and railway transportation.
</P>
<P>
Labor co-operation is mainly conducted in the fields of
architecture, water conservancy, fishing, textiles, electronics,
iron and steel and the catering industry.
</P>
<P>
So far, Chinese companies have signed contracts worth from 10
million US dollars to hundreds of millions of US dollars.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Visits Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said today that it is still not the time for NATO to give
preferential consideration to any one country aspiring to joining
it.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian news service, Rompres, quoted Solana as saying
that NATO has not yet decided on which country to accept first
into the North Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
Solana explained to Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu
that the NATO eastward expansion has to be a clear-cut, gradual
and transparent process.
</P>
<P>
"There exists no exterior veto right but special attention has
to be paid to the relationship with the Russian Federation," the
NATO chief was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca and Senate Speaker
Oliviu Gherman also met Solana during his six-hour visit to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Gherman told the NATO visitor that a phased expansion may give
rise to discord between those which join NATO earlier and those
which join NATO later.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted that when he visited Prague prior to his
tour of Romania, Solana said that the Czech Republic will be one
of the first countries to be accepted into NATO.
</P>
<P>
Poland and Hungary are believed to be other eastern and central
European countries that will be given favorable consideration by
NATO.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Sees Highest Jobless Rate in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's jobless rate reached
6.38 percent in March, the highest since 1992, according to
statistics released today.
</P>
<P>
The rate means that 2 million workers are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The surge of unemployment is mainly due to the country's high
interest rates which, at 40 percent, are the highest in the world,
experts at the Geography and Statistics Institute said.
</P>
<P>
The exorbitant cost of borrowing and repaying loans has forced
many small and medium-sized enterprises to close down since the
start of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the biggest industrial city of Sao Paulo alone, about 1,000
businesses went bankrupt in the first three months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government raised interest rates at the beginning
of 1995 to cool down the then-overheated economy.

<HEADLINE> Star Field Hockey Player's HK Career Seems Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The international field career of
talented Hong Kong field hockey player Arfan Pervez seems to be
over due to his poor disciplinary record.
</P>
<P>
The fullback's record prompted the Hong Kong Hockey Association
to bar him from representing Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, the 25-year-old Pervez, who was banned for eight
months earlier this year for rough play and bringing the game into
disrepute, will be allowed to play for his club Shaheen after
serving out the suspension.
</P>
<P>
According to Con Conway, president of the association, the
organization would not select him for the Hong Kong team because
of his behavior.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot have a player who had a bad record at an
international level as well as in Hong Kong. So we have decided
not to select him in the future," he said, although he admitted
that Pervez was a "talented player".
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation carried out by the association's
council, the player has received five yellow cards and two red in
the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
John Stapley, the Hong Kong team's manager, said he had even
managed to keep him out of the game to let him cool down.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair for them to do this to me," Pervez said, after
learning of the decision. He would appeal to the association, he
said.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends 2-Month Extension of UNAVEM III </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today recommended only a two-month renewal
of the U.N. Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, the secretary-general said
progress in implementing the Lusaka Protocol has been
disappointingly slow and many of the tasks which the parties
themselves agreed to carry out in April, remain unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
On May 2, 918 soldiers from the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) were registered in the quartering
camps, U.N. spokesman Sylvana Fao said.
</P>
<P>
She said the overall registration so far was 27,928 of the
total expected of 60,000.
</P>
<P>
The report said the overall achievement in Angola fell well
short of what the Security Council had been led to expect.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the secretary-general had recommended the
mandate of UNAVEM III to be extended for a period of two months
only, until July 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The mission's mandate will expire on May 8.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Shakes Washington State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A moderate earthquake hit
Washington state Thursday, causing little damage but disrupting a
baseball game, said local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred at 9:04 p.m. Thursday with a magnitude of
5.4 recorded by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey's
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., and 5.3 by the
University of Washington Geophysics Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
It lasted about 30 seconds and was centered near Duvall, about
20 miles northeast of Seattle. Dozens of smaller aftershocks
followed today.
</P>
<P>
In Duvall, a woman fell and bruised her arm during the quake
and power was briefly knocked out in some areas, and some stores
and homes reported items falling off shelves, but no serious
damage or injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The quake halted a Kingdome baseball game between the Seattle
Mariners and the Cleveland Indians in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
The last quake in the state was in January 1995 with a
magnitude of 5.0. However, in 1949, a quake centered near Olympia
registered 7.1 and killed eight people, and in 1965, a quake
measuring 6.5 hit the Seattle-Tacoma area, killing seven.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Officials Meet International Crisis Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Rajko
Kasagic today ruled out handing Serb war crimes suspects to the
Hague-based international tribunal for trial.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with the International Crisis Group today
in the Serb stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo, Kasagic said the
extradition of Serb leaders to stand trial "contradicts our
constitution."
</P>
<P>
Kasagic told reporters that the group, headed by U.S. Senator
George Mitchell, was concerned about helping the implementation of
the peace accords initialed in November 1995, which ended the
three and half year-old war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tanjug news agency, Kasagic noted that one of
the topics at the talks was cooperation with the international
tribunal for war crimes in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he hoped Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his
military leader Ratko Mladic would be extradited in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic and Mladic are on the list of the international war
crime tribunal as war criminals in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The International Crisis Group is an independent and non-profit
organization which aims at helping the reconstruction and
development of Bosnia and the implementation of the Dayton
agreement, Mitchell added.

<HEADLINE> "Tibetan Rights Campaign" Accreditation Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Economic and Social
Council (ECOSOC) today rejected the accreditation of the "Tibetan
Rights Campaign" to the forthcoming second U.N. Conference on
Human Settlement (Habitat II) by a vote of 21 to 15, with 16
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Chinese Deputy Representative to the
U.N. Wang Xuexian criticized the United States for taking up the
settled issue "out of its own political purposes."
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Tibetan Rights Campaign," Wang noted, "is an
organization based on the territory of the United States that
takes splitting Tibet from China as its primary objective."
</P>
<P>
It was precisely for the reason that the ECOSOC last year
rejected accreditation of this organization for participation in
activities related to the Fourth World Women's Conference in
Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ECOSOC decision "is based on the fundamental
principle that no organization whose objective is to sabotage the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states of the
U.N. should be allowed to be involved in activities related to the
U.N."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang pointed out, the Habitat II Secretariat has
stated that it is not in a position to recommend accreditation of
this organization because the primary purpose of this organization
"was either not clearly relevant or seemed to be outside the
substantive scope of the conference."

<HEADLINE> 17th Meeting Of Technical Preparatory Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The 4-day 17th Meeting of the
Technical Preparatory Committee of the Whole ended tonight after
adopting a report and draft resoultions and decisions recommended
for adoption by the 3-day 22nd meeting of the Conference of
Ministers of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) which will
open on May 6, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the meeting noted that in 1995, Africa
experienced for the second consecutive year a modest economic
growth. "Despite the modest recovery of the GDP in 1995, many of
the factors responsible for a weak economic performance in Afirca
over the years, both internal and external, were still at work
and GDP growth was yet to keep pace with population growth, as a
consequence of which per capita income declined by 0.6 percent in
1995," the report added.
</P>
<P>
On the United Nations system-wide special initiative on
Africa, the report said, the special initiative is the UN
system's most significant and largest coordinated action in
support for Africa's development. Its aim was to mobilize
international support for Africa's development through practical
actions, focusing on development priorities identified by the
African countries them- selves.
</P>
<P>
Resolutions and decisions recommended for adoption by the
forthcoming 22nd meeting of the Conference of Ministers include
implementation of the UN new agenda for the development of Africa
in the 1990s, implementation of the programme for the second
industrial development decade for Africa (1993-2002), enhancement
of women's contribution to the implementation of the programme
for the second UN industrial development decade for Africa
(1993-2002), promotion of mineral resources development and
utilization in Africa, promotion of energy resources development
and utilization in Africa, and eight-year intra-African trade
development action plan. enditem

<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua)-- Malawian Vice-President Chakufwa
Chihana has presented his resignations to President Bakili
Muluzi, the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the opposition Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) had
resigned both from the vice-presidency and from his cabinet
portfolios of irrigation and water development to devote himself
to the party work, the state radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Aford National Executive committee had endorsed his
decision Wednesday. No replacement has been announced.
</P>
<P>
Chihana, a famous trade union leader, was appointed
vice-president by Muluzi in mid-1994.
</P>
<P>
Tension began to emerge in December last year when Chihana
accused Muluzi's govenment of corruption, nepotism and tribalism.
however, President Muluzi has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Chihana's resignation will threaten the
fragile tribal alliance forged two years ago after the country's
first multi-party elections in three decades. enditem

<HEADLINE> 1 Billion Pounds Needed for Culling Selected Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke told the cabinet that measures for tackling the BSE
crisis, known as mad cow disease, would cost at least 1 billion
pounds (1.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Clarke told cabinet members that if the money was spent on the
scheme for destroying 15,000 to 20,000 cattle a week, the prospect
of tax cuts in the run-up to the general election scheduled for
next May would be dented, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury expected that around 260 million pounds (390
million dollars) of the cost would be recouped from the European
Union, and next year the net cost was expected to fall to 600
million pounds (900 million dollars), and to 570 million pounds
(855 million dollars) in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said that the cost this year would be met from the
Treasury's 2.5 billion pound (3.75 billion dollar) contingency
reserve, but he made it clear that the unexpected burden on public
finances would mean a tight spending review this summer.

UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Commission of
Sustainable Development today called on governments to promote

<P>
In explaining this appeal, commission chairman Rumen Gechev of

He said the growth contributes to the great increase of energy
demand and in many cities' level of air pollution which can be
actively harmful to human health.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher Due to Rise in Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Stocks moved higher this afternoon
as the U.S. government reported a rise in jobs in April.
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
up 13.72 at 5,511.99, holding steady.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Dow plunged nearly 77 points and broader
indexes tumbled even further as the latest evidence of a surging
economy sent investors running for cover before today's employment
report.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq market -- one of Thursday's biggest losers as
investors secured profits on a powerful rally in technology and
smaller-company shares -- was snapping back with a gain of 13.43
at 1,191.76, regaining almost two-thirds of the previous session's
drop.
</P>
<P>
Other broad-market indicators were positive, but less
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by almost 8 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 280.83 million
shares, about even with Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The AYSE composite index was up 1.43 at 347.64 and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 list was up 3.32 at 646.70. The American Stock
Exchange's market value index was up 1.36 at 590.33.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rose this morning after the Labor Department reported
that the nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.4 percent in
April, the lowest level in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the government reported that the economy as
measured by the gross domestic product surged upward at an annual
rate of 2.8 percent in the first three months of the year. The
news rattled a bond market that had grown increasingly tense in
anticipation of the employment data, which actually proved to be a
calming force in today's trading.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. human rights envoy for former
Yugoslavia Elisabeth Rehn held talks today with deputy head of
Kosovo District Milos Nesovic over the recent situation in Kosovo
Province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Information Secretariat said in a statement that
at their talks held in the provincial capital of Pristina, both
Nesovic and Rehn stressed that all problems had to be resolved
through dialogues within the framework of the existing
constitutional and legal provisions of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Rehn also expressed concern about the recent tragic events in
Kosmet (Kosovo and Metohija) where six people died in ethnic
violence last week.
</P>
<P>
A Serb killed an ethnic Albanian student last week, thinking
the student was stealing his car. Five Serbs, including two
policemen, were killed in ensuing violence.
</P>
<P>
During her second visit to Kosovo in six months, the U.N. envoy
today also toured a hospital and a refugee camp in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Rehn has seen for herself that more than 90 percent of the
patients and more than half the total employment at the health and
medical center in the city are precisely members of the Albanian
national minority, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million population
in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. They have been trying to
secede from Serbia to annex with neighboring Albania. About 150
people have died during sporadic clashes between Serbs and
Albanians in Kosovo since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Rehn is expected to visit Sandzak, a Yugoslav region with a
large Muslim minority that adjoins Bosnia, later today.
