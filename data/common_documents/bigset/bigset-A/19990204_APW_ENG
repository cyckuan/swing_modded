<HEADLINE> FCC Asked To Examine WWF Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal regulators are hearing complaints that  
the World Wrestling Federation went over the line of decency with 
its raucous Super Bowl commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Two TV watchdog groups said Wednesday the commercial should not  
have run Sunday on a program with such wide appeal as the annual 
telecast of the NFL's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	But WWF officials said most people who saw the ad -- including  
officials at Fox Broadcasting Co., which carried the telecast -- 
found nothing offensive about it and said they intend to continue 
running the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert W. Peters, president of the group Morality in Media,  
called the WWF commercial ``one of the most vile commercials ever 
aired on network TV'' even though he conceded he hadn't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Family Association, another group often critical of  
sex and violence on television, told the Federal Communications 
Commission that the ad fell within the agency's definition of 
indecency and should not have run in the early evening as it did on 
Sunday's Super Bowl broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Family Association, which is based in Tupelo,  
Miss., filed a complaint against its local Fox television 
affiliate, WLOV in West Point, Miss., and urged others to file 
similar complaints against their local Fox stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad in question offered a typical ``day at the office'' at  
WWF headquarters in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF wrestler ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin says in the ad that the  
WWF offers ``a nonviolent form of entertainment'' just before he 
slams a folding chair against a passerby. Executives brawled in the 
lobby and office suites in the ad, and bodies shattered glass 
partitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene Roberts and the American Family Association faulted  
showed a a couple in an embrace with the woman's legs wrapped 
around the man's waist as female wrestler Sable walks by saying 
``We never use sex to enhance our image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The spot was a tongue-in-cheek parody,'' said Jim Byrne, a  
marketing executive for the WWF. ``Everything about it was so 
over-the-top that for anyone to interpret it literally is 
interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said most people got the joke. ``There will always be people  
who take themselves way too seriously who are extremely vocal,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to WLOV was referred after office hours to a lawyer in  
Washington, and calls to Fox TV network executives for comment were 
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has authority to fine broadcast license holders like TV  
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Goldstein, chief of the FCC branch that handles such  
complaints, said the agency had received 45 complaints about the ad 
via e-mail through Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters said there probably would have been no complaints about  
the ad had it run in late-night TV when children are not watching. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he was appalled that it was shown during the Super  
Bowl, which typically draws the year's biggest TV audience. ``The 
vast majority of parents wouldn't have any concern about having 
their 2-year-olds watching it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Doping Summit Ends in Disarray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- No matter how hard they tried to  
claim victory, International Olympic Committee leaders couldn't 
disguise the reality: Their authority has eroded even further. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blunt rejection of that leadership, the 15 European Union  
governments refused to accept a watered-down final resolution at 
the Olympic drug summit, which ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their stance was a sharp setback for the IOC and its president,  
Juan Antonio Samaranch, as they struggled to regain credibility in 
the wake of the Salt Lake corruption scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These issues are bigger than the IOC,'' British Sports  
Minister Tony Banks said. ``It might come as a surprise to the IOC 
to find there is actually something bigger than the IOC, but there 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee, the IOC's most important national  
branch and a consistent ally of Samaranch, offered only lukewarm 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	When Samaranch called the meeting a ``big victory'' in the fight  
against doping, USOC executive director Dick Schultz countered: 
``Everybody tends to exaggerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the IOC's first experiences with democracy and  
they had to learn how to deal with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the conference laid the groundwork for major anti-drug  
initiatives, the resolutions fell far short of the tough, immediate 
action the IOC needed to reassert its legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had to back off the two main planks of the meeting:  
creating an international anti-doping agency and imposing a 
mandatory minimum two-year drug sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC is too weak,'' said Roland Baar, a member of the IOC  
athletes' commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a top IOC leader conceded the three-day meeting failed to  
accomplish what the committee had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't dealt with it,'' IOC vice president Dick Pound  
said. ``We are now in a position to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government, which had serious reservations about parts  
of the IOC plan, voted for the revised package. But Barry 
McCaffrey, the White House drug policy adviser who had attacked the 
IOC's credibility and called for reforms, described the final 
declaration only as a ``good first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch fired back at McCaffrey in his closing news  
conference, suggesting the White House was in no position to 
lecture. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very thankful he is so interested in the IOC,''  
Samaranch said. ``But we also told him he had many problems in his 
own country on doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has withstood calls for his resignation from outside  
the committee, and wrapped up the summit by saying the IOC emerged 
``stronger'' from the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But the USOC appeared to back off its previous unqualified  
support for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Schultz said the USOC fully supported Samaranch  
and believed he was the only person capable of leading the IOC out 
of its crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he said:  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any reason to change the position at this point as  
long as we are making progress and moving forward and that he can 
still command the respect of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think our position has changed. I think that we feel  
there needs to be consistency to get through this crisis and that 
he is probably in the best position to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has been in power since 1980 and plans to stay until  
his term ends in 2001. He will put his leadership to a vote of 
confidence at a special IOC assembly March 17-18. IOC members will 
also vote on proposals to change the process for selecting host 
cities and expel members implicated in the Salt Lake case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Morning Herald, whose parent company is a local  
partner of the 2000 Olympics, said Thursday that Samaranch ``must 
carry the ultimate responsibility for crisis that is engulfing the 
Olympic movement. He is not an answer to the problem. He represents 
the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the proposed anti-doping agency will be discussed  
again at a meeting with sports and government leaders this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference agreed to set up the agency, but details on the  
structure, mission and financing were put off for up to three 
months. Officials said the goal is to have the agency up and 
running before the Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks and other government officials refused to give the IOC a  
leading role in the doping agency, which would supervise worldwide 
drug testing and policy on an initial $25 million budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chairing of that independent agency by president Samaranch  
would compromise it,'' Banks, the British Sports Minister, said. 
``It would not be independent. We cannot accept that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said governments could have a 50 percent role in the  
agency -- but would be expected to contribute financially. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also was forced to allow each sport to ignore a minimum  
two-year ban in drug cases where they find ``exceptional 
circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the biggest sports, including soccer, cycling and  
tennis, argued that a two-year ban for a first offense would never 
hold up to challenges under right-to-work laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks warned that this opened an ``enormous loophole.''  
</P>
<P>
	``This is minimalist and permissive,'' he said. ``It undermines  
the two-year ban.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the IOC threatened to expel from the Olympics those  
sports that failed to adopt the two-year ban. Thursday's resolution 
made no mention of expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- USA Today said the son of IOC member Kim Un-yong of South  
Korea was employed by a Utah company, Keystone Communications, at 
the request of the Salt Lake bid committee. Kim is among at least 
three members under investigation by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mark Tewksbury, the 1992 100-meter breaststroke gold medalist  
from Canada, said he was quitting a string of Olympics-related 
positions because he had ``lost confidence in the leadership'' of 
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In a case going back more than 30 years, Japan's largest  
newspaper, Yomiuri, said that Sapporo's bid committee gave $2,800 
each to four IOC members in 1964, apparently to win their votes in 
an unsuccessful bid for the 1968 Winter Games. The Japanese city 
was chosen as the site for the 1972 Winter Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Welch Defends Actions in SLOC Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tom Welch, the man at the center of Salt  
Lake City's Olympic storm, apologized and expressed his sorrow for 
the controversy -- and attempted to spread the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am saddened and dismayed that so many feel the need to  
isolate responsibility for what -- at the time -- were cooperative 
decisions,'' Welch said Wednesday in a ``Dear Friends'' fax to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had our agreed course of action been questioned at the time by  
those to whom we reported, no doubt we would have been pleaded to 
pursue other avenues,'' he said. ``It is ironic that those who were 
so supportive of our efforts to secure the Games now feel the need 
to distance themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His statement, in which he said he was ``very sorry for the  
discomfort and misunderstanding created by this current 
controversy,'' did not name names. However, he and his attorney 
have been doing so in interviews this week, claiming Gov. Mike 
Leavitt, departing Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Frank 
Joklik, Salt Lake Mayor Deedee Corradini, Atlanta Mayor Andrew 
Young and bid committee board members were in the know. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt, Joklik, Corradini and Young have denied knowing about  
the hundreds of thousands of dollars in scholarships, cash payments 
and expensive gifts that went to International Olympic Committee 
members during Salt Lake's bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The expenditures are being investigated by the U.S. Justice  
Department, by ethics panels of SLOC and the U.S. Olympic Committee 
and by Utah Attorney General Jan Graham, who also was on the bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, SLOC said its ethics panel's report will be  
released at a board of trustees meeting next Tuesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, who was chairman of the bid committee, has resigned, but  
remains on the job until he is replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who had been president of SLOC but resigned after being  
charged with spousal abuse in 1997, was stripped Jan. 8 of his 
pension and $10,000-per-month consulting contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Welch confirmed that the bid committee took $50,000 in cash to  
Budapest in June 1995, when the IOC chose Salt Lake, but said it 
was for paying the expenses of hundreds in the Salt Lake 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	He also confirmed an earlier Associated Press report that the  
son of IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga of The Republic of Congo said 
he could influence four or five IOC votes for $30,000 to $35,000 on 
the eve of the 1995 vote in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	--Opponents of the games turned up the heat on Wednesday, saying  
they will not wait for the end of the legislative session before 
launching a petition drive aimed at putting the 2002 Winter Games 
on the 2000 general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Utahns for Responsible Public Spending would need around 125,000  
signatures to get the measure on the ballot. The petition is 
phrased to say that Utah would not guarantee or reimburse the debt 
or obligations of any organization hosting the Olympic Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Olene Walker approved the petition for circulation, but  
said no to Pace's request to circulate it via the Internet and has 
not yet ruled on whether the group can publish the petition as an 
insert in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Michigan congressman is asking the General Accounting Office  
to investigate whether Salt Lake is being rewarded with $150 
million in federal funds to help it stage Olympics it secured by 
shady means. U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, is troubled that 
Salt Lake City may get millions for roads, airport and mass transit 
improvements as well as security and housing. 
</P>
<P>
	--USA Today reported that the son of IOC member Kim Un-yong of  
South Korea was employed by a Utah company, Keystone 
Communications, at the request of the bid committee. It had 
previously been reported that First Security Bank of Utah employed 
two IOC relatives and Keystone one, but the identity of the 
Keystone employee had not been revealed at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today said the arrangement was confirmed Wednesday by David  
Simmons, former chief executive of the satellite television 
broadcast provider. Simmons said he hired Kim's son, Jung Hoon, 
known to him as John Kim, during the early 1990s. He said the man 
worked at company offices in New York City. He said the bid 
committee reimbursed Keystone for a portion of the salary, but he 
declined to say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	--Earlier Wednesday, the elder Kim said he was confident he will  
be exonerated. ``I have a long, bright future spread before me,'' 
he said Wednesday in Yongpyong, South Korea, where he is the chief 
organizer of the Winter Asian Games. He refused to discuss details 
of the case, saying it would ``only intensify internal fights'' 
within the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	--In a new blow to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch,  
rank-and-file IOC members rebelled against plans to strip them of 
voting rights in the selection of Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian IOC member Mario Pescante said 42 IOC members had a  
breakfast meeting with IOC executive board members Wednesday to 
discuss the proposed new voting procedure for the 2006 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	An ``overwhelming majority'' of the members came out against the  
plan, that would ban IOC member visits to the six 2006 candidates 
and proposed that the selection of the host city be made by a 
15-member panel rather than the full IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	--The bribery scandal took a new turn today as officials in the  
Japanese city of Sapporo faced allegations they made payoffs in a 
failed bid for the Winter Games more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper, reported that Sapporo's  
bid committee gave $2,800 each to four IOC members in 1964, 
apparently to win their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	After bidding unsuccessfully for the 1968 games, Sapporo was  
chosen as the site for the 1972 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Skier Lajunen Wins Nordic Combined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAALFELDEN, Austria (AP) -- Olympic silver medalist and former  
World Cup champion Samppa Lajunen of Finland started two seconds 
ahead and finished nearly a minute ahead of everyone in a 
10-kilometer ski race Thursday to win the gold medal in nordic 
combined at the World Junior Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Lajunen took the lead Wednesday in the 90-meter jumping and was  
two seconds ahead of teammate Jouni Kaitainen to start the 10K 
second half of the two-day combined event. He finished 56 seconds 
ahead of Kaitainen, with Switzerland's Andi Hartmann taking the 
bronze by turning in the fastest cross-country time to move up from 
13th place. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Demong of Vermontville, N.Y., 28th after the jumping, moved  
up to 13th place, while Johnny Spillane of Steamboat Springs, 
Colo., 32nd in jumping, finished 19th overall. 
</P>
<P>
	A spot in the first 12 finishers would guarantee a place on the  
World Cup next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it would be tough after the jumping. We were hoping  
for a top-12, and Bill did a great job in coming from way back and 
getting close ... but he just couldn't catch that group,'' said 
U.S. coach Baard Joergen Elden. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 90-meter team jumping event, Austria earned 962.0 points  
to edge second-place Germany (952.5). The United States was 14th in 
the 16-team field. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships will stage the cross-country relays Friday  
before the four-man nordic combined team event is held on Saturday.

	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Hasbro Inc., the second-largest U.S. toy  
company, said Thursday that fourth-quarter profits rose 18 percent 
over the previous year, due partly to strong sales of the popular 
Furby toy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro's earnings for the quarter were $131.8 million, or 98  
cents per share, on revenues of $1.3 billion. During the the same 
period in 1997, the company posted earnings of $111.3 million, or 
82 cents per share, on revenues of $1.13 billion. The 1997 figures 
do not include a $140 million restructuring charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock rose 68 3/4 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.18 3/4  
on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hasbro's record fourth-quarter performance is especially  
significant given the challenging industry and retail environment 
throughout 1998,'' said Hasbro Chairman and CEO Alan G. Hassenfeld 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sold 2 million Furby toys last year, many in the  
weeks just before Christmas, at an estimated retail price of $30 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Results for the entire year were mixed. Full-year profits fell  
from $227.4 million in 1997 to $220 million last year. Earnings per 
share fell from $1.69 to $1.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew to $3.3 billion from $3.19 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Figures for the full year in 1998 did not include a $20 million  
charge to write off research and development costs at MicroProse, 
an entertainment software company. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro said it expects earnings per share growth of greater than  
15 percent in 1999, based partly on the belief that sales will be 
strong for toys connected to the spring release of the movie ``The 
Phantom Menace,'' a new installation in the ``Star Wars'' series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro owns several well-known brands, including Playskool,  
Kenner, Tonka, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, Tiger and Galoob.

<HEADLINE>  Space Mirror Experiment Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- An exotic space mirror expected to flash a beam of  
reflected sunlight down to earth failed to unfold after repeated 
attempts by the Mir space station's crew today, forcing the 
experiment to be called off for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror was supposed to work like a tiny, artificial moon,  
said Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment could also help develop bigger mirrors that could  
be used to illuminate sun-starved cities or light up emergency 
areas to ease rescuers' work. In the more distant future, such 
devices may act as ``solar sails,'' using solar wind to push 
spaceships through space. 
</P>
<P>
	Mir cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergey Avdeyev started the  
experiment by jettisoning a Progress cargo ship, with the mirror 
attached, from the station just after 5 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over an hour later, they sent a remote command to unfold  
the mirror, made of a thin membrane covered by a metal layer. The 
segments of the round, silver flower-like structure unfolded only 
partially, apparently snagging on the cargo ship's antenna. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just stopped, that's it,'' Padalka said as he looked out  
the window at the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	Padalka and Avdeyev then quickly blasted the ship's engines,  
jarring the mirror, and manipulated the antenna. The mirror finally 
unfurled a bit more, but became stuck again, Lyndin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The experiment may be retried on Friday if space experts come up  
with a solution to the problem overnight, he said. So far the cause 
of the glitch was unclear, and if no breakthrough is made, the 
Progress cargo ship and the mirror will be abandoned on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror, 83 feet in diameter, was supposed shine light on a  
spot about 5 miles in diameter in a number of places, provided the 
sky is clear, said Lyndin. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the experiment triggered an avalanche of dramatic  
reports, many of which described the mirror as a ``second moon'' 
that would glare from the skies. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials connected with the experiment said that was not  
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been tormented by the media which simply went mad  
about that, spreading all kind of ridiculous rumors,'' spokeswoman 
Vera Medvedkova said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two cosmonauts were supposed to steer the Progress to hold  
the spot of light steady for about 15 seconds in each area of the 
experiment. Scientists said the mirror would appear to people on 
the ground as only slightly brighter or larger than an ordinary 
star. 
</P>
<P>
	From space, the crew hopes to see a tiny spot of light on the  
earth's surface and will try to film it through Mir's windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The mirror's reflected sunlight was supposed to be visible in  
the German city Bonn and the Czech city Plzen tonight, weather 
permitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanadis Weber, spokeswoman for German Center for Air and Space  
Travel in Cologne, said she believed the experiment was worthwhile 
because ``it will enhance our understanding of solar energy and its 
use for propelling spacecraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before reaching Bonn and Plzen, the mirror was supposed to also  
illuminate the city of Aktyubinsk in Kazakstan and Saratov in 
Russia as well as cities in Belarus and Ukraine. But the future of 
the experiment was uncertain because of today's difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	After the experiment is completed, the mirror, along with the  
garbage-filled cargo ship will be allowed to burn up in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia ran a similar experiment six years ago, but the crew then  
didn't try to maneuver the mirror and it was barely visible only to 
those who knew its exact position.

<HEADLINE> Puckett Shines on Austria Race Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Stephan Eberharter and Werner Franz  
treated it like a race. Casey Puckett wishes it had been. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett, the Crested Butte, Colo., product better known as a  
slalom skier, dazzled a sun-splashed crowd by finishing fifth out 
of starting position 45 in Thursday's men's downhill training 
session in the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Eberharter and Franz earned starting spots in Saturday's  
downhill, conducting their training performances in a race 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Eberharter tied teammate Hans Knauss, winner of the famed  
Hahnenkamm downhill two weeks ago at Kitzbuehel, Austria, for the 
fastest time, 1 minute, 40.12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Kristian Ghedina, who won last year's debut race on the  
Birds of Prey course, showed he's a contender for a World 
Championships gold medal by placing third, .01 seconds back. 
Hermann Maier was fourth in 1:40.47, .17 ahead of Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
	The most gratifying thing about Puckett's run was that the  
Austrians, the top team in the world, went all out because racers 
were skiing for one of the four spots available in the field 
Saturday. On Wednesday, racers were testing equipment and racing 
lines, and some of the times were suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of sandbagging yesterday, so this is pretty  
cool,'' Puckett said. ``There were a lot of places I could have 
made up time, so I'm pretty psyched. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt a little bit out of control at a couple of spots where  
I thought I was about to lose it, but I held strong and kept 
rolling my skis down the hill,'' Puckett said. ``It was coming at 
me a lot quicker today than it did yesterday'' when he was 17th in 
the first training session. ``I had some hard landings and hurt my 
knee a little -- not hurt, but my knee aches a little. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my kind of course. There's a lot of difficult turns on  
the top and I think I really nailed a couple. And then there's a 
lot of speed in the middle that I'm not exactly comfortable with 
because of my lack of experience in downhill. But I've jumped all 
my life and I'm having a blast on those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eberharter confirmed that this was no waltz down the mountain  
for the Austrians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a race for me today. I didn't hold anything back,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My expectations before the training were pretty low. I said to  
myself, `If it's not working today, I have another (medal) chance 
in the giant slalom next Friday, so take it easy.' Maybe it worked 
that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eberharter and Franz went through two agonizing days of  
qualifying to get into the Olympics last winter, and both were 
devastated when they couldn't make the lineup. Franz, a downhill 
specialist, didn't get to race at all. Eberharter faltered in his 
specialty, the super-G, but salvaged his Olympics by winning silver 
in the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Austrian team made it much, much better because we had  
only one day to qualify and in Nagano we had two days. I don't 
think that was the best way,'' Eberharter said. ``You have one race 
(in training) and then you can concentrate on the original race and 
then you don't get burned out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victimized by Austria's race before the race was Andreas  
Schifferer, the defending World Cup downhill champion and winner of 
the second Birds of Prey downhill a year ago. He was sixth, missing 
a spot in the starting field Saturday by .53 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Immigrants Found in Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Eleven Chinese immigrants found in a  
ship's cargo container were detained Thursday after federal 
officials received a tip about possible smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were aboard the Hanjin Beijing, which sailed from Taiwan  
with a stopover in Hong Kong. They were healthy despite living 
inside the cargo container for about two weeks, Coast Guard 
spokesman Lt. Dan Deptula said. 
</P>
<P>
	The immigrants are likely to be deported unless they state a  
fear of political persecution, which would trigger a hearing before 
an immigration judge, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hanjin Beijing is registered in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Lynx Released in Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH FORK, Colo. (AP) -- The Canadian lynx padded fluidly --  
almost gliding -- on giant, snowshoe-like paws across a snowfield 
into a canopy of trees. It was, for Gene Byrne, his crowning 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't get many memorable moments like this in a career,''  
the wildlife biologist said after watching the cat -- one of two 
released Wednesday -- run from the cage that had been her home for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long trip. We've been working on this for 26  
years, 10 of them intensively. I'm happy to see them running in the 
woods of Colorado at last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four hours later, a pilot monitoring the radio collars on the  
cats said they had moved less than a mile. Wildlife officials said 
that wasn't unusual because the animals are usually more active at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more lynx were to be released today, part of a state and  
federal effort to put as many as 110 back on the Colorado terrain 
that was their home before ski areas, hunting, homes and other 
development drove the secretive animals away. 
</P>
<P>
	The reintroduction is part of a national campaign to restore  
native species to public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people want all of our natives species back on  
the public lands,'' said Kim Vogel of the U.S. Forest Service. She 
said federal agencies now have enough expertise on the issues to 
avoid placing unnecessary restrictions on ranchers, farmers or 
outdoorsmen to protect the lynx. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes were raised in the case of the lynx when the  
Environmental Liberation Front claimed it set fires causing $12 
million in damage at the Vail ski area last October. Activists 
oppose Vail's expansion plans, saying they will destroy lynx 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The last lynx spotted in Colorado was just outside the ski area  
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday morning, 9,200 feet high in the aspen and spruce of  
the San Juan Mountains, state Division of Wildlife staff released 
the two females in a remote site 130 miles from the nearest major 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx were trapped in British Columbia and trucked 1,700  
miles to southern Colorado. Officials chose a broad, open space on 
private land near the Rio Grande National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife officer Bill Andree, flanked by about two dozen  
journalists and biologists, set a metal cage containing a sleek 
wildcat with tufted ears on a 6-inch layer of snow. Then he 
unlocked the door. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're free,'' Andree whispered to the 3-year-old cat  
nicknamed No. 7. He stood back and waited in the bright, midmorning 
sunshine. No. 7, which arrived in Colorado last week, remained 
crouched on a grass bed in the cage for a little more than five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Andree and Byrne tilted the cage forward gently and the  
lynx stepped out on the snow, looked around wide-eyed for another 
minute or so and bounded into the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	When Andree and Byrne opened the cage for the second lynx,  
nicknamed No. 9, she darted quickly toward the forest and the 
13,000-foot snowy peaks towering in the background as the crowd 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they have to find a place to make a living,'' Byrne said.

<HEADLINE> Dierdorf Out at ABC Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
      *AP Sports Writer b6 NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC decided last year to stick    	
with Dan Dierdorf instead of hiring John Madden for its  
high-profile ``Monday Night Football'' announcing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season the network will have neither analyst.  
</P>
<P>
	Dierdosf said Thursday that he is leaving his job at ABC after  
12 years. Al Michaels is now the only announcer who has been in the 
ABC booth for more than one season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, ABC Sports informed my representatives at The  
Marquee Group that no substantial offer to extend my contract would 
be forthcoming,'' Dierdorf's statement said. ``Therefore, Sunday's 
broadcast of the Pro Bowl will be my last for ABC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf's departure had been speculated for months as ABC  
seemed unwilling to renew his $1.75 million a year contract. 
Dierdorf came under heavy criticism this season as he struggled to 
mesh with newcomer Boomer Esiason in ABC's three-man booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a very talented broadcaster, who earned the respect,  
admiration and friendship of everyone with whom he worked at ABC 
Sports,'' said Brian McAndrews, executive vice president and 
general manager of ABC Sports. ``We wish him luck in his future 
endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel said ``it would be premature to  
discuss our plans for next season.'' But with most top analysts 
locked up at other networks, it is expected ABC will shift someone 
from cable partner ESPN to the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Sterling Sharpe's name has been mentioned the most. But ABC may  
be hesitant to team two inexperienced game analysts, especially in 
a year in which it has the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney could also decide to move one of ESPN's Sunday night  
analysts -- Paul Maguire or Joe Theismann -- to ABC and plug Sharpe 
into the cable slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Or it could team Esiason and Michaels in a two-man booth, which  
has been done only once before when Michaels and Frank Gifford 
teamed in 1986 -- one year before Dierdorf came on board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michaels-Dierdrof-Gifford team was together for 11 years  
before ABC replaced Gifford with Esiason last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf might have trouble ending up at another network for the  
upcoming season. Fox has no apparent openings and ESPN is run by 
the same people who ousted Dierdorf at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS could shift No. 2 analyst Randy Cross to the studio and team  
Dierdorf with Verne Lundquist. But CBS seems unwilling to shuffle 
its top announcing teams to make room for Dierdorf, who began his 
network career at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this point, CBS has not expressed an interest in Dan  
Dierdorf,'' CBS Sports spokeswoman LeslieAnne Wade said.

<HEADLINE> Working Dads Fight for Family Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were snide comments and many, many jokes.  
And when Maryland state trooper Kevin Knussman won his four-year 
legal fight this week against the bosses who denied him parental 
leave, only a couple of colleagues called to congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman's victory highlights the rights of working fathers to  
take time off with their babies. But his isolation shows how 
balancing a job and a family remains a silent struggle for many 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of the progress is still going on underground,'' says  
James Levine, a leading researcher on fatherhood and co-author of 
the book ``Working Fathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing -- often with reason -- that they'll be labeled slackers,  
fathers cobble together sick days and vacation time to create leave 
time after a baby is born. When they want to go to a school play, 
they dash for the door, under cover of attending a ``late 
meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ben, a New York city money manager and father of a 3-month-old,  
carefully left his computer on and his desk lamp lit not too long 
ago when he took his wife to the hospital for a sonogram. ``It made 
it look like I was still there,'' said Ben, who refused to be 
further identified, fearing for his career. ``Plus, it made me feel 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, attitudes have changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked 15 years ago how much unpaid parental leave time was  
reasonable for men to take, 63 percent of business leaders at large 
companies said, ``none.'' Even 40 percent of executives at 
companies with a parental leave policy at the time nixed the idea 
of actually using it, according to Catalyst, a non-profit group 
that studies women in business. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, half a million men take some sort of parental leave each  
year to care for a new child, under the auspices of the 1993 
federal Family and Medical Leave Act. That compares with 1.4 
million women. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 20 million people have taken leave under the federal  
law, which says all employers with 50 or more workers must allow up 
to 12 unpaid weeks off to care for a new baby or seriously ill 
family member. The law also allows workers to use sick time and 
vacation so they can get paid during their leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman, a helicopter paramedic, sued the state police after he  
was denied 12 weeks paid leave following the birth of his daughter 
in 1994. He was given 10 paid days off, but sought more time 
because his wife experienced childbirth complications. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a jury awarded him $375,000 in damages for mental  
anguish, in the first sex discrimination case under the Family 
Leave act. Attorneys for the state police said they may appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a presumption that women are going to be the  
primary caretaker,'' said Sara Mandelbaum, an American Civil 
Liberties Union lawyer who represented Knussman. ``Those attitudes 
are hard to change, especially in a male-dominated organization 
like the state police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies do encourage fathers to take parental leaves --  
and more men are taking them. AT&AMP;T offers new parents up to a year, 
unpaid, with a guaranteed job upon return. About one man takes 
advantage of the program for every 18 women. That's up from a 
1-to-400 ratio a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Nathanson, an AT&AMP;T computer analyst, says his co-workers  
and bosses fully supported his decision to take nine months 
parental leave in 1996. ``There was never any grief about this,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for other men, obstacles, both perceived and real, prevent  
their making use of work-family programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only do men fear career trouble or teasing if they openly  
make family a priority, but they feel, sometimes rightly so, that 
work-family progams are mainly pitched to women. 
</P>
<P>
	Money also plays a role. A few companies, including Merrill  
Lynch and the software maker Lotus Development Corp., offer paid 
leaves for men. But most don't, and since men are major 
breadwinners, it's hard for them to take unpaid time off. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathanson and his wife, for example, both felt strongly that one  
parent should be home with their daughter for a year. Since she 
earns two-thirds of the household income, he stayed home. 
``Financially, I wasn't burned by the fact that if I took off, 
there goes the family income,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, many men choose to do what they can, when they can.  
Clark Adams, chief executive officer of Needham, Mass.-based 
Mulberry Child Care Centers, says fathers pick up or drop off 25 
percent of children at the company's 55 centers daily, and more are 
serving on parent advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Knussman is glad he took a stand. After he filed his  
suit, the state police gave him a full 12 paid weeks off following 
the birth of his second child. 
</P>
<P>
	``Biting the hand that feeds you is never easy,'' he said by  
telephone as his daughters giggled in the background. But taking 
three months off was ``just a great, great time. I will never, ever 
regret that.''

<HEADLINE> ETrade Experiences Online Glitches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Software troubles plagued online brokerage  
ETrade for a second straight day Thursday, enraging investors who 
were unable to buy or sell stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's woes added fuel to a new inquiry into the booming  
Internet brokerage industry by New York state's attorney general. 
Citing a wave of complaints about system crashes, delayed trades 
and constant busy signals, Eliot Spitzer's office has asked a 
number of online trading firms to provide reports on their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	While most online brokerages experience snarls during especially  
busy trading days, ETrade's trouble had nothing to do with system 
capacity or heavy volume, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	New software installed Tuesday night malfunctioned Wednesday  
morning, knocking out the trading function for 75 minutes. About 5 
percent of ETrade's customers were unable to trade electronically 
throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The system functioned normally for the first half-hour of  
trading Thursday before crashing again at about 10 a.m. EST. Some 
service was restored within an hour, and the system was entirely 
fixed within two hours, said Lisa Nash, vice president for customer 
management at the Palo Alto, Calif., brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade brokers were able to fill telephone orders, but many  
callers experienced lengthy delays, even as ETrade put more staff 
members onto telephone detail. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade also set up a special e-mail address to handle customer  
complaints. Nash said the company had received more than 1,500 
messages as of Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Many angry investors turned to Internet chat rooms to disparage  
ETrade. Dubbing the brokerage EtrytoTrade or ETrash, many 
threatened to move their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Crisci, an ETrade customer who trades over the Internet  
several times a week, said he is frustrated enough to look into 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is both a legal and implied trust or contract to  
provide uninterrupted services during market hours,'' he said. 
Crisci said he lost money Wednesday when the system outage 
prevented him from canceling an order to buy stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer, who took office in January, released a statement  
saying: ``The public knows that there are always risks involved in 
investing in the stock market. But part of that risk should not 
include questions about whether trades will be executed promptly or 
whether online brokerage firms can deliver on the services that 
they've promised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer's office has asked several online brokerages to provide  
information on their operations, but a spokesman wouldn't name the 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry follows a stream of warnings in recent weeks from  
state and federal securities regulators, who have urged online 
investors to use caution and be prepared for possible delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission, issued a warning to ordinary investors. 
Thursday, four Democratic lawmakers commended Levitt's effort and 
asked him to brief them on electronic trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the burgeoning industry, ETrade currently ranks third in  
volume behind Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and Waterhouse Investor 
Services, and third in accounts behind Schwab and Fidelity 
Investments. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most recent fiscal quarter, ETrade handled 2.8 million  
total transactions, up from 1.6 million in the same period of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors punished ETrade's stock for the second straight day,  
sending its shares down $1.75, or 3 percent, to $53.50 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade fared better on the market than several of its  
competitors, however. National Discount Brokers Group fell $8.62 1/2, 
or 23 percent, to close at $29 on the New York Stock Exchange, and 
Ameritrade Holding Corp. tumbled $17.81 1/4, or 14 percent, to close 
at $110.75 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab, which does less of its business online, fell $1.50 to  
close at $66.50 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade said it will handle complaints on a case-by-case basis,  
but wouldn't say whether it plans to mollify customers with offers 
of free transactions or any other reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are vocal, but they are fair,'' Nash said. ``We know they  
are very frustrated when they can't place a trade.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Text of Anti-Doping Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the resolution adopted Thursday at the end of the World  
Conference on Doping in Sport: 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that doping practices contravene sport and medical  
ethics, and that they constitute violations of the rules 
established by the Olympic Movement, and concerned by the threat 
that doping poses to the health of athletes and youth in general; 
</P>
<P>
	Recognizing that the fight against doping in sport is the  
concern of all: the Olympic Movement and other sports 
organizations, governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations, sportsmen and sportswomen throughout the world, and 
their entourage; 
</P>
<P>
	The World Conference on Doping in Sport, with the participation  
of representatives of governments, of intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations, of the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC), the international sports federations (IFs), the 
National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and of the athletes, declares: 
</P>
<P>
	1. Education, prevention and athletes' rights  
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic oath shall be extended to coaches and other  
officials, and shall include the respect of integrity, ethics and 
fair play in sport. Educational and preventive campaigns will be 
intensified, focusing principally on youth, and athletes and their 
entourage. Complete transparency shall be assured in all activities 
to fight doping, except for preserving the confidentiality 
necessary to protect fundamental rights of athletes. Partnership 
with the media shall be sought in anti-doping campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code  
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code is accepted as the basis  
for the fight against doping, which is defined as the use of an 
artifice, whether substance or method, potentially dangerous to 
athletes' health and/or capable of enhancing their performances, or 
the presence in the athlete's body of a substance, or the 
ascertainment of the use of a method on the list annexed to the 
Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code applies to all athletes,  
coaches, instructors, officials and to all medical and paramedical 
staff working with athletes or treating athletes participating in 
or training for sports competitions organized within the framework 
of the Olympic Movement. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Sanctions  
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions which apply to doping violations will be imposed  
in the framework of controls both during and out of competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	In accordance with the wishes of the athletes, the NOCs and a  
large majority of the IFs, the minimum required sanction for major 
doping substances or prohibited methods shall be a suspension of 
the athlete from all competition for a period of two years for a 
first offense. However, based on specific, exceptional 
circumstances to be evaluated in the first instance by the 
competent IF bodies, there may be a provision for a possible 
modification of the two-year sanction. Additional sanctions or 
measures may be applied. More severe sanctions shall apply to 
trainers and officials guilty of violations of the Olympic Movement 
Anti-Doping Code. 
</P>
<P>
	4. International Anti-Doping Agency  
</P>
<P>
	An independent International Anti-Doping Agency shall be  
established so as to be fully operational for the Games of the 
XXVII Olympiad in Sydney in 2000. This institution will have as its 
mandate, notably, to coordinate the various programs necessary to 
realize the objectives that shall be defined jointly by all the 
parties concerned. Among these programs, consideration should be 
given in particular to expanding out-of-competition testing, 
coordinating research, promoting preventive and educational actions 
and harmonizing scientific and technical standards and procedures 
for analyses and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	A working group representing the Olympic Movement, including the  
athletes, as well as the governments and intergovernmental 
organizations concerned, will meet, on the initiative of the IOC, 
within three months, to define the structure, mission and financing 
of the Agency. The Olympic Movement commits to allocate a capital 
of $25 million to the Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Responsibilities of the IOC, the IFs, the NOCs and the CAS.  
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, the IFs and the NOCs will maintain their respective  
competence and responsibility to apply doping rules in accordance 
with their own procedures, and in cooperation with the 
International Anti-Doping Agency. Consequently, decisions handed 
down in the first instance will be under the exclusive 
responsibility of the IFs, the NOCs, or, during the Olympic Games, 
the IOC. With regard to last instance appeals, the IOC, the IFs and 
the NOCs recognize the authority of the Court of Arbitration for 
Sport (CAS), after their own procedures have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to protect athletes and their rights in the area of  
disciplinary procedure, the general principles of law, such as the 
right to a hearing, the right to legal assistance, and the right to 
present evidence and call witnesses, will be confirmed and 
incorporated into all applicable procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	6. Collaboration between the Olympic Movement and public  
authorities 
</P>
<P>
	The collaboration in the fight against doping between sports  
organizations and public authorities shall be reinforced according 
to the responsibilities of each party. Together they will also take 
action in the areas of education, scientific research, social and 
health measures to protect the athletes, and coordination of 
legislation relative to doping.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Weighs Big Ten Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- There's more at stake than just 111  
years of football independence Friday when Notre Dame's trustees 
decide whether to go ahead with negotiations to join the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision affects millions of dollars in bowl and TV  
revenues, recruiting and academics, among other things. More 
importantly, Notre Dame's status as the national, Catholic American 
university could be forever altered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame's identity nationally is so linked to football that  
people worry if the football program were restricted from a 
national schedule to a regional schedule, that would have an impact 
on the identity,'' said Notre Dame professor Gregory Sterling, who 
favors the move. ``This is touching the nerve center of the 
university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the decision affects far more than the football  
team, how the Big Ten would affect the future of the Irish legacy, 
which includes 11 national championships and greats like Knute 
Rockne and Frank Leahy, is of utmost concern to most with ties to 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're really addressing here is the extent to  
which the athletic department is advanced or not by virtue of our 
football program changing its status,'' said athletic director Mike 
Wadsworth, who played football for the Irish in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	As an independent, Notre Dame takes home every cent of its gate  
receipts, all of proceeds from bowl payouts and an estimated $7 
million a year in its exclusive TV contract with NBC, which is 
expected to jump to $8 million a year for the 2000-2005 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But as a member of the Big Ten, it would enter a revenue sharing  
program that splits up a portion of each school's gate receipts 
from football and basketball, bowl revenues, TV contracts and 
proceeds from the NCAA basketball tournaments, Big Ten commissioner 
Jim Delany said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether you're up or you're down, those bowl  
revenues are there,'' Delany said. ``Whether you in the Rose Bowl 
or not, you get the money. Whether you're on ESPN or not, you get 
money. So, basically it's a shared risk, shared upside, shared 
downside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should the trustees, meeting in London to dedicate a new Notre  
Dame facility there, decide to proceed with talks to join the 
conference, school and Big Ten officials will still have to decide 
several issues. But Delany anticipates no problems to resolve those 
``competitive and financial issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be disappointing if they're not interested in taking the  
next step,'' Delany said. ``It's somewhat implicit that when we 
decided to contact Notre Dame as the first institution to talk to, 
that we felt they would be the best fit for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Problem is, an overwhelming majority of Notre Dame alumni don't  
think the Irish are a good fit for the Big Ten, in part because the 
decision has academic implications as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame, known for its undergraduate programs, trails far  
behind the Big Ten schools in research and graduate programs. Some 
see joining the Big Ten as a way to improve those programs because 
conference affiliation also includes membership in the Committee on 
Institutional Cooperation, the academic arm of the Big Ten that 
includes all 11 conference schools and the University of Chicago. 
It allows the schools to share resources freely. 
</P>
<P>
	But some also see that as a threat to Notre Dame's Catholic  
identity, especially in a conference of secular schools, and some 
Big Ten presidents have grumbled privately that Notre Dame's weak 
graduate programs are not a good fit for the Big Ten, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our brand name is something special. We'd rather be one of one  
than one of 12,'' said Chuck Lennon, executive director of the 
Alumni Association. ``Not that we're better than anybody. We're 
different, and I think that's important because there is a very 
positive feeling about the quality of the Big Ten academically and 
athletically, but it just is not the right mix for us.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Opening Night Arrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the first time in 291 days, there will be run-of-the-mill  
NBA games. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening night has finally arrived, and a new era begins.  
</P>
<P>
	No Michael Jordan. No Phil Jackson. No Dennis Rodman -- at least  
we're pretty sure on that last one. 
</P>
<P>
	The dynasty from Chicago that won those six championships this  
decade is gone. Everyone else has a better chance now, but they'll 
only have 13 weeks and 50 games to show it before the playoffs 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Let the tainted season begin.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in basketball and in other sports like to build it  
up and tear it down, but that's not what we're trying to do,'' said 
Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, the longest tenured coach in the NBA as he 
begins his 14th season tonight. ``We've got a bunch of quality 
players together, and they've played together for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan's team, including Karl Malone, John Stockton and Jeff  
Hornacek, won't recognize many of the fellows in the Bulls uniforms 
when Utah plays Chicago. Only Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown 
and Bill Wennington remain from last year's playoff roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach has changed, too, with Tim Floyd replacing Phil  
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers made the Bulls the biggest underdogs of the night,  
installing Utah as a 15-point favorite, and Jazz fans will come 
ready to mock the remnants of one of the sport's greatest teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to boo us as soon as we get off the airplane,''  
said Harper, the only remaining starter from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	They might boo them in Chicago, too, once the fans in that city  
fully comes to grips with the dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
	It's be a brighter picture elsewhere tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	The schedule has Washington at Indiana, Philadelphia at  
Charlotte, Cleveland at Atlanta, Detroit at Miami, Toronto at 
Boston, New York at Orlando, Sacramento at San Antonio, Minnesota 
at Denver, Dallas at Seattle, Houston at the Los Angeles Lakers and 
Phoenix at the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Busy nights will be commonplace in the NBA this season as teams  
squeeze all their games into just 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important to start with a little more urgency and  
get some wins early on,'' Phoenix Suns coach Danny Ainge said. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen is how the fans will respond.  
</P>
<P>
	When the baseball strike ended in 1995, the backlash from the  
public was fierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime fans stopped going to games, casual fans stopped  
watching on TV and a trio of New Yorkers even ran onto the field at 
Shea Stadium and threw $1 bills at the players, a la Abbie 
Hoffman's famous protest on the floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is quite certain how any fan backlash might manifest  
itself in the NBA, but the league has been taking steps to mend 
fences with its paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to do some damage control, I guess. Personally, I  
don't think free tickets and autograph sessions are gonna do it. I 
think that's kind of phony,'' Grant Hill told the Detroit Free 
Press. ``I think the best way to do it is to go out and play hard 
and win. I think you'll see -- and the cities that win, the cities 
that are in the playoffs -- the fans will come back. And the cities 
that have losing teams, they'll be a little lukewarm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there's one factor that may draw them back more than anything  
else, it's the heightened competition that comes with every game 
meaning a little bit more and every team having a little more of a 
chance in the post-Jordan era. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the true NBA fans are going to be the ones who  
obviously were disappointed with the lockout, but are just very, 
very happy that we're back to playing,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van 
Gundy said. ``What they want to see is good play, hard play, 
competitive play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks fans have already taken a liking to the team's newest  
scorer, former Golden State guard Latrell Sprewell, who will be 
playing his first regular season game in more than 14 months when 
the Knicks play the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz are widely being picked as the favorite to come out of  
the West, but the competition will be tougher now that Scottie 
Pippen has joined Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich scoffed when somebody pointed out  
that his frontcourt has three Hall of Famers, while his backcourt 
is comprised of considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have three superstars in the lineup at one time is not  
easy. There is only one basketball, so we have to have some guys 
who will make sacrifices and be program players,'' Tomjanovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next 90 days, and they will be hectic days, will determine  
who makes the playoffs and tries to succeed the Bulls as champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season carries a blemish, but the playoffs will be  
the same. The only difference is that the postseason will start two 
weeks later than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do win a championship,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said,  
``I don't think anyone should put an asterisk on the side and say 
it wasn't a full season and Michael wasn't playing.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Skeptical of Clinton on Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eventually, Congress is going to have to agree  
to close unneeded military bases -- but Republicans may not trust 
President Clinton with the keys. 
</P>
<P>
	That, and the built-in political resistance to shutdowns that  
hurt back home, loom as obstacles to his effort to start two new 
sets of base closings, targets to be selected later, in 2001 and 
2005. He wants legislation to renew the commission system that has 
produced nearly 100 base closings in the past decade under a sort 
of no-fault plan that provides insurance against a political 
backlash and avoids the congressional pressures that once prevented 
shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican grudge is over a loophole Clinton used to  
advantage in deflecting two politically-sensitive shutdown 
decisions in 1995, as he prepared for his re-election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	It is supposed to be an all-or-nothing process. A commission  
lists the bases to be closed or cut back, for Congress and the 
president to accept or reject, but not to change. Clinton signed 
off on closing them, but then kept operations going at bases near 
Sacramento, Calif., and San Antonio, Texas, by ordering a shift 
from the military to civilian contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	There were Republican reminders of that when Secretary of  
Defense William S. Cohen took the administration case for base 
closings to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner of Virginia, new chairman of the Senate Armed  
Services Committee, told Cohen on Wednesday that he recognizes the 
need, but isn't ready to commit to the new rounds the Pentagon 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to revisit what happened, that's history,'' he  
said. ``But we really have to determine whether or not we can make 
a politically bulletproof bill to avoid what happened -- and you 
know what I'm talking about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue has been politicized,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts of  
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of trust in the last go-around,'' GOP Rep.  
James Hansen of Utah told Cohen the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Both said they agreed with the process. The skepticism is about  
Clinton's handling of it, 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget seeks new base closing rounds in 2001 and 2005.  
It does not say how many bases, or which ones. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be left to a new Base Realignment and Closure  
Commission, BRACE in the Pentagon and congressional acronym. The 
Pentagon recommends bases for closing or curtailment, and the 
bipartisan commission makes the choices -- taking the political heat 
off Congress and the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress still is coping with the impact of prior rounds.  
The 1995 dispute aside, there is built-in resistance to yielding 
the economic benefits of military bases back home, among Democrats 
as well as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said prior closings and cuts, affecting nearly 250 bases,  
will save $14 billion, and avoid spending of about $5.6 billion a 
year after 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	By administration estimate, it will take further cuts of about  
10 percent in U.S. bases in the United States to fit trimmed, 
post-Cold War military forces and budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the money is essential, and while Congress could  
delay base cutbacks, ``at some point in time they're going to be 
faced with a real, critical choice'' because old bases are taking 
funds needed for new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new rounds he seeks, Cohen said, the Pentagon would  
save $20 billion on bases, plus $3 billion a year. ``That will come 
into play in the year 2008 to 2015, that's when all of those 
systems we're buying now have to be paid for,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is a politically sensitive issue, a tough vote, even with  
the commission as a buffer, choosing the bases to shut. And the 
lingering resentment of Clinton's intercession last time will make 
this time more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	For Congress, it also is a blind draw, because there is no list  
of the bases that might be marked for closings or cuts. Roberts 
said there ought to be at least a general description so that 
everybody wouldn't be left in ``BRAC purgatory.''

<HEADLINE> Committee Won't Appeal Quota Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- School officials will not ask the Supreme Court to  
overturn a ruling against its race-based admissions policy at 
prestigious Boston Latin School for fear a negative outcome could 
damage affirmative action programs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a case that would be isolated to Boston,'' school  
Superintendent Thomas Payzant told The Boston Globe after the vote 
Wednesday. ``The whole country would have to live with the 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous decision came two months after the board voted to  
appeal a Nov. 19 ruling by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 
which found that an admissions policy used to boost minority 
enrollment at the nation's oldest public secondary school was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The disputed policy required half the students be selected  
solely on entrance exam scores and grades, with the remaining slots 
to be weighted by race considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's reversal came after consultations with civil  
rights leaders, said chairwoman Elizabeth Reilinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Those leaders advised that the Supreme Court might rule against  
the city, which could hurt race-based primary- and secondary-school 
admissions policies throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Legal Defense fund of the NAACP certainly was very strong  
in their encouragement of us not to appeal, as were a number of 
civil rights organizations,'' Reilinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court in May reversed a lower court's decision that  
upheld Boston Latin's argument for having a race-based policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal challenge was brought by Sarah Wessmann, a white  
student who claims she was denied admission to the school in favor 
of less-qualified minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to consider any appeal of public  
school affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's decision will not change the admission policy  
for next year's classes at Boston Latin and the city's two other 
examination schools, While the case was pending, the committee 
decided to stop considering race in its admissions process. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said it will begin working toward revising its exam  
school admissions policies so they will promote the city's goal of 
diversity and withstand potential court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous Boston Latin alumni include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Cotton  
Mather and Ben Franklin.

<HEADLINE> `Charlie Brown' Still a Good Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bless the little round-headed boy. He never  
gives up. Maybe that's why 30 years later, ``You're a Good Man, 
Charlie Brown'' remains a modest but appealing show, a gentle paean 
to persistence guaranteed to cheer the hardest heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that ``Charlie Brown'' is exactly what it was in 1967 when  
the musical revue opened off-Broadway for a marathon four-year run. 
Director Michael Mayer has tinkered and tugged on the material and 
quickened the pace of this version now playing at Broadway's 
Ambassador Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer has also assembled a splendid cast, six performers who  
have a real talent for playing the characters created by Charles M. 
Schulz in his legendary comic strip ``Peanuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulz's little crew, whether read in newspapers or watched on  
television specials, are old friends for a lot of us fans of the 
funnies. We are protective of them. Yet these actors satisfy our 
sense of the familiar while bringing something surprising to their 
interpretations. They can be childlike without being childish, not 
an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the character of Sally Brown, Charlie's little sister,  
who was not in the original but has been added to this production. 
As played by the scene-stealing Kristin Chenoweth, she projects a 
fierce loony logic that children will understand and adults will 
wish they could emulate. Chenoweth, all blond curls and kewpie-doll 
voice, doesn't let a joke get past her. 
</P>
<P>
	Is there anyone who doesn't identify with Charlie Brown, bruised  
and battered by life and a bevy of highly critical friends? The lad 
retains our sympathy because he always tries to do the right thing. 
Anthony Rapp perfectly captures his wide-eyed earnestness that 
somehow survives his lack of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	These are no self-esteem problems with Snoopy, a hedonistic  
hound whose main concerns seem to be eating and sleeping. Roger 
Bart delivers a sly, impish performance. Bart is a superb physical 
comedian as well, turning Snoopy into a more gleefully athletic 
canine than one remembers in the original. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilana Levine, as the professional termagant Lucy, does crabby to  
nerve-shattering perfection. B.D. Wong's Linus, Lucy's 
blanket-dependent brother, is cheerfully professorial, eager to 
overexplain everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Wayne Mathis's ingratiating smile may be at odds with  
the sobriety of the piano-playing Schroeder, but he cuts loose in 
one of the more sparkling new songs, ``Beethoven Day,'' a hymn to 
his favorite composer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie Brown'' is a form of entertainment Broadway hasn't  
seen much of in recent years -- a revue. It used to be a staple in 
less-demanding days before the advent of television. If one sketch 
wasn't terrific, another would come along in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the case here, although author Clark Gesner, who wrote  
the sketches, music and lyrics, has a pretty high batting average. 
And some of them -- the book report on Peter Rabbit and Snoopy's 
hymn to ``Suppertime,'' for example -- remain fresh and funny no 
matter now many times you hear them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer and set designer David Gallo have framed the show in a  
proscenium of yellowed newspapers. The bold bright colors of the 
set, large cutouts of simple objects such as a tree, a dog house or 
a bench, give the feeling of a comic strip come to life. 
</P>
<P>
	That's another reason why this show has been so successful over  
the past three decades. ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' has 
remained remarkably faithful to its original, often inspired 
source.

<HEADLINE> Slain Gay Student's Parents Comment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- The parents of a gay college student who  
died after he was pistol-whipped, robbed and lashed to a fence on 
the Wyoming prairie say they don't want his death exploited by 
activists for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very frightening concept as a parent that your son now  
becomes a martyr, a public figure for the world,'' Judy Shepard 
told ``Dateline NBC'' for a story scheduled to air Friday. ``He's 
just our son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Shepard was found Oct. 7 tied to a fence outside the  
University of Wyoming college town of Laramie, 40 miles west of 
Cheyenne. He died five days later in a Colorado hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the 21-year-old was attacked, in part, because he  
was homosexual. Some gay advocacy groups have invoked the case in 
seeking harsher sentences for people convicted of crimes that 
involve bias against the victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyoming is one of nine states without bias crimes legislation. A  
move to pass a hate crimes bill was defeated Wednesday by a 
legislative committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's parents described their son as a sometimes naive young  
man who was often too trusting for his own good. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Vanity Fair in its March issue reveal that Shepard had  
been attacked and raped in Morocco while he was on a high school 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanity Fair also reported that Shepard tested HIV-positive at  
the Fort Collins, Colo., hospital where he died. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine said two men who fought with suspects Russell  
Henderson and Aaron McKinney following Shepard's attack may have 
come into contact with Shepard's blood and have been put on AIDS 
drugs. The article did not give a source. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany County Coroner Julie Heggie told The Associated Press  
that she had no information about whether Shepard was HIV-positive. 
``I know that's not in the autopsy report,'' Heggie said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Poudre Valley Hospital did not return calls for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard told Vanity Fair that her son had previously tested  
negative for the virus. The AP was unable Wednesday to contact the 
Shepards, who live in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and McKinney, both of Laramie, have been charged with  
murder and are awaiting trial. Prosecutors are seeking the death 
penalty against both. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anger really isn't there yet,'' Mrs. Shepard said. ``I am  
sure it will come. ... They've done something horrible to my life, 
to my son, to my family, and I don't want to waste any of my 
feelings on them. I'm saving it all for Matt.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Casts Doubt in Cable Car Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine Corps judge doubts  
prosecutors have enough evidence to support charges against one of 
two aviators charged in the deaths of 20 people in an Italian ski 
gondola accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Thursday before jury selection in the  
court-martial of Capt. Richard Ashby that he would dismiss charges 
against Ashby's navigator if he had to make an instant ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter in the Feb. 3, 1998, accident at 
Cavalese, Italy. The navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of 
Westbury, N.Y., faces the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given what I've seen, I'm concerned,'' the judge, Lt. Col.  
Robert Nunley, said of the charges against Schweitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's radar-jamming jet severed a ski gondola cable in the  
Italian Alps, sending 20 people inside plunging to their deaths. 
The jet was supposed to be observing a minimum altitude of 1,000 
feet when it hit the cable, which was suspended 370 feet above the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Ashby was flying recklessly low and fast  
during the low-level training flight. Defense attorneys say the 
pilot was using a map that didn't have the ski lift marked on it 
and that an optical illusion caused him to think he was flying 
higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunley said he wouldn't rule on Schweitzer's status now in order  
to give prosecutors time to develop the case against him. Another 
judge is to hear Schweitzer's case when it begins March 1 and could 
rule on Schweitzer's dismissal motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer's attorney urged Nunley to rule immediately, saying  
his opinion was consistent with another judge who, at an 
investigative hearing last year, said the case was weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Beck, a civilian defense lawyer for Schweitzer, said he was  
confident that charges against his client would be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence will show the mishap was ``a terribly tragic accident,  
not the result of criminal negligence,'' Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers in Ashby's trial questioned 10 prospective jurors from a  
pool of 15 and plan to finish by lunch time today with four others. 
</P>
<P>
	Before jury selection began, Ashby formally pleaded innocent to  
the charges, which include destruction of private and government 
property and dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces a separate trial on a charge of obstruction of  
justice involving the disappearance of a videotape from the cockpit 
of the EA-6B Prowler after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunley ruled that Ashby can't be forced to testify about the  
missing tape because doing so would violate his constitutional 
guarantee against self-incrimination.

<HEADLINE> Senator Salutes Women Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Ted Stevens took a detour before  
rejoining the impeachment trial Thursday to help recognize the 
achievements of women athletes on the 13th annual National Girls 
and Women in Sports Day. 
</P>
<P>
	And in turn they showered the Alaska Republican with praise and  
applause for what he's done to help them score on the athletic 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	At a buffet luncheon in an ornate third-floor meeting room in  
the Russell Senate Office Building, basketball Hall of Famer Nancy 
Lieberman-Cline told Stevens that in women's sports, ``We know you 
as the father of Title IX.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That 1972 federal law bars sexual discrimination by schools,  
colleges and universities that receive federal education money and 
has been credited with helping girls and women both athletically 
and academically. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, who has three daughters among his six children, ushered  
the bill through the Senate and long has been an advocate of 
equality of the sexes in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and Charles Robb, D-Va.,  
and several House members also attended the luncheon, held steps 
away from an outdoor balcony with scenic views of the Capitol dome 
that senators visit regularly to comment on the continuing Senate 
trial of President Clinton for TV news crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Shalala, the health and human services secretary, said  
Title IX revolutionized sports and referred to Stevens as the law's 
``guardian angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said the law has brought ``tremendous improvements'' in  
women sports, but lamented that many young people still are 
overweight. His announcement that he plans legislation to encourage 
school districts to create comprehensive physical education 
programs earned him more hearty applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic speed skater Bonnie Blair was the 1999 recipient of the  
Women's Sports Foundation's Flo Hyman Award. Blair, the most 
decorated American athlete in Winter Olympic history, won five gold 
medals and one bronze in her sport. Hyman, an Olympic volleyball 
player, died unexpectedly in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Wants Financial Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid an avalanche of public complaints that  
proposed federal rules could turn every bank teller into a spy for 
Big Brother, a Texas lawmaker is pushing legislation aimed at 
protecting Americans' financial privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The far-reaching legislative package unveiled Wednesday by  
Republican Rep. Ron Paul would, among other things, block proposed 
anti-money laundering rules that would track the habits of bank 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the federal banking agencies that are proposing  
the ``Know Your Customer'' rules are reconsidering in response to 
the public outcry that started in December. The Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., for example, had received more than 14,000 e-mail 
messages and letters opposing the proposal as the end of last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and the  
nation's bankers themselves have complained that the rules would 
impinge on privacy rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We proclaim that American citizens have the right to be free  
of the snooping, spying, prying eyes of government bureaucrats,'' 
Paul told reporters. He said his legislation would ``give Americans 
the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their every 
financial step is not being filed away and viewed as potentially 
criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul said about a dozen lawmakers, including House Republican  
Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, had agreed to join him as co-sponsors of 
the bill to stop the ``Know Your Customer'' rules. 
</P>
<P>
	But the other two measures in his package -- to repeal the Bank  
Secrecy Act and to let people see the files on them created by the 
federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network -- hadn't attracted any 
co-sponsors yet and legislative prospects were clouded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank Secrecy Act of 1974 obligates banks to report  
customers' cash transactions of $10,000 or more to law enforcement 
authorities. Paul said the law has failed to help catch drug 
dealers, who ``are smarter than most bankers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul, a physician who is on the House Banking Committee, once  
ran for president as the Libertarian Party's nominee. His strict 
constitutionalist beliefs often put him at odds with his fellow 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul maintains that the ``Know Your Customer'' rules violate the  
Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations would require banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is designed to combat money laundering techniques  
used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide illegal 
profits. Money laundering is a major concern of law enforcement 
officials; it reached an estimated $30 billion in this country last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Paul's bill regarding files kept by the Financial  
Crimes Enforcement Network would not abolish the Treasury 
Department agency, he said he does not see any need for it. Most 
law enforcement activity should be done by states rather than 
federal ``bureaucrats carrying guns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the agency said they hadn't seen Paul's  
legislation yet and had no immediate comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the office  
of the U.S. comptroller of the currency, which regulates nationally 
chartered banks, told The Associated Press on Friday that they were 
reconsidering the ``Know Your Customer'' rules they had previously 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association last week urged the federal  
banking regulators to withdraw the proposal, warning it could make 
Americans lose confidence in the banking system and government.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The first Internet broadcast of Victoria's  
Secret's Spring Fashion Show turned out to be a bust for some 
people after millions of fans jammed the site, causing major 
technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Web surfers who hoped to catch a glimpse of supermodels  
strutting around in racy lingerie were instead greeted with jagged 
video and audio problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``That says to me the technology in not up to snuff,'' said  
Wendy Hargle, a computer technician in Berkeley, Calif., who tried 
to view the show. ``Someone did not anticipate the level of 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The much-hyped fashion show was held in New York and marked a  
milestone for the Internet. It was one of the first large-scale 
live video events in which a corporation invested money and 
prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	A television ad for the 14-minute event was shown during  
Sunday's Super Bowl, and other ads were placed in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was Webcast using ``streaming video'' technology.  
Streaming video allows Web surfers to view live video without 
downloading large files. The quality of the video depends on the 
number of people watching, how powerful the computers are and how 
congested Net traffic is.

<HEADLINE> Travel Industry Passes Y2k Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Major airlines said their computer reservations  
systems have warded off the Y2K bug, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday was the first day most airline systems could book  
tickets for Jan. 1, 2000. Early indications are that the systems 
that have been undergoing revamping for months and even years 
handled their first confrontation with the Year 2000 problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this was the first major milestone,'' said United  
Airlines spokeswoman Kristina Price, who estimated United has spent 
$70 million on its Year 2000 Project. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day has gone by without a hitch. We're very excited it  
went so smoothly,'' said Jennifer Hudson of Sabre Group, which is 
largely owned by American Airlines' parent company AMR Corp. and 
has 40,000 travel agencies using its reservations system. ``We had 
tested and re-tested for this day for months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much computer software was designed to recognize years by just  
the final two digits rather than all four. For 2000, computer 
systems that have not been reprogrammed will interpret double zero 
to mean 1900 and could stop functioning 
</P>
<P>
	The computerized reservations systems used by major airlines and  
many car rental and other travel industry businesses display dates 
for sale only 331 days in advance. Thus, Thursday became the first 
day to book travel for next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	At Worldspan, an Atlanta-based system owned by Delta, Northwest  
Airlines and TransWorld Airlines, no Y2K-related glitches were 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one carrier still isn't booking flights for Jan. 1,  
though. Ed Stewart, Southwest Airlines' director of public 
relations, said Southwest always leaves a four- to six-month lead 
time on bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to depend on the people in reservations,'' he  
replied, when asked when it will start taking Jan. 1 bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	The travel industry expects the period around New Year's Eve and

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Triple Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A man was convicted Thursday of killing  
his mistress and their two sons to keep his wife from finding out 
about his double life. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter C. Contos faces an automatic sentence of life in prison  
without possibility of parole on the three first-degree murder 
convictions. Sentencing was scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Contos, 34, admitted he strangled Catherine Rice and their two  
sons, aged 4 years and 2 months, after she threatened in September 
1997 to expose their relationship to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the body of Ms. Rice, 35, at her Lowell home, then  
stuffed the boys' bodies in his locker at Otis Air National Guard 
Base in Bourne on Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	Portrayed by the defense as a military man with a troubled  
childhood, he allegedly snapped when confronted with the possible 
loss of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Contos' lawyer argued the crime was manslaughter because it  
happened in the heat of the moment. Manslaughter carries a maximum 
sentence of 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors depicted Contos as a cold-hearted Don Juan who  
bragged about his ability to keep a mistress -- allegedly telling a 
buddy, ``It's good to be king.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks New Nabisco Cracker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nabisco Inc. was blocked from tossing goldfish  
into the snack food market by a federal judge who ruled Wednesday 
that the company's new fish-shaped cracker would unfairly take 
advantage of the success of Pepperidge Farm's established product. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin found that Pepperidge  
Farm had spent considerable amounts of money boosting the image of 
its Goldfish cracker and strengthening ties between the product and 
Pepperidge Farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``In essence, Pepperidge Farm has taken a unique and fanciful  
idea -- creating a cheese cracker in the shape of a goldfish -- and 
turned this idea into its signature,'' the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperidge Farm, a division of the Campbell Soup Co. of Camden,  
N.J., went to court after learning that Nabisco wanted to launch 
the new cracker this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco was forced to put off the distribution by the judge's  
ruling. The preliminary injunction did leave open the possibility 
of a trial on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco's goldfish-shaped cracker was to be included in a mix  
based on the Nickelodeon's cartoon series, ``CatDog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scheindlin said the fish in the ``CatDog'' mix ``strikes at the  
heart of what trademark dilution law is intended to prevent.'' She 
ordered Nabisco, headquartered in Parsippany-Troy Hills, N.J., to 
recall all CatDog brand products currently distributed to any 
retailers and to cease using gold goldfish in the manufacture, 
distribution, sale, advertisement or promotion of any of its 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco plans to ask the judge to stay the effect of her ruling  
while it seeks an emergency appeal because the product that was 
ready to be shipped this week is perishable, said Hank Sandbach, a 
company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pepperidge Farm's attempt to keep our product off the market  
smells rather fishy to us. Obviously we're unhappy with the results 
of the judge's ruling and confident we'll win this CatDog fight on 
appeal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Albright, president of the Norwalk, Conn.-based  
Pepperidge Farm, said the judge's ruling would help the company 
continue the growth of a product that has doubled in sales in the 
past three years, making it the second-largest snack cracker brand 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, Pepperidge Farm has carefully built the  
Goldfish shaped cracker into an icon brand which consumers of all 
ages recognize,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Ready To Start 90-Day Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It'll start like this: Larry Bird's team will break from a  
huddle and walk to center court at Market Square Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The place will be rocking, the ball will go up, someone will win  
the tip and the NBA season -- after a bitter lockout, the retirement 
of Michael Jordan and brief training camps -- will finally begin, 94 
days late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course everyone would like to see Michael still in the  
league, but he is not and the league will continue to go on,'' Bird 
said. ``And there will be new champions, not only this year but as 
the years pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird's team is being cast as the favorite in this abbreviated  
50-game season, and Indiana will be the site of the first action as 
the Pacers play the Washington Wizards in a 7 p.m. EST start. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 11 games will be played around the league, making for an  
extremely busy opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone better get used to it.  
</P>
<P>
	Busy nights will be commonplace in the NBA this season as teams  
squeeze all their games into just 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you will see a lot more intensity. The only problem I  
foresee is that if you have a major injury to one of your star 
players -- if he misses a couple weeks -- that's a lot of games,'' 
Bird said. ``I think the team that stays the healthiest has 
probably got a better opportunity to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the flip side, of course, is that the injured teams will be  
in for a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Hornets have already lost their two best players,  
Glen Rice and Anthony Mason, to injuries. Combined with the loss of 
centers Matt Geiger and Vlade Divac and guard Dell Curry to free 
agency, the Hornets will have a tough time when they open at home 
against the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games, it's Cleveland at Atlanta, Detroit at Miami,  
Toronto at Boston, New York at Orlando, Sacramento at San Antonio, 
Minnesota at Denver, Chicago at Utah, Dallas at Seattle, Houston at 
the Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix at the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important to start with a little more urgency and  
get some wins early on,'' Phoenix Suns coach Danny Ainge said. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen is how the fans will respond.  
</P>
<P>
	When the baseball strike ended in 1995, the backlash from the  
public was fierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime fans stopped going to games, casual fans stopped  
watching on TV and a trio of New Yorkers even ran onto the field at 
Shea Stadium and threw $1 bills at the players, a la Abbie 
Hoffman's famous protest gimmick on the floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is quite certain how any fan backlash might manifest  
itself in the NBA, but the league has been taking steps to mend 
fences with its paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's one factor that may draw them back more than anything  
else, it's the heightened competition that comes with every game 
meaning a little bit more and every team having a little more of a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the true NBA fans are going to be the ones who  
obviously were disappointed with the lockout but are just very, 
very happy that we're back to playing,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van 
Gundy said. ``What they want to see is good play, hard play, 
competitive play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks fans have already taken a liking to the team's newest  
scorer, former Golden State guard Latrell Sprewell, who will be 
playing his first regular-season game in more than 14 months when 
the Knicks play the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, it'll be a rematch of the NBA Finals, sort of, when  
the revamped Bulls travel to Utah to play the Jazz. Chicago will be 
without several key members of its now-deconstructed dynasty, 
including Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley, Steve 
Kerr, Jud Buechler and Scott Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of how much things have changed since last June, this  
would-be marquee matchup will not even be shown on national 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of 50 games we've got to play well in to make a  
run at the playoffs,'' Karl Malone said. ``Michael, Scottie and 
Dennis were the Bulls. It's not like that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz are widely being picked as the favorite to come out of  
the West, but the competition will be tougher now that Pippen has 
joined Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich scoffed when somebody pointed out  
that his frontcourt is comprised of three Hall of Famers while his 
backcourt is comprised of considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have three superstars in the lineup at one time is not  
easy. There is only one basketball, so we have to have some guys 
who will make sacrifices and be program players,'' Tomjanovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next 90 days, and hectic days they will be, will determine  
who makes the playoffs and tries to succeed the Bulls as champions. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season may be tainted, but the playoffs will be the  
same. The only difference is that the postseason will start two 
weeks later than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do win a championship,'' Bird said. ``I don't think  
anyone should put an asterisk on the side and say it wasn't a full 
season and Michael wasn't playing.''

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Weighs Big Ten Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- There's more at stake than just 111  
years of football independence Friday when Notre Dame's trustees 
decide whether to go ahead with negotiations to join the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision affects millions of dollars in bowl and TV  
revenues, recruiting and academics, among other things. More 
importantly, Notre Dame's status as the national, Catholic American 
university could be forever altered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame's identity nationally is so linked to football that  
people worry if the football program were restricted from a 
national schedule to a regional schedule, that would have an impact 
on the identity,'' said Notre Dame professor George Sterling, who 
favors the move. ``This is touching the nerve center of the 
university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the decision affects far more than the football  
team, how the Big Ten would affect the future of the Irish legacy, 
which includes 11 national championships and greats like Knute 
Rockne and Frank Leahy, is of utmost concern to most with ties to 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're really addressing here is the extent to  
which the athletic department is advanced or not by virtue of our 
football program changing its status,'' said athletic director Mike 
Wadsworth, who played football for the Irish in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	As an independent, Notre Dame takes home every cent of its gate  
receipts, all of proceeds from bowl payouts and an estimated $7 
million a year in its exclusive TV contract with NBC, which is 
expected to jump to $8 million a year for the 2000-2005 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But as a member of the Big Ten, it would enter a revenue sharing  
program that splits up a portion of each school's gate receipts 
from football and basketball, bowl revenues, TV contracts and 
proceeds from the NCAA basketball tournaments, Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether you're up or you're down, those bowl  
revenues are there,'' Big Ten commissioner Jim Delaney said. 
``Whether you in the Rose Bowl or not, you get the money. Whether 
you're on ESPN or not, you get money. So, basically it's a shared 
risk, shared upside, shared downside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should the trustees, meeting in London to dedicate a new Notre  
Dame facility there, decide to proceed with talks to join the 
conference, school and Big Ten officials will still have to decide 
several issues. But Delaney anticipates no problems to resolve 
those ``competitive and financial issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be disappointing if they're not interested in taking the  
next step,'' Delaney said. ``It's somewhat implicit that when we 
decided to contact Notre Dame as the first institution to talk to, 
that we felt they would be the best fit for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Problem is, an overwhelming majority of Notre Dame alumni don't  
think the Irish are a good fit for the Big Ten, in part because the 
decision has academic implications as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame, known for its undergraduate programs, trails far  
behind the Big Ten schools in research and graduate programs. Some 
see joining the Big Ten as a way to improve those programs because 
conference affiliation also includes membership in the Committee on 
Intercollegiate Cooperation, the academic arm of the Big Ten that 
includes all 11 conference schools and the University of Chicago. 
It allows the schools to share resources freely. 
</P>
<P>
	But some also see that as a threat to Notre Dame's Catholic  
identity, especially in a conference of secular schools, and some 
Big Ten presidents have grumbled privately that Notre Dame's weak 
graduate programs are a good fit for the Big Ten, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our brand name is something special. We'd rather be one of one  
than one of 12,'' said Chuck Lennon, executive director of the 
Alumni Association. ``Not that we're better than anybody. We're 
different, and I think that's important because there is a very 
positive feeling about the quality of the Big Ten academically and 
athletically, but it just is not the right mix for us.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Draws Up Economic Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil is drawing up a new round  
of measures to stabilize its ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan said Thursday ``new policy  
initiatives are being prepared'' to meet revised economic targets 
set by the government and the International Monetary Fund. He did 
not elaborate but did rule out a sudden ``surprise package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malan spoke as Brazil's new targets were announced by the  
Finance Ministry and the IMF at a joint press conference in 
Brasilia. The main goal is to keep inflation below 10 percent in 
1999, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others include increasing the nation's budget surplus to up to  
3.5 percent of gross domestic product and reducing the public debt 
to below 46.5 percent of the GDP. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer, speaking at the conclusion  
of three days of talks with Brazilian officials, said the goals 
were needed because of Brazil's new exchange rate policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The real's value against the dollar has plunged by 33 percent  
since Jan. 13, when the government first moved to let the real 
float freely on world exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new foreign exchange regime requires a new framework,''  
Fischer said. ``We've had very good, fruitful talks with the goal 
of establishing this framework.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer left for Washington late Thursday, leaving other IMF  
officials behind to continue conducting a review of the $41.5 
billion aid package for Brazil would continue. He expected the 
review to be completed within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The review will determine whether the IMF and other  
international lenders will deliver the next $9 billion installment 
of the aid package to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The aid package was given conditional approval after Brazil  
unveiled an austerity plan last October to shave $15 billion from 
its budget deficit in 1999. The bulk of the plan has since been 
approved by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil's economy continues to be unstable. Its currency in  
particular has struggled since the devaluation, plunging to as low 
as 2.17 to the dollar last week. The real closed Thursday at 1.81 
to the dollar, compared to 1.21 to the dollar before the 
devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have been rising as well. Many Brazilians fear the return  
of inflation, which fell from about 2,700 percent in 1993 to around 
2 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday, Brazil's budget surplus target for 1999 was 2.6  
percent of GDP. The goal to reduce public debt to below 46.5 
percent of GDP is effectively unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing official sources, Brazilian media said Thursday that the  
new estimate for inflation this year was 10-12 percent compared to 
a pre-devaluation forecast of 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian economy, which was expected to shrink by 1 percent  
in 1999, reportedly will contract by 3.5 percent. That's more 
optimistic than U.S.-based Salomon Smith Barney, which foresees a 6 
percent contraction.

<HEADLINE> House Members Want Trial Over Quick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like just about everyone else, House  
Republicans want a speedy end to the impeachment process they set 
in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of ominous polls and the near certainty President  
Clinton will survive the trial, the lawmakers see little point in 
dragging it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost everyone, even people who are convinced that Clinton's  
actions were reprehensible -- even those voters are wanting this 
entire matter over,'' said Rep. Richard Baker, a Louisiana 
Republican who won a seventh term in a squeaker in November. ``So I 
think the nation has had enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the trial managers, House members are now free from  
Monica Lewinsky. Republicans among them expressed no wish to 
second-guess those they elected to carry the fight forward. ``I am 
extremely proud of their integrity,'' declared Rep. Tom Coburn, 
R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the hunger to close this convulsive chapter in Washington  
-- and ease the threat that voters will punish the GOP in 2000 -- was 
palpable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's light at the end of the tunnel,'' says Republican Rep.  
Mark Foley of Florida. ``I just hope that a boulder doesn't fall on 
the tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers, however, pressed on Thursday, pleading  
unsuccessfully with the Senate to allow at least Ms. Lewinsky to 
testify in person in what's left of the trial. The Senate rejected 
that idea, 70-30, with 25 Republicans joining all 45 Democrats in 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the talk in the nation about ``moving on,'' most House  
members already have. Regular business has returned since their 
impeachment vote Dec. 19 -- a trade bill here, an hour-long speech 
to an empty chamber there, not to mention committee meetings on the 
budget of the president they impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	With one seat vacant and the 13 serving as trial managers, that  
leaves 421 able to throw themselves back into the blend of foreign, 
national and local matters that constitute normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
	But they cannot entirely escape the issue still gripping the  
other half of the Capitol. Not even in historic Williamsburg, Va., 
at a leafy Republican retreat surely rustling with chatter about 
the impeachment end game. ``It will be omnipresent in the 
background,'' Rep. Greg Ganske of Iowa predicted Thursday before 
heading down to the annual get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite polls indicating Americans are unhappy with the conduct  
of the trial and blame the GOP, many Republicans are reluctant to 
leave their band of 13 twisting in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're trying to fulfill their constitutional  
obligations, and that may or may not be politically smart,'' said 
Rep. Ernest Fletcher of Kentucky, a freshman Republican who won a 
narrow victory in the fall. ``But I think in the long run it will 
be well respected by the American people and by history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we do is a dilemma,'' Foley said. ``They are doing  
the best they can in a very difficult situation. They are being 
pilloried in a number of circles ... but I don't fault them for 
what they are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are as reflexively critical of the managers as the  
Republicans are supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't represent my House,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,  
D-Fla. ``It's abundantly clear they ... don't represent the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers often follow public opinion and sometimes bravely defy  
it. Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., confessed to having trouble 
comprehending it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought surely there would be by this time more of an  
objective recognition by the public that this was not partisan 
politics, not a vendetta against the president, but that we were 
talking about legal questions,'' she said. ``And I can't explain 
it. I'm still shaking my head over it.''

<HEADLINE>  Marine Trial Starts in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A court-martial began today for a  
Marine pilot whose jet clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 
people, with the judge ruling the defendant won't be questioned 
about a missing videotape if he testifies. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby's trial on 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter began one day after the first anniversary of the 
tragedy that happened when the wing of his EA-6B Prowler sliced 
through cables supporting the Mount Cermis ski gondola in Cavalese, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, noted today that Ashby faces  
a separate court-martial on obstruction of justice charges for 
allegedly destroying a videotape shot during the flight. Forcing 
him to testify about it during his manslaughter trial could violate 
his constitutional protection against self-incrimination, Nunley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunley added the disappearance of the tape demonstrated a  
``consciousness of guilt'' on Ashby's part. He said Ashby and his 
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, asked after the flight what 
they should do with the tape and one of the two backseat crewmen, 
Capt. Chandler Seagraves, replied, ```I'd get rid of it if I were 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A second, blank videotape was substituted for the missing tape,  
prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer faces a separate court-martial in the accident;  
unlike Ashby, he had agreed to have the obstruction of justice 
charges combined with his manslaughter and homicide counts in a 
single trial. Charges were dismissed against Seagraves and the 
other man in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley granted motions by CBS and Rolling Stone magazine to  
quash subpoenas issued them by prosecutors for outtakes and notes 
from their interviews with Ashby and Schweitzer. CBS' ``60 
Minutes'' broadcast a segment on the case Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment guides me here, and most of the statements  
were self-serving anyway and not incriminatory,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley ruled that if Ashby takes the stand, prosecutors will be  
allowed to interview an expert witness on computer flight 
simulation. He didn't elaborate on how the testimony of the expert 
related to Ashby's participation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley refused a request by Schweitzer's attorneys to dismiss  
charges against him. He said that decision would be up to a 
different judge who was named to preside at Schweitzer's 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection began later today with questions directed at 15  
potential jurors, all officers of rank equal to Ashby's or higher. 
Lawyers can reduce the size of the panel if they detect an 
objectionable bias, and the court-martial can proceed with a panel 
as small as five members. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the jet was flying too low and too fast and  
that the cable wouldn't have been struck if Ashby had followed 
flight rules. The gondola cable hung about 370 feet above the 
ground, and the minimum altitude for the mission was 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say the accident was not Ashby's fault, noting  
that the 33-year-old cable system wasn't marked on the map Ashby 
was given before he began a low-level training flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., could be sentenced to more  
than 200 years in prison if convicted of all charges, which also 
include destruction of government and private property and 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two  
Austrians and one Dutch person died in the Feb. 3, 1998, accident. 
Attorneys for the victims are seeking damage payments from the U.S. 
government.

<HEADLINE> Jury: Clear Rapper ODB's Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A grand jury concluded that rapper ODB shouldn't  
face attempted murder charges filed last month after an encounter 
with police that ended in gunfire, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before returning its finding, a grand jury heard testimony from  
seven witnesses, including police officers and a forensic expert. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only individuals that fired shots were the police  
officers,'' said Peter Frankel, attorney for Russell Jones, the 
real name of the 30-year-old Wu-Tang Clan singer. ``There was no 
gun recovered, and no ballistics evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 15, Jones and his cousin were driving away from the  
United Kingdom Studios when police stopped his Chevrolet Tahoe, 
allegedly because the vehicle's lights were not on. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers testified that when they approached the driver's  
window, two shots were fired and they returned fire. Jones pleaded 
innocent to the charges and was released on $150,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel said his client will appear in court Friday, when the  
charges are to be formally dismissed.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Pilots Approve 1st Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Federal Express Corp. and its pilots union  
finally have a work contract after years of squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fedex Pilots Association announced Thursday that 86 percent  
of its voting members approved the five-year deal, which takes 
effect May 31. The tally was 2,516-395. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes 2 1/2 months after the pilots backed down from a  
threat to strike and makes the pilots the only FedEx employees in 
the U.S. represented by a union. The haggling over a contract has 
gone on since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract ratification gives the company and the union a  
starting point for putting their differences behind them, said Paul 
Schlesinger, a market analyst for Donald Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great opportunity for the company and the pilots and  
everybody else to get on with their lives. ... If they can do that 
and forget about the tensions that were created, they'll all be 
better off,'' Schlesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's 3,600 flight crew members will get a 17 percent  
pay raise over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the pilots originally sought a 24 percent raise over four  
years, the union said its members were pleased with company 
concessions on flight scheduling and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives FedEx pilots the best retirement package in the  
airline industry,'' said union president Frank Fato. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract boosts pension payments from 41 percent of a  
pilot's final-year pay to 72.5 percent. For a 30-year veteran who 
flies the company's largest cargo jets and earns $225,000, the 
increase amounts to $70,875 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots, for the first time, also will have some control over  
flight schedules, and a committee of pilots and company managers 
will handle complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	A new scheduling system put in place last year by the company  
often had pilots hustling to catch connecting flights or making too 
many takeoffs and landings, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
	``(That is) a complete change in philosophy that allows us to  
get in and work with the company to provide the rules that are 
going to make our lives tolerable for the remainder of our 
careers,'' Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx president Ted Weise said the contract makes the pilots'  
salaries competitive with those at other major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	'' ... And it recognizes the vital contributions they provide in  
maintaining FedEx's leadership position in our industry,'' Weise 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Line Pilots Association represented FedEx pilots when  
they first started working toward a contract. Over the years, the 
pilots twice rejected proposed contracts recommended by their union 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fedex Pilots Association took over in 1996. Its leadership  
endorsed the contract in December and mailed ballots to members 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots threatened a holiday-season strike in October after  
contract talks broke off. FedEx began leasing planes and crews from 
other companies in preparation for a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx declines discussing particulars of those contracts.  
</P>
<P>
	The contract talks resumed Nov. 20 after FedEx founder and FDX  
chairman Frederick Smith warned the pilots they could lose their 
jobs if they went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Davies said he's hopeful subsequent contract negotiations will  
be smoother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we were trying to swallow the apple whole ...  
everything was at issue,'' he said. ``This will make transition 
into the next round of negotiations I believe a lot easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis-based FedEx was founded in 1973 and is owned by FDX  
Corp. It has 145,000 employees worldwide and ships more than 3 
million items to 211 countries each day.

<HEADLINE> Karl Brings Deep Rotation to Bucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks are already better  
than last year in at least one area: bench strength. 
</P>
<P>
	When George Karl arrived in Milwaukee, his first order of  
business was to upgrade his reserve rotation, which became even 
more essential when the lockout compressed the 1999 season to 50 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl got more than he ever dreamed of when the Bucks were able  
to land two Dell Curry and Vinny Del Negro. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you said we could get Dell Curry and Vinny Del Negro, that  
would probably have been above our expectations,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, 34, a 12-year NBA veteran who averaged 9.4 points for the  
Charlotte Hornets last season, showed his worth immediately after 
signing a one-year, $1 million contract by scoring 21 points in 26 
minutes of an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming here to Milwaukee has really rejuvenated me,'' Curry  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And his presence, along with that of Del Negro, should refresh  
the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Negro, 32, the ninth-year veteran who left the San Antonio  
Spurs as a free agent during the lockout to play in Europe, signed 
a four-year deal to back up Ray Allen at shooting guard and Terrell 
Brandon at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry and Del Negro, who averaged 10.4 points last season for  
the Spurs, will team with Michael Curry, Armen Gilliam and rookie 
Robert Traylor to provide a solid second unit. 
</P>
<P>
	That should save minutes for starters Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson,  
Tyrone Hill, Terrell Brandon and Ervin Johnson as the Bucks try to 
end their seven-year playoff vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our starting five can play with anybody in the  
league,'' Robinson said. ``Now we've got a great scorer coming off 
the bench in Dell Curry. He can give you big numbers at any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto Del Negro.  
</P>
<P>
	It will no longer be a concession, as it was under former  
coaches Mike Dunleavy and Chris Ford, when the Bucks starters take 
a breather. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've got a low block presence, you've got a  
defender, you've got a shooter, you've got a good decision-maker, 
you've got a rookie that's going to play with enthusiasm,'' Karl 
said. ``There's a lot of things out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And an upgraded bench means a livelier starting lineup, Allen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so important. Because last year I had guys backing me  
up who were hesitant on shooting and scoring,'' Allen said. ``Dell 
and Vinny, they come in to score. ... I think they continue the 
fluidity of our offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Karl instituting the same trapping defense he employed in  
Seattle, the Bucks starters will feel blessed for the breaks on the 
bench, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said in his first two years in the league, he hated to  
come out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You felt like when you went to the bench, you were sitting  
soft. You go to sit on the sideline and you know you're not going 
to put on your shooting shirt because you're going to go right back 
into the game,'' Allen said. ``Coach wants you to rest, but at the 
same time you can't let your whole offense self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, now we have a better sense of reliance in the guys coming  
off the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, who took the SuperSonics to the playoffs seven straight  
seasons before being fired for his playoff failures, said the 
improved bench will be essential in the short season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the more people you win games with the better you're  
going to be,'' he said. ``I think giving guys opportunities, it's 
the kind of way I think this team should go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if I was coaching in Seattle, I don't know if I'd go that  
way,'' Karl added. ``We won a lot of games just by being smart and 
old and slow and sloppy. But we knew how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And until the Bucks do, they'll have to rely on more players as  
they scale the slippery slope to the NBA's upper echelon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think the older teams have the advantage more than the  
deep teams,'' Karl said. ``I've always felt the older guys kind of 
know how to win those games when they're tired and ugly. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think sometimes taking this energy and these fresh legs  
and this depth is a little overrated than just a sense of how to 
win basketball games. I think personally the old-timer who knows 
how to win basketball games is a lot more valuable than the young, 
ambitious, energetic athlete who has no idea how to win basketball 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's where Curry and Del Negro come in.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Courts AARP on Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is trying to get the most  
powerful lobby for older Americans to line up behind his plans for 
using projected budget surpluses to help shore up Social Security 
and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans on Medicare -- especially Americans with lower  
incomes -- should be able to count on a defined set of benefits and 
protections without having to worry about excessive new costs they 
can't begin to afford,'' Clinton told a legislative council meeting 
of the American Association of Retired Persons on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Corry, AARP's director of federal affairs, said the  
president's position ``still leaves open a lot of room for debate, 
but it does begin to anchor the debate, and that is very helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of a bipartisian Medicare commission are exploring  
whether the government could still guarantee health benefits under 
a premium support system designed to foster competition among 
private companies that would offer health plans to Medicare 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reiterated on Wednesday his position that the long-term  
solvency of both Medicare and Social Security must be secured 
before any of the federal budget surplus is spent on broad-based 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to treat this as real serious or solemn,'' said Ari  
Fleischer, majority spokesman for the House Ways and Means 
Committee. He pointed to a recent Congressional Budget Office 
report that found Clinton-supported spending last year shrank the 
projected surplus by $51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing for the president to say these words. It's  
another to judge his actions,'' Fleischer said. He added that 
Republicans don't see tax cuts and Social Security and Medicare 
reform as an either-or choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to work together across party lines to make these  
decisions. We have to work together across generational lines to 
make these decisions,'' Clinton told the seniors' group. ``I ask 
you to join with me to make sure that our country meets that 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His condemnation of a GOP-proposed income tax cut echoed of the  
poll-tested rhetoric he used in the 1996 campaign to slam the tax 
plan of his Republican opponent, Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Clinton said, the GOP plan would ``benefit clearly the  
wealthiest Americans -- who have, I might add, done quite well as 
the stock market has virtually tripled in the last six years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar, partisan-edged rhetoric was unfortunate, AARP's  
Corry said. 
</P>
<P>
	His group has been careful not to alienate the Republican  
majority in Congress by choosing sides in the debate that is 
unfolding just as the 2000 campaign grinds into gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't do Social Security and Medicare legislation from one  
side of the aisle,'' Corry said. ``We hope people aren't just 
trying to stake out positions to sharpen differences for the 
election campaign.''

<HEADLINE> States To Divide $5B Tobacco Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco states reached a tentative  
agreement Thursday on dividing a $5.15 billion trust fund for 
farmers that would be financed by the major cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The distribution plan will use the 1998 basic quota system set  
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said North Carolina Attorney 
General Mike Easley and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most equitable way and what our farm groups want  
here. All states come out pretty much even with that,'' Easley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton said Phil Carlton, the lawyer for four  
largest U.S. tobacco companies, would prepare a final draft of the 
proposed agreement, and the states' representatives would meet 
again to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 people met behind closed doors at a Raleigh hotel to  
work out the distribution plan. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, the largest flue-cured tobacco state, and  
Kentucky, the biggest burley tobacco producer, would receive the 
biggest shares under the proposal -- 38.34 percent and 29.97 
percent, respectively, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said Tennessee would get 7.65 percent; South  
Carolina, 7.01 percent; Virginia, 6.65 percent; and Georgia, 5.91 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The other tobacco quota states will receive less than 5 percent,  
based on their 1998 basic quotas. Maryland and Pennsylvania tobacco 
farmers are not part of the quota system, and their shares of the 
settlement still must be worked out, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The private trust fund was created last month by tobacco-growing  
states and cigarette makers following last fall's $206 billion 
settlement between the tobacco industry and 46 states. The fund was 
created to aid tobacco farmers expected to be squeezed by the 
higher cigarette prices and curbs on tobacco promotion that are 
part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund will be financed by contributions over 12 years  
by Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco 
Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. The payments could begin 
as early as April. 
</P>
<P>
	Burley's share of the basic quota was 44 percent in 1998;  
flue-cured tobacco farmers got the other 56 percent, according to 
the U.S. Farm Service Agency. Using that formula to divide the 
trust fund money, burley states would get $2.256 billion and 
flue-cured states, $2.892 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Burley-tobacco states and states that grow flue-cured tobacco  
entered Thursday's meeting at odds over how to divide up the trust 
fund money. Each backed formulas that favored their crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny McKinney, chief executive officer of Burley Tobacco  
Growers Cooperative in Lexington, Ky., said each state must work 
out how to distribute the money to the farmers and how much goes to 
quota owners, tenants who work tobacco acreage and lessees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it leaves here and goes back to the state level, that's  
when the civil war starts,'' he said. ``It's going to get pretty 
hateful pretty darn quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major tobacco states involved in setting up the trust fund were  
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and 
Kentucky. Other involved were Maryland, West Virginia, Indiana, 
Florida, Alabama and Ohio.

	January Retail Sales Beat Forecasts  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- January proved to be a better-than-expected  
month for the nation's retailers, who saw big sales gains as 
Americans bought up deeply discounted merchandise. ``The economy is 
more robust that most people expected it would be,'' said Steve 
Paspal, senior retail analyst at Sovereign Asset Management, a 
subsidiary of John Hancock Funds. ``How can that not help retail 
sales?'' Retailers continue to benefit from low unemployment and 
inflation, which also have helped to raise consumer confidence. 
Separately, the Labor Department reported the number of Americans 
filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits fell by 
9,000 to 292,000 last week.

	Factory Orders Surge at Year's End  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to American factories rebounded in  
December but the gain wasn't enough to prevent 1998 from entering 
the record book as the weakest year for manufacturing since the 
recession of 1991. Orders jumped 2.3 percent during the last month 
of the year, to a seasonally adjusted $343.5 billion, the Commerce 
Department said today. It was the biggest increase in 13 months. 
However, orders for all of 1998 -- $4.03 trillion -- were just 2.1 
percent higher than the year before. That compared with a healthy 
5.4 percent gain in 1997

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 62.31

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended lower after a day of wide swings,  
as aggressive profit-taking in technology shares overwhelmed 
strength in industrial names. The Dow Jones industrial average was 
down 62.31 points to close at 9,304.50. It briefly swung into 
positive territory in the afternoon, as the Federal Reserve 
signaled that it had no intention of raising interest rates. But 
the 31-point gain in the Dow couldn't hold as technology leader IBM 
was pounded 5 3/4 to 169 1/2, responsible for nearly 24 points of the 
Dow's loss. The rout in technology shares sent broad-market indexes 
tumbling. The Nasdaq had its third-largest point drop ever, down 
82.87 to 2,410.54.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online investors were unable to buy or sell  
stocks through ETrade for part of a second straight session today, 
as a software problem continued to plague the Internet brokerage. 
The trading function was unavailable for 75 minutes yesterday 
morning, and about 5 percent of ETrade's customers were unable to 
trade electronically throughout the afternoon. Today, the problem 
again affected the entire trading function for about an hour, 
beginning at around 10 a.m. EST. By 11 a.m., service was restored

tinkering caused its Internet software to run dramatically slower. 
It said, however, that the overall results vindicated its claims 
that government efforts to disable Internet functions within its 
Windows software cause serious problems. The government alleges 
that Microsoft illegally ``tied'' its Internet browser software 
into Windows, which forced consumers who use its dominant computer 
operating system also to use its browser.

and Rice-A-Roni reported today it earned $73.2 million, or 50 cents 
a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $25.6 million, 
or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 8.1 percent to

	American Airlines, Pilots Argue  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Labor relations between American Airlines and its  
pilots could once again affect the carrier's passengers, who have 
stayed loyal despite a brief strike two years ago and a slowdown 
last summer. At the heart of the most recent dispute is whether AMR 
Corp., the parent of the nation's second-largest airline, is too 
slowly absorbing recently purchased Reno Air into American's 
system, thereby paying Reno's 300 pilots on a lower pay scale. 
While federal law bars a strike over the issue, pilots could refuse 
to volunteer for overtime, which could force the cancellation or 
delay of flights.

	MINNETONKA, Minn. (AP) -- Cargill Inc. has set aside a plan to  
sell most of its North American seed operations to a German 
company, the two firms announced today. The planned $650 million 
sale of Cargill Hybrid Seeds North America to Hoeschst Schering 
AgrEvo GmbH had already been on hold for several months pending 
resolution of a lawsuit filed against Cargill by Pioneer Hi-Bred 
International. Pioneer filed suit against Cargill and two other 
seed companies last October in Iowa, claiming the companies bred 
corn hybrids using genetic material developed by Pioneer.

	Bank of England Cuts Key Rate  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England cut its base interest rate by  
a half point to 5.5 percent today, a larger-than-expected change 
which pushed stock prices higher at first. But they closed 
marginally lower. The blue chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 
100-share index closed down 0.4 points, or 0.007 percent, at 
5,939.9. It was the fifth rate reduction in the securities 
repurchase rate in as many months, but it left British rates well 
above the 3 percent level set by the 11 countries participating in 
the new euro currency.

	Russians Plan Budget Compromise

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Cabinet proposed a compromise over  
spending cuts for the Kremlin and parliament today, trying to head 
off a disagreement that has threatened to delay passage of the 
budget. Communist lawmakers signaled their support. The government 
suggested a 20 percent cut in the expenses of President Boris 
Yeltsin's staff. The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, had 
previously demanded a 40 percent cut in the Kremlin's spending. The 
parliament's staff will be cut by only 4 percent, as the 
legislature had insisted. Yeltsin had earlier asked for a 12 
percent cut across the board.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The risky world of day trading in stocks has  
become so popular among ordinary investors that the ``Doonesbury'' 
comic strip is chronicling the day-by-day progress of a character 
who has embarked on it. The buttoned-down Chase opened an online 
day-trading account this week with a $10,000 deposit -- actually 
less than most day-trading companies charge amateur investors to 
open an account. By today's episode, Chase was ready to buy shares 
of imaginary company E-Bid, a new business ``with only one product 
-- its own stock.'' His adrenaline rush was palpable. A day earlier, 
he masked his fear when the Nasdaq Stock Market dropped 63 points 
and he was suddenly down 40 percent on his trades.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Settles With Bowden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn officials are finished dealing  
with Terry Bowden. Now they'd like to get out of dealing with Bobby 
Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn athletic director David Housel said Wednesday the school  
is looking at alternatives to its Sept. 2 season opener against 
Florida State, a game originally billed as a father-son matchup. 
But now that Terry Bowden is no longer Auburn's coach, playing 
against Bobby Bowden's Seminoles doesn't seem so appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not accurate to say we are trying to get out of it, but  
we are looking at all of the options that would be suitable for 
handling this situation,'' Housel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school reached a financial settlement with Terry Bowden on  
Monday, which bans the former Tigers coach and his wife from 
criticizing the school. Now Housel -- and new Auburn coach Tommy 
Tuberville -- want out of the Florida State game. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I don't want is for our players to have to rehash what  
has gone on over the last three months,'' Tuberville said. ``I 
would just hate for them to have to go through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting out of the game would be the final bit of Bowden  
business for Auburn, which has been trying for months to move past 
Terry Bowden's ugly midseason resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement closes the door on Terry Bowden's 5 1/2 seasons at  
Auburn. He gets a lump sum payment of $620,000, a lakeside home for 
five years and two cars the ex-coach had before he resigned Oct. 23 
after opening the season with a 1-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, he and his wife, Shyrl, agreed not to make  
``statements that could be construed as negative or derogatory 
toward Auburn, the Auburn athletics department or its employees or 
the Auburn Board of Trustees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was presented to us and I didn't have a problem with  
it,'' Terry Bowden told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``My 
wife and I are comfortable with the settlement and consider it the 
end of an ugly and disappointing situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bowdens' violate the agreement, they may be required to  
repay the $620,000, pay the $850,000 mortgage on the house, which 
is owned by the Auburn Alumni Association, and give back the cars, 
which he can keep for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said the gag order was ``strongly recommended'' by  
attorneys for both Bowden and the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally did not think it was that big of a deal,'' Housel  
said. ``But the attorneys thought it was a good idea so we included 
it. It was just a routine thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bowdens' deal with the university took effect Monday, the  
same day Tuberville signed a contract with the school worth at 
least $770,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Auburn will try to help Tuberville avoid the game against  
his predecessor's father. The Mobile Register initially reported 
Wednesday that Auburn was trying to get out of the game at a cost 
to Auburn of up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Register reported that a new opponent has been lined up for  
an Auburn home game on Sept. 4, and the school is working with 
ESPN, which owns the rights to the game, to find a replacement team 
to play FSU for the Thursday night telecast. 
</P>
<P>
	David Nagel, a spokesman for ESPN, said that was ``absolutely  
not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The game is scheduled and we are taking no position to change  
this,'' Nagel said. ``We hope and expect the game to take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden said if the game is canceled, FSU officials ``won't  
have had anything to do with getting out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't believe the red tape we had to go through to get  
this game,'' Bobby Bowden said. ``We went through a lot of 
extremes, changing our schedule and going through the conference.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall for 4th Straight Session / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell for a fourth straight day  
Thursday as strong economic readings stoked inflation concerns and 
traders braced for a big supply of new Treasury securities due next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32  
point, or $4.69 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.29 percent from 5.25 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds fell in the morning as national retailers reported  
better-than-expected sales for January while the government 
reported factory orders jumped 2.3 percent during December. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, the data suggest that the economy may not need any  
more stimulus from the Federal Reserve, where officials may be 
growing more concerned about inflationary pressures than the drag 
of economic turmoil overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its Dec.  
22 meeting, revealing that the central bank's policy on interest 
rates has turned neutral after three cuts during the fall. The 
minutes were released a day after the Fed officials left interest 
rates unchanged after one of their periodic strategy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also said traders are concerned about how well the  
market will absorb next week's auction of $35 billion in new 
Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Thursday, the Lehman Brothers Daily  
Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with 
maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.67 points to 1,305.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.46 percent as the  
discount remained unchanged at 4.36 percent. Six-month yields were 
4.54 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.39 
percent. One-year yields were 4.61 percent as the discount rose 
0.03 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.50 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 13/32 to 124 30/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.14 percent from 5.12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Different Bulls Team To Face Jazz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- There is a certain spot on the Delta  
Center floor where Michael Jordan hit the final, 
championship-winning shot of his incomparable career. 
</P>
<P>
	The next member of the Chicago Bulls to shoot on that hallowed  
ground could be Rusty LaRue. 
</P>
<P>
	The wretched remains of the six-time world champions will return  
Friday to the scene of their club's last triumph, a Game 6 NBA 
Finals win over the Utah Jazz that capped Jordan's career and 
signaled the end of Chicago's basketball reign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a delicious bit of payback, the Jazz, who saw their  
championship dreams twice crushed by Jordan and his teammates, have 
the opportunity to throw the first punch in what will probably be a 
season of beatings for the depleted Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie coach Tim Floyd has the dubious honor of beginning his  
rebuilding project in one of the NBA's most hostile environments. 
</P>
<P>
	A ripple of excitement spread through Salt Lake City two weeks  
ago when the NBA released its shortened schedule and a rematch 
between the conference champions was right at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd and the Bulls realize that, Jordan or no Jordan, Jazz fans  
will always have it in for anybody wearing Chicago's red and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to boo us as soon as we get off the airplane,''  
said Ron Harper, the only remaining starter from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to know this is a different team, and I'll pass this  
word,'' Floyd said with a laugh. ``I think regardless of who is 
coming in, the Bulls or any other team, Utah is going to be sending 
a statement early and quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While their fans may think otherwise, the Jazz players aren't  
attaching any special meaning to the meeting. For them, running 
with the Bulls is just the first lap in a race they hope will end 
in the champions' circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of 50 games we've got to play well in to make a  
run at the playoffs,'' Karl Malone said. ``Michael, Scottie 
(Pippen) and Dennis (Rodman) were the Bulls. It's not like that any 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Chicago bears only faint resemblance to the Bulls of eight  
months ago, the biggest change the Jazz made was allowing utility 
big man Antoine Carr to sign with the Rockets. He has been replaced 
by Thurl Bailey, who has been out of the league since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in basketball and in other sports like to build it  
up and tear it down, but that's not what we're trying to do,'' 
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We've got a bunch of quality players 
together, and they've played together for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, who manned the bench at Iowa State last year and has  
never played or coached professionally, is up against Sloan, a 
former Bulls playing great who begins his 11th season in Utah, by 
far the longest tenure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's in a tough situation,'' Sloan said of Floyd. ``I'm  
sure he'll make the best of it, but it would be a really tough 
thing to do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls franchise is making a definite effort toward a fresh  
start. The seven remaining players and three assistant coaches from 
last year's team quietly received their championship rings 
Wednesday at the Bulls' practice facility, rather than during a 
public ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, Brent Barry and Toni Kukoc are definite starters for the  
Bulls on Friday. Beyond that, it gets murky: Floyd will likely 
start journeymen Andrew Lang or veteran Bill Wennington at center 
and Mario Bennett or Dickey Simpkins at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost both of its preseason games to the Indiana Pacers,  
but also showed more life than some expected. In particular, Kukoc 
scored 32 points in the Bulls' 89-83 loss in their final 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not the same team, but they're still the Bulls,'' Jeff  
Hornacek said. ``We respect that.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns Ambulances About Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The valve on a type of oxygen tank commonly  
used in ambulances can explode and cause serious burns, the 
government warned Thursday as it moved to take the equipment off 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a rare risk -- some 200,000 of the tanks are in use, yet the  
Food and Drug Administration knows of only 16 explosions in four 
years. Eleven people were seriously burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the flash fires are dangerous enough that the FDA told  
manufacturers to recall the equipment, aluminum valves called 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injured were rescue workers opening the valves,  
although some patients were burned, too. Within days, FDA officials 
will write rescue squads and other emergency workers nationwide 
with some ``common-sense precautions'' to minimize the risk until 
the valves are fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA didn't act soon enough, and needs to take additional steps  
to ensure every at-risk oxygen regulator is fixed fast, said 
Richard Duffy, occupational health director of the International 
Association of Fire Fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which represents 230,000 firefighters, alerted FDA to  
the problem in 1996 when firefighters in Texas and Colorado were 
burned. The union again complained in June, when a Broward County, 
Fla., firefighter suffered burns to 38 percent of his upper body 
during a routine check of oxygen tanks. At the firefighters' 
urging, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
then asked FDA to reinvestigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a potential for the same hazard to occur to every user  
out there,'' Duffy warned. 
</P>
<P>
	While ambulances and other emergency vehicles are the major  
users of this equipment, the FDA acknowledged Thursday that a small 
number of patients also may have the product at home. Its records 
show one patient was burned when an oxygen device strapped to her 
shoulder caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these are not going to burn,'' stressed Dr. Bruce  
Burlington, FDA's medical devices chief. ``Thousands of them are 
used everyday and we have only 16 reports accumulated over years. 
But it's an important and real risk when it happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Healthcare Products of St. Louis, which makes 60 percent  
of the oxygen regulators sold, agreed to a recall Thursday. Within 
several weeks, it will replace oxygen regulators sold under its 
Life Support Products brand, including models LSP 106, 270, 280, 
370 and 735. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are high-pressure oxygen canisters, similar to those  
scuba divers use, found mostly in hospitals and ambulances. On top 
of the canisters are valves, or regulators, that determine how fast 
the high-pressure oxygen escapes from the tank into an oxygen mask. 
Most hospitals use hard-to-burn brass regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	But most emergency vehicles use lighter-weight aluminum  
regulators, which can burn fairly easily, Burlington said. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, patients typically use portable liquid oxygen canisters  
or steel oxygen tanks, he said. But some patients may own the 
at-risk aluminum model, and can check by calling their oxygen 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	When the FDA learned of the first fires several years ago,  
engineers thought the problem was that dust or other particles 
seeped into the canisters and caused friction, making the oxygen 
explode. So FDA ordered manufacturers to add a screen filter to the 
tanks. But this year's fires showed a filter didn't solve the 
problem, Burlington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until replacing the regulators, rescue workers can minimize  
their risk, he said: Crank the valve slowly, so there's less 
friction. Keep tanks and related equipment scrupulously clean, 
particularly when refilling the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	----------	 
</P>
<P>
	Allied's recall hot line is 1-800-231-5273.

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Says Padres Still Have Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn thinks the San Diego Padres will  
remain competitive despite the loss of several stars who helped 
them reach the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question, of course, is how much so.  
</P>
<P>
	The Padres held a hot-stove session with the media on Thursday,  
and the big topic was Tuesday's trade of Greg Vaughn, who set the 
club record with 50 homers, to the Cincinnati Reds for Reggie 
Sanders, Damian Jackson and a minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn followed Kevin Brown, Steve Finley, Ken Caminiti and Joey  
Hamilton out of town, leaving many fans angry and feeling betrayed 
after voters overwhelmingly approved a new downtown ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who's entering his 18th season with the Padres, said he  
understands the fans' frustration, but also understands the club's 
need to become younger and faster. One thing for sure, he said, is 
that players won't speak openly of their chances to reach the World 
Series, like they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you, most people will look at teams on paper and  
they'll go right to the highest payrolls and say, `This team's got 
a chance to win,''' said Gwynn, who's 72 hits shy of 3,000. ``They 
won't say that about us, and rightfully so. I think after you go to 
the World Series and you get rid of (five) guys, you can't expect 
to have a chance to go to the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Padres still have to go out and play, ``and that's where  
a guy like me comes in, because that's my job, to remind guys that 
we still have to work and prepare and do the things we have to do 
for this upcoming season, like we're trying to get to the World 
Series,'' Gwynn said. ``You just won't hear people as open about 
last year's chances of winning the whole thing, because we were 
pretty blunt about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres beat the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves to reach  
the World Series, only to be swept by the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego had no chance of keeping Brown, who got a staggering  
$105 million over seven seasons from the hated division rival Los 
Angeles Dodgers. Finley went to Arizona and Caminiti back to 
Houston, both for more money, and Hamilton was traded to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason the Padres traded Vaughn was because he's in the  
final year of his contract, and if came anywhere near the 50-homer, 
119-RBI season he had in 1998, the Padres feared he might seek as 
much as $10 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres, who play in a small broadcast market, say they've  
lost $50 million the last four seasons. They say they'll have 
roughly the same payroll as they did at the start of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever the realist, Gwynn wondered whether the Padres will be able  
to keep closer Trevor Hoffman, who will earn $4.1 million in the 
final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you, the price has gone up,'' Gwynn said. ``If  
they can sign him, great. If they can't, don't be surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman emerged as baseball's most dominant closer last year,  
tying the NL record with 53 saves in 54 chances and finishing 
second in the Cy Young balloting behind Atlanta's Tom Glavine. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Kevin Towers said he had productive talks with  
Hoffman's agents before the winter meetings and hopes to reopen 
them during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and Sanders, meanwhile, said they're eager to win over  
Padres fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think once the city of San Diego sees how enthusiastic me  
and Reggie are, how much spunk we're going to try to bring to the 
team, and hustle and effort and things of that nature, they're 
going to quickly realize that we're here to help, not to hurt,'' 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we're sorry for their loss. I mean, who wouldn't fall in  
love with a 50 home run guy?''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Trim Losses Dow Off 40.42 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were lower at midday but trimming  
their losses, in a skittish market riddled with speculation about 
what the Federal Reserve will do to interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 40.42 at 9,326.39. The Dow dropped as low as 9,275.15, down 91 
points, before hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow rose 92.69 to close at 9,366.61 in heavy  
trading, in relief that Fed had not raised interest rates at a 
policy meeting that wrapped up Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	But this morning, the rumor on Wall Street was that minutes from  
the Fed's previous meeting in December, which are scheduled to be 
released today, will show a shift among central bankers toward 
tighter monetary policy in the future, said Charles White, 
portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern that interest rates will go higher has sent bond prices  
lower and affected stocks as well, White said, especially financial 
and utility stocks that tend to react more sensitively to changes 
in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones utility index was down 2.82 points, or 0.96  
percent, at 292.13. Dow industrials component Citigroup was down 1 1/8 
at 53 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad market indexes were lower as investors took profits in  
technology shares, with the exception of online trading companies, 
which were hi 
</P>
<P>
	gher. The Nasdaq composite, in which technology stocks are  
heavily represented, was down 44.39 at 2,449.02, while the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 composite was down 14.49 at 1,257.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Many portfolio managers are sitting out the market ahead of  
Friday's release of January employment data. Some traders fear the 
report will show a drop in unemployment that could put pressure on 
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Higher rates are not 
good for stock prices because they raise corporate financing costs 
and can cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get to the day before the release of the employment  
situation report, people who aren't day-trading will sit with their 
position and go into the number pretty much flat from where they 
went in today,'' White said. ``Don't do much the day before that 
report. That gives the day-traders the chance to move the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 391.98 million 
shares, up from Wednesday's pace of 357.44 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reportd that orders to U.S.  
factories jumped 2.3 percent during December, but they rose just

<HEADLINE> Gas Blamed for Ford Plant Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A gas buildup in the boiler of a power station at  
the Ford Motor Co. Rouge complex caused an explosion that destroyed 
the station and killed a worker, a state inspector said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast Monday injured more than 20 other Ford workers, 15 of  
whom remained in critical condition Thursday. It cut off power and 
shut down production at the 1,100-acre complex where 10,000 people 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	A boiler inspector from the state Department of Consumer and  
Industry Services examined the remains of the coal-fired power 
plant Thursday and traced the blast to boiler No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Johnson said the blast was caused by a furnace explosion.  
He said gas built up inside the firebox of the boiler and then 
ignited. 
</P>
<P>
	The firebox generated heat that turned water into steam to power  
the plant's electrical generators. The steam also powered other 
factory operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The boiler was made in 1965 and was one of the newer ones at the  
Rouge complex, which has some boilers dating from the 1930s, agency 
spokeswoman Maura Campbell said. It last was inspected Feb. 20, 
1998, and was due soon for an annual check. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the last thing we'll be able to do for a  
while,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``A lot of the other questions are 
going to take some time to answer, like why was there a buildup of 
gas in the boiler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another key question is what ignited the gas, the agency said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford is pushing to resume full production on Monday at the  
complex, which makes Ford Mustangs as well as engines and a variety 
of other vehicle components used at 16 of Ford's 20 North American 
assembly plants.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Excerpts-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Thursday's Senate impeachment trial:  
</P>
<P>
	``We need witnesses, ladies and gentlemen, to clarify who said  
what, who's being honest, who's not, and what really did happen in 
this sordid tale.'' -- Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Give us this witness. We will do it in a professional manner.  
We will focus on the obstruction. We will try to do it in a way not 
to demean the Senate. We will try to do it in a way not to demean 
Ms. Lewinsky. We will try to do it in a way to get to the truth. 
Please give us a chance to present our case in a persuasive 
fashion. Because unlike the House, everything is in dispute here.'' 
-- Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To release these videotapes generally to the public, which  
will happen if they're put into the record, inevitably will surely 
cause consternation among those members of the public, particularly 
parents who do not choose to spend one more moment, much less hours 
and even days, thinking about the president's relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky and explaining it yet again to their children.'' -- 
Greg Craig, presidential attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not wise or right to suspend judgment and turn over, for  
public viewing, the videotaped testimony of private witnesses who 
were forced to appear and to testify under compulsion.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``One can only ask: Who really benefits from this kind of  
practice? Is it really in the public interest for the Senate to 
issue and serve a subpoena on private individuals like Monica 
Lewinsky or Vernon Jordan, to summon these citizens before the 
Senate, to compel their testimony before video cameras, and then to 
take that videotaped testimony, without any consideration or 
thought about the legitimate personal concerns or interests of 
those witnesses, to release those videotapes of that testimony to 
the national media? 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it really in Ms. Lewinsky's interest to do this? Is it in  
the interest of her family or of her future? Is it fair to Mr. 
Jordan or to his family to subject him to this kind of treatment? 
Is it really in the Senate's interest? Is it in the interest of the 
Constitution or the presidency or of the American people to have 
videotape of Monica Lewinsky readily available for all the world to 
see and to hear?'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be sure that the release of this testimony and of this  
video tape will only add to the agony, to the embarrassment, and to 
the humiliation. And I'd only hope that those who purport to be 
concerned about the moral damage that can be attributed to the 
president's conduct and the president's example are equally mindful 
of the hurt that will be inflicted on innocent people by the mere 
broadcasting of these video tapes and their existence in perpetuity 
in the public record and the public domain.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, is  
simple: You do not need for these videotapes released to do your 
constitutional duty, and the people we all work for do not want 
these videotapes released either.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Live testimony from these three individuals or from Ms.  
Lewinsky alone will be worse than an exercise in redundancy. It 
will be an exercise in excess. It will only postpone the end of a 
trial that nobody wants anymore and no one wants to prolong any 
longer.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is worth asking: Will the public's respect for  
the Senate and for the members of this body be enhanced by calling 
live witnesses? Does the Senate really feel a need or an obligation 
or some requirement to bring Ms. Lewinsky to sit here and to 
testify in the well of this historic chamber?'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In our view, the Senate has indulged the managers. And despite  
the misgivings of many senators, the Senate has leaned over 
backwards to accommodate the managers. We believe it is time for 
the Senate to say it's time to vote.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In truth, there are no bombshells in that testimony. There is  
no dynamite, there are no explosions. We believe that highlighting, 
explaining and calling attention to those parts of that testimony 
that is important can be done with the transcripts, and the 
transcripts more than satisfy the requirement that we see or the 
need to conduct that function, or to carry out that function. 
That's what ordinary lawyers do when they are trying cases or 
arguing in front of a jury.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe an impeachment trial is not exactly the same as any  
other trial, but in the history of the Senate, it has been a 
basically open process, except for the voting. It has been an 
opportunity for witnesses to come before you.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``For those of you who do believe the president is guilty of  
these crimes, you have an obligation to let the showing of these 
depositions or the presentation preferably of Monica Lewinsky live 
to be here so those who maybe don't think the same way you do have 
an opportunity for that credibility to be judged. Only if the 
witness is present can they be judged that way.'' -- McCollum.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Trial Starts in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot whose jet clipped a ski  
gondola cable and killed 20 people in Italy last year cannot be 
forced to testify about a missing videotape shot before the 
accident, a judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The setback for prosecutors came before lawyers began  
questioning potential jurors to hear the case of Capt. Richard 
Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, also ruled prosecutors cannot  
see unpublished notes and tapes about the case belonging to CBS' 
``60 Minutes'' and Rolling Stone magazine. A ``60 Minutes'' program 
on the cable car tragedy was telecast Jan. 24; the Rolling Stone 
story was published in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen Marine officers -- all of equal or superior rank to  
Ashby -- were summoned as possible jurors at the court-martial. The 
selection process is expected to continue Friday. Opening arguments 
are planned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	An EA-6B Prowler radar-jamming jet flown by Ashby severed the  
Mount Cermis gondola cable in the Italian Alps on Feb. 3, 1998. The 
jet was supposed to be at a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet when it 
hit the cable, suspended 370 feet above the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	During a motions hearing before jury selection, Nunley said the  
case against Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, was weak 
and he would be inclined to dismiss it. Because he isn't the 
presiding judge in that case, however, Nunley refused a defense 
motion to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
	The court-martial of Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., begins  
March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and  
faces a maximum sentence of more than 200 years. He also is charged 
with obstruction of justice for allegedly destroying the tape. He 
will be tried separately on that charge. Schweitzer faces the same 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Both formally entered innocent pleas Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Nunley said if Ashby decides to testify, forcing him to talk  
about what happened to the missing videotape would violate his 
constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby had brought his personal video camera on the flight, and  
he gave it to Schweitzer to use, the judge said. A week after the 
flight, another member of the jet's four-man crew was told the tape 
had been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Debtor Triggers China Bank Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAIKOU, China (AP) -- A cautionary tale for China's troubled  
banking industry: Its first bank failure under communist rule 
started with a single debtor. 
</P>
<P>
	A speculator in stocks and real estate who couldn't repay loans  
worth $200 million in 1997 bankrupted 28 credit unions. The local 
Hainan Development Bank was ordered to absorb them. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus began a rapid decline for the bank that exposed rampant  
mismanagement and fraud, said Chi Fulin, a Haikou-based government 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	This financial horror story from tropical Hainan island, some  
1,500 miles from Beijing in the South China Sea, echoes with 
similarities to the U.S. savings-and-loan crisis of the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say managers of the Hainan bank ignored their advice,  
paid illegally high interest rates to attract deposits, falsified 
accounts and accepted bribes in exchange for approving loans, Chi 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	China's central bank lent the Hainan Development Bank some $350  
million to absorb the failed credit unions. But by early 1998 the 
Hainan bank, known in Chinese as Haifa, was running out of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing impending disaster, the Hainan government injected money  
into Haifa and filed more than 400 lawsuits aimed at recovering 
outstanding loans, according to an account Chi wrote for the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too late. After panicked depositors started a run on  
their accounts, regulators declared Haifa insolvent on June 21 and 
closed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank was taken over by Industrial and Commercial Bank of  
China, one of four main state-owned commercial banks, which began 
to reimburse depositors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank regulators point to the takeover as a sign of their  
ruthless determination to clean up China's debt-laden banks. They 
say it also is a warning of what could happen if they don't act 
decisively. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hainan Development Bank is not the only case. This could  
happen in other places,'' said Chi, who is executive director of 
the China Institute for Reform and Development. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the Haifa rescue to the Chinese treasury is unclear.  
</P>
<P>
	Hainan Development Bank had some $3 billion in assets, according  
to Chi. It isn't clear how much of that can be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, ICBC was paying out $35 million of its own money every  
day to reimburse former Haifa depositors, according to Chi. He said 
that after the panic subsided, many put their money back in the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hainan Development Bank was set up in 1995. Owned by the  
Hainan government and a group of state companies, it was meant to 
finance projects to improve the economy of Hainan. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse has wiped out a source of loans and scared  
depositors away from local banks just when the island's slumping 
economy needs credit, Chi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If other provinces can draw lessons from this closure, it will  
have great preventive value,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Ed McCaffrey looked like a man badly in need of  
a nap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos' wide receiver tried to add up his hours of  
sleep over the past four days. The total, he decided, was around 10 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But he certainly wasn't complaining about the hectic schedule  
that began in Miami, stretched across to Denver, then to Los 
Angeles, then finally to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a Super Bowl title, a victory parade in Colorado, a TV  
appearance with Jay Leno, then on to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to let it all soak in,'' McCaffrey said,  
shaking his head at the blur of the past four days. ``I do know 
I've had an awful lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fun will continue Sunday, when McCaffrey and no less than  
nine of his Denver teammates will suit up for the NFC against the 
AFC in the all-star game at Aloha Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said he's a little starry-eyed being in his first Pro  
Bowl.

	``I've watched some of these guys play on TV for years,'' he  
said. ``Some of them, I've played against, but all these great 
players here, I'm awed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some of the Broncos practiced for the first time with the  
NFC on Wednesday, three Denver all-stars -- John Elway, Terrell 
Davis and Steve Atwater -- had not yet arrived in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Romanowski was another who did make it to practice.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great year, we won it all, and now I'm here at the  
Pro Bowl. This is what it's all about,'' Romanowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos linebacker will be making just his second Pro Bowl  
appearance, but he's been in more Super Bowls than most. The 
11-year veteran has won two Super Bowl rings with the Broncos after 
playing for the champion 49ers in 1988 and 1989. The latter was San 
Francisco's 55-10 rout of the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	One of just 13 players to win a Super Bowl in each conference,  
Romanowski said he's honored to be back at the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a few years when I felt like maybe I deserved it  
but didn't get it,'' he said. ``So it feels really good to be voted 
into the game by the guys you play against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead to next season, when the Broncos will be aiming  
for an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl victory, Romanowski 
said he will join a chorus of those trying to talk Elway into one 
more year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody will talk to him about coming back,''  
Romanowski said. ``But I just hope he does what's best for him and 
his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Minnesota Vikings running back Robert Smith was  
named as a replacement for Detroit's Barry Sanders, who has injured 
ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who will be making his first appearance in the Pro Bowl,  
finished the 1998 season fifth in the NFC in rushing with 1,187 
yards.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Show Lewinsky Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though senators chose not to call her for live  
testimony, Monica Lewinsky makes clear in her videotaped deposition 
that she now has ``mixed feelings'' for President Clinton and 
insists he never suggested she file a false affidavit to deny their 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton's impeachment trial a week or less from completion,  
Ms. Lewinsky, in testimony obtained by The Associated Press late 
Thursday, cast doubt on Clinton's sworn testimony that he told her 
she might have to turn over presidential gifts if they were 
subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did the president ever tell you to turn over the gifts?'' Rep.  
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., asked in the Monday deposition. ``Not that I 
remember,'' Ms. Lewinsky answered. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors are trying to show that the president's  
efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job were linked to her filing a 
false affidavit denying their affair and that the hiding of gifts 
he had given her was part of a scheme by Clinton to obstruct 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky at times helped both the prosecutors and the  
president in the deposition, which was scheduled for public release 
today. Snippets of the videotape will be played to television 
viewers at the trial on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	After rejecting live testimony Thursday, the Senate voted to  
release the complete transcripts of Ms. Lewinsky, presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors originally wanted live testimony by all three  
witnesses. But with many Senate Republicans content to admit only 
the videotape into evidence, the managers scaled back their request 
to Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, the Senate responded with a stinging rebuke,  
rejecting the proposal on a 70-30 vote. Twenty-five Republicans 
joined all 45 Democrats in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was in recess today, so both sides could prepare for  
Saturday's presentations, which also may include White House use of 
the videotape. Closing arguments will be held Monday, and then 
deliberations, with a vote expected next Friday or sooner on 
conviction or acquittal of the president on perjury and obstruction 
of justice charges. Republicans and Democrats agree that the 67 
votes needed to convict and remove Clinton are lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday was a day of retreat both for the House managers and  
Senate Republicans, who abandoned proposals for ``findings of 
fact'' that would have declared presidential wrongdoing without 
removing Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think it's time we get to a vote and we move on'' to  
other issues, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said some language to disapprove Clinton's conduct was  
still under consideration by Republicans, but it was unclear 
whether any GOP proposal would mesh with a planned Democratic 
censure resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	In her deposition, Ms. Lewinsky testified that in a  
middle-of-the-night telephone call initiated by Clinton on Dec. 17, 
1997, the president suggested she could file an affidavit to avoid 
being deposed in the Jones case. Clinton told her in that 
conversation that she had been made a potential witness by the 
Jones attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked whether the president suggested what she might  
say in the affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``There was no 
discussion of what would be in an affidavit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would  
have to be false,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The questioning turned personal when Bryant asked Ms. Lewinsky  
whether she still had ``feelings for the president'' a year after 
she was thrust unwillingly into the impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings,'' she replied. She answered ``yes''  
twice when asked if she still admired the president and appreciated 
``what he is doing for this country as the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Dec. 17 conversation, Ms. Lewinsky testified that Clinton  
``said it broke his heart ... that my name was on the witness 
list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky then asked, ``Can I take a break please. I'm  
sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the questioning resumed, Ms. Lewinsky was asked to describe  
her reaction when she learned she might be called as a witness in 
the politically charged Jones case against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared,'' she responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky testified that Clinton at one point in the  
conversation also reminded her of the cover stories they had 
devised earlier to hide their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the president said something like, ``You can  
always say you were coming to see (Oval Office secretary) Betty 
(Currie) or bringing me papers,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, was that in connection with the affidavit?'' Bryant  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe so, no,'' she said, striking down a theory  
prosecutors have held that the cover stories had been suggested to 
her to encourage her to file a false affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a Dec. 28, 1997, meeting Clinton, during which they  
discussed what to do with the subpoenaed gifts, Ms. Lewinsky 
replied: ``And as I've testified numerously, his response was 
either ranging from no response to 'I don't know or let me think 
about it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, Mrs. Currie came to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment to  
pick up the gifts. House prosecutors concluded that Clinton sent 
his secretary to get them, but there is no direct testimony to 
support that. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has attacked the prosecution case on the gift  
retrieval, especially the House's reliance on a brief phone call 
from Mrs. Currie to Ms. Lewinsky about 3:30 p.m. that day. White 
House lawyers noted Ms. Lewinsky testified the transfer took place 
about 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	But in her deposition, Ms. Lewinsky said she had additional  
phone conversations with Mrs. Currie that day and they discussed 
``when she was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her 2 p.m. estimate may have been wrong.

	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Scenes from the life of Bob  
Cornuke: 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian hieroglyphics of cattle on stone slabs oddly out of  
place in the Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers with guns.  
</P>
<P>
	The granite top of a security-fenced mountain blackened by  
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Millennium-old local stories about a visit from the Hebrew  
nation when Moses was its leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornuke is not a movie scriptwriter. He heads a foundation,  
Bible Archaeology, Search and Expeditions, that hunts down sites of 
biblical importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're (taught) that this is myth and legend,'' said Cornuke,  
who acknowledged he was looking for fun when he got involved in his 
first Biblical explorations with Apollo 15 astronaut and moonwalker 
Jim Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin's moon trip proved a religious revelation after which he  
retired and hunted for Noah's Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, this was adventure; maybe we'd find something,''  
Cornuke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, he had pursued many careers: police SWAT team  
member, Washington lobbyist, real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
	But a literal mountaintop experience changed him, leaving him to  
conclude the Bible is ``100 percent historically true.'' He told 
himself: ``Morally editing it to fit my lifestyle was over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change came during a clandestine visit to a fenced-off  
mountain in Saudi Arabia, where he and fellow explorer Larry 
Williams discovered what experts consider the original Mount Sinai, 
from which, the Bible says, God delivered the Ten Commandments into 
Moses' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I stood on those scorched rocks, it was like a floodgate  
opening in my life. My life was changed in that 10-15 minutes,'' 
Cornuke said. 
</P>
<P>
	He dedicated himself to finding other archaeological support for  
the Bible. ``To make a decision'' about God, he said, ``you need to 
have all the information available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On today's maps, Mount Sinai is on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. But  
Cornuke says there are dozens of references in the Old Testament 
that say the Hebrew nation, escaping from the Egyptian Pharaoh, 
``went out of'' Egypt before reaching the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Williams, using the literal directions in the New King  
James Bible, traced the route of the fleeing nation, putting the 
crossing of the Red Sea at the tip of the Sinai Peninsula, locating 
the bitter springs of Marah, the separate site of 12 springs and 70 
palms, and Jabal al Lawz in Saudi Arabia, which they believe to be 
the biblical Mount Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
	There, they found an altar that they concluded matched one  
described in Exodus 24, boundary markers described in Exodus 19, a 
split rock described in Exodus 17, and a cave described in 1 Kings 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered evidence of what apparently was a huge lake  
below the mountain in a region that gets one-half inch of rain 
every 10 years, which they consider evidence of the story in which 
Moses struck a rock and water gushed out onto the desert, saving 
the Hebrews. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian hieroglyphics on stones at Jabal al Lawz showed bovine  
animals, which are not indigenous there, and locals repeat stories 
learned from earlier generations about a visit from Moses. 
</P>
<P>
	Penetrating the security perimeter at the mountain, they also  
found the top covered with granite rocks that had been melted by an 
exterior heat source, because while the exteriors were burned 
smooth as glass, the interiors of boulders were untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Exodus story, God descended on Mount Sinai in flames and  
smoke like a furnace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The visible evidence is quite overwhelming: the location of  
the true Mount Sinai has been discovered in the ancient land of 
Midian, known today as Saudi Arabia,'' said Dr. Roy Knutson, 
another explorer who also has spent time on digs at prominent 
archaeological ruins. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornuke and Williams' discovery is the subject of a video, ``The  
Search for the Real Mount Sinai.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill McCartney, who founded the Promise Keepers Christian  
ministry, called it ``the most powerful thing I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Katzenberg, whose DreamWorks studio produced the recent  
hit ``Prince of Egypt,'' wrote in an endorsement of the video, 
``There really isn't anything quite like standing on the very 
ground where dramatic and tumultuous events have taken place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornuke and Williams both seek further investigation by experts,  
but doubt whether the Saudi government will allow it. Cornuke has 
been arrested on allegations of espionage during his expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
	He is now working on an expedition concerning Noah's Ark. He  
also said he has clues to the whereabouts of the Ark of the 
Covenant, the gold and acacia wood box containing the Ten 
Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	While some archaeologists decry the involvement of amateurs in  
their work, Ken Durham, professor of Old Testament history at 
Colorado Christian University, notes the Dead Sea Scrolls were 
found by a shepherd boy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the impact of the expeditions could be immeasurable.  
</P>
<P>
	Proving the authenticity of particular events in the Bible  
``ultimately has a bearing on everything in it,'' Durham said. ``If 
it's not historically reliable, it's just not reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a witness in a courtroom.''

<HEADLINE> Palladium Up Again on Russia Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Palladium futures jumped more than 3 percent Thursday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange in continued buying brought on by fears 
Russia, the world's largest producer, will delay new shipments for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Other precious metals futures also surged. On other markets,  
crude and its products slumped, while meat and livestock rallied a 
second day. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium continued its weeklong surge as Japanese auto and  
electronics manufacturers scrambled to secure new supplies in the 
face of halted shipments from Russia, which produces about 
two-thirds of the world's supply. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third year, Russia has not shipped precious metals since  
December amid bureaucratic delays. In previous years, those delays 
have extended into June, causing palladium to become the world's 
most valuable precious metal. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers have increasingly turned to palladium for use in  
electronics and automobile catalysts that are required in many 
countries to reduce emissions. While many Japanese producers in 
particular have stocked up in anticipation of such a scenario with 
Russia, most have inventories that will comfortably last only 
through February. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium for March delivery rose $11.70, or 3 percent, to  
$362.70 an ounce; April platinum rose $7.10 to $362 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures also continued their rise amid signs of  
tightening inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	March silver jumped 21.7 cents, or 4 percent, to $5.76 an ounce,  
helping boost April gold $1.90 to $291.20 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil futures pressured other energy prices on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange as investors eyed forecasts for warmer 
weather that would cap a lackluster season for demand in major 
heating regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service's 10-day forecasts consistently  
have called for above-normal to much above-normal temperatures in 
the Northeast and Midwest, the nation's largest heating areas, and 
with the peak demand season winding down market, participants are 
concerned about ample supplies for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude also fell in delayed reaction to industry data that showed  
inventories continue to rise despite attempts by world oil 
producers to cut output and prop prices. 
</P>
<P>
	March crude fell 36 cents to $12.02 a barrel; March heating oil  
fell 1.04 cents to 31.35 cents a gallon; March unleaded gasoline 
fell 1.56 cents to 35.75 cents a gallon; March natural gas rose 6.5 
cents to $1.835 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange in continued enthusiasm tied to the government's 
announcement it soon will begin shipping pork and beef products to 
economically beleaguered Russia under an aid package announced late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .38 cent to 67.35 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .50 cent to 74.30 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose the limit 2 cents to 45.92 cents a pound; March pork bellies 
rose the limit 3 cents to 60.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Debate Cisneros Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawyer for former Housing Secretary Henry  
Cisneros tried to convince a federal appeals court panel Thursday 
that his client should not be prosecuted whether or not he lied to 
the FBI about payments to a former mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros pleaded innocent last year to charges he lied to  
investigators during his routine background check before 
President-elect Bill Clinton named him to his first Cabinet in 
early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros was alleged to have vastly underreported the amount he  
had paid a former mistress. He also allegedly lied about the timing 
of payments to the woman, Linda Jones, then known by her married 
name of Medlar. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Barry Simon argued that because presidents have the sole  
constitutional power to pick whom they choose as Cabinet nominees, 
what Cisneros told the FBI is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, after all, could ignore any information the FBI gave  
him, Simon argued before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question of the FBI is only relevant to the extent that  
the president decides it is,'' Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon did not say whether Cisneros did, in fact, lie.  
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros won Senate confirmation in 1993 and served as housing  
secretary until 1996, when he resigned to become president of 
Univision Communications Inc. He retained Clinton's support 
throughout an investigation into the payments to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The court system has no business prying into the Cabinet  
selection process, Cisneros' lawyers argue. A lower federal court 
disagreed and refused the throw out a 21-count indictment last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question of nomination is a wholly political process,''  
Simon argued to the openly skeptical judges, one of whom called the 
argument ``a very odd separation of powers claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor for Independent Counsel David Barrett called  
Simon's argument contrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is a red herring inserted into the trial,''  
prosecutor Mathew Rosengart argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' trial, once scheduled for last fall, is on hold while  
the appeals court reviews the case. The panel, which includes two 
Republican appointees and one Democrat, is likely to rule this 
spring.

<HEADLINE> Injecting New Drug Reverses Strokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- For the first time, doctors have shown  
they can reverse massive strokes up to six hours after the start of 
symptoms by squirting a new clot-dissolving medicine directly into 
the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The new approach offers potentially better treatment for the  
worst strokes and a doubling of the three-hour window that now is 
the deadline for stroke victims to get help before they suffer 
permanent brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors tested the medicine, called prourokinase, on people who  
suffered a particularly serious form of the disease that accounts 
for about one-third of the approximately 600,000 strokes treated in 
the United States annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a massive stroke, this gives you the best chance  
of a decent outcome,'' said Dr. Steven R. Levine of Detroit Medical 
Center, who was not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Until two years ago, strokes were totally untreatable in the  
hours immediately after they occurred. Then researchers discovered 
that TPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, already the mainstay of 
treating heart attacks, could also dissolve the blood clots that 
cause most strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	But research suggested that TPA can help only if given within  
three hours of the start of symptoms such as numbness and 
difficulty talking, and brain scans are necessary to make sure the 
stroke truly results from a clot. Even then, there is about a 6 
percent chance that TPA will trigger bleeding that makes the stroke 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely because of these difficulties, TPA is given to only  
about 5 percent of stroke victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the prourokinase study, directed by Dr. Anthony  
J. Furlan of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, were released 
Thursday at a stroke conference sponsored by the American Heart 
Association. The study was financed by Abbott Laboratories, which 
is developing the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the ways in which prourokinase may be more effective is  
that it is released via a catheter, threaded through an artery, 
directly into the brain. TPA is injected into a vein and must 
travel throughout the body. 
</P>
<P>
	At 51 hospitals in the United States and Canada, 180 patients  
who suffered blockages of the brain's middle cerebral artery were 
given either prourokinase or a blood thinner called heparin, which 
was not expected to have a significant impact. Symptoms started 
between three and six hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	After three months of treatment, the researchers found that 40  
percent of the patients getting prourokinase had little or no 
disability resulting from their strokes, compared with 25 percent 
receiving heparin. Twenty-four percent of the prourokinase patients 
died, as did 27 percent in the comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the second major revolution in stroke treatment  
in this decade,'' predicted Dr. Randall Higashida of the University 
of California, San Francisco, who took part in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it can be widely used at most major medical centers.  
</P>
<P>
	Furlan said he hopes prourokinase will be approved by the Food  
and Drug Administration for routine use by early next year. He 
could not estimate how much it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also hope that the approach can help other stroke  
patients besides those with massive strokes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another study found that TPA may do more harm than good when it  
is given beyond three hours of the start of symptoms, as experts 
say happens in about 40 percent of cases where it's used. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 597 patients, researchers gave some TPA and others  
dummy shots three to six hours after the start of strokes. Those 
getting TPA were more likely to suffer dangerous hemorrhaging in 
the brain, said Dr. Wayne Clark of Oregon Health Sciences Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``After three hours, intravenous TPA should not be used for a  
stroke,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another approach is anchrod, a blood thinner derived from pit  
viper venom that was tested on 500 stroke victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment began within three hours of the start of symptoms and  
continued for three to five days. Forty-two percent of the treated 
patients had substantial recovery, compared with 34 percent getting 
dummy injections. 
</P>
<P>
	Study director Dr. David Sherman of the University of Texas  
Health Science Center in San Antonio said it's unclear how the drug 
compares to TPA but it may be useful beyond TPA's three-hour 
cutoff.

<HEADLINE> Ambulances Warned About Oxygen Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is about to warn paramedics and  
firefighters that the valve on a type of oxygen tank commonly used 
in ambulances occasionally explodes, causing serious burns to 
patients and emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a rare risk -- some 200,000 of the tanks are in use, yet the  
Food and Drug Administration knows of only 16 explosions in four 
years. Eleven people were seriously burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxygen-fueled fires are ferocious. Most of the explosions  
occurred when ambulances were racing ill patients to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	So even though the fires are rare, the FDA wants all the at-risk  
equipment -- aluminum regulators on the oxygen tanks -- taken off the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	And within days, FDA officials will write rescue squads and  
other emergency workers nationwide with some ``common-sense 
precautions'' they can take in the meantime to minimize the risk of 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these are not going to burn,'' stressed Dr. Bruce  
Burlington, FDA's medical devices chief. ``Thousands of them are 
used everyday and we have only 16 reports accumulated over years. 
But it's an important and real risk when it happens,'' so FDA is 
pushing companies to recall the regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Healthcare Products of St. Louis, which makes 60 percent  
of the oxygen regulators sold, today became the first manufacturer 
to agree to a recall. It will replace oxygen regulators sold under 
its Life Support Products brand with brass regulators within 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	These are not the little portable oxygen canisters that patients  
with lung disease commonly wheel around. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the issue concerns high-pressure oxygen canisters,  
similar to those scuba divers use, found in hospitals and 
ambulances. On top of the canisters are valves, or regulators, that 
determine how fast the high-pressure oxygen escapes from the tank 
into an oxygen mask. Most hospitals use hard-to-burn brass 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	But most ambulances use aluminum regulators, and high-pressure  
oxygen can cause aluminum to burn fairly easily if there's any sort 
of spark, Burlington explained. 
</P>
<P>
	When the FDA learned of the first fires several years ago,  
engineers thought the problem was that dust or other particles had 
seeped into the tanks, causing friction that made the oxygen 
explode. So manufacturers added a screen filter to the regulators. 
But more fires occurred, showing a filter isn't solving the 
problem, Burlington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers can minimize the risk of fire until they can  
replace the regulators, he said. The valve should be cranked 
slowly, so there's less friction. Tanks and related equipment 
should be kept scrupulously clean, particularly when refilling the 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, oxygen tanks themselves come in either steel or aluminum,  
and the FDA suggests not using aluminum tanks together with 
aluminum valves. Ambulances prefer aluminum because it's not as 
heavy to drive around, but the extra aluminum of a tank might 
increase the risk. 
</P>
<P>

	Allied's recall includes models LSP 106, 270, 280, 370 and 735.

	Lewinsky Won't Testify Live  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators have voted 70-30 against having  
Monica Lewinsky testify live at President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. Just before that, senators voted 100-0 to admit videotaped 
depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney 
Blumenthal into evidence. Earlier today, Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott said he hoped the trial would be wrapped up by Thursday 
or Friday of next week.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife say they are  
``profoundly saddened'' by People magazine's decision to do a cover 
story on daughter Chelsea. The Clintons said People chose to run 
the story ``despite personal appeals with respect to her privacy 
and her security from her parents.'' The magazine hits the street 
tomorrow with a cover photo of Chelsea with her mother and the 
headline: ``Hillary &AMP; Chelsea -- Grace Under Fire.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is seriously  
considering sending U.S. troops to enforce the peace if a 
settlement is reached in war-scarred Kosovo. ``The Balkans are an 
explosive area. They touch other difficult areas, and unless we can 
contain and ultimately defuse the ethnic hatreds in that region 
they can embroil us ... in a much larger conflict,'' Clinton said.

	Serbs Vote To Attend Peace Talks

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's parliament voted today to  
send a delegation to Kosovo peace talks but took a tough and 
unconciliatory stance. Lawmakers insisted Belgrade won't budge on 
Western demands to give broad self-rule to the province. The 
one-sided vote -- 227-3 with three abstentions -- was the last 
remaining hurdle to an internationally brokered peace conference 
starting Saturday outside Paris and aimed at halting an 
11-month-old war that has killed 2,000 people and left hundreds of 
thousands homeless.

defeat of hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Palestinian 
officials say the effort will focus on getting the 600,000 eligible 
Israeli Arabs to cast their ballots -- votes that could make all the 
difference in a close contest. The election was also a factor in 
Arafat's decision to reconsider plans to declare independence in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 4, just days before the vote, 
the officials said.

Tyson goes to court tomorrow to be sentenced on two counts of 
second-degree assault stemming from an altercation following a

whether Tyson will have to return to jail in Indiana for violating 
probation for a rape conviction. It could lead boxing authorities 
to strip him of his license once again.

lawyer collected the visa from the Indian High Commission in 
London, British Broadcasting Corp. radio said. India, Rushdie's 
birthplace, banned ``The Satanic Verses'' after it provoked angry

<HEADLINE> AMA, Editor Resolve Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Less than a month after firing the editor of its  
medical journal over a published sex poll, the American Medical 
Association had kind words for him in announcing an agreement that 
will let him contribute articles to the publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. George Lundberg was fired Jan. 15 by AMA Executive Vice  
President E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. after publishing the survey to 
coincide with President Clinton's impeachment trial. Anderson said 
it inappropriately interjected the organization into a political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA and Lundberg issued a statement Wednesday saying they  
had resolved ``substantive differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Lundberg ``intends to devote the same effort,  
skill and determination that he brought to JAMA for nearly two 
decades to critical medical and health issues, as well as 
contributing to scientific medical research and journalism, 
including JAMA, subject to editorial discretion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA did not elaborate, and Lundberg and his attorney did not  
return telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg's firing prompted an outcry from some in the profession  
who said it damaged the journal's credibility and editorial 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey in JAMA showed 59 percent of college students  
questioned by the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and 
Reproduction didn't consider oral-genital contact as having ``had 
sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said during his grand jury testimony that oral sex was  
not one of the acts covered in his definition of sexual relations. 
He is accused of lying about his relationship with former White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky and trying to cover it up.

<HEADLINE> White House Offers Oil Firms Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration offered some relief  
Thursday to beleaguered domestic oil and natural gas producers who 
have been battered by crude oil prices at some of their lowest 
levels since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced that independent  
producers who drill on public lands will be allowed to suspend 
operations for up to two years without losing their leases. The 
action is directed at ``stripper'' wells, which individually 
produce 15 barrels or less daily, but collectively account for 32 
percent of all oil drilled on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will help to alleviate the economic impact low oil prices  
may have on small federal stripper-oil operations,'' Babbitt said. 
``We understand what the small operators are going through, and 
this is the right decision at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which  
represents smaller producers, welcomed Babbitt's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action would bring some relief to a section of our  
industry hit hardest by the very low oil prices,'' said IPAA 
President Gil Thurm. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thurm prodded the administration to do more. ``At a time  
when oil revenues have been slashed and many of our members wonder 
how long they can survive without closing their businesses or 
laying off even more workers, we also need immediate emergency 
action to keep America's oil and gas industry alive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a worldwide glut, crude oil prices have plunged 55  
percent in the past two years. The depressed prices have prompted 
thousands of layoffs in the industry and had a ripple effect on the 
budgets of state and local governments that depend on oil royalties 
and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing the results of an industrywide survey taken last  
month, IPAA said more than 136,000 oil wells and 57,000 natural gas 
wells have shut down since prices crashed in November 1997 -- 
representing an economic loss of $25 billion. Some 41,000 jobs have 
been lost in the past two years, IPAA estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting producers' sentiment that the administration hasn't  
done enough, Thurm said, ``We hope that today's announcement 
represents a clear recognition by the Clinton administration that 
significant domestic oil and natural gas resources are at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has rallied behind legislation introduced by Sen.  
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and other Oil Patch legislators that 
would provide an array of tax incentives to help independent 
producers. Many also favor replenishing the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, a move that would siphon millions of barrels of oil from 
the glutted market. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve, stored in underground salt caverns in Louisiana and  
Texas, can hold up to 752 million barrels. It stands at 560 million 
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the administration was praised for one action, it was  
criticized for another proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, warned the administration that he will  
``vigorously oppose'' a proposal to reinstate a five-cent-a-barrel 
tax to fund the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. That proposal, 
contained in the fiscal 2000 budget President Clinton submitted to 
Congress Monday, ``is the worst possible idea at the worst possible 
time,'' Gramm complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax, collected on every barrel of oil drilled domestically  
or imported, is used to finance oil pollution prevention and 
cleanup activities by various federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton is asking us to reinstate the tax for  
another 10 years and to let him collect at least $4 billion more 
from hard-pressed oil producers,'' Gramm wrote Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson. ``What he's really asking us to do is dramatically 
accelerate the rate at which Texas oil producers go broke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Treasury, Transportation and Energy departments  
offered no comment. The White House referred calls to Treasury.

<HEADLINE> Albert, Sprewell Return Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Marv Albert and Latrell Sprewell both begin their comebacks this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert returns from a 16-month absence to announce the New York  
Knicks' home opener Sunday against the Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fired by NBC in September 1997 after pleading guilty to  
biting a former lover during a sexual encounter. He later had the 
misdemeanor assault conviction cleared from his record. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell is coming back after more than a year away from the  
game, now as a member of the Knicks, after being suspended for 
choking former coach P.J. Carlesimo. The Knicks open their season 
Friday at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I would certainly be one who believes in second  
chances,'' Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert won't be working his old post as NBC's top play-by-play  
announcer. Instead, he'll be the radio voice of the Knicks -- the 
same place where he began his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll have a good type of anxiety,'' Albert said. ``I'm just so  
happy to be back. The Heat-Knicks game is everything, and the 
Garden will be rocking. It's Miami with Pat Riley and Alonzo 
Mourning, and the return of Sprewell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, who worked 20 years at NBC, has his immediate focus on  
his new job at MSG. Eventually, he would like to return to network 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	It could come sooner than expected. Fox Sports Net reported  
Thursday night that Albert is deep in discussions with NBC to 
return in some capacity to the network's NBA coverage this season. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC denied the report.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, our stable of announcers is tied up, and we'd have  
to wait and see when something opens up,'' NBC Sports chairman Dick 
Ebersol said. ``I'll never close the door on it because I think 
Marv's paid his debt. If he doesn't return here, I wouldn't be 
surprised at all to see another network pick him up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully someday I'll be talking to that type of audience  
again,'' Albert said. ``But I tune that out for now and am not even 
thinking about that stuff yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert, who has called six NBA Finals in his 30-year  
broadcasting career, will handle the play-by-play duties for about 
35 Knicks games this season for MSG. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sprewell signing was a steal, Albert believes, but it wasn't  
the Knicks' priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players like him don't drop in your lap every day,'' he said.  
``They stole a potential All-Star, but their major concern is 
rebounding -- and Marcus Camby certainly isn't the answer there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert's team to beat: the Spurs.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Western Conference is a much stronger conference and San  
Antonio looks really tough. Sean Elliott looks healthy and they've 
added Steve Kerr and Mario Elie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's Bill Walton, a former partner of Albert's, says the title  
race is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton will work alongside Steve Jones on Sunday for the  
network's first telecast of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Famer said a handful of teams will challenge for the  
NBA title -- Indiana, Miami, New York, Utah, San Antonio, Los 
Angeles Lakers and Houston -- unless one of them signs Dennis 
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Dennis joins any of those elite teams, that would change  
the balance of power significantly,'' Walton said. ``He brings so 
much energy and work ethic. Dennis absolutely brings problems, but 
he needs the NBA stage and I see him in the mix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton agrees with Albert about the Knicks' need for an inside  
presence, and he also is worried about how Sprewell will mesh in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Knicks, you worry about team chemistry. ... Rodman  
has never done anything like what Sprewell did,'' Walton added. 
``The concern you have is Sprewell's long history of hurting his 
team's chemistry and being a selfish player. It was brutal when he 
was in Golden State.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Members Want Trial Over Quick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who rose in the public gallery of the  
Senate and shouted, ``God almighty, take the vote and get it over 
with!'' wins no support from those concerned with the chamber's 
rules and decorum. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sentiment is widespread, shared even by some of the  
House Republicans who set the impeachment trial in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of ominous polls and the near certainty President  
Clinton will survive the trial, Republican House lawmakers see 
little point in dragging it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost everyone, even people who are convinced that Clinton's  
actions were reprehensible -- even those voters are wanting this 
entire matter over,'' said Rep. Richard Baker, a Louisiana 
Republican who won a seventh term in a squeaker in November. ``So I 
think the nation has had enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the trial managers, House members are now free from  
Monica Lewinsky. Republicans among them expressed no wish to 
second-guess those they elected to carry the fight forward. ``I am 
extremely proud of their integrity,'' declared Rep. Tom Coburn, 
R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the hunger to close this convulsive chapter in Washington  
-- and ease the threat that voters will punish the GOP in 2000 -- was 
palpable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's light at the end of the tunnel,'' says Republican Rep.  
Mark Foley of Florida. ``I just hope that a boulder doesn't fall on 
the tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House managers, however, pressed on Thursday, pleading  
unsuccessfully with the Senate to allow at least Ms. Lewinsky to 
testify in person in what's left of the trial. The Senate rejected 
that idea, 70-30, with 25 Republicans joining all 45 Democrats in 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	A spectator, Richard Douglas Llamas, 48, of the District of  
Columbia, was arrested after he rose in the gallery and shouted for 
the senators to get it over with. He was escorted from the gallery 
and charged with disruption of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the talk in the nation about ``moving on,'' most House  
members already have. Regular business has returned since their 
impeachment vote Dec. 19 -- a trade bill here, an hour-long speech 
to an empty chamber there, not to mention committee meetings on the 
budget of the president they impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	With one seat vacant and the 13 serving as trial managers, that  
leaves 421 able to throw themselves back into the blend of foreign, 
national and local matters that constitute normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
	But they cannot entirely escape the issue still gripping the  
other half of the Capitol. Not even in historic Williamsburg, Va., 
at a leafy Republican retreat surely rustling with chatter about 
the impeachment endgame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be omnipresent in the background,'' Rep. Greg Ganske  
of Iowa predicted Thursday before heading down to the annual 
get-together. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite polls indicating Americans are unhappy with the conduct  
of the trial and blame the GOP, many Republicans are reluctant to 
leave their band of 13 twisting in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're trying to fulfill their constitutional  
obligations, and that may or may not be politically smart,'' said 
Rep. Ernest Fletcher of Kentucky, a freshman Republican who won a 
narrow victory in the fall. ``But I think in the long run it will 
be well-respected by the American people and by history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we do is a dilemma,'' Foley said. ``They are doing  
the best they can in a very difficult situation. They are being 
pilloried in a number of circles ... but I don't fault them for 
what they are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker senses that the majority of his constituents want the  
impeachment articles to come to a vote, not for the trial to simply 
peter out. ``Whatever the vote outcome is, they can certainly live 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are as reflexively critical of the managers as the  
Republicans are supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't represent my House,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,  
D-Fla. ``It's abundantly clear they ... don't represent the 
American people.''

<HEADLINE>  Robinson Says He's Gotten Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Eugene Robinson, who in less than 24 hours was  
charged with soliciting sex from an undercover officer and burned 
on the biggest play in Atlanta's Super Bowl loss to Denver, is 
touched by the support he's getting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very encouraged by the support I've received. My  
teammates and my friends, everybody has been very supportive,'' 
Robinson said after Wednesday's Pro Bowl practice. 
</P>
<P>
	His Falcons teammates at the Pro Bowl said their respect for  
Robinson hasn't diminished. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've ever been around Eugene for 15 minutes, you'd  
realize what a great person he is,'' running back Jamal Anderson 
said. ``We still think about him, respect him, the same way we 
always have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jessie Tuggle went to Robinson's room to speak with  
him Saturday night after he heard of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with him, looked him in the eyes and told him, `I  
still believe in you. You've got to go on like it never happened.' 
We talked about everything we had done to get where we were (in the 
Super Bowl), and what we had to do in the game,''' Tuggle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He does worry that the incident might cost Robinson eventually.  
</P>
<P>
	``It may hurt his career at some time in the future,'' Tuggle  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Tuggle and Anderson said they don't believe any  
distractions caused by Robinson's arrest played a part in the 
Falcons' 34-19 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went into the game absolutely the same as we would have  
anyway,'' Tuggle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Anderson: ``I'd love to be able to use that as an excuse,  
but it sure didn't affect anything in terms of my running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was some speculation that Robinson might pass up the Pro  
Bowl because of his public troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, there he was wading into a group of autograph  
seekers, chatting and signing caps, footballs and assorted items 
thrust at him. 
</P>
<P>
	A little later, he yelled, ``Good try, Brandon, atta boy,'' as  
his son futilely tried to chase down an older boy running with the 
ball on the Pro Bowl practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's wife, Gia, their 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, and  
Brandon are with him in Hawaii for Sunday's all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how everything is going with his family, Robinson replied,  
``It's good. I think everything is going very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson obviously is trying to get on with his life.  
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I don't intend to do is cower and hide,'' the  
Falcons' safety said. ``That's not my personality. God made me a 
person who really likes and cares about people. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, on the advice of his attorney, he would not answer  
questions about his arrest last Saturday night for allegedly 
offering an undercover police officer $40 for oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
	After the mostly sleepless night that followed, he started for  
the Falcons on Sunday and let the Broncos' Rod Smith get behind him 
for an 80-yard TD reception. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest around 9 p.m. EST Saturday came just 12 hours after  
Robinson, nicknamed ``The Prophet'' for his religious beliefs, 
received the 1999 Bart Starr Award from the Christian group 
Athletes In Action, annually honoring an athlete of high moral 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson declared his innocence after the arrest, but he still  
apologized publicly on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, is expected to be arraigned on the misdemeanor  
count within the next 30 days. He could have charges dropped 
through a diversion program commonly offered in such cases. If he 
is not offered pretrial intervention, Robinson could face a maximum 
penalty of about 60 days if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Surge at Year's End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to American factories rebounded in  
December but the gain wasn't enough to prevent 1998 from entering 
the record book as the weakest year for manufacturing since the 
recession of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders jumped 2.3 percent during the last month of the year, to  
a seasonally adjusted $343.5 billion, the Commerce Department said 
today. It was the biggest increase in 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
	However, orders for all of 1998 -- $4.03 trillion -- were just 2.1  
percent higher than the year before. That compared with a healthy 
5.4 percent gain in 1997 and was the weakest year since orders 
posted a 2.3 percent decline seven years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness was particularly pronounced at U.S. blast furnaces  
and steel mills, which are competing with cheap steel imported from 
Russia, Brazil and Korea. Their orders fell 12.5 percent, the 
biggest decline in at least 15 years. And the increase for aircraft 
was anemic, a 0.2 percent gain over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Both figures reflect the global economic crisis that swept  
across Asia during the summer and fall of 1997, struck Russia last 
year and spread to Brazil last month. 
</P>
<P>
	However, on the bright side, orders for computers and office  
equipment surged 19.4 percent, the biggest gain in 14 years. And 
orders for communications equipment jumped 12.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last  
three or more years -- rose 3.6 percent and orders for nondurable 
goods rose just 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the month of December, orders for industrial machinery and  
equipment rose 7.4 percent; for electronic and electrical 
equipment, 3.6 percent; and for transportation equipment, 1.8 
percent. Fabricated metal products and stone, clay and glass 
products both rose 1.3 percent. But orders for primary metals such 
as steel fell 1.3 percent. Nondurable-goods orders rose 1.2 
percent, led by chemical products. 
</P>
<P>
	The big increase, overall, for orders in December suggests the  
economy carried considerable momentum as it moved into 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of that, the Labor Department said today that  
the number of Americans filing first-time applications for 
unemployment benefits fell by 9,000 to 292,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline, the fourth in five weeks, reduced the seasonally  
adjusted number of jobless claims during the week ended Jan. 30 to 
the lowest level since the week ended Dec. 19. Claims shot up 
during Christmas week to 372,000, raising concern that labor-market 
conditions were deteriorating but the subsequent declines has 
calmed those fears. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes weekly  
fluctuations, fell by 16,000 to 317,250, also a six-week low. 
</P>
<P>
	The year ended with the unemployment rate at a 28-year low of  
4.3 percent in December. The department is scheduled to release the 
January report on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Rykodisc Puts Music on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Showing its independent spirit, independent  
record label Rykodisc is distributing part of its catalog over the 
Internet using a music format shunned by its larger cousins in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for its unconventional artists such as David Bowie, Elvis  
Costello and Frank Zappa, Rykodisc announced it would license about 
175 songs to www.GoodNoise.com to be made available in the MP3 
format for 99 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always tried to get ahead of industry issues that are  
staring us in the face,'' said Lars Murray, director of new media 
for the Salem, Mass.-based Rykodisc. ``We have to do that because, 
as a smaller label, we're not in the position to set industry 
trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MP3 format allows for easy transfer of songs off the  
Internet and is proving increasingly popular with artists 
frustrated with the major record labels' distribution practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Major record labels view MP3 with suspicion because of its lack  
of copy protection. Once downloaded, a file can be copied endlessly 
and played on a $200 Walkman-like device called a Rio. This worries 
the recording industry, which fears the Internet could cut into its 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction to Rykodisc's announcement was cool at the Recording  
Industry Association of America, a trade group that counts music 
giants Sony, Atlantic and Warner Bros. among its members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a free world,'' said RIAA spokeswoman Alexandra Walsh.  
``It's up to every individual company to decide what works best for 
them. They have to decide whether and how they're going to protect 
their product online or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry set up the Secure Digital Music  
Initiative last December to develop a secure format for digital 
distribution by this fall, but Rykodisc's move indicates the 
smaller labels might not wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in  
Cambridge, Mass., called the Rykodisc move a ``huge boost'' for the 
company and MP3. ``It's a clear sign that indy music is willing to 
test the waters on a new form of distribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, selling music over the Internet makes up only 0.3  
percent of total record sales, which hit $12.2 billion in 1997, but 
projections from Forrester show the Net could account for up to 30 
percent of all music sales by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray emphasized the MP3 offerings were not intended to bypass  
retailers, who handle more than half of all music sales, according 
to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the business of selling CDs and what we hope this is  
going to do is let people get a taste of the artists and then go 
and buy the full length CD,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Mulls Gays in Clause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- University of Notre Dame trustees are  
scheduled to meet this week to consider adopting an 
anti-discrimination policy that some say will compromise a central 
part of its Roman Catholic mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The university already forbids discrimination based on, among  
other things, gender and race. It does not, however, ban bias 
against homosexuals, and campus administrators think it should stay 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary spirit animating this is moral, because whereas in  
a secular environment this is seen as a simple matter of civil 
rights, that's not the way it's viewed through a Catholic prism,'' 
said school spokesman Dennis Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	But for about 100 students who began a hunger strike Wednesday  
night, it is a basic question of civil rights -- a concept they want 
the trustees to embrace and approve. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic doctrine teaches that homosexuals are to be loved  
like all God's creatures, but that homosexual sex is a sin. In 
order to preserve that distinction, the school can't submit to all 
secular norms, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In law these days, the difference between sexual orientation  
and sexual practice sometimes doesn't seem to be recognized,'' he 
said. ``The two seem to be lumped together as one in the same. The 
difference between the two is at the very heart of Catholic 
teaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the trustees adopt the proposal, which was approved last year  
by the Senate Faculty and the Academic Council, then Moore said 
courts could end up deciding Catholic moral doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has struggled to figure out how to make homosexuals  
feel welcome while staying true to Catholic teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Notre Dame banned a student group for gays and lesbians  
from meeting on campus. Yet it also formed committees to suggest 
ways to better meet the needs of those same students. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the school began printing a spirit of inclusion  
statement in all university handbooks stating that homosexuals were 
welcome in the university family and would not be discriminated 
against. 
</P>
<P>
	Student protesters called that a hollow promise.  
</P>
<P>
	``It says we're going to include people, but we're not going to  
give them legal protection from discrimination,'' said Aaron 
Kreider of the Progressive Student Alliance and one of the 
organizers of the hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
	University President the Rev. Edward A. Malloy had urged the  
Academic Council to reject the proposal last November, and Moore 
said Malloy would argue against it again this week when the 
trustees meet in London. 
</P>
<P>
	As a practical matter, Moore said, Notre Dame doesn't  
discriminate against gays. He said faculty members have been 
disciplined in the past for sexual misconduct, but none of them 
were homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Catholic schools, including Georgetown, have adopted the  
same anti-discrimination proposal under consideration at Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown spokesman Daniel Weckerman said school officials felt  
the change did not conflict with Catholic teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Utz, head of Notre Dames's counseling center, said he's  
unsure whether changing the policy would improve the climate on 
campus. Several gays on the faculty told him they doubted they'd be 
more open about their sexuality because of a policy change. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't really suggest that Notre Dame is that worse than  
any predominately heterosexual college,'' Utz said.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Deposition Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of deposition testimony by Monica Lewinsky and Vernon  
Jordan, introduced by House prosecutors Thursday:	
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``... your meeting with Vernon Jordan on Dec. 31, 1997. Was  
that to go back and talk about the job again?''	
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``A little bit, but ... for me, the point of that  
meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't 
returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way 
... to ... cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp 
testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never 
disclosed that to the president. So that was sort of my intention 
in meeting with Mr. Jordan, was hoping that I could give a little 
information and that would get passed on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``And that was at a meeting for breakfast at the Park Hyatt  
Hotel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Did you discuss other things, other than Linda Tripp and  
your job search?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``I think we talked about what each of us were doing  
New Year's Eve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Specifically about some notes that you had at your  
apartment?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky: ``Oh, yes. That was really in relation to discussing  
Linda Tripp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``There is no question but that through Betty Currie I  
was acting on behalf of the President to get Ms. Lewinsky a job. 
...
</P>
<P>
	``I think, congressman, if in fact the president of the United  
States' secretary calls and asks for a request, that you try to do 
the best you can to make it happen. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I interpreted it as a request from the president. ...  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no question that he asked me to help and that he  
asked others to help. I think that is clear from everybody's grand 
jury testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``The fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.  
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed 
were not of interest to me. I knew where I would need to call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``You're acting in behalf of the president when you are  
trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of the 
job search?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``And on either of these conversations that I've referenced,  
that you had with the president after the witness list came out, 
your conversation on 12-7 and your conversation sometime after the 
11th, did the president tell you that Ms. Monica Lewinsky was on 
the witness list in the Jones case?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``He did not.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``Would you have expected the president to tell you if he had  
any reason to believe that Ms. Lewinsky would be called as a 
witness in the Paula Jones case?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``That would have been helpful.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``... So it would have been helpful, and it was something you  
would have expected?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan: ``Yes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Q: ``... And yet, according to your testimony, the president did  
not so advise you of the fact that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness 
list despite the fact that he had conversations with you on two 
occasions, on 12-7 and 12-11?'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Martin Needs Better Luck at Daytona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Martin had a career season in  
1998 despite disappointing results in Daytona and Talladega. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin won seven races and finished in the top five in 22 of 33  
events. He finished as runner-up to Jeff Gordon despite having the 
kind of year that usually wins championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But one reason for his third runner-up finish in the Winston Cup  
standings was his performance at Daytona and Talladega. In the four 
races at those two tracks, Martin's best finish was 16th in the 
Pepsi 400 in October at Daytona. At least that was better than when 
he began the year by finishing 38th in the Daytona 500 after 
getting caught in someone else's accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Daytona and Talladega -- the longest and fastest ovals on the  
Winston Cup circuit -- are the only tracks where NASCAR requires 
carburetor restrictor plates to help keep speeds under 200 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	That means, in a schedule that this year increases by one to 34  
races, the teams spend an inordinate amount of time and money 
preparing engines and cars for four events. Add to that the fact 
that the engine restrictions mean most of the cars have similar 
power and remain bunched through much of the races, adding to their 
chances of wrecking. 
</P>
<P>
	That has never pleased either Martin or team-owner Jack Roush,  
especially when each season begins with the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restrictor plate racing is not much fun,'' Roush said. ``There  
is so little to work with in terms of power, and so much finesse 
required to the body. ... It's hit and miss. It's limited time and 
great anxiety. ... We don't look forward to coming to Daytona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who crashed in two of last year's restrictor plate  
events and had mechanical problems in a third, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got wrecked in 50 percent of the restrictor plate races,  
broke a part in another one and didn't have a great finish in the 
fourth one. That's not a very good record, but there's not a whole 
lot I can do about getting wrecked in restrictor plate races. We 
just need to be ready with a good car and motor and then have 
better luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin tried to be upbeat heading into the opening of practice  
today for the Feb. 14 race. A good effort in Saturday's qualifying, 
which will determine the front row in the 43-car field, would also 
be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Martin arrived at Daytona with what was basically a  
new team, an untried Ford Taurus and a new alliance with Burton. At 
least, this year, he's on more solid ground heading into one of his 
most difficult tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a shop full of cars, a race team together that's  
cranking out fast pits stops, and we feel like we're quite a bit 
more ready than we were a year ago,'' Martin noted. ``That's 
comforting, believe me. 
</P>
<P>
	``In testing, our speeds were quite a bit more competitive than  
a year ago. If we don't win the Daytona 500, it won't be from a 
lack of effort on Roush Racing's part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was 18th overall in winter testing at Daytona, with a  
fast lap of 190.759 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Wallace led the way in a Ford at 193.129, followed by  
Gordon's Chevrolet Monte Carlo at 192.452, the Pontiac Grand Prix 
of Kyle Petty at 192.341 and the Taurus of Dale Jarrett at 192.139. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Daytona 500 champion Dale Earnhardt was 30th at  
190.130. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Saturday's qualifying, time trials will continue  
Monday and Tuesday. The speeds from those three days will 
determined the starting lineups for Thursday's two 125-mile 
qualifying races that fill positions three through 30 for the 
500-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	Positions 31 through 36 go to the fastest remaining drivers from  
the three days of qualifying, and the rest of the field is filled 
with provisional starters based on last year's top 40 in the 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	If needed, the final spot in the lineup is used for any former  
series champion who fails to make it any other way.

<HEADLINE> History From the Horse's Mouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talk about learning straight from the horse's  
mouth: Scientists used the fossilized teeth of ancient horses -- 
some as small as dogs -- to reconstruct these early animals' diets 
and paint a picture of the Florida they roamed 5 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For paleontologists, the University of Florida study is a  
milestone because it demonstrates that new scientific techniques 
can show how long-dead species evolved. As well, it disproved some 
theories based solely on how fossils look. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also sheds new light on prehistoric Florida. Five  
million years before Walt Disney made exotic animals a tourist 
attraction, six species of ancient horses competed for food with 
rhinoceroses and elephants in a landscape resembling equatorial 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at the shift of climates and vegetations through  
millions of years by analyzing the tooth content of these 
mammals,'' said paleontologist Bruce MacFadden, lead author of the 
study published Friday in the journal Science. ``That's pretty 
cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History buffs may recall that the modern-day horse was brought  
to the Americas by Spanish explorers. But prehistoric horses roamed 
North America millions of years earlier until dying out about 
10,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	MacFadden studied the fossilized teeth of those ancient horse  
ancestors, found in central Florida phosphate mines. The six 
species ranged from a three-toed, dog-sized animal to a one-toed, 
zebra-sized equine called Dinohippus mexicanus, among the closest 
relatives of modern-day horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Paleontologists had thought that ancient horses were mostly  
grass eaters because 20 million years ago they evolved long, 
high-crowned teeth, perfect for snipping gritty grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5 million-year-old Florida horses shared those long teeth.  
</P>
<P>
	But how, MacFadden wondered, could all those animals have  
competed for the same limited amount of grass? So he 
reinvestigated, examining microscopic wear patterns on the teeth 
and analyzing their carbon isotope content. 
</P>
<P>
	Isotopes are atoms of carbon that have different numbers of  
neutrons. Trees and shrubs have more carbon-13 than grasses, for 
example. When these isotopes build up in tooth enamel, they 
illustrate a creature's diet. The technique's power is prompting 
scientists to take a fresh look at other fossils, even the teeth of 
early humans. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, eating from tender trees and shrubs, as deer do  
today, leaves microscopic round pits in teeth. Eaters of grittier 
grass, like zebras, sustain long tooth scratches. 
</P>
<P>
	MacFadden's conclusion: Despite their common teeth, some of the  
ancient horses ate only grass, some a mix of grass, leaves and 
shrubs and -- in a real surprise -- the modern-like Dinohippus ate 
mostly from trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The carbon tests show ancient Florida's landscape was a lush  
mosaic of canopy-covered forests with bushes for horses to nibble, 
savanna-like grasslands and marshes, with rushes and reeds for 
other horses to chew, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some horses were tiny because they competed for food not just  
with other horses but with rhinoceros- and elephant-like beasts 
with similar grazing habits. 
</P>
<P>
	Here the tale gets more intriguing: Not much later, 4.8 million  
years ago, North America experienced a major mammal extinction that 
killed off the huge beasts like rhinoceroses, as well as three of 
the horse species. 
</P>
<P>
	The smallest horses that originally ate mostly grass became  
extinct. The bigger scrub eaters, including Dinohippus, survived -- 
and then they switched their diet to the grass their smaller 
relatives left behind, said paleontologist Paul Koch of the 
University of California, Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? No one knows. But Koch suggests the spread of  
poorer-quality grasses, which were less tolerated by small animals 
with fast metabolisms than by larger horses more tolerant of lousy 
diets. 
</P>
<P>
	MacFadden's study is ``a really important paper, showing our  
ability to study ecosystems of the past,'' Koch said. ``We're 
interested in how diversity, flexibility in what you eat, affects 
survival and extinction. ... But at the same time you are a little 
unsatisfied -- you want to know more.''

<HEADLINE> Christian Activists Eye Welfare Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEVY CHASE, Md. (AP) -- Politicians in Washington regularly  
trumpet the successes of the 1996 welfare overhaul. But pastors 
attending a conference here say they don't see much to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are moving from welfare poor to working poor,'' says  
the Rev. William M. Blackford of Louisville, Ky., one of some 600 
pastors and volunteers who attended a meeting this week of 
Christian activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants spent three days this week swapping ideas,  
recharging their batteries and trying to convince members of 
Congress that nations are judged by how they treat their poorest 
and most vulnerable citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy makers in Washington wonder what will happen to people on  
welfare when the economy falters. The people at this conference 
wonder what's happening to people now. 
</P>
<P>
	With a booming economy, jobs are available, they agree, but they  
don't pay much and many of the supports that are supposed to help 
people move from welfare to work have been slow to begin or are 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	There are waiting lists for child care, and most people in  
service jobs don't get sick days to care for a sick child. Jobs 
exist, but often they're in the suburbs, and the poor have no way 
to get to them. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, activists complain that parents must get  
their children immunized in order to participate in the state's 
work program, but health clinics aren't open at night or on the 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fredricksburg, Va., the demand for food aid has tripled and  
more people are lining up for emergency shelters, said pastor David 
Henry of the Fairview Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists argue that falling welfare caseloads, which have  
reached to a 30-year law, aren't enough to declare success. 
</P>
<P>
	``What nobody at the federal, state or local level can tell you  
is where these people have gone,'' said the Rev. Ginny N. Britt of 
Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	She prefers a different statistic: One in five American children  
lives in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate here is much different than the debate on Capitol  
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think poor people exist in Washington,'' said Carol  
Fennelly, who organized the conference for Call to Renewal. ``In 
the circles of power that make decisions about our day-to-day 
lives, poor people don't exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While conservative Christians were also at this meeting, many of  
the participants deeply opposed the 1996 law that overhauled the 
nation's welfare system, ending a six-decade guarantee of federal 
aid for the poor. And they almost resent that they are stuck 
cleaning up some messy results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a trap where churches save bad policy?'' one man asked  
during a session designed to allow New Englanders to trade ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Some comfort came from an unexpected source. Housing Secretary  
Andrew Cuomo got a standing ovation for a speech that denounced the 
welfare overhaul that his boss, President Clinton, signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welfare reform was never about a policy debate,'' Cuomo said.  
``It was a political debate. Nobody said how do we really help 
people on welfare?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he singled out Congress for blame, Cuomo clearly was not  
singing out of the Clinton administration hymnal. He said the 
welfare overhaul was ``meant to punish'' poor people who were 
trapped in a terrible system with twisted incentives. ``Economic 
selfishness'' and racism were behind the legislation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, activists like those gathered here must spread the word  
about life on the streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense that the economy's going well and people are  
doing well, and if it's OK for me, it must be OK for everyone,'' 
Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the gloomy mood among conference attendees, there were  
pockets of good news. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Skip Long told how businesses and churches have joined  
together in Raleigh, N.C., to train people for work and then offer 
them jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha De Hollander said things were going well in Kent County,  
Mich., which has been designated a ``Project Zero'' site, with the 
goal of moving everyone off welfare. The program has brought lots 
of back-up services for people moving off the rolls, and churches 
have adopted families to mentor them through work. 
</P>
<P>
	She sees opportunity for churches, who have long worked hard to  
serve the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think there's an interesting opportunity here, kind of a  
moment, to create new partnerships,'' she said. ``We all knew it 
wasn't working before.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Up, Corn Mixed, Soybeans Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures advanced early today on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn futures were mixed and soybeans 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans retreated after the U.S. Agriculture Department  
reported soybean meal and oil exports in the past week were weaker 
than expected. That offset initial gains tied to the government's 
announcement that an unknown foreign buyer had purchased 275,000 
metric tons of soybeans for delivery this marketing year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were supported by weekly export sales of 588,300  
metric tons, well above market expectations and a sharp improvement 
over lackluster demand from the past few weeks. Corn futures also 
saw unexpected heavy export demand, but gains were limited by 
expectations any rally would again prompt heavy farmer selling of 
stored crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 1 cent to $2.66 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1/4 cent to $2.16 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at 
$1.06 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 2 cents to $5.05 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures rallied early on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange in continued enthusiasm tied to the 
government's announcement it soon will begin shipping pork and beef 
products to economically beleaguered Russia under an aid package 
announced late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .05 cent to 67.02 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .40 cent to 74.20 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose 1.58 cents to 45.50 cents a pound; March pork bellies rose 
1.63 cents to 58.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet With Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is looking for ways to  
revive lagging Mideast peace talks in a meeting with Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat in an unusual setting. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was planning a brief review with Arafat while they  
attended the 47th annual National Prayer breakfast in a downtown 
hotel today. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of Arafat's attendance at the breakfast had promised to  
protest outside the event. Only one showed up, James Lafferty of 
Washington, representing the Traditional Values Coalition. ``These 
people should not be providing cover for Mr. Arafat to appear in 
this city,'' Lafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people aimed their protest at Clinton. Their leader, the  
Rev. Patrick Mahoney of Washington, said the goal was to ``urge 
President Clinton to stop using Christianity for political gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Christian and Jewish groups urged members of Congress to  
boycott the breakfast on grounds Arafat had supported terrorism and 
had not repented. 
</P>
<P>
	This prompted White House spokesman Joe Lockhart to say: ``It's  
a morning of prayer and reconciliation and we believe that it's 
unfortunate that that spirit of reconciliation is being ignored by 
some and that people have made the decisions that the normal 
politics of Washington should intrude on this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a spokesman for the breakfast chairman, Rep. Steve  
Largent, R-Okla., said Largent had asked Clinton Friday ``not to 
politicize the breakfast by having the meeting'' with Arafat there. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, Brad Keena, said in an interview that Largent  
supported Arafat's attendance, but disapproved of the president 
taking up controversial issues at the breakfast with the 
Palestinian leader. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley, said Clinton would have  
``brief contact'' not only with Arafat but also President Jamil 
Mahaud of Ecuador and the leaders of Macedonia, Albania and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am insistent on following up the peace process,'' Arafat  
told reporters following a 40-minute meeting with Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is stalled, with Israel refusing to yield more land  
because it says the Palestinians have not lived up to promises made 
at the Wye River summit in October to crack down on militant 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat, in a brief exchange at the doorway of the State  
Department, did not say how he thought the process could be 
revived. 
</P>
<P>
	On another touchy subject, he said Palestinian leaders were  
grappling with the question of a Palestinian state. ``This can't be 
mentioned now,'' Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian leader has been urged by the Clinton  
administration to stop declaring his intention to set up a state in 
May if negotiations with Israel fail to produce what Arafat wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about whether terrorist suspects are treated leniently  
by Palestinian authorities also were raised by Albright at her 
meeting with Arafat, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin 
said.

<HEADLINE> Elway Sees Pro Bowl As Another Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- John Elway may strap on his Denver Broncos  
helmet for the final time this weekend, but even if he does retire, 
he won't look back on the Pro Bowl as his final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I haven't looked that far ahead. Anyway, if it  
is the last one, the one I'll still remember (as his football 
finale) was last week,'' said Elway, MVP of the Broncos' 34-19 
Super Bowl victory over Atlanta on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, a nine-time all-star, said his four kids convinced him to  
come to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl this time because ``They love it 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He missed last year's game because of an injury and expects to  
be in for only one or two series in Sunday's AFC-NFC matchup, 
saying, ``I'll just play it by ear and try to do something good out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He smiled and added, ``Anyway, (Doug) Flutie's a lot younger  
than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is 38 and Flutie, a Pro Bowl rookie, is 36. The other AFC  
quarterback is 35-year-old Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie suddenly appeared at Elway's locker in Aloha Stadium,  
grinning and demanding to know why Elway got No. 7 for his red AFC 
jersey, since that's Flutie's number with Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won the coin toss,'' Elway shot back. ``You flipped a coin  
and you lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway missed four starts this season because of injuries, but  
said he feels fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in pretty good shape right now,'' he said. ``The heat has  
been a big part of it; Miami, now here. It's good on the old 
joints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway planned to make this season his last, but he just might be  
lured back again by the prospect of winning an unprecedented three 
consecutive Super Bowls. He said after the win against Atlanta that 
he expected to announce a final decision in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver teammate Terrell Davis, also among the 10 Denver players  
that give the Pro Bowl a distinct Broncos flavor, laughed and said 
he wasn't going to give Elway an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will physically threaten him. I will physically persuade  
him. I will sabotage every single vehicle he might drive away in,'' 
Davis said. ``He has to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over yet, we just got started. You go tell him I said  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, apparently feeling a bit hassled by the blur of  
activities and travel, said things seemed even more hectic at the 
Super Bowl and afterward this time than they did when the Broncos 
won it last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went right back for the parade. ... I checked my car phone  
and I had 30 or more messages, and I thought, `I'll just have to 
wait to get to those,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need some time to slow down and try to get organized, get  
the bills paid and all that stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Wynette Daughters Want Body Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The body of country singer Tammy Wynette  
should be exhumed and autopsied to see if she really died of a 
blood clot, according to three of her daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, 55, whose many hits included ``Stand by Your Man,'' was  
found dead in her Nashville home April 6 by husband George Richey. 
</P>
<P>
	She was declared dead by her personal physician, Wallis Marsh,  
who was flown in from Pittsburgh. Without an autopsy, Marsh said 
the cause of death was a blood clot to her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	In letters sent to Dr. Bruce Levy, Nashville's medical examiner,  
three of Wynette's daughters said they didn't trust Marsh's 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter obtained by WTVF-TV in Nashville, Jackie Daly told  
Levy she wants ``to stress to you how important it is to my sisters 
and I to really know how our mother died. I find it hard to believe 
you can tell how my mother died by looking at her and not doing an 
autopsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters were sent to Levy by Wynette's daughters Tina  
Jones and Georgette Smith, whose father is country singer George 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman said Wednesday his  
office is aware of the letters but has not begun an investigation.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Minister's Trial Set To Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- Rev. Henry Lyons apparently was ``just making  
... up'' numbers when he compiled a state-by-state accounting of 
the National Baptist Convention USA's members, a former aide says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say a state and he would give me a figure. At first, I  
just thought he was really intelligent,'' Lynda Shorter told jurors 
Wednesday in Lyons' racketeering trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got to the middle of the list, I realized he was  
making them up. He was smirking and laughing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shorter, who was Lyons' administrative aide for about a year  
beginning in June 1995, also testified that Lyons kept no ledgers 
showing how he spent the convention money or records of checks that 
came in to the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful black church organization has a touted 8.5 million  
members, but prosecutors who accuse Lyons, the group's president, 
of swindling money from companies seeking to do business with the 
group call that figure a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and his alleged mistress, Bernice Edwards, are accused of  
duping corporations who wanted to market life insurance, credit 
cards and funeral plots to the members of almost $4 million. 
Prosecutors say the pair used the money to finance lavish 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, a jewelry store owner testified Lyons and Ms.  
Edwards picked out a 5.56-carat diamond as part of a four-month 
spending spree in which they spent almost $43,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Grimm said the pair made several visits to her St.  
Petersburg shop between December 1995 and March 1996, first buying 
an expensive money clip and eventually picking out a diamond ``the 
size of a dime'' that cost $36,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards described it as an engagement ring from Lyons, Ms.  
Grimm said, but later asked her not to mention it in front of a 
friend she and Ms. Edwards were meeting for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	One $10,000 payment for the diamond was made from a check from  
the Baptist Builder's Fund, Ms. Grimm testified. Prosecutors have 
described that as a secret bank account the pair used to hide 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer has described Ms. Edwards as a single mother  
struggling to make ends meet who was ``brought along as 
window-dressing'' by prosecutors trying to convict Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' lawyers maintain the failed business deals are not  
criminal matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons also is charged with grand theft, accused of stealing  
about $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith 
intended to rebuild burned black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces another trial this spring on 54 federal charges of bank  
fraud, wire fraud, extortion and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Michelle Pfeiffer Celebrates 40th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michelle Pfeiffer took on 40 with a flourish and  
isn't worried about starlet lookalikes, even if they do appear in 
her husband's TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's OK for me to get older,'' she said in the upcoming  
Ladies' Home Journal. ``My husband just loves old women. He's crazy 
about his grandmother.''

been deemed the new Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> D.C. Aide in Word Dispute Rehired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams is  
rehiring an aide who resigned under fire after using the word 
``niggardly'' to describe how he must manage office money. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor came under criticism from other city officials and  
some civil rights leaders in recent days for accepting David 
Howard's resignation over the use of the word, which means stingy 
and has no racial connotation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Williams urged Howard to return to his job as  
director of the mayor's Office of the Public Advocate. Howard 
agreed to go back to work but asked for a new posting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I acted too hastily in accepting David's  
resignation,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said he also was too quick to offer his resignation on  
Jan. 26. ``At that time, I though it was the best thing for the 
city and the administration,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard said he resigned because rumors were spreading that he  
used a racial epithet in a Jan. 15 conversation with members of his 
staff, and he said those rumors had compromised his ability to be 
an effective public advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the mayor, who is black, and Howard, who is white, said the  
word Howard used, when describing how he managed a fund, was 
``niggardly.'' Dictionaries and other language references trace its 
origins to Scandinavia and attribute no offensive meaning to it. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent review by the mayor's staff found that one of the  
people to whom Howard was speaking misunderstood the word to be a 
racial epithet.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Trial Starts in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A court-martial began today for a  
Marine pilot whose jet clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 
people, with the judge ruling the defendant won't be questioned 
about a missing videotape if he testifies. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby's trial on 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter began one day after the first anniversary of the 
tragedy that happened when the wing of his EA-6B Prowler sliced 
through cables supporting the Mount Cermis ski gondola in Cavalese, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, noted today that Ashby faces  
a separate court-martial obstruction of justice charges for 
allegedly destroying a videotape shot during the flight. Forcing 
him to testify about it during his manslaughter trial could violate 
his constitutional protection against self-incrimination, Nunley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunley added the disappearance of the tape demonstrated a  
``consciousness of guilt'' on Ashby's part. He said Ashby and his 
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, asked after the flight what 
they should do with the tape and one of the two backseat crewmen, 
Capt. Chandler Seagraves, replied, ```I'd get rid of it if I were 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A second, blank videotape was substituted for the missing tape,  
prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer faces a separate court-martial in the accident;  
unlike Ashby, he had agreed to have the obstruction of justice 
charges combined with his manslaughter and homicide counts in a 
single trial. Charges were dismissed against Seagraves and the 
other man in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley granted motions by CBS and Rolling Stone magazine to  
quash subpoenas issued them by prosecutors for outtakes and notes 
from their interviews with Ashby and Schweitzer. CBS' ``60 
Minutes'' broadcast a segment on the case Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment guides me here, and most of the statements  
were self-serving anyway and not incriminatory,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley ruled that if Ashby takes the stand, prosecutors will be  
allowed to interview an expert witness on computer flight 
simulation. He didn't elaborate on how the testimony of the expert 
related to Ashby's participation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley refused a request by Schweitzer's attorneys to dismiss  
charges against him. He said that decision would be up to a 
different judge who was named to preside at Schweitzer's 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection was expected to begin later in the day. Fifteen  
jurors, all officers of rank equal to Ashby's or higher, were 
appointed. During questioning today, lawyers can reduce the size of 
the panel if they detect an objectionable bias, and the 
court-martial can proceed with a panel as small as five members. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the jet was flying too low and too fast and  
that the cable wouldn't have been struck if Ashby had followed 
flight rules. The gondola cable hung about 370 feet above the 
ground, and the minimum altitude for the mission was 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say the accident was not Ashby's fault, noting  
that the 33-year-old cable system wasn't marked on the map Ashby 
was given before he began a low-level training flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., could be sentenced to more  
than 200 years in prison if convicted of all charges, which also 
include destruction of government and private property and 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two  
Austrians and one Dutch person died in the Feb. 3, 1998, accident. 
Attorneys for the victims are seeking damage payments from the U.S. 
government.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Debate Park Fee Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two western senators welcomed a pilot program  
that allows the government to collect new fees at more than 300 
parks and recreation areas, but called for some changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said  
visitors should have to pay only once when they come to a park. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said that in Utah, a vacationer can take a raft trip  
through Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service and state 
lands and be assessed separate fees from all three. He said the 
three agencies should share a single, ``reasonable'' fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said that at Mt. St. Helens National Park in Washington  
state, there are fees for ``everything one can imagine.'' Murkowski 
said some parks are charging several fees at one place -- for 
entrance, parking, visitor center films and interpretive hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing will destroy this program faster than overachieving  
greedy managers,'' Murkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators asked recreation industry and federal agency  
officials to give them suggestions for improving the program within 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Four federal agencies -- the Park Service, BLM, Fish and Wildlife  
Service and Forest Service -- are allowed to collect the additional 
fees, which mostly run under $20 and are as low as $1 or $2. The 
four agencies collected $180 million through the program last year. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of the proceeds are supposed to be used where  
they are collected for park maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Both senators stressed that they support the fee program, which  
began in late 1995 and was extended by Congress last year until 
Sept. 30, 2001. The Clinton administration has proposed making the 
program permanent.

<HEADLINE> Utah Gov., SLOC Plan Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The panel running the scandal-clouded 2002  
Winter Olympics would grow by more than 50 percent but lose power 
to a new management committee under a plan laid out Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee chairman Robert Garff will be voted on Feb. 11 by the 
committee's board of trustees, two days after it gets a report from 
an independent ethics panel investigating Salt Lake's bid for the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Revelations that the bid committee that preceded SLOC gave more  
than $1 million in cash, free medical care, travel and scholarships 
to International Olympic Committee members have prompted a 
reexamination of how the committee is governed. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization is designed both to broaden community  
representation and lay more responsibility in the laps of a 
management committee, Leavitt and Garff said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would answer the call by city council members and activist  
groups for more community representation on the committee, which 
now numbers 33 persons appointed by Leavitt and Mayor Deedee 
Corradini and would grow to 50. The 17 new members also would be 
appointed by the governor and mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the enlarged board of trustees would lose much of its  
current decision-making authority, and instead play a role of 
advising the management committee and consenting to its decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members still would serve on standing committees for  
audit, budget and investment, community relations, compensation and 
facilities-environment. 
</P>
<P>
	They also would elect from their ranks seven members for the  
management committee, which would directly oversee the committee 
employees planning the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the seven elected by their peers, the management  
committee would include Leavitt, Garff, Corradini, a new SLOC 
president and chief executive, four athletes, three U.S. Olympic 
Committee officials and two IOC representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The management committee would replace the existing 15-member  
executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are starting a new era with a new governing structure,''  
Garff said. ``The increase in membership will broaden the 
represented constituency groups, infuse new enthusiasm, and involve 
the dynamic leaders of this community. The election of a management 
committee by its peer group will ensure greater responsibility in 
the operational control of the games.''

<HEADLINE> Injecting New Drug Reverses Strokes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A newly developed stroke-stopping drug  
can be given up to six hours after symptoms start -- double the 
current limit -- substantially increasing the number of people who 
could escape the crippling attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, called prourokinase, is the latest in a growing list  
of medicines being tested to dissolve clots in the brain, which 
cause 83 percent of the nation's 600,000 strokes annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the only approved treatment for strokes is TPA, a  
clot dissolver that is also the mainstay of heart attack therapy. 
To work, it must be given within three hours after the numbness, 
slurred speech and other warning signs of strokes begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Since most victims do not get to the hospital soon enough,  
doctors would like to have something that gives them more breathing 
room. On Thursday, researchers from the Cleveland clinic Foundation 
presented results of the first large-scale testing of the new drug 
that appears to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Prourokinase seems to work well even when given between three  
and six hours after the start of symptoms. The doctors tested it on 
people with particularly serious strokes resulting from clots in 
the brain's middle cerebral artery. They were 60 percent more 
likely than usual to escape with little or no permanent impairment. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as TPA dramatically changed physicians' approach to  
strokes, some say the new drug may again turn stroke therapy upside 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the second major revolution in stroke treatment  
in this decade,'' predicted Dr. Randall Higashida of the University 
of California, San Francisco, who took part in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke kills 158,000 people yearly -- the third leading cause of  
death in the United States -- and has left more than one million 
Americans disabled to some extent, the American Heart Association 
says. Its estimated cost is $41 billion annually, mostly because of 
the high expense of rehabilitating and caring for victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of prourokinase's benefits may result from the way it is  
given. Unlike TPA, which is injected into a vein and travels 
throughout the body, doctors release prourokinase via a catheter 
that is threaded through an artery directly to the site of the clot 
in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	However, this also is an important shortcoming. One limit to  
giving TPA is the need for time-consuming testing before treatment 
starts. Patients must have head scans to make sure their strokes 
truly result from clots and not hemorrhages, which produce similar 
symptoms. Prourokinase will take even longer to administer, because 
patients must also undergo catheterization, the process of putting 
a skinny tube into the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Anthony Furlon said a well-orchestrated stroke team  
typically can do the entire process in about an hour. Still, the 
treatment will be limited to large medical centers that have the 
equipment and expertise to do such procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a massive stroke, this gives you the best chance  
of a decent outcome,'' said Dr. Steven R. Levine of Detroit Medical 
Center, who was not involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Furlon said he hopes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will  
approve prourokinas for routine use by early next year. He released 
the results at a stroke conference sponsored by the American Heart 
Association. The study was financed by its maker, Abbott 
Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at 51 hospitals in the United States and Canada  
participated in the study, randomly assigning 180 patients to get 
either prourokinase or a blood thinner called heparin that is 
unlikely to have a major impact on the condtion. All started their 
symptoms between three and six hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months after treatment, they found that 40 percent of the  
patients getting prourokinase had little or no disability resulting 
from their strokes, compared with 25 percent receiving heparin. 
Twenty-four percent of the prourokinase patients died, as did 27 
percent in the comparison group. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the approach has been tried on only one type of  
particularly bad stroke, Furlan said, ``I'm hopeful this will help 
other stroke patients, but we haven't worked out the details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another study presented at the conference examined whether TPA  
can be given beyond three hours of the start of symptoms, as 
experts say actually happens in perhaps 40 percent of the cases 
it's used. This study -- financed by Genentech, TPA's maker -- found 
that the drug actually may do more harm than good when given this 
late.

<HEADLINE> Donald O'Connor: Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Entertainer Donald O'Connor, whose  
talents at singing, dancing and comedy graced '50s musicals such as 
``Singin' in the Rain,'' was in critical condition Thursday with 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 73, was taken to Desert Regional Medical Center on  
Saturday, and his condition began deteriorating on Tuesday, 
hospital spokesman Tom Wixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was moved to intensive care because of some heart and lung  
failure,'' Wixon said. ``He's on a ventilator and listed in 
critical condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, who lives in Sedona, Ariz., was the featured player in  
the Fabulous Palm Springs Follies, a performing arts group at the 
Historic Plaza Theatre in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he just wasn't feeling well,'' Follies spokeswoman  
Joelle Casteix said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor appeared in several movie musicals in the 1950s, and in  
1952, he got the biggest role of his career as Gene Kelly's friend 
in ``Singin' in the Rain,'' considered one of the greatest musicals 
in Hollywood history. 
</P>
<P>
	One of its most famous scenes is the ``Make 'Em Laugh'' number,  
in which O'Connor's acrobatic and comic talents add much to the 
song. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other '50s musicals he appeared in were ``Call Me  
Madam,'' and ``There's No Business Like Show Business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also was known for the ``Francis'' series of comedies, which  
featured a bumbling O'Connor and a talking mule. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on Aug. 28, 1925, in Chicago, to circus performers who went  
into vaudeville, O'Connor joined his family's act when he was an 
infant. He made his film debut at age 11 in a dancing scene with 
two of his brothers in ``Melody for Two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a contract actor for Paramount, he played adolescent roles in  
several films, including Huckleberry Finn in ``Tom Sawyer -- 
Detective'' (1938) and as a child Beau in ``Beau Geste'' (1939) 
before returning to vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
	In the '40s he went back to movies, playing high-energy juvenile  
leads opposite such actresses as Gloria Jean and Susanna Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	In television, he won an Emmy for ``the Colgate Comedy Hour'' in  
the early 50s, and appeared in ``The Donald O'Connor Texaco Show'' 
from 1954-55.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dominates Junior Alpines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAUPRE, Que. (AP) -- Bryon Friedman and Courtney Strait picked  
up the gold medals in super-G Thursday as U.S. skiers continued 
their domination of the North American Junior Alpine Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Strait, a 17-year-old from Clifton Park, N.Y., who also won the  
women's giant slalom title Monday, led U.S. women into the top nine 
places as she took the super-G at Mt. Ste. Anne with a time of 1 
minute, 26.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans have won 11 of the 18 possible medals in three days of  
racing, in part because western Canadian skiers are not racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Madaileine Sparks-Krebs of Waitsfield, Vt., who was second  
behind Strait, collected her second silver medal, finishing in 
1:27.08 with Christin Lathrop of North Conway, N.H., in third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's race, which followed the women's super-G, was held in  
flat light which made visibility tricky. Friedman, an 18-year-old 
from Park City, Utah, won in 1:23.00 after taking the silver medal 
in the giant slalom two days earlier. Brad Hogan of Holmes, N.Y, 
was second with a 1:23.19 and Canadian Kristian Guay was the bronze 
medalist.

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Strickland in Good Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rod Strickland rejoined the Washington Wizards  
in pretty good shape Thursday and will probably play in Friday 
night's season opener at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	As for his agent's claims that Strickland had ``changed his  
lifestyle'' over the past nine months, it turned out to be 
propaganda amid his acrimonious contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That new man stuff?'' said Strickland, shaking his head and  
making a slashing motion across his throat. ``I'm the same person. 
Obviously I worked out real hard. I think that's why I wasn't as 
bad as I thought I might be today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day after agreeing to a four-year, $40 million contract -- a  
major comedown from his original demands -- Strickland made it 
through the entire 2 1/2-hour team practice without much trouble, but 
admitted feeling winded. Once he's up to speed, last year's NBA 
assists leader will team with six-time All-Star Mitch Richmond to 
form perhaps the best backcourt in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God,'' Richmond said. ``I am so glad this got done. I am  
so glad this is over. Now we can get down to business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Strickland, the Wizards would certainly have been  
also-rans in the Eastern Conference. The only question mark now is 
in the middle. Lorenzo Williams was declared out for the season 
Thursday with stress fractures in both feet and Ben Wallace has a 
sprained ankle, leaving Terry Davis, Otis Thorpe and Jahidi White 
to play center-by-committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But, with Strickland back in the fold, at least there's enough  
perimeter talent to complement Juwan Howard and possibly make some 
noise in the shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited and overjoyed,'' Howard said. ``With him, our  
chances are good as far as making it to the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the Wizards were preparing to play the season without  
Strickland, and Strickland said he thought he would either have to 
sit out the season or sign a one-year contract with another team 
for a minimal amount. Talks stalled for more than a week as 
Strickland's agent, David Falk, and general manager Wes Unseld 
traded barbs in public. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough came when owner Abe Pollin told Unseld --  
against Unseld's wishes -- to increase the team's offer. The Wizards 
had been offering three years for $27 million, while Strickland 
wanted five years at $55 million. In the final deal, all but $5 
million of the $40 million is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It obviously wasn't the deal we wanted, but it was a deal that  
was good enough to get me to play basketball this year,'' said 
Strickland, who later made it clear he didn't get what he thought 
he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was upset by the public debate during his  
negotiations, particularly by the perception the Wizards were 
shortchanging him because of his age and his off-the-court problems 
last year, including a drunken driving conviction, a fight with a 
teammate in a hotel, routine tardiness and a poor diet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take a lot of things personal, and during the negotiations I  
took some things very personal,'' Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Falk tried to improve his client's bargaining  
position by saying Strickland had improved his diet, worked himself 
into great shape and had ``changed his lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave only responded to that because there was things being  
said,'' Strickland said. ``I don't need to respond to that. What I 
do is what I do. That's my business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the deal done, Strickland said there were ``no hard  
feelings'' and he was ready to play. It's up to his coach, Bernie 
Bickerstaff, to decide how much and when. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a better team with Rod,'' Bickerstaff said. ``I don't  
know at what point we become better because of his conditioning. 
... I'll just leave the intrigue out there. I don't know whether 
he'll start Friday. He could, but it's a good possibility he 
won't.''

<HEADLINE> CIA Official Settles Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior CIA official at the Pentagon's  
satellite surveillance office agreed Thursday to pay the government 
$48,700 to settle allegations he violated conflict-of-interest 
rules by recommending bonuses for a defense contractor that 
employed his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest civil settlement ever obtained by the Justice  
Department's criminal division in settlement of a conflict of 
interest case, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $48,700 equaled the entire profit that Allen L. Krum's wife  
made on stock options she exercised while employed at Lockheed 
Martin Corp., and was ``substantially more than the government 
could have obtained under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines for 
criminal cases,'' the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the civil suit and accompanying settlement filed in U.S.  
District Court in suburban Alexandria, Va., the government said 
that Krum, 46, of Centreville, Va., is a senior CIA employee 
assigned to the Defense Department's National Reconnaissance 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a few years ago, NRO was so secret that its very existence  
was not acknowledged. The NRO manages U.S. spying by satellites and 
high-flying aircraft around the world. The NRO also acquires the 
satellites and planes from defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil suit alleged that Krum took official action in his  
government position in matters in which his wife had a financial 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1994 to 1996, Krum was a contracting officer and technical  
representative for specific contracts between NRO and Lockheed 
Martin. His primary duties included recommending approval for 
engineering changes and for bonuses totaling millions of dollars 
and renegotiating contracts with Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1996 to April 1997, Krum served as NRO chief of a  
restructuring program for a contract with Lockheed Martin. His 
primary duties included developing overall contract requirements 
and plans and ensuring adequate budgeting for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	From April 1997 to the present, Krum has been NRO director of  
imagery development, a position in which he has approved contract 
payments and bonuses to contractors for which he had previously 
been the recommending authority, including Lockheed Martin 
contracts, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1994 to June 30, 1997, his wife, who was not named in the  
lawsuit, was a Lockheed Martin program management engineer in the 
capital area, but she did not work on contracts supervised by her 
husband, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	But from April 1994 through January 1997, she received options  
to buy 3,000 shares of Lockheed Martin stock. In April and May 
1997, she exercised the option to buy 1,600 shares for a profit of 
$48,700, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	She canceled the remaining options upon her voluntary  
resignation from Lockheed Martin later. 
</P>
<P>
	Krum agreed to make the payment within 30 days. He keeps his  
government job, Justice spokesman John Russell said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Fate Again in Judge's Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson once  
again faces jail time and the possible loss of his boxing license. 
It all depends on a judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson goes to court Friday to be sentenced on two counts of  
second-degree assault stemming from an altercation following a 
minor traffic accident in August. The sentence will help determine 
whether Tyson will have to return to jail in Indiana for violating 
probation for a rape conviction, and it could lead boxing 
authorities to strip him of his license once again. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's lawyers will ask for probation. In a memo this week to  
Judge Stephen Johnson, they argued Tyson would become a ``useful 
and contributing member of the community'' if he were spared jail 
time, received more psychiatric help and continued to perform 
volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, Montgomery County State's Attorney Douglas  
Gansler, wants Tyson behind bars, but is hampered by a plea 
agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Robert Dean. In December, 
Tyson pleaded no contest -- meaning he neither protests the charges 
nor admits guilt -- and Dean promised in return that the state would 
not seek a jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an agreement that I would have reached,'' said  
Gansler, who defeated Dean in the Democratic primary. Dean then 
endorsed Gansler's Republican opponent, Thomas O'Malley, in the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he can't ask for jail in the courtroom, Gansler has done  
so in public. Paul Kemp, one of Tyson's lawyers, said Gansler's 
remarks broke the plea agreement and were a ``violation of the 
rules of professional conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson kicked one motorist and punched another after the accident  
in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Md., on Aug. 31. The two 
victims, Abmielec Saucedo and Richard Hardick, settled out of 
court, and their lawyers say both men are ready to tell the judge 
that Tyson shouldn't go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo from Tyson's lawyers said the fighter was not taking  
his antidepressant drug, Zoloft, at the time of the accident and 
that ``everything in his life and career were in chaos.'' The 
lawyers also noted that Saucedo's only injury was a cut lip, even 
though the 62-year-old man had been struck by one of the strongest 
men in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Tyson had intentionally struck Mr. Saucedo, one need  
only look at the crumpling of Francois Botha as a result of the 
single punch from Mr. Tyson to envision the result,'' the lawyers 
said, referring to Tyson's fifth-round knockout of Botha last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Gansler's memo to the judge called Tyson ``nothing less than a  
time bomb.'' Gansler detailed Tyson's 1991 rape conviction in 
Indiana, seven brushes with the law as a juvenile, and the infamous 
fight in which Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear in 
June 1997. Tyson subsequently had his boxing license revoked for a 
year.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year

<HEADLINE> Payton Spurs Organ Donation Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton said  
today that publicity about his need for a liver transplant is 
spurring interest all over the country in organ donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of people are calling, finding out how to become  
donors,'' Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
	His plight made people ``realize that you never know what's  
doing to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CBS' ``This Morning,'' Payton seemed particularly  
pleased by a comment from Mike Ditka, who was his coach with the 
Chicago Bears and now is with the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the amazing thing is to be able to give life in  
death,'' Payton said. ``And he stated that's the most precious 
thing in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you know, from a coach, .... sometimes he can be a little  
wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old Payton was diagnosed with a rare liver disease --  
primary sclerosing cholangitis -- which blocks the bile ducts. 
Without a transplant, his doctor says he would live about two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton said he has been holding up ``real well'' spiritually and  
mentally. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you have a good support team, it kind of makes  
things a lot easier to deal with. And, the outpouring of friends 
and people that I've never heard of, it's been very uplifting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Payton qualifies for rush status, he's expected to wait  
100 to 200 days for a liver at the Mayo Clinic, said John Wingate, 
a spokesman for LifeSource in St. Paul, which handles organ 
procurement for the upper Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Chevron N.C. Drilling Plan Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- It's now unlikely that Chevron USA will proceed  
with plans to drill for oil off the North Carolina coast -- an 
announcement met with applause by opponents of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sort of a reprieve, but we're not going to put our  
guard down,'' said Robert Lamme, a spokesman for Senate President 
Pro Tem Marc Basnight, a coastal resident who is against drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chevron spokesman said Wednesday the oil giant has suspended  
plans for at least a year to sink an exploratory well 45 miles off 
Cape Hatteras, citing low gas prices and opposition from 
environmentalists and politicians. A final decision on whether to 
continue the project will be made this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say there is a low probability we would pursue drilling a  
well in North Carolina right now,'' said Andy Hardiman, vice 
president for Chevron's deep water business unit. ``There's a high 
probability that we won't go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of oil wells off the coast horrified many  
environmentalists, fishermen, coastal residents and others, who 
fear that oil spills and development could harm an area considered 
a rich fishing ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents had promised to mount a fight similar to that against  
Mobil Oil Corp.'s plans to drill in the same area a decade ago. The 
state has set aside $367,000 for a study of the effects of the 
drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill by former U.S. Sen. Lauch Faircloth to block the drilling  
failed last year in Congress, but by the end of 1998 Chevron faced 
a bigger problem: the lowest gas prices, adjusted for inflation, in 
60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron's 1998 fourth-quarter earnings dropped 63 percent. The  
oil industry's woes have led to deep cuts in capital spending and 
the abandonment of risky projects such as oil exploration in virgin 
U.S. territory, said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst with 
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an industry that has very few friends,'' Gheit said  
Wednesday. ``Obviously when the economics are bad and you have no 
friends, there's no reason to put more capital in an area where 
you're not welcome and you're not making money.''

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Enters New York Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Their tactics may differ, but long-distance  
giants AT&AMP;T Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. have both shown this week 
that they're determined to pry open the local telephone monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom said Wednesday it has begun offering local service  
across most of New York state. It will lease phone lines from Bell 
Atlantic, which holds a regional monopoly in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came just two days after AT&AMP;T joined forces  
with Time Warner Inc., expanding its plan to bypass phone 
monopolies around the country by sending calls over cable TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments could mark a new phase in a turf war between  
local and long-distance companies that began in 1996 after Congress 
passed laws designed to enhance competition. That effort has 
largely failed and most consumers still have only one choice for 
local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	Two consumer groups -- Consumers Union and the Consumer  
Federation of America -- reported Wednesday that local and 
long-distance rates have both remained relatively steady since the 
law was passed. Both groups had lobbied against the law. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom's local service will be offered in the New York  
City area at a 5 percent discount to Bell Atlantic prices or in a 
flat-rate package of $14.99 for 100 calls, said spokeswoman Elena 
French. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of New York City, there is no discount. A 100-call  
package would cost $19.99 a month. Because the population is less 
dense than in the city, Bell Atlantic is charging more to lease 
those lines, French said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic was quick to declare Wednesday that the  
arrangement proves that its market is open to competition -- a 
regulatory prerequisite for local phone companies to begin selling 
long-distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say this is a stamp of approval by MCI WorldCom on  
Bell Atlantic having opened up completely to (federal) standards,'' 
said Jim Freeze, a telecommunications analyst at Forrester Research 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the telecommunications reform law was passed three  
years ago, long-distance operators still accuse the local 
monopolies, known as Baby Bells, of denying them easy access to 
their calling networks. For their part, the Baby Bells have 
bristled at a mountain of government requirements keeping them out 
of long distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're now in the frustrating position of doing is meeting  
a whole series of tests and requirements, 600-to-700 pages ... 
proving that markets are open,'' said Bell Atlantic president James 
G. Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, the MCI WorldCom deal may enable Bell Atlantic  
to apply as soon as this spring for clearance to sell long-distance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although much delayed, this is exactly what the  
telecommunications act contemplated three years ago, so I'm happy 
to get on with it,'' said Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast with MCI WorldCom's approach, AT&AMP;T has chosen to  
circumvent the traditional telephone infrastructure and use cable 
TV wires to offer local and long-distance calling and high-speed 
Internet connections.. 
</P>
<P>
	With Time Warner on board, AT&AMP;T is now pursuing its strategy  
with help from the two largest cable companies in the country. Last 
year AT&AMP;T agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc. The combination 
could eventually serve 40 percent of American homes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, unlike MCI WorldCom's New York service, AT&AMP;T's local  
offerings aren't expected to begin for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss., already offers local  
calling to business customers in more than 100 markets across the 
country, and offers limited local residential service in Illinois, 
Michigan and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Bell Atlantic actually marks the second foray into  
New York's local-calling market by MCI, which was acquired by 
WorldCom last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A different arrangement with Bell Atlantic in 1997 proved  
unprofitable and was scrapped after just a few months. The new 
relationship will allow MCI WorldCom to lease customer phone lines 
as needed rather than pay for access to the entire Bell Atlantic 
network in New York.

<HEADLINE> January Retail Sales Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big discounts in the weeks following Christmas  
drove many Americans to shop in January, pushing up sales at the 
nation's biggest retailers to better-than-expected levels. 
</P>
<P>
	From discounters to department stores, most fared well in  
January, which is typically considered a time that merchants drop 
prices to clear out their winter inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting a message from the American public: They will  
spend as long as the price is right,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail 
consultant and president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper 
Montclair, N.J. ``In January, they got what they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The healthy results pleased merchants who had anticipated that  
consumers would scale back their spending in 1999 amid expectations 
that global financial turmoil would slow down U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers continue to benefit from low unemployment and  
inflation, which also have helped to raise consumer confidence. 
Separately today, the Labor Department reported the number of 
Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits 
fell by 9,000 to 292,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underlying strength in the economy is still there and  
consumers are still spending,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, managing 
director at Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	January's figures followed a mixed Christmas for retailers, who  
faced a slow start to the season but managed to achieve respectable 
sales by slashing prices right before and after the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Discounters were the big winners. Shoppers continue to flock to  
stores like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart for their affordable prices 
and wide selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty stores also showed healthy sales gains, especially  
those specializing in home furnishings, electronics and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	After a tough holiday season, department stores generally  
bounced back in January, enticing shoppers with steep discounts. 
They also benefited from seasonal winter weather, which bolstered 
sales of sweaters and coats. 
</P>
<P>
	There were exceptions, notably J.C. Penney, which continued to  
struggle at its department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For most retailers, the fiscal year ended in January, and  
analysts expect strong fourth-quarter and year-end earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 10.3 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 17.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 2.6 percent, total sales down 3.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 8.5 percent, total sales up 9.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.1  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 13 percent, total 
sales fell 6.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 9.6 percent, total sales up  
15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 7.3 percent, total sales up 7  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 5.3 percent, total  
sales up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 11 percent, total sales fell 5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 15 percent, total sales up 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Is Chelsea Clinton a Public Figure? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the heat of their 1992 campaign, the  
Clintons invited People magazine into their backyard and posed: 
Bill, Hillary and Chelsea in one big hug, piled into a hammock. A 
similarly flattering cover story on Chelsea almost seven years 
hence drew a testy retort from the president and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, peppered with questions  
Thursday about the unusual statement from the Clintons prefacing 
next week's 8-page feature, ``Hillary &AMP; Chelsea: Grace Under 
Fire,'' refused even to entertain the question about whether 
Chelsea is, as People managing editor Carol Wallace called her, ``a 
valid journalistic subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Media watchdogs cried foul on the White House.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea is becoming fair game,'' said Marvin Kalb, director of  
Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public 
Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	From a gawky 12-year-old in braces to poised college student,  
Chelsea, nearly 19, has emerged as a sort of semipublic figure -- 
traveling on overseas missions, working the crowds alongside her 
parents, turning up in front of news cameras to hold her father's 
hand when the political stakes last year became critical. 
</P>
<P>
	So why the fuss over an article that, in trying to illustrate a  
close family bond, recalls slumber parties, messages from ``Mommy'' 
to Chelsea's elementary school and a beach picnic where Chelsea 
noticed her mother shiver and slipped her own jacket around Mom? 
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea has not taken on a public role,'' the Clintons' said  
in their appeal meant to hold back the floodgates on coverage of 
their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's People story follows sensational tabloid cover  
stories last year on Chelsea's breakup with her college boyfriend. 
But it is no more intrusive and no less flattering than the story 
the Clintons sanctioned in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In the earlier feature, they freely offered up details on  
Chelsea's plea for pierced ears, her favorite TV sitcoms, her 
morning routine, even the time she asked about sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between then and now? ``Nothing has changed from  
Mrs. Clinton's point of view,'' said her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kalb and others point to vivid images from the past year  
that suggest mixed messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days after Monica Lewinsky burst into headlines last year,  
Chelsea flew 3,000 miles home from Stanford University where she 
was then a freshman. Photographs of her and Dad arm-in-arm 
departing for Camp David helped bolster his initial denials of any 
marital wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months later, she linked hands with both parents and --  
again before a bank of cameras -- held husband and wife together the 
day after Clinton publicly confessed his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chelsea is now being used to convey an image and the line then  
becomes more and more difficult to draw between what is 
journalistically acceptable and what is self-protective for family 
reasons,'' said Kalb. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the coverage unfortunate. But journalism professor  
George Reedy, who was press secretary to Lyndon Baines Johnson, saw 
a public benefit to knowing the private lives of presidents and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the very important things the press must do is give the  
public a picture of what the man is really like -- what his 
personality is, is he honest, is he smart. And people ARE reflected 
in their children,'' Reedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a mirror the Clintons, unlike their predecessors, have  
tightly cloaked since the `92 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to answer any questions about her,'' Mrs.  
Clinton firmly told CNN's Larry King when he asked in 1996 whether 
Chelsea was dating. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea has never been interviewed, although reporters have been  
invited to off-the-record dinners with her during foreign trips. 
She has only spoken in public overseas, in roundtable discussions 
with other young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``For over six years, the media has understood and respected the  
unique situation facing Chelsea,'' the Clintons said on learning of 
the new People story. ``We can only hope the media will continue 
its policy of restraint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a public role is not unusual for the progeny of presidents.  
Anna Roosevelt served as substitute hostess for her father. Amy 
Carter was trotted out for state dinners and to play the violin for 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat at Camp David. LBJ's then teen-age 
daughters, Lucy and Linda, made speeches and kept full public 
schedules. Barbara Bush's eldest grandchild introduced her to the 
1992 Republican national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	But when historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony suggested ``it would  
be wonderful'' if Chelsea introduced Mrs. Clinton to the Democrats' 
1996 convention, the first lady turned frosty, for the first time 
in their many conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said absolutely, unequivocally no. There was not even a  
hesitation or consideration of that,'' recalled Anthony, author of 
the upcoming ``First Families.''

<HEADLINE> Nets Looking To Move Into NBA Elite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Making the playoffs isn't going to  
be enough for the New Jersey Nets in this lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the post-Jordan era, the Nets are a young team that's looking  
to replace Michael and the Chicago Bulls on top. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, it's high hopes for a team that last year made the  
playoffs for the first time since 1993-94. But with an explosive 
run-and-gun offense led by second-year phenom Keith Van Horn and 
All-Star center Jayson Williams, it's going to be fun watching them 
try. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets return nine players from a team that had a 43-39 record  
in John Calipari's second season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Although New Jersey was swept by Jordan and company in first  
round of the playoffs, the Nets had a chance to win the first two 
games in Chicago, even with point guard Sam Cassell severely 
limited by a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The only key player not returning is backup point guard Sherman  
Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Cassell, Van Horn, Williams, Kerry Kittles, Kendall  
Gill, Chris Gatling, Rony Seikaly, Lucious Harris and Brian Evans 
will be small forward Scott Burrell, center Jim McIlvaine and 
guards Eric Murdock and Earl Boykins. 
</P>
<P>
	The ever-talkative Williams, who averaged 12.9 points and 13.6  
rebounds in earning his first All-Star berth, describes the Nets as 
young, quick, explosive and energetic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're like the Yankees,'' said Williams, who signed a  
seven-year, $100 million contract after the lockout ended. ``We 
don't have any stars here. Everybody is a star. The Yankees didn't 
have one star, but a bunch of stars, and that's how we all are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing the Nets can do is score. They averaged 99.6  
points, best in the Eastern Conference. Their weakness is defense. 
They gave up 98.1 points and were next to last in defensive 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in our own hands,'' Calipari said. ``If we defend better  
and rebound better defensively, we're going to win a lot more 
games. If we don't, we're only going to be a slightly better than 
.500 team. That's what holds us back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If one player holds the key, it's Van Horn. The power forward  
averaged 19.7 points and 6.6 rebounds in a season in which he never 
played like a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	He looks physically stronger this year and is going to the  
basket more rather than staying outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who has like Van Horn's big brother since he joined  
the team, said he's the best player he's gone against other than 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``You haven't seen nothing yet,'' Williams said of Van Horn.  
``When the `Pale Rider' puts on his boots this year, he is probably 
going to lead the league in scoring. ... Every day I come here, it 
puts a smile on my face. I know I am playing with a legend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn also has lots of help, which is what makes the Nets  
scary. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell (19.6 points), Kittles (17.2), Gill (13.4), Gatling  
(11.5) and Williams also can score. Seikaly, Harris, Murdock, 
Evans, McIlvaine and Burrell all have experience, much of it as 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The makeup of the team is great,'' Seikaly said. ``If the  
starters are not going well, we can go to the bench without 
hesitation because it's just as deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing that concerns every team in this 50-game season is  
injuries. New Jersey will open on Saturday at Atlanta without 
Kittles (knee) and Seikaly (ankle). Both are expected to return 
within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how the other guys feel, me personally, I think  
we have every right to the title as anyone,'' Cassell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari was a little more cautious.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are a bunch of teams saying: `Why not us?,'' Calipari  
said. ``The thing for us is a plateau at a time. It's winning in 
the playoffs and then advancing from there. Some of the other teams 
have already been in the finals and advanced in the playoffs. I 
don't know how our team will react in the second round.''

<HEADLINE> Skiers Erberharter, Franz Shine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- Stephan Eberharter and Werner Franz  
were disappointed at missing the four-man Austrian team that skied 
in last year's Winter Olympics. They got even Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eberharter and Franz earned starting spots in Saturday's  
downhill at the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Eberharter tied teammate Hans Knauss, winner of the famed  
Hahnenkamm downhill two weeks ago at Kitzbuehel, Austria, for the 
fastest time in training, 1 minute, 40.12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Kristian Ghedina, winner of the first race ever run on  
Beaver Creek's Birds of Prey downhill course last season, was only 
a hundredth of a second back in third, followed by Austria's 
Hermann Maier in 1:40.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Puckett of Crested Butte, Colo., who began the day  
thinking he was training merely for the combined later in the 
championships, earned a spot in the open downhill by finishing 
fifth in 1:40.64. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt a little bit out of control at a couple of spots where  
I thought I was about to lose it, but I held strong and kept 
rolling my skis down the hill,'' Puckett said. ``It was coming at 
me a lot quicker today than it did yesterday'' when he was 17th in 
the first training session. ``I had some hard landings and hurt my 
knee a little -- not hurt, but my knee aches a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most gratifying thing about his performance was that the  
Austrians, the top team in the world, went all out because racers 
were skiing for one of the four spots available in the field 
Saturday. On Wednesday, racers were testing equipment and racing 
lines, and some of the times were suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of sandbagging yesterday, so this is pretty  
cool,'' Puckett said. ``There were a lot of places I could have 
made up time so I'm pretty psyched. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my kind of course. There's a lot of difficult turns on  
the top and I think I really nailed a couple. And then there's a 
lot of speed in the middle that I'm not exactly comfortable with 
because of my lack of experience in downhill. But I've jumped all 
my life and I'm having a blast on those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eberharter confirmed that this was no waltz down the mountain  
for the Austrians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a race for me today. I didn't hold anything back,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My expectations before the training were pretty low. I said to  
myself, `If it's not working today, I have another (medal) chance 
in the giant slalom next Friday, so take it easy.' Maybe it worked 
that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eberharter and Franz went through two agonizing days of  
qualifying to get into the Olympics last winter and it took a toll. 
Eberharter did win a silver medal in the giant slalom but failed in 
his best event, super-G. Franz, a downhill specialist, didn't get 
to race at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Austrian team made it much, much better because we had  
only one day to qualify and in Nagano we had two days. I don't 
think that was the best way,'' Eberharter said. ``You have one race 
(in training) and then you can concentrate on the original race and 
then you don't get burned out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victimized by Austria's race before the race was Andreas  
Schifferer, the defending World Cup downhill champion and winner of 
the second Birds of Prey downhill a year ago. He was sixth, missing 
a spot in the starting field Saturday by .53 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	While Eberharter, Franz and Puckett had reason to smile,  
Canada's Luke Sauder continued a streak of frustration. After 
placing 52nd on Wednesday, he was 42nd on Thursday, 3.89 seconds 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm struggling a little bit,'' Sauder admitted. ``I'll keep  
training and skiing every day and maybe find what was fast before. 
I trained really well this summer and I'm probably skiing the best 
I've skied in my life, but I'm also skiing the slowest I've skied 
in probably the last five seasons of World Cup, so it's kind of 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have expectations. Everybody comes here to win and  
everybody from number one to 40 has the tools. It's just a matter 
of putting it all together and doing it consistently.''

                           *Joann Grillo    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joann Grillo, a mezzo-soprano who sang nearly  
200 times with New York's Metropolitan Opera and co-founded a 
traveling theatrical company, died Monday of a heart attack. She 
was 59 and recovering from recent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Grillo first gained attention in the early 1960s with the  
Brooklyn Opera Company. She debuted at the Met in 1963 as Rosette 
in Massenet's ``Manon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her 20-year career at the Met, Ms. Grillo established herself  
primarily as a dependable singer of supporting roles. She also 
played major roles with other international opera companies. 
</P>
<P>
	With her husband, dramatic tenor Richard Kness, Ms. Grillo  
founded the Ambassadors of Opera and Concert Worldwide in 1981. The 
company performed opera, musicals and vocal concerts in such places 
as Singapore, Guam, Malaysia, Pakistan and Fiji.

<P>
                      *Joseph Kingsbury-Smith    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joseph Kingsbury-Smith, a former national  
editor and chief foreign correspondent for Hearst Newspapers who 
shared in a Pulitzer Prize for reporting from the Soviet Union, 
died Wednesday in suburban Virginia. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingsbury-Smith started a 60-year career with Hearst in 1924,  
when he joined the International News Service as a copy boy. He 
spend the next 34 years in a variety of posts with INS in New York, 
London and Washington, including chief diplomatic correspondent, 
and vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1940s, Kingsbury-Smith corresponded with Soviet Premier  
Josef Stalin. In 1956 he shared the Pulitzer for international 
affairs reporting with Hearst colleagues William Randolph Hearst 
Jr. and Frank Conniff for a series of interviews with Nikita 
Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	He became publisher of the now-defunct New York Journal-American  
in 1959. Seven years later he was named European director of the 
Hearst Corp. and chief foreign writer for its newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1976 he was named national editor of Hearst newspapers. Later  
he headed Hearst's corporate activities in Washington, retiring as 
a vice president and director of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Eileen; two daughters; two  
grandchildren; and two great-granchildren. 

</P>
<P>
                           *John Service    	
</P>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- John Service, an expert on China who was  
forced out of the State Department during the McCarthy era and 
later cleared, died Wednesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Service was the first of the ``old China hands'' to face  
accusations that a pro-Soviet conspiracy in the State Department 
helped lead to the takeover of mainland China by Communists who 
overthrew the Nationalist government in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	While he did criticize the Nationalist Chinese government and  
praise the Communists, investigations essentially found that his 
conclusions were sincere, not a sign of disloyalty to the United 
States. A Senate committee that cleared him said Service wrote 
``what appears to have been the true facts as he saw them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Service, the son of missionaries, was born in China. After  
attending college at Oberlin, he returned to China in 1932 and 
joined the Foreign Service. 
</P>
<P>
	He was assigned to the new Nationalist capital at Chongqing as a  
political officer in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, after getting to Mao Tse-tung's headquarters, Service  
wrote a memo praising the leader, saying Mao was ``universally 
spoken of with respect ... a kind of veneration.'' At the same 
time, Service was describing the Nationalist government as corrupt 
and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	His views, reportedly leaked to the Nationalist government,  
angered the powerful China lobby in the United States. Service was 
called back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Service returned to China as an army adviser, but was  
permanently recalled when he drafted a letter urging that the 
United States provide aid to the Chinese Communists as a way of 
reducing U.S. casualties in an expected Allied invasion to oust the 
Japanese from China. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he was accused of treason for sharing top-secret  
documents with a left-wing publication, Amerasia. A grand jury 
declined to indict him. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1950, Sen. Joseph McCarthy named Service as one of  
14 Communist Party members with close ties to the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Service was cleared by a Senate committee, but was fired in  
December 1951 amid questions about his loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	He challenged the dismissal and, in 1956, the Supreme Court  
ruled unanimously in his favor. He rejoined the State Department, 
taking an obscure post in the Liverpool, England, consulate before 
retiring in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Service later became library curator at the Center for Chinese  
Studies at the University of California-Berkeley. He published 
several books on China. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Claude Vealey    	
</P>
<P>
	SOMERSET, Pa. (AP) -- Claude Vealey, one of three gunmen who  
killed United Mine Workers of America reformer Joseph ``Jock'' 
Yablonski and Yablonski's wife and daughter in 1969, died Sunday of 
brain cancer. He was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Vealey, who confessed in 1970, died at the State Correctional  
Institution at Laurel Highlands, about 60 miles southeast of 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Vealey, Paul Gilly and Aubran ``Buddy'' Martin shot the  
Yablonskis on orders from United Mine Workers President Tony Boyle 
on Dec. 31, 1969, in Clarksville. 
</P>
<P>
	Yablonski had asked the Justice Department to investigate  
possible fraud in the union's bitter presidential election, which 
he had lost to Boyle three weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen, Boyle and five others were convicted in the  
shootings. 

</P>
<P>
                             *Yu Qiuli    	
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Yu Qiuli, a survivor of the Chinese Communist  
Party's epic Long March of the 1930s who later rose to become a 
vice premier, died Wednesday at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Yu lost his left arm following one of many battles during the  
Long March, the yearlong, 6,000-mile retreat by Communist 
guerrillas fleeing the Nationalist government's efforts to 
exterminate them. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands died of hunger, exhaustion, thirst, cold or infighting  
during the grueling trek from southern China to the north. Of the 
90,000 to 100,000 people who set out in October 1934, just 7,000 to 
8,000 completed the march. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Communists seized power from the Nationalists in 1949,  
Yu remained active in the military until 1958, when he became 
petroleum minister. He took charge of building the Daqing oilfield, 
China's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed vice premier in 1975. In 1982, he was made  
deputy secretary general of the Central Military Commission, 
through which the Communist Party wields control over the army.

<HEADLINE> Koznick Carries U.S. Slalom Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Trying to calm her nerves, Kristina Koznick  
made a mistake on the world's biggest skiing stage. 
</P>
<P>
	While preparing for her first Olympic appearance, Koznick tried  
to trick her mind into thinking that the slalom race ahead of her 
was just another ride down the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went into Nagano, and I was nervous and I thought, `Oh, it's  
not a big deal. It's not a big deal,' and that's a joke,'' Koznick 
said Thursday during a teleconference atop Vail Mountain. ``It is a 
big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, America's top woman slalom racer, fell behind following  
a conservative first run in Japan, and she was disqualified after 
missing a gate during an aggressive second run. 
</P>
<P>
	She vowed not to make the same mistake Feb. 13 in the World  
Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants an Olympic medal. Everybody wants a world  
championship medal. I think with that motivation, I won't have a 
lagging first run,'' she said. ``It will be a totally different 
race for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though she finished second in the World Cup slalom standings  
last year and ranks fifth this season, Koznick is still seeking her 
first daytime victory. 
</P>
<P>
	If Koznick was on the planning committee for the championships,  
Vail would be lit up like Yankee Stadium. Both of her career World 
Cup victories have come under the lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nickname `Queen of the Night' can be taken plenty of  
different ways,'' she said jokingly. ``I love racing at night. I 
grew up training from 7 to 9 o'clock at night. I just like it. More 
people come out to watch. It's more of a show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, 23, added to her nocturnal reputation Dec. 28 in  
Semmering, Austria, posting a come-from-behind victory to match her 
nighttime win in Are, Sweden, 11 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody walked up to me and said, `You're a favorite for  
the slalom,' I would say, `Well, I hope so,''' she said. ``That 
makes me feel good. It doesn't really put pressure on me. I put 
plenty of pressure on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick will try to work out any nerves in the giant slalom Feb.  
11. Because of back problems, she has not skied in that event since 
the U.S. Nationals last March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not hoping for a podium on the G.S.,'' she said. ``I know  
I'm not going to have any jaws dropping, but it will make me feel 
good to do something other than just slalom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Koznick gears up for her two events, the women's downhill  
competitors completed their second day of training Thursday on the 
1.6-mile International course. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaela Dorfmeister, who won the bronze in the super-G on  
Wednesday, had the fastest training time of 1 minute, 34.32 
seconds. Like the six other Austrian skiers, Dorfmeister broke from 
her racing tuck and stood upright about 50 meters from the finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take an easy run,'' Dorfmeister said. ``I take care.''  
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Sylvaine Berthoud finished second in 1:34.65, and  
Stefanie Schuster, who had the fastest training time Tuesday, was 
third in 1:34.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuster has only one top-10 World Cup finish in the downhill  
this season, but is an additional weapon for the Austrian women as 
they try to repeat their super-G sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not so easy (Wednesday), but I hope we do the same,''  
Dorfmeister said. ``Maybe two medals. Three will be very 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several skiers nearly wiped out on the course's final jump onto  
Pepe's Face, but there were no crashes like the one that took out 
downhill favorite Regine Cavagnoud on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frenchwoman tore a knee ligament in a crash on French Face  
and is expected to be out for several weeks.

<HEADLINE> CART Driver Ribeiro Takes a Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- Veteran CART driver Andre Ribeiro,  
squeezed out by Team Penske's decision to field only one car this 
year, is taking a leave from the sport to pursue business 
opportunities in his native Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	While careful to avoid talk of retirement, the 33-year-old  
Ribeiro said he definitely will spend 1999 away from the racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I can't say whether I'm done or not done,''  
Ribeiro said Wednesday during CART's annual spring training at the 
Miami-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex. ``At this time, all my 
attention and effort will go toward doing business in Brazil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ribeiro and team owner Roger Penske will team up to establish a  
retail auto business in Brazil under the Penske name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ribeiro owns three wins in four CART seasons, all coming with  
owner Steve Horne's Tasman team. He moved over to Penske last year, 
joining Al Unser Jr. in a two-car team, but the operation struggled 
all season with a new Mercedes-powered chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian's best finish was seventh at Vancouver,  
accomplished while recovering from a broken leg sustained during a 
crash at Mid-Ohio. He earned just 13 points, finishing 22nd in the 
driver standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Penske and team sponsor Marlboro opted to cut back to a one-car  
operation in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the one-car effort gives us a chance to refocus our  
organization,'' Penske said. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the first time since 1971 that Penske has run only one  
car in open-wheel racing. Penske said he'd like to add a second car 
again next year, but was noncommittal whether Ribeiro would regain 
his driving assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, details of the Brazilian business venture remain to  
be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it will be one big dealership or several dealerships,  
I'm not sure yet,'' Ribeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penske Automotive Group already owns six dealerships in southern  
California, selling more than 35,000 vehicles annually.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers Sign Roy Rogers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cavaliers added a much-needed big body to  
their roster, and Roy Rogers added another team to his NBA resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, a free agent forward/center cut earlier this week by the  
Chicago Bulls, signed a contract with Cleveland on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs will be the 25-year-old Rogers' sixth team in three  
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was waived by the Bulls on Monday, less than two weeks  
after he was acquired from Houston in the sign-and-trade deal that 
sent Scottie Pippen to the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I played well in Chicago,'' he said. ``But as my dad  
always told me, 'Life has a strange way of throwing you curve 
balls.''' 
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't was the first off-speed pitch Rogers has seen in his  
short pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	After being drafted by the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1996 with the  
22nd overall pick out of Alabama, the 6-foot-10 Rogers averaged 6.6 
points and 4.7 rebounds per game. He also blocked 163 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Grizzlies traded him in Oct. 1997 to Boston, which then  
shipped him to Toronto as part of a seven-player deal last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflamed right knee limited him to only 15 games last season  
with the Celtics and Raptors, who traded him last June to Houston 
along with two first-round draft picks for Kevin Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers got the call from the Cavs on Wednesday night while at  
his parents home in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got the call from Cleveland, I said I'll be on the next  
flight up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs, who placed rookie forward Ryan Stack on the injured  
list Thursday with a broken right hand, have been looking for a 
frontline player who can spell center Zydrunas Ilgauskas in games 
and bang with him during practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was just looking for another shot.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking for a place where I could fit in,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NY Military Recruit Booth Torn Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For 50 years it sat at the Crossroads of the  
World, a squat steel-and-glass box where military recruiters 
enlisted generations of young men and women into service. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the old Armed Forces Recruiting Center was  
dismantled to make way for a high-tech version more in tune with 
the glitzy makeover of Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it closed in July, the cramped booth set national records  
for enlistments, some 10,000 a year, even though its recruiters 
rejected nine out of 10 applicants for age, medical problems or 
other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither pedestrians nor motorists whizzing past the traffic  
island at Broadway and 43rd Street appeared to notice that another 
bit of Gotham history was being carted off for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the unique history of the recruiting center, we asked  
the Smithsonian Institution and some other museums if they had any 
interest,'' said Peter Shugert, spokesman for the Army Corps of 
Engineers. ``There were no takers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1950, the recruiting center was located in the shadow  
of the building where the ball drops on New Year's Eve and looked 
like a prop left behind by a UFO-movie crew. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of men and women signed up for duty over  
the past half-century, many no doubt lulled by portrayals of 
military life that may have been a little more glamorous than 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's location made it a favorite site for anti-war  
demonstrations during the Vietnam War and again during the Gulf 
War. More recently, it was targeted by protesters of the Clinton 
Administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy regarding gays in 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
	With no one marching or playing ``Taps,'' it fell to civilian  
hard-hats Don Braun and David Poniros to lower the Stars and 
Stripes on Wednesday and fold it into a neat triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	Braun, the project manager for the Corps of Engineers, said he  
remembered the procedure from when his father, a World War II 
veteran of the Navy Seabees, was buried. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's replacement, slated to open in June, is a $1.5  
million building with two 35-foot American flags in neon lights 
covering the outside walls. Nine video screens will display 
recruiting messages and information. 
</P>
<P>
	And the old center? A couple of the lighted signs were carefully  
salvaged by the workers. Most of the steel and other materials were 
headed for storage in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE>  For Meissnitzer, Pressure Is Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- It was a hug that said everything.  
</P>
<P>
	Picabo Street, who came back from oblivion to win an Olympic  
gold medal, threw her arms around Alexandra Meissnitzer to mark the 
occasion of the Austrian's return from her own trek through the 
doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	After an off year in 1997, Meissnitzer began to regain form in  
1998, and this year is on the verge of becoming the sport's 
dominant woman. 
</P>
<P>
	She took a huge step Wednesday by winning the super-G, the first  
women's event of the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	There in the finish area to congratulate her was Street, who  
overcame a year of inactivity to win the super-G in the 1998 Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't talk, because she knew what was going on,''  
Meissnitzer said. ``Yesterday we spent the day together and she was 
trying to make me more relaxed. When she's trying to concentrate, 
she likes to be alone in her room. But I'm the opposite. I want to 
talk. If you're talking to someone who knows, it's such a help, 
someone who can know what's going on in your head. And it's nice to 
have someone on the circuit whose not jealous of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer earned her first medal in three World Championships  
by negotiating Vail's International course in 1 minute, 20.53 
seconds to pace an Austrian sweep. It was just .03 seconds back to 
Renate Goetschl and .21 to Michaela Dorfmeister. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweep gave Austria five of the six medals awarded so far in  
the championships. Hermann Maier shared the gold with Norway's 
Lasse Kjus in the men's super-G on Tuesday, with Hans Knauss 
claiming third. 
</P>
<P>
	Street, out this season with severe injuries to both legs  
suffered in a post-Olympics race, plunged through a crowd to hug 
Meissnitzer. They became friends after sharing a podium at St. 
Anton, Austria, in 1996, and Meissnitzer spent the summer with 
Street after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that I've won the gold, maybe that will take away the  
pressure and I can just concentrate on skiing,'' said Meissnitzer, 
whose great season -- six World Cup victories and the lead in the 
overall standings -- had ski-mad Austria expecting her to win three 
medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer described her gold-medal effort as ``a good run. I  
just made a little mistake in the middle section and I also had one 
near the big jump'' at the end of the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty close today. It was a good run, but I could have  
risked more on the last part over the rolls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Melanie Turgeon, racing despite a recurrence of the  
back problem that has plagued her since the summer, was the top 
North American in the field, 19th in 1:22.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The top American, also victim of a bad back, was Kate Monahan of  
Aspen, Colo., 23rd in 1:22.90. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I felt like I skied pretty well,'' Monahan said,  
``just not as fast as I would have liked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jonna Mendes of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was 26th in the field  
of 43 in 1:23.23, and Caroline Lalive of Steamboat Springs, Calif., 
was 28th, 2.73 back of the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Gerety of Anchorage, Alaska, missed a gate near the bottom  
and failed to finsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians Gail Kelly, Sara-Maude Boucher and Anne Marie  
Lefrancois were 31st, 32nd and 34th.

<HEADLINE> Bookies Won Another Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Bookies won another Super Bowl, but bettors  
didn't get taken for too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures released Thursday by the Nevada Gaming Control Board  
showed the state's legal sports books finished with a profit of 
nearly $3 million on the game on total betting of $75,986,520. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount wagered was just under last year's record of $77.3  
million, but bookies made a 3.8 percent profit on this year's game, 
up from 0.6 percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a wonderful handle,'' said Pete Korner, operations  
manager for Las Vegas Sports Consultants, which sets the odds for 
most major sports books. ``The end result is comparable to some 
good days we've had in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korner said the decision by the Falcons to go for a 2-point  
conversion with just over two minutes left in the game might have 
been the difference between some sports books making a profit or 
taking a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversion failed, and with it so did the chances of some  
books to make money on betting on the total points scored in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anywhere in the world, anyone with a bet on the over-under had  
to wonder what he was doing,'' Korner said. ``It really wasn't 
going to make any difference in the game, just in the number of 
total points scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The failed 2-point conversion left the final score at 34-19, for  
a total of 53 points. In some books that was the total on parlay 
cards, but many other books had it at 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettors who wager parlay cards lose on ties, meaning sports  
books who had it at 53 won a pile of money on parlay bets while 
those who had it at 54 had to pay off those who bet the under. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really cost a lot,'' Korner said. ``It would have been a  
really good day otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the amount of money bet in the state's 137 legal betting  
parlors was below last year's record amount, it was still the 
second-best bet Super Bowl ever. Tens, and even hundreds, of 
millions more were wagered illegally across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl is the most heavily bet sporting event of the  
year, but sports books don't generally get rich off of it. Rather, 
it attracts gamblers to casinos, where hotel operators hope they 
will make even more off games such as blackjack and craps that give 
casinos a larger win percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost every Las Vegas hotel-casino was packed Super Bowl  
weekend, which ranks only behind New Year's as the biggest tourism 
weekend of the year in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become quite a party overall, but the casino win is far  
more important than the sports book win,'' Korner said. ``Betting 
on the game is basically to keep people in the house, and that's 
exactly what it does. Even if the sports book loses money, it's 
still huge for the casino.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Excerpts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Thursday's Senate impeachment trial:  
</P>
<P>
	``We would like very much, as we always have, to have all of the  
witnesses presented here live as we would normally have in a trial, 
as the House has always believed that it should have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came before you for a few days recognizing the reality of  
that and went forward with your procedures to request not five, not 
six, not 12, but three witnesses be deposed so that we might be 
able to, in the discovery process you've allowed us, to gain the 
depositions of those three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we're before you with motions first, to enter those  
depositions and the video recordings of those depositions, into 
evidence formally for your consideration because they've now been 
accomplished.'' -- Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I think that it's imminently fair that we be allowed to  
present at least one witness live to you, the central witness in 
the cast of this entire proceeding, and that's Monica Lewinsky.'' -- 
McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In the context of all of this, I think we have to recognize a  
couple of things. One is that live witnesses are preferable whether 
you have depositions or not. These were discovery depositions. We 
would have liked to have asked for all of them to be live, but we 
are recognizing reality by coming down to one today.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of you have had the privilege, and I'm sure you've  
availed yourself of the opportunity to look at the videotapes of 
these depositions. And you see that they are indeed what most 
depositions are. They are discovery. They have long pauses in them. 
They're not at all like it would be in a trial itself. You don't 
have the opportunity to fully see or explore with a witness the 
demeanor, the temperament, the spontaneity, all of those things 
that you normally get with an exchange. You have the camera simply 
focused on the witness. You don't get to have the interaction you 
get in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``And remember again, that we're dealing here first with your  
determining whether or not the president committed the crimes of 
perjury and obstruction of justice, and then the question of 
whether or not he should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I believe and we believe as House managers that you should  
at least let us have Monica Lewinsky here live for both of those 
reasons.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be a record, not only for you, but for the public  
and for history, of the entire proceeding. There is evidence in 
these depositions that needs to be a part of the official record.'' 
-- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Just on the record alone, just to put the depositions into  
record, there can be nothing complete about this trial if we don't 
at least do that.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky continues to be in her own way an impressive  
witness. As I spoke to you earlier, she does have a story to tell. 
After all, no one knows more about the majority of the allegations 
against the president -- other than, of course, the president 
himself.'' -- Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``At her deposition, she appeared to be a different Monica  
Lewinsky than the Monica Lewinsky with whom I had met a week 
earlier. Unlike before, she was not open to discussion or fully 
responsive to fair inquiry. She didn't volunteer her story. She 
didn't tell her story. Rather, she was ... very guarded in each 
response and almost protective. Her words were carefully chosen and 
relatively few. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, the concepts that she discussed had the familiar  
ring of another key witness to these proceedings, such as: 'it 
wasn't a lie' or 'wasn't false,' it was 'misleading' or 
'incomplete'; 'truth is what one believes it is and may be 
different for different people'; 'truth depends on the 
circumstances.''' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Her (Lewinsky's) testimony is clearly tinted -- and some might  
even say tainted -- by a mixture of her continued admiration for the 
president, her desire to protect him and her own personal views of 
right and wrong.'' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've seen this deposition (of Lewinsky), you've witnessed  
an effective effort by a loyal supporter of the president to 
provide the very minimum of truth in order to be consistent with 
her own grand jury testimony, which is legally necessary for her to 
fulfill the terms of her immunity agreement.'' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You can parse the words and you can use legal gymnastics, but  
you cannot get around the filing of the false affidavit in an 
effort to avoid appearing in the (Paula) Jones case and possibly 
providing damaging testimony against the president.'' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We all want to bring this matter to a conclusion. We want to  
see the end of the story. We want to have a final chapter in this 
national drama.'' -- Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the testimony of Mr. Jordan is dramatic in that it  
shows the control and direction of the president of the United 
States in the effort to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the testimony of Mr. Jordan provides new evidence  
supporting the charges of obstruction and verifying the credibility 
of Ms. Lewinsky.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I would respectfully request this body to develop the facts  
fully, to hear the testimony of Mr. Jordan, to allow him to explain 
this. It tells a story start to finish on this one aspect of 
obstruction of justice that is critical to your determination.'' -- 
Hutchinson.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls as Japan Yields Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen Thursday as  
higher Japanese bond yields continued to support the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also fell slightly against the euro and other major  
currencies as the European Central Bank declined to change interest 
rates, giving the new currency a boost against speculation that 
European rates were about to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 112.21  
Japanese yen, down from 112.87 late Wednesday. The euro was quoted 
at $1.1328, up from $1.1316. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have based their dollar/yen transactions this week on  
the upward movement of Japanese government bond yields, as the 
yields narrow the gap between Japanese securities and U.S. Treasury 
bonds. The stronger Japanese yields make their bonds and yen more 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the yield on the most-watched Japanese bond rose to  
levels not seen since July 1997, finishing Wednesday at 2.335 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the yield fell to 2.170 percent on Thursday, the  
bond still remained attractive because the yield stayed above 2 
percent, said Kathleen Stephansen, a senior economist at Donaldson, 
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The yields are rising partly because banks are selling off their  
10-year bond bonds and buying short-term maturities, Stephansen 
said. The banks are seeking quick money to fatten their balance 
sheets before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the dollar initially rallied during Japanese trading,  
it plunged two yen during the day, hitting 111.65 yen, before 
recovering to a slight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the British failed to lower the value of the British  
pound. The Bank of England cut its repo rate by 50 basis points to 
5.50 percent, a larger slice than anticipated. Although the pound 
initially fell, it eventually rose higher than it was in late 
trading on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound rose to $1.6445 from $1.6364.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4145 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4153, and 1.4900 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5135. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.7265 German 
marks, down from 1.7286; 5.7904 French francs, down from 5.7971; 
and 1,709.40 Italian lire, down from 1,712.33.

<HEADLINE> Double Murder Case May Be Unraveling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man confessed this week to killing a teen-age  
couple in 1982 -- a crime for which another man came within two days 
of being executed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A videotaped confession was made Wednesday to a private  
investigator working with Northwestern University journalism 
professor David Protess and his class. In it, Alstory Simon, a 
Milwaukee laborer who used to live in Chicago, says he killed Jerry 
Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, in Chicago's Washington Park on 
Aug. 15, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Protess made headlines two years ago when another group of his  
students cleared four men in a different killing. On Wednesday, he 
and his current class turned the new tape over to the Cook County 
state's attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reviewing it and will conduct our own full  
investigation,'' state's attorney spokesman Bob Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter, now 43, was convicted of the killings and was  
two days away from death when his scheduled September execution was 
delayed because of questions about his mental condition and IQ. 
Porter's appeal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, sitting in the visiting room at Cook County Jail, banged  
his handcuffed fists against his forehead Wednesday when he was 
told of the videotaped statement, the Chicago Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, my God. Thank you, God,'' he said as he began to weep.  
``I'm just overwhelmed. I've been trying to fight for my life for 
so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the videotape, broadcast on Chicago television stations,  
Simon said he felt threatened during a confrontation over drug 
money and was protecting himself and his wife when the shooting 
occurred. He fired his gun, he said, because he thought Hillard was 
going for a gun in his coat. He said he didn't mean to shoot Ms. 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I knew anything, I just pulled it up and started  
shooting,'' he said during the 10-minute statement, taped in his 
Milwaukee apartment. ``I must have close to busted off about six 
rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also this week, Protess and his students submitted two  
affidavits in Porter's case. In one, a key witness against Porter 
recanted his testimony, saying it was coerced by police. The other 
affidavit was from an Illinois prison inmate who said Simon 
confessed that he committed the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter's attorney, Daniel Sanders, said he will seek to have  
Porter's conviction vacated and his client freed. 
</P>
<P>
	If Porter is exonerated, he will be the 10th death row prisoner  
in Illinois released since the state reinstated capital punishment 
in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Protess and another group of students were instrumental  
in the freeing of four men wrongfully convicted in a 1978 gang rape 
and double murder in suburban Ford Heights.

<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 5, 1937, President Roosevelt proposed increasing the  
number of Supreme Court justices; critics charged Roosevelt was 
attempting to ``pack'' the court. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	In 1917, Mexico's Constitution was adopted.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	In 1962, French President Charles De Gaulle called for Algeria's  
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, a military jury in North Carolina convicted Marine Pvt.  
1st Class Robert Garwood of collaborating with the enemy while a 
prisoner of war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, the Arizona House impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, setting  
the stage for his trial and conviction in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: The Soviet Union announced that all but a small  
rear-guard contingent of its troops had left Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: Sixty-eight people were killed when a mortar  
shell exploded in a marketplace in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
White separatist Byron De La Beckwith was convicted in Jackson, 
Miss., of murdering civil rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963, and 
was immediately sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Democratic fundraiser Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie  
pleaded innocent in Washington to charges he'd raised illegal 
donations to buy influence in high places. A federal judge in Los 
Angeles threw out Charles Keating's state securities fraud 
conviction for a second time, saying the trial judge had given 
jurors flawed instructions.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Honduras is likely to face a grave  
shortage of food this year due to devastation caused by Hurricane 
Mitch, the World Food Program warned on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this moment there is a deficit of 191,000 tons of basic  
grains in Honduras and that means that there will be a food crisis 
this year,'' said Giuseppe Lubatti, the U.N. program's 
representative in the Honduran capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis probably will be sharpest between March and May,''  
he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Lubatti said the World Food Program was preparing $62 million  
worth of aid to help ease the problem with 2,500 tons of food a 
month over the next two years. It donated about 20,000 tons of food 
over the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the hurricane that hit the country in late  
October and early November caused more than $1.7 billion in losses 
to the food sector and killed more than 5,600 people. 
</P>

<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The Argentine government will  
continue studying the viability of fully dollarizing the country's 
economy, an Economy Ministry official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Carlos Menem's proposal to scrap the Argentine  
currency in favor of the U.S. dollar was announced several weeks 
ago. Secretary of Strategic Planning Jorge Castro said after 
Menem's weekly Cabinet meeting that the initiative is considered a 
``strategic priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the meeting, Castro presented a study of the viability of  
pursuing a bilateral monetary treaty with the United States that 
would lead to the dollarization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollarization proposal responds to the trend of current  
times. In that sense, the Argentine government is thinking ahead,'' 
Castro said on television.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The leaders of four Central  
American countries gathered here Thursday to plan for an upcoming 
visit by President Clinton and discuss ways to recover from 
Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Attending the meeting were Presidents Alvaro Arzu of Guatemala,  
Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador, Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua, 
Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica and Carlos Flores Facusse of 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	Honduran Foreign Minister Roberto Flores Bermudez said the  
leaders were discussing continued relief efforts after Mitch, which 
killed almost 10,000 people in late October and early November. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is to visit Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and El  
Salvador March 8-11 in part to assess the damage caused by the 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on hand were Vice President David Fernandez Mirabel of the  
Dominican Republic and a representative of Belize, Mike Mena.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Urged To Attend Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top official in Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic's party told the Serbian parliament today that 
it should vote to send a delegation to Kosovo peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Socialist Party ``thinks that we should show that we are  
fighting for peace and to defend Kosovo everywhere where Kosovo is 
discussed,'' said the party's secretary-general, Gorica Gajevic. 
</P>
<P>
	In her speech to the legislature, which was to vote later today  
on whether to send a delegation to France for the talks, Gajevic 
blasted NATO as an international ``bully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened Serbs and rival ethnic Albanians with force  
if they don't start negotiating by Saturday and strike a deal by 
Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is wielding the stick, piling up weapons and threatening  
our country,'' Gajevic said, adding that Serbia would never allow 
foreign troops on its territory to implement an eventual peace 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Defense Secretary William Cohen had testified  
before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the promise of a 
U.S. peacekeeping presence might be crucial for nailing down 
support for a peace plan from Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	International pressure to attend the peace conference has been  
so strong that Serbian officials had been sending signals of 
dropping their long-standing demand that Kosovo talks be held only 
in Serbia without international mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	The daily Glas Javnosti reported today that Milosevic has been  
meeting frequently in recent days with ultranationalist leader 
Vojislav Seselj to discuss joining the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-liners loyal to Milosevic and ultranationalists loyal to  
Seselj hold a majority in the legislature, which last year 
resoundingly rejected foreign mediation over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the debate opened, more violence was reported in Kosovo.  
Serb sources in Pristina, the capital of the province, reported a 
police officer was killed early today on a routine patrol in 
Djakovica, near the Albanian border. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace conference sponsors are pushing a deal providing for a  
three-year period of autonomy for Kosovo, a province of 
Yugoslavia's Serbia. After that, the two sides would review 
Kosovo's status. 
</P>
<P>
	Western governments hope the autonomy arrangement works so well  
that ethnic Albanian sentiment for outright independence wanes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rebels, who plan to attend the talks in Rambouillet,  
France, outside of Paris, say they will demand a guarantee on a 
vote for independence in three years. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 
2 million people are ethnic Albanians, and sentiment for 
independence is overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia, as well as the United States and the five other  
conference sponsors, oppose independence for Kosovo, fearing it 
would destabilize the Balkans. That raises doubts about the 
prospects for a lasting agreement to end the 11-month-old war that 
has killed 2,000 people and made refugees out of hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior commander in the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said  
Wednesday that his side was committed to an independent Kosovo and 
was joining the talks with little faith they would resolve the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Independence ``will come with war and not talks,'' said  
commander Remi, who like most top-ranking KLA officials identified 
himself only by one name. ``The Serb side knows only force,'' he 
said in northern Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Outlook Bright for HMO Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debate in Congress over HMOs has shifted  
from whether to pass ``patient protection'' legislation to what it 
should include. 
</P>
<P>
	The issues have not changed much since last year, but the  
politics have. A half dozen bills have been introduced, and House 
and Senate committees already are looking for compromises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to tackle the managed-care issue in a bipartisan  
manner,'' Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., 
and the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., 
said in a joint statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They said their staffs were meeting with interest groups in a  
``serious effort'' to find common ground. While Congress has failed 
to produce legislation thus far, they said, ``it is our hope that 
with a fresh start and open minds,'' they can reach consensus in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Even fierce opponents say this year is likely to produce action.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a train going down the track,'' said Chip Khan, who  
heads the Health Insurance Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Any law is likely to give patients the right to complain to an  
outside mediator if an insurance company turns down care and to 
provide guarantees that a health-insurance plan will pay for 
reasonable visits to an emergency room and other basic care. 
</P>
<P>
	But crucial questions still are debated hotly, including whether  
patients should be allowed to sue HMOs when care is denied and 
whether plans must pay for what doctors consider medically 
necessary care. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the House narrowly passed a GOP bill along party  
lines. In the Senate, no legislation was considered because 
Republicans and Democrats couldn't even agree on the rules for 
debate. But this year looks different: 
</P>
<P>
	--Both House and Senate leaders have said legislation will be  
produced through the committee process, which forces the parties to 
work together. Last year, Democrats backed President Clinton's 
plan, and Republicans met in secret to craft their approach. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the House, Democrats picked up five seats in the November  
elections. Last year, the Democratic HMO bill failed by five votes. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the Senate, GOP leaders have introduced their own modest  
legislation. A year ago, they were saying they might not back 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	--The new House speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has  
signaled interest in seeing HMO legislation become law. He was 
chairman of last year's GOP task force, knows the issues and has 
promised a vote before year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Politically, many Republicans would like this issue off the  
table before the 2000 elections. Last year's exit polls found HMOs 
were not a top issue for most voters, although candidates of both 
parties campaigned on it across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The essential arguments for and against legislation have not  
changed. Supporters say patients need protection from health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans that deny 
needed care in order to hold down costs. Opponents say new 
regulations will increase the cost of insurance, cause employers to 
drop coverage and leave more people uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	But even opponents, including the HMO trade group, are open to  
modest regulations, including the right to take disputes over 
coverage to an independent panel. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear how hard opponents will lobby against legislation  
this year. Opponents spent $60 million to lobby on HMO regulation 
and other subjects in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Health Plans is looking ahead to  
2000, trying to keep HMOs out of the presidential race by releasing 
polls of GOP voters in New Hampshire and Iowa that show minimal 
interest in the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some insurance companies are acting on their own to  
address complaints. Just Thursday, Sierra Health Services of Nevada 
became the latest company voluntarily to offer its members external 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that anti-managed care comments and anecdotes  
create a concern that HMOs may not provide lifesaving treatment for 
severely ill patients,'' the company's chief executive officer, Dr. 
Anthony M. Marlon, said in a statement. ``Outside independent 
review should give our members peace of mind.''

<HEADLINE> Hero Firefighter's Son Needs Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Legislators, school officials and  
donors tried Thursday to help the son of a fallen firefighter who 
was denied a state college tuition waiver because his father wasn't 
technically a state employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of the pilots the state depends on to fight wildfires,  
Donn Johnson flew a California Department of Forestry plane but was 
employed by a contractor the state hired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature didn't seem to make a distinction when it  
honored Johnson as a state hero after he was killed in an air 
tanker crash while saving homes from a wildfire 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Calder Johnson, began attending Humboldt State  
University in the fall after school officials assured him he was 
entitled to a state scholarship for children of firefighters and 
police officers killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Humboldt State's lawyers read his father's death  
certificate and took back the money this week, leaving the young 
man and his widowed mother feeling disowned by the state his father 
had given his life for. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after an Associated Press story on their plight,  
officials scrambled to help Calder Johnson -- and children of 
similar fallen heroes -- get a free ride through college. 
</P>
<P>
	Two private donors gave about $10,000 to the university to cover  
his tuition and fees, said Humboldt State University spokesman Sean 
Kearns. Tuition and room and board this year is $7,720. 
</P>
<P>
	There were numerous other offers of donations to Johnson and the  
university. Johnson is pondering the offers. The college declined 
donations that would have exceeded the amount of the original 
government scholarship, Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two state lawmakers said they may introduce  
legislation to officially extend the scholarship to make the 
children of contract firefighters as well as state employees 
eligible for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really, really surprised and pleased. This makes me very  
optimistic,'' said Johnson, who was 5 when his father died on Oct. 
7, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother had scraped together $900 to keep the 17-year-old  
Eagle Scout attending college this semester. But Johnson, 
interested in the medical field, feared he would have to drop out 
without more money, ending his dream of attending graduate school.

<HEADLINE> Senate Will Show Video Depositions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate moved today to bring President  
Clinton's impeachment trial to a prompt conclusion, rejecting a 
last-ditch request by House prosecutors to summon Monica Lewinsky 
for live testimony. Republicans also shrank from a plan to declare 
the president guilty without ousting him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	With 25 Republicans joining Democrats, the Senate rejected,  
70-30, the prosecutors' request to issue a subpoena requiring the 
young woman at the center of the impeachment drama to testify in 
the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	With support from several Democrats, however, Senate Republicans  
approved the House prosecutors' request to show at the trial this 
weekend ``all or portions'' of the videotaped depositions of Ms. 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House adviser 
Sidney Blumenthal. All three had been questioned in private earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and White House lawyers would have up to three hours  
each to show portions of those videotapes on Saturday before the 
two sides begin closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, emerging from a closed-door meeting with fellow  
Republicans, Majority Leader Trent Lott declared the Senate was 
``on track'' for a final vote on the two articles of impeachment by 
Feb, 12, or perhaps a day earlier. Democrats renewed a call for a 
formal censure of the president, but only after the trial ends with 
his acquittal on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	While the drive to end the trial picked up steam, Republicans  
thwarted a Democratic request to skip the airing of any witness 
testimony and move directly to closing arguments. The idea offered 
by Minority Leader Tom Daschle was rejected 56-44. 
</P>
<P>
	While senators began laying the groundwork for the trial finale,  
they turned away House prosecutors who pressed for live testimony 
by Ms. Lewinsky. The House prosecutors, at times, flashed their 
frustration over being unable to secure enough votes for conviction 
or live witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one senator has failed to personally sit through ... every  
deposition, that senator is not equipped to render a verdict on the 
impeachment trial,'' Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., chided at one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., made his own plea. ``I think that it  
is eminently fair that we be allowed to present at least one 
witness live to you, the central witness in the cast of this entire 
proceeding and that is Monica Lewinsky,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House special counsel Gregory Craig opposed Ms. Lewinsky's  
live appearance and the release of the videotapes, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is a bad idea,'' Craig told the senators, arguing  
the tapes would ``produce an avalanche of unwelcome'' testimony 
``into the living rooms of the nation.'' He argued that only 
written transcripts should be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	When the White House requested it be given early notice of which  
parts of the videotaped depositions the prosecutors planned to use 
on Saturday, Rogan bristled. He quoted a former California judge 
who once said ``it's none of your damn business what the other side 
is going to put on.'' Presidential attorney David Kendall had 
presented the idea as a way of speeding up Saturday's proceeding. 
Senators rejected the idea on a 54-46 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., lamented that Ms. Lewinsky had been  
``very guarded,'' choosing her words carefully to ``provide the 
very minimum of truth'' during her deposition earlier this week. 
``Her testimony is clearly tinted and some might even say tainted 
by a mixture of her continued admiration for the president, her 
desire to protect him and her own personal views of right and 
wrong,'' Bryant lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	To help in the argument for showing portions of the videotapes  
at the trial, Rep. Asa Hutchinson provided the first quotations 
from Jordan's deposition concerning efforts to find a job for Ms. 
Lewinsky around the time she was emerging as a witnesses in the 
Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan testified Clinton had asked him to find the former intern  
a job and ``the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms. 
Lewinsky.'' Hutchinson argued the testimony showed Jordan was an 
unwitting agent for a president eager to thwart Mrs. Jones' lawyers 
from learning about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the proceedings, White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff  
wrote Lott today that Clinton would not submit to a deposition, as 
GOP senators requested. ``It is neither necessary nor appropriate 
for the president to testify,'' Ruff wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been trying to find an exit from a trial that  
is unpopular with the public. Democrats have increasingly referred 
to the proceedings as a ``Republican trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes, the more it becomes a partisan trial, a  
Republican trial,'' Democratic leader Daschle told reporters. He 
said the Democrats were drafting a proposal to censure Clinton and 
expected to have it completed in a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Republicans also indicated today that prospects were  
dimming for a proposal that would conclude Clinton committed 
wrongdoing without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have blocked it. We don't want this to break  
into a partisan melee,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. And Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the proposal ``an effort for 
politicians to protect themselves politically. The way out is to 
vote 'guilty' or 'not guilty' and live with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the Democratic alternative would  
be written less legalistically than the articles of impeachment 
``and more in moral terms of censure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``finding of fact'' proposal pushed by some Republicans  
accuses Clinton of lying to the grand jury. They would like to vote 
on that before the actual articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged lawmakers and others at a  
prayer breakfast to help Clinton, who participated in the event. 
Lieberman asked ``at this time of difficulty for the president, 
that you hear his prayer, that you help him with the work he is 
doing with his family and his clergy, that you accept his 
atonement.''	   Republicans held a party meeting to search for a solution to the 
``findings of fact'' dilemma, unhappy to have the trial end with a 
straight acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to convict a  
president and remove him from office -- a margin both parties agree 
is not within reach -- but the ``finding of fact'' would only need a 
majority.

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Drug Smuggling Stopped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate Republicans accused President  
Clinton on Thursday of failing to get tough on drugs by funding 
programs to stop smuggling from other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., called Clinton's drug policy one of  
``Just say maybe'' rather than ``Just say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way we can win this is to just say `no,''' he said at  
a news conference. ``This is a serious war. This is not a war you 
just say `maybe' about. This is a war you win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal 2000 seeks $17.8 billion  
for drug-fighting programs, a slight decrease from the $17.9 
billion this year, which includes $844 million in emergency 
supplemental funding. 
</P>
<P>
	About 14 percent of the 2000 funding would go to international  
and interdiction programs, compared with nearly 18 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``As this number goes down, the supply goes up,'' said Sen. Paul  
Coverdell, R-Ga. ``As the supply goes up, the price goes down. As 
the price goes down, use goes up. That's why interdiction is 
useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim McDonough, director of strategy at the White House Drug  
Control Office, said the administration had a planned approach that 
balanced both sides of the drug equation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theory is, if there's no demand there's no supply. The  
more you can lower demand you really can cut supply,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Republicans were upset they could find no  
evidence that Clinton funded a special program that Congress and 
the White House agreed to last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	That law authorizes more than $2 billion over three years for  
equipment, training and other interdiction tools for the Coast 
Guard and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the House Judiciary  
subcommittee on crime, called the omission a travesty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not even beginning in the president's plan to wage the  
kind of war we said a couple of months ago we should do,'' McCollum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough did not have specifics on those line items, but he  
said that the overall cuts Republicans decried compared a regular 
year's funding with extra, supplemental funding added at GOP 
insistence. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the supplemental funding, the overall budget would  
increase in 2000, and the percentage for interdiction would remain 
roughly the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall's anti-drug law included provisions that mandated the  
use of foreign aid as leverage to urge other nations to keep up 
anti-drug efforts, upgraded some technology and intelligence tools 
that American law enforcement officers use in intercepting illegal 
drugs and provided U.S. aircraft and helicopters to Bolivia, 
Colombia and Peru to help eradicate drug crops.

<HEADLINE>  Polish Farmers Suspend Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Farmers striking for higher prices for  
agricultural products said today they would temporarily suspend 
protests after Poland's government ordered police to clear their 
roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm leaders called off the blockades, which have disrupted  
traffic across the country since Jan. 25, in hopes of resuming 
negotiations with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The government indicated it would meet with farm leaders after  
making sure that all road blocks are gone. The ministers walked out 
Wednesday, saying they would not meet with striking farmers while 
the illegal blockades continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers, who also oppose the reforms necessary for Poland's  
bid to join the European Union, began dismantling the first of 
about 90 roadblocks, constructed with farm equipment and bales of 
hay. 
</P>
<P>
	But Andrzej Lepper, a radical farmer leader and a driving force  
behind the protest, said twice as many would go up again unless 
talks show some progress by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension, which he called ``a gesture of good will,'' came  
soon after the interior minister ordered police to make sure roads 
were clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict has fueled tension in the ruling coalition of the  
right-wing Solidarity and the pro-market Freedom Union, which 
criticized government officials for starting talks Tuesday on a 
premature report that the blockades had been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	With talks stalled, the government had planned today to approve  
a program to restructure the agriculture sector this year without 
consultations with farming leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite broad economic reforms intended to complete the shift  
from a communist-era economy to a market system, Polish agriculture 
remains hobbled by small, poorly equipped farms unable to compete 
with more modern farms in western Europe. Farmers have resisted 
planned agricultural reforms, fearing the loss of control over 
their land and working for others. 
</P>
<P>
	While surveys show most Poles favor joining the EU, the protest  
also illustrates that many are worried about tougher competition 
that threatens living standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Before talks stalled, the agriculture ministry promised to  
introduce stricter controls on food imports and to stimulate 
exports to Russia, where the market has collapsed along with the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also agreed to buy pork at higher prices,  
apparently meeting a key demand, but Lepper rejected the purchase 
price as too low.

<HEADLINE> New Forbes Theme Gets Mixed Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Nancy Streck watched closely as Steve  
Forbes assured her face-to-face that he was unalterably ``pro-life 
from conception to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You look in his eyes and you can tell he's sincere,'' said  
Streck, a veteran abortion opponent who signed on with Forbes' 
presidential campaign after their meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Loras Schulte, another longtime abortion foe, heard the same  
pitch. He signed on with activist Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trust is something you earn,'' said Schulte. ``Steve Forbes is  
probably going to have some problems getting back that trust, 
especially with religious conservatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Forbes is far different than the one who  
unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in 1996, and his 
ability to pull off the switch holds the key to his future. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last bid, the millionaire publisher focused almost  
exclusively on his call for a flat tax, and he found hostility 
among social conservatives leery of his stance on abortion and 
other issues important to the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
	He also relied extensively on a television blitz, devoting  
little effort to building campaign organizations in important early 
states like Iowa and Hew Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	This time Forbes is carefully courting conservatives, sounding  
strict antiabortion themes and conservative positions on other 
social issues such as school choice and English as the official 
language, as well as hammering at the flat tax. He's also spending 
lots of his money to recruit talented organizers in what backers 
argue is nothing more than an expected evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's natural that he would broaden his agenda,'' said former  
Iowa Republican Chairman Steve Grubbs, who has joined Forbes' 
campaign. Others are a bit more skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the jury is still out,'' said Des Moines lawyer Steve  
Roberts, who sits on the Republican National Committee. ``People 
have a right to change their mind, but I find the conversion 
amazing. It's been somewhat of a shock to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Streck had no such doubts, saying she talked with Forbes and  
found his views compatible with hers on such things as school 
choice and official English. ``Those are important issues for me,'' 
said Streck. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are also important issues for a group of national social  
conservative leaders who interviewed six GOP presidential hopefuls 
Tuesday in Washington. ``I think Forbes helped himself,'' said 
participants Paul Weyrich. ``He came across very humbly and was 
very candid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some blame bad advice for his message last time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think people who were advising him told him not to address  
these things,'' said Streck. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Siegrist, a legislative leader and veteran Republican  
mover, said Forbes has proven himself more adept on the campaign 
trail this time, appearing more comfortable in private meetings 
with key activists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's better than he was last time around,'' said Siegrist, who  
is nevertheless backing Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee 
governor and U.S. education secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulte, backing Bauer, said social conservatives have a long  
memory: ``One of the things that appeals to me is the consistency 
of their positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But RNC member Roberts said Forbes has clearly made inroads with  
social conservatives, who are far less nervous about his campaign. 
Some prominent leaders of that movement have signaled that they, at 
the least, are less hostile to Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem, to some extent, to be giving Forbes a blank check  
on this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran antiabortion lobbyist Mona Yentes confessed that she  
likes a lot of what Forbes says, giving him credit ``for 
articulating a conservative message very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like the church; you always accept converts,''  
said the fundamentalist Christian who remains on the fence about 
Forbes. ``In the church you would disciple your converts before you 
would put them in leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Iowa Republican Chairman Richard Schwarm said he's  
willing to accept that Forbes has experienced ``a growth in his 
philosophy'' but doesn't know about others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect the electorate might be a little bit more  
questioning than I am,'' said Schwarm. 
</P>
<P>
	And Siegrist cautioned that Forbes risks lose backing from more  
traditional Republicans who like his focus on lower taxes if he 
courts conservatives too heavily. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to be careful to not pander to that side too much,''  
said Siegrist.

<HEADLINE> L.T. Enjoys Birthday, Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The passage of a little time apparently did a  
lot to mellow out Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrating his 40th birthday, Taylor was glib, personable and  
relaxed Thursday as he spoke and answered questions for nearly 20 
minutes at an airport hotel news conference for the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame's newest five members. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, Eric Dickerson, Tom Mack, Ozzie Newsome and Billy Shaw --  
appearing together for the first time -- were on their way to 
Hawaii, where they will meet with officers of the Hall of Fame and 
attend Sunday's Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who played for the New York Giants for 13 years and  
established himself as one of the dominant defensive players in NFL 
history, said he was ``very appreciative of being in the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame, class of '99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked hard for this day and am happy this day did  
come,'' he said. ``I wondered if it was all worth it. I'm here to 
say, Yes, it is.' I wasn't sure how I would feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't particularly overjoyed Saturday when I got the  
news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, he wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's candidacy was a topic of controversy throughout Super  
Bowl week. Suspended once while he was playing and arrested twice 
on drug charges after he retired, Taylor has struggled with 
off-the-field problems that left some voters uneasy with his 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike baseball, there is no ``citizenship'' clause in the  
football hall's bylaws. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue endorsed 
Taylor's election, which nevertheless was still in question before 
the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The following day, in an interview with Fox Sports News, Taylor  
criticized some of the writers who elected him, and said they were 
holding him to a standard they would not apply to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about his feelings of last weekend, he smiled and  
replied, ``We really don't have to go there. There were questions 
and situations I felt shouldn't have been involved in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw myself as one of the best to play the game. I gave the  
game everything I had. I'm very happy the game gave back to me. I 
can't control (the voting process). I put my heart into it every 
Sunday. I've been rewarded for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who was wearing a Hall of Fame shirt, sweatpants, a  
dangling earring, a black bandana, dark glasses and sandals, joked 
with the other future Hall of Famers along with the media in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a pleasure to be with these guys,'' he said.  
``Football was my life and I really enjoyed it. I have a lot of 
memories from it. I am just very happy and very humbled to have my 
name mentioned with all these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he was torn as far as a Hall of Fame presenter was  
concerned between Giants owner Wellington Mara and former Giants 
coach Bill Parcells, now coach of the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a big problem there,'' Taylor said. ``It's hard for me  
to even think about which one I would take because I would snub the 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About Parcells, Taylor said, ``He allowed me to do what I do  
best. ... Create havoc, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, the NFL's top defensive player three times, and  
Dickerson, the league's third-leading career rusher, were both 
elected in their first year of eligibility.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Lenard Goes on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat shooting guard Voshon Lenard will start  
the season on the injured list as he ponders whether to undergo 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctors and coach Pat Riley have recommended an operation  
to repair the stress fracture in Lenard's left leg. Surgery would 
likely sideline him for 8-10 weeks in a lockout-abbreviated season 
that runs only 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no guarantee the fracture will heal without surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	With the season opener Friday against the Detroit Pistons,  
Lenard remains uncertain what to do regarding his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm either going to try to see if I can let it heal or if I  
need the surgery,'' Lenard said. ``It's kind of shocking to me to 
have to be on the injured list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenard risks a more serious injury by playing, and Riley decided  
not to take the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``As his coach, I feel this is in his best interests,'' Riley  
said. ``Despite his courage and his desire to play, I want to make 
sure this is taken care of. He's done until this heals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also placed on the injured list Thursday were forward Terry  
Mills (sore knee) and center Amal McCaskill (back). The Heat waived 
center Thomas Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley designated Dan Majerle as Lenard's replacement in the  
starting lineup. Miami's offense will be hurt on the perimeter by 
the loss of Lenard, who ranked sixth in the NBA last season with 
153 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	His injury was diagnosed at the start of training camp two weeks  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said his decision was based on Lenard's tentative play in  
practice and two exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The final determination is that the doctors believe he needs  
to have surgery,'' Riley said. ``If we're not going to listen to 
them, then why do we hire them?''

<HEADLINE> Thrill Killing Suspect Pleads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASTORIA, Ore. (AP) -- A man accused in a beachfront killing  
inspired by the film ``In Cold Blood'' avoided a possible death 
sentence with a plea Thursday that requires him to cooperate 
against his alleged accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Carl McAllister, a 21-year-old high school dropout, stood  
in white jail garb and chains and told a judge how he gunned down a 
couple as they watched the sunrise on a Seaside beach on July 14, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal with prosecutors, McAllister pleaded guilty to two  
counts of aggravated murder and will be sentenced Feb. 26 to two 
consecutive life terms without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no adequate punishment for the brutal murder of two  
people in cold blood,'' said Don Nimz, the brother of one of the 
victims. But he added that the plea ``saved years and years of 
appeals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McAllister and Bradley Charles Price, 23, were accused in the  
slayings of Gabriella Brooke Goza, 26, and Frank ``Kacy'' Nimz Jr., 
36. Goza, a local waitress, and Nimz, a tuna fisherman, were shot 
in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors called it a ``thrill killing,'' influenced by the  
movie the suspects had rented four times -- a dramatization of the 
Truman Capote true-crime book ``In Cold Blood.'' McAllister 
allegedly phoned a friend the morning of the murders and said the 
couple was killed ``for the hell of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the shootings, Price and McAllister fled together to  
Mexico. McAllister was arrested last July as he walked back across 
the border into Brownsville, Texas. Price, who goes on trial in 
May, was arrested two days later in the Mexico City nightclub.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Executes Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man who shot a car salesman, tied his body  
to a truck bumper and then dragged the man down a dirt road has 
been executed by injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Leslie Fry, 23, had pleaded guilty to murder and robbery in  
the February 1994 slaying of Leland A. Jacobs, who worked for a 
Richmond-area Ford dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	In a final statement before his execution Thursday night, Fry  
said he was ``sorry for what I've done, and I have made peace with 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs was shot 11 times with a .22-caliber handgun. His necktie  
was tied to the rear bumper of an Explorer. A medical examiner 
testified that Jacobs probably was still alive when he was dragged. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer who had a warrant for Fry's arrest in an  
unrelated case spotted Fry and an accomplice, then 17-year-old 
Bradford A. Hinson, leaving the scene and stopped them. Fry 
confessed to the killing when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinson was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery and is  
serving an 88-year sentence.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Lineup May Change in Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers might have to make as  
many as two changes in their starting lineup Friday night when they 
open the abbreviated NBA season against the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Horry's wife went into labor Thursday in Houston, and the  
28-year-old forward was scheduled to fly there Thursday night. Team 
spokesman John Black said it was uncertain whether Horry would 
return in time to play against the Rockets in the opener at the 
Forum in suburban Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Fox, the other starting forward, missed his third straight  
day of practice because of sore ankles, and said while he hoped to 
play in the opener, he would have to wait until Friday's 
shootaround to determine his status. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's practice, Fox, in civilian clothes, spent time  
shooting baskets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers coach Del Harris said Fox wouldn't start against the  
Rockets even if he is able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's missed too much,'' Harris said. ``We'll put him in there  
some and see how he goes. He hasn't been effective in a week 
(because of his ankles).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris listed several possible starting lineups.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Houston guessing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	If Horry is back in time, he will start at one forward position.  
It could be at power forward with Kobe Bryant at small forward, or 
it could be at small forward with Elden Campbell, Corie Blount or 
Travis Knight at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the Lakers' first 10 games are against playoff teams  
from last year -- Houston, Utah, San Antonio twice, Minnesota, 
Indiana and Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we started with 11 wins,'' Harris recalled. ``You've  
just got to believe you're as ready as anybody. We're hoping we 
come out of the gate strong. There aren't that many bad teams 
you're going to play, anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About the first three opponents -- Houston, Utah and San Antonio  
-- Harris said, ``This is like opening with Duke, Stanford and 
Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was nothing new on the Dennis Rodman front  
Thursday as the Lakers turned in their 14-player opening-night 
roster to the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has played on five of the last 10 NBA championship  
teams, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls, recently 
mentioned the Lakers as one of the teams he was interested in 
joining, and the Lakers have expressed an interest in Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you we're fielding calls from several teams that  
are expressing serious interest in Dennis, and he's weighing his 
options,'' Andrea Marozas, a spokeswoman for International Creative 
Management, which represents Rodman, said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the situation who spoke on the condition of  
anonymity said there is no time frame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard a thing about it,'' Lakers co-captain  
Shaquille O'Neal said. ``I don't want to think about it until it 
happens. It's up to him, it's not up to us. We said openly and 
publicly we wouldn't mind having him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to his agent. I'm sure (executive vice president)  
Jerry (West) is doing everything he can.''

<HEADLINE> 'Doonesbury' Follows Day Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The risky world of day trading in stocks has  
become so popular among ordinary investors that the ``Doonesbury'' 
comic strip is chronicling the day-by-day progress of a character 
who has embarked on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The buttoned-down Chase opened an online day-trading account  
this week with $10,000 -- actually a smaller deposit than most 
day-trading companies require of an amateur getting into the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday's episode, Chase was ready to buy shares of  
imaginary company E-Bid, a new business ``with only one product -- 
its own stock.'' His adrenaline rush was palpable. A day earlier, 
he masked his fear when the Nasdaq Stock Market dropped 63 points 
and he was suddenly down 40 percent on his trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Day trading has attracted a small but growing breed of  
investors, many of whom have abandoned their regular jobs for the 
prospect of quick riches. Day traders seek out stocks solely for 
their sharp price swings, buying and selling them quickly to 
capitalize on the short-term movement in price and rarely holding a 
position overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	But securities regulators have expressed concern that some  
day-trading companies, which sell training courses and specialized 
software and provide computer work space to investors, could be 
misleading them about potential profits and causing them to get in 
over their heads. State regulators have stepped up their scrutiny 
of day-trading firms and a handful, particularly in Massachusetts, 
have filed fraud charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're concerned when day trading becomes such a part of the  
culture'' that it is featured in a popular comic strip, said Marc 
Beauchamp, a spokesman for the North American Securities 
Administrators Association, which represents the state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are misled about the potential of day trading and  
lose all their money: that's not funny,'' Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission, warned last week that day trading can be ``highly 
risky'' for Main Street investors, who should engage in it only 
``with funds they can afford to lose.'' He expressed dismay at 
stories he had heard of people putting up their student loan money, 
mortgages or retirement savings to finance their day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading companies acknowledge it's not for  
everyone, but they say it can give financial freedom to ordinary 
people who study and learn trading techniques. They maintain the 
regulators are unfairly tarnishing their industry because of a few 
rogue firms that may have misled investors about what kind of money 
they could make. 
</P>
<P>
	The Electronic Traders Association, which represents day-trading  
companies, said in a statement Thursday it was concerned that many 
people may be undertaking the practice without ``a clear 
understanding of the effort required to become successful and the 
potential risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group issued guidelines for people considering day trading  
and a suggested disclosure statement for companies to provide to 
potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the guidelines: only risk capital that you don't need for  
living or retirement should be used to finance day trading, and 
only ``highly disciplined'' people should get into it.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 62.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended lower after a day of wide swings,  
as aggressive profit-taking in technology shares overwhelmed 
strength in industrial names. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow average was down  
62.31 at 9,304.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow erased a 91-point morning gain and briefly swung into  
positive territory in the afternoon, as the Federal Reserve 
signaled that it had no intention of raising interest rates. But 
the 31-point gain in the Dow couldn't hold as technology leader IBM 
was pounded 5 3/4 to 169 1/2, responsible for nearly 24 points of the 
Dow's loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners never lost their lead on advancers and were leading by  
more 9 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was moderately 
heavy. 
</P>
<P>
	The rout in technology shares sent broad-market indexes  
tumbling. The Nasdaq had its third-largest point drop ever. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite lost 23 points. It fell 23.58 to 
1,248.49 down, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 
82.87 to 2,410.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,100 up, 1,952 down and 525 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 851.73 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
869.9 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 7.53 to 591.05, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 6.15 to 707.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.95 to 417.79.  
</P>
<P>
	The market couldn't hold up without technology shares, which  
have been the key to its advances, said Larry Wachtel, market 
analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology is the key'' to the market's high valuations, he  
said, and by selling technology stocks, ``in effect the Street is 
saying, you have reached valuations that I cannot justify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One exception to the debacle in technology stocks for most of  
the day was online trading companies, which were posting strong 
gains for the second day in a row until Elliott Spitzer, New York 
State's attorney general, said he was looking into trading 
irregularities at these firms. Most of them ended lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's brief foray into positive territory was sponsored by  
economically sensitive stocks, such as Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing and International Paper, by Eastman Kodak, all of 
which ended in positive territory after the Fed released minutes of 
its December meeting indicating that it didn't plan to raise 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But big losses in names like computer chip maker Advanced Micro  
Devices in leading volume on the New York Stock Exchange, proved 
too much. Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock after the company 
pulled out of two high-profile technology conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of competitor Intel were down sharply in Nasdaq trading.  
Intel lowered its prices in January, in a move that analysts fear 
may spark a price war in semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	Some portfolio managers were quiet ahead of Friday's release of  
January employment data, fearing that the report will show a drop 
in unemployment that could put even more pressure on the Fed to 
raise interest rates. Higher rates are not good for stock prices 
because they raise corporate financing costs and can cut into 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a possible early peak at that data, the Labor Department said  
early Thursday that the number of new unemployment claims fell 
9,000 in the week ended Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other pieces of bullish economic news, the Commerce  
Department reported a 2.3 percent jump in orders to U.S. factories 
in December but said they rose just 2.1 percent for all of 1998, 
the weakest showing in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	And retailers reported strong January sales figures, but  
Wal-Mart shares were unchanged late in the day after the retailer 
reported that sales at stores open at least a year rose 10.3 
percent during the four weeks ended Jan. 29.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Excerpts-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Thursday's Senate impeachment trial:  
</P>
<P>
	``We would like very much, as we always have, to have all of the  
witnesses presented here live as we would normally have in a trial, 
as the House has always believed that it should have. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came before you for a few days recognizing the reality of  
that and went forward with your procedures to request not five, not 
six, not 12, but three witnesses be deposed so that we might be 
able to, in the discovery process you've allowed us, to gain the 
depositions of those three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we're before you with motions first, to enter those  
depositions and the video recordings of those depositions, into 
evidence formally for your consideration because they've now been 
accomplished.'' -- Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I think that it's imminently fair that we be allowed to  
present at least one witness live to you, the central witness in 
the cast of this entire proceeding, and that's Monica Lewinsky.'' -- 
McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In the context of all of this, I think we have to recognize a  
couple of things. One is that live witnesses are preferable whether 
you have depositions or not. These were discovery depositions. We 
would have liked to have asked for all of them to be live, but we 
are recognizing reality by coming down to one today.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of you have had the privilege, and I'm sure you've  
availed yourself of the opportunity to look at the videotapes of 
these depositions. And you see that they are indeed what most 
depositions are. They are discovery. They have long pauses in them. 
They're not at all like it would be in a trial itself. You don't 
have the opportunity to fully see or explore with a witness the 
demeanor, the temperament, the spontaneity, all of those things 
that you normally get with an exchange. You have the camera simply 
focused on the witness. You don't get to have the interaction you 
get in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``And remember again, that we're dealing here first with your  
determining whether or not the president committed the crimes of 
perjury and obstruction of justice, and then the question of 
whether or not he should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I believe and we believe as House managers that you should  
at least let us have Monica Lewinsky here live for both of those 
reasons.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be a record, not only for you, but for the public  
and for history, of the entire proceeding. There is evidence in 
these depositions that needs to be a part of the official record.'' 
-- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Just on the record alone, just to put the depositions into  
record, there can be nothing complete about this trial if we don't 
at least do that.'' -- McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Lewinsky continues to be in her own way an impressive  
witness. As I spoke to you earlier, she does have a story to tell. 
After all, no one knows more about the majority of the allegations 
against the president -- other than, of course, the president 
himself.'' -- Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``At her deposition, she appeared to be a different Monica  
Lewinsky than the Monica Lewinsky with whom I had met a week 
earlier. Unlike before, she was not open to discussion or fully 
responsive to fair inquiry. She didn't volunteer her story. She 
didn't tell her story. Rather, she was ... very guarded in each 
response and almost protective. Her words were carefully chosen and 
relatively few. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, the concepts that she discussed had the familiar  
ring of another key witness to these proceedings, such as: 'it 
wasn't a lie' or 'wasn't false,' it was 'misleading' or 
'incomplete'; 'truth is what one believes it is and may be 
different for different people'; 'truth depends on the 
circumstances.''' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Her (Lewinsky's) testimony is clearly tinted -- and some might  
even say tainted -- by a mixture of her continued admiration for the 
president, her desire to protect him and her own personal views of 
right and wrong.'' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've seen this deposition (of Lewinsky), you've witnessed  
an effective effort by a loyal supporter of the president to 
provide the very minimum of truth in order to be consistent with 
her own grand jury testimony, which is legally necessary for her to 
fulfill the terms of her immunity agreement.'' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You can parse the words and you can use legal gymnastics, but  
you cannot get around the filing of the false affidavit in an 
effort to avoid appearing in the (Paula) Jones case and possibly 
providing damaging testimony against the president.'' -- Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We all want to bring this matter to a conclusion. We want to  
see the end of the story. We want to have a final chapter in this 
national drama.'' -- Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the testimony of Mr. Jordan is dramatic in that it  
shows the control and direction of the president of the United 
States in the effort to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the testimony of Mr. Jordan provides new evidence  
supporting the charges of obstruction and verifying the credibility 
of Ms. Lewinsky.'' -- Hutchinson. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I would respectfully request this body to develop the facts  
fully, to hear the testimony of Mr. Jordan, to allow him to explain 
this. It tells a story start to finish on this one aspect of 
obstruction of justice that is critical to your determination.'' -- 
Hutchinson.

<HEADLINE> Wynette Daughters Want Body Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Three of Tammy Wynette's daughters have  
written letters asking that the country singer's body be exhumed 
for an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	In letters sent to Dr. Bruce Levy, Nashville's medical examiner,  
the daughters said they want to make sure their mother died from a 
blood clot as reported by her personal doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter obtained by WTVF-TV in Nashville, Jackie Daly told  
Levy she wants ``to stress to you how important it is to my sisters 
and I to really know how our mother died. I find it hard to believe 
you can tell how my mother died by looking at her and not doing an 
autopsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar letters were sent to Levy by Wynette's daughters Tina  
Jones and Georgette Smith, whose father is country singer George 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, 55, whose many hits included ``Stand by Your Man,'' was  
found dead in her Nashville home April 6 by husband George Richey. 
</P>
<P>
	She was declared dead by her personal physician, Wallis Marsh,  
who was flown in from Pittsburgh. Without an autopsy, Marsh said 
the cause of death was a blood clot to her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy District Attorney General Tom Thurman said Wednesday his  
office is aware of the letters but has not begun an investigation.

<HEADLINE> Gary Coleman Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Former TV star Gary Coleman received a  
90-day suspended sentence Thursday after agreeing to a plea bargain 
in a case in which he was accused of hitting an autograph-seeker. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace, ending his  
trial on assault and battery charges in which he said he hit a 
large and scary woman to get away from her. 
</P>
<P>
	He hung his head and wept as his attorney discussed the plea  
with the judge. He also was ordered to attend anger-managment 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 86-pound Coleman, who played Arnold in the sitcom  
``Diff'rent Strokes,'' testified earlier Thursday that he was 
frightened by Tracy Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very small, very delicate, you know,'' said Coleman, who  
stands 4-foot-7. ``I don't break easy, but I do break. And I was 
getting real scared, so I thought it's either fight or flee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, 30, said Ms. Fields, a 205-pound bus driver, yelled at  
him after he gave her an autograph July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``She called across the room again quite loudly, `Ain't you  
gonna put nothing nice on it?''' Coleman said. ``I thought that's 
really rude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who works for a mall security force, said Ms. Fields  
swore at him and called him a punk, so he swore back. He tore up 
the autograph and that's when she allegedly became menacing, so he 
hit her. 
</P>
<P>
	``After she bristled and got a little huffy and blocked my path  
I decided, well, she looks like she wants to slap the taste out of 
my mouth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fields claims to suffer from headaches and muscle spasms  
since the incident and has filed a $1 million lawsuit against 
Coleman.

<HEADLINE> Koznick Carries U.S. Slalom Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- If Kristina Koznick was on the planning  
committee for the World Alpine Ski Championships, Vail Mountain 
would be lit up like Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, America's top woman slalom racer, has won two World Cup  
races in her career. Both have come under the lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nickname `Queen of the Night' can be taken plenty of  
different ways,'' Koznick said jokingly Thursday during a video 
teleconference atop Vail. ``I love racing at night. I grew up 
training from 7 to 9 o'clock at night. I just like it. More people 
come out to watch. It's more of a show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, 24, added to her nocturnal reputation Dec. 28 in  
Semmering, Austria, posting a come-from-behind victory to match her 
nighttime win in Are, Sweden, 11 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in Are gave Koznick momentum going into the 1998  
Olympics in Nagano, Japan, but she fell behind after a conservative 
first run and was eliminated altogether when she missed a gate on 
the icy course. 
</P>
<P>
	Expect a different approach Feb. 13 when the women race for the  
world slalom championship on Vail's International course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went into Nagano, and I was nervous and I thought, `Oh, it's  
not a big deal. It's not a big deal,' and that's a joke,'' Koznick 
said. ``It is a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants an Olympic medal. Everybody wants a world  
championship medal. I think with that motivation, I won't have a 
lagging first run. It will be a totally different race for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, currently fourth in the World Cup slalom standings,  
will get an added bonus at the championships as she competes in the 
giant slalom Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	She last skied in the event at U.S. Nationals last March and  
doesn't hold any high hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more there to just kind of get my nerves out and have a  
good time, and experience the World Champs for more than one day,'' 
she said. ``I know I'm not going to have any jaws dropping, but it 
will make me feel good to do something other than just slalom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Koznick gears up for her two events, the women's downhill  
competitors completed their second day of training Thursday on the 
1.6-mile International course. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaela Dorfmeister, who won the bronze in the super-G on  
Wednesday, had the fastest training time of 1 minute, 34.32 
seconds. Like the six other Austrian skiers, Dorfmeister broke from 
her racing tuck and stood upright about 50 meters from the finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take an easy run,'' Dorfmeister said. ``I take care.''  
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Sylvaine Berthoud finished second in 1:34.65, and  
Stefanie Schuster, who had the fastest training time Tuesday, was 
third in 1:34.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuster has only one top-10 World Cup finish in the downhill  
this season, but is an additional weapon for the Austrian women as 
they try to repeat their super-G sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not so easy (Wednesday), but I hope we do the same,''  
Dorfmeister said. ``Maybe two medals. Three will be very 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several skiers nearly wiped out on the course's final jump onto  
Pepe's Face, but there were no crashes like the one that took out 
downhill favorite Regine Cavagnoud on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frenchwoman tore a knee ligament in a crash on French Face  
and is expected to be out for several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Dierdorf Out at ABC Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL's most high-profile announcing team is  
undergoing its second major change in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Dierdorf announced Thursday that he is leaving his job as an  
analyst for ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' after 12 years at the 
network, leaving Al Michaels as the only announcer who has been in 
the booth for more than one season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, ABC Sports informed my representatives at The  
Marquee Group that no substantial offer to extend my contract would 
be forthcoming,'' Dierdorf's statement said. ``Therefore, Sunday's 
broadcast of the Pro Bowl will be my last for ABC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf's departure had been speculated for weeks, as ABC  
seemed unwilling to renew his $1.75 million a year contract. 
Dierdorf had come under heavy criticism this season as he struggled 
to mesh with newcomer Boomer Esiason in ABC's three-man booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a very talented broadcaster, who earned the respect,  
admiration and friendship of everyone with whom he worked at ABC 
Sports,'' said Brian McAndrews, executive vice president and 
general manager of ABC Sports. ``We wish him luck in his future 
endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About a replacement, ABC Sports spokesman Mark Mandel said, ``It  
would be premature to discuss our plans for next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With most of the top announcing talent locked up by other  
networks, ABC probably will have to look to cable partner ESPN for 
a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Sterling Sharpe is one of the leading contenders to  
replace Dierdorf. But Disney could also decide to move one of 
ESPN's Sunday night analysts -- Paul Maguire or Joe Theismann -- to 
the ABC and plug the less experienced Sharpe into the cable slot. 
</P>
<P>
	After last season, Esiason replaced Frank Gifford after 27 years  
in the booth. That was the first change to ABC's announcing team 
since Dierdorf joined Michaels and Gifford in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf may have trouble ending up at another network for this  
upcoming season. Fox has no apparent openings and ESPN is run by 
the same people who ousted Dierdorf at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS seems unwilling to shuffle its top announcing teams to make  
room for Dierdorf, who began his network career at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this point, CBS has not expressed an interest in Dan  
Dierdorf,'' CBS Sports spokeswoman LeslieAnne Wade said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Want Clinton Trial Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some Republican governors are worried that the public  
frustration over President Clinton's impeachment trial is having a 
negative impact on the GOP. But at least one is optimistic the tide 
will eventually turn in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think President Clinton is fatally wounded and will limp  
through the rest of his presidency,'' said Oklahoma Gov. Frank 
Keating. That outcome, Keating said, might help the GOP win the 
presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if that scenario holds true, Keating, chairman of the  
Republican Governor's Association, agrees that the GOP is bearing 
the brunt of public disgust now. He believes there should be ``a 
heads-up vote, yes or no'' immediately on whether to continue the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is set to vote today on whether to call witnesses to  
testify on the floor -- a move that could prolong President 
Clinton's trial. A vote against testimony could mean the beginning 
of the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci said he hopes the trial ends as  
soon as possible. He pointed to GOP losses in last fall's 
congressional elections as proof that many Americans believe 
Republicans are responsible for what they consider partisanship and 
foot-dragging. 
</P>
<P>
	``There appeared to be, here and in the rest of the country,  
support for Democrats and dissatisfaction with Republicans,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster has been banging that drum for  
months, saying Republicans should end the trial speedily because 
they don't have the votes to convict Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sooner this is wound up the better off the country is  
going to be, and for sure, the Republican Party,'' he said. 
``People just don't like what's happening in Washington. They don't 
like the way it's been drawn out on totally partisan lines. You 
cannot impeach a president on partisan lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP governors, including Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Cecil  
Underwood of West Virginia and Mike Johanns of Nebraska, said 
voters will judge Republicans more by what they accomplish in the 
way of programs than by the impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Washington are so wrapped up and consumed by this,  
but when you get out in the heartland, people aren't paying that 
much attention,'' said John Truscott, spokesman for Michigan Gov. 
John Engler. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns said the wrath of a disgusted public may cross party  
lines and leave people mad at politicians in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this process has hurt everybody. It's hurt Bill  
Clinton, it's certainly hurt his family. It's hurt the House of 
Representatives, it's hurt the Senate. In the eyes of the average 
citizen, it's a mess,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lott Sees Trial Ending Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans moved to bring President  
Clinton's impeachment trial to a prompt conclusion today as 
Majority Leader Trent Lott signaled a lack of support for live 
testimony and GOP lawmakers shrank from an effort to declare the 
president guilty without removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from a closed-door GOP caucus, Lott told reporters the  
Senate was ``on track'' for a final vote on the two articles of 
impeachment by Feb, 12, or perhaps a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, Democrats renewed a call for a formal censure of  
the president but only after the trial ends with his acquittal on 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott made his comments shortly before the resumption of the  
trial, and an effort by House prosecutors to summon Monica 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide 
Sidney Blumenthal for live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been trying to find an exit from a trial that  
is unpopular with the public. Democrats have increasingly referred 
to the proceedings as a ``Republican trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes, the more it becomes a partisan trial, a  
Republican trial,'' Democratic leader Tom Daschle told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Democrats were drafting a proposal to censure  
Clinton and expected to have it completed in a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not appear that the votes are there for live  
witnesses,'' despite a desire by House prosecutors to summon Ms. 
Lewinsky and the two others to testify, Lott told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Republicans also indicated today that prospects were  
dimming for a proposal that would conclude Clinton committed 
wrongdoing without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have blocked it. We don't want this to break  
into a partisan melee,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. And Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the proposal ``an effort for 
politicians to protect themselves politically. The way out is to 
vote 'guilty' or 'not guilty' and live with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the Democratic alternative would  
be written less legalistically than the articles of impeachment 
``and more in moral terms of censure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``finding of fact'' proposal pushed by some Republicans  
accuses Clinton of lying to the grand jury. They would like to vote 
on that before the actual articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott predicted that videotaped depositions of Ms. Lewinsky,  
Jordan and Blumenthal will be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	As for live testimony, a majority of 51 votes would prevent  
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anything to add by calling them in,''  
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. added, 
``Don't want it, don't need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and Kay Bailey  
Hutchison of Texas added their voices against witnesses, a position 
taken by at least three GOP senators Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the political arguments began, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,  
D-Conn., urged lawmakers and others at a prayer breakfast to help 
Clinton, who participated in the event. Lieberman asked ``at this 
time of difficulty for the president, that you hear his prayer, 
that you help him with the work he is doing with his family and his 
clergy, that you accept his atonement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans held a party meeting to search for a solution to the  
``findings of fact'' dilemma, unhappy to have the trial end with a 
straight acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to convict a  
president and remove him from office -- a margin both parties agree 
is not within reach -- but the ``finding of fact'' would only need a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want to show portions of the videotapes as  
part of further evidence presentation, but only as a fallback 
position if they can't get live witnesses. Democrats have been 
united in opposition to live testimony, and even Republicans who 
viewed the videotapes of Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan appeared 
unenthusiastic about calling them. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead House prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said there  
were ``no bombshells or anything like that'' in the depositions, 
but added the managers who questioned the three witnesses believed 
their responses would be useful to the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans considered draft language of a  
statement that would find that Clinton ``willfully provided false 
and misleading'' grand jury testimony, and impeded efforts to 
uncover evidence in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Daschle called the proposal an ``extralegal''  
device that could turn the entire proceeding into a ``Republican 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart added, ``I think it's  
understandable as people work toward trying to figure out a way to 
bring this process to an end ... but in the rush to do that ... 
they shouldn't try to trample on the Constitution in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators also sent Clinton a letter, asking him to  
submit voluntarily to a sworn deposition to answer questions in the 
case. The president already has said he would not.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Would Get Most From Gas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is haggling with  
Congress over how to spend $1.5 billion in unexpected gas tax 
money, but states may take more of an interest in the dispute now 
that they know how much they have to gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation  
Committee, published a list Thursday showing how the states would 
split the pot when the federal government starts its next fiscal 
year on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	California would get the most, gaining an extra $121 million in  
highway funds. Texas, with $99 million extra, and Illinois, with 
$45 million, would follow. The District of Columbia, known for its 
potholes as much as its monuments, would rank last, with an 
additional $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster opposes a provision in the proposed $45.5 billion  
Transportation Department budget that would divert about half the 
money to transportation programs other than highways. 
</P>
<P>
	American drivers have generated the funds by buying cheap gas  
and fuel-guzzling sports-utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said that under the terms of last year's $203 billion  
national highway bill, any extra money generated by the gas tax 
should go back to the states. His breakdown shows the states' 
revised shares based on the distribution formula created in the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am concerned by the president's attempt to rewrite the law  
and redistribute these funds,'' Shuster said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., chairman of the Senate Environment and  
Public Works Committee, in a letter to Transportation Secretary 
Rodney Slater, said, ``The president's budget proposal would upset 
the delicate balance finally achieved in those (highway) 
negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the proposal on Monday, Slater conceded the  
administration was reworking the highway bill funding formula. He 
said diversions were justified because states still were going to 
get more highway money, and the rest would go to ``programs that we 
think are strategic and keeping with the overall needs identified 
by the administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They include $730 million for road, bridge and clean-air  
programs, $291 million for mass transit, $250 million for research 
and $125 million for automotive safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also wants to spend $35 million for rail  
improvements and $25 million for a transportation historic 
preservation project. 
</P>
<P>
	States already are scheduled to receive significant road and  
bridge money under the highway bill. Already $25 billion worth of 
highway projects are in the pipeline, and even without the extra 
gas money, California would get close to $2.5 billion in road funds 
on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois' take would be $905 million, while the District of  
Columbia would get $106 million even without any of the extra gas 
tax money. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster's spokesman, Scott Brenner, said, ``We'll listen to  
their proposals, but we have no plans to reopen the legislation 
right now. The bill's not even a year old.''

<HEADLINE> Drifter To Face Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Prosecutors said Thursday they will seek  
the death penalty for a drifter who admitted killing a 9-year-old 
in a public restroom while the boy's aunt waited outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Wilson, 21, confessed to slashing young Matthew Cecchi's  
throat in November at Oceanside Harbor north of San Diego but 
pleaded innocent by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	His murder trial is scheduled for Aug. 23.  
</P>
<P>
	At a preliminary hearing last month, Superior Court Judge John  
Einhorn read from a confession Wilson made to police after he was 
captured in Hollywood for stabbing a woman and trying to steal her 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said he had a chance to kill two women before he saw  
Matthew. When he overheard the boy tell his aunt that he needed to 
go to the restroom, Wilson said he knew he had an opportunity to 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed the boy into the restroom. When the boy looked away  
and faced the urinal, Wilson said he took a hunting knife from his 
belt, pulled back the boy's head and slashed his throat.

<P>
	Richard Douglas Llamas, 48, a District of Columbia resident, was  
immediately escorted from the gallery, said Capitol police Lt. Dan 
Nichols. Llamas was taken to Capitol police headquarters and was

<HEADLINE> Welch Defends Actions in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tom Welch, the man at the center of Salt  
Lake City's Olympic storm, apologized and expressed his sorrow for 
the controversy -- and tried to spread the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am saddened and dismayed that so many feel the need to  
isolate responsibility for what -- at the time -- were cooperative 
decisions,'' Welch said Wednesday in a ``Dear Friends'' fax to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had our agreed course of action been questioned at the time by  
those to whom we reported, no doubt we would have been pleaded to 
pursue other avenues,'' he said. ``It is ironic that those who were 
so supportive of our efforts to secure the games now feel the need 
to distance themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His statement, in which he said he was ``very sorry for the  
discomfort and misunderstanding created by this current 
controversy,'' did not name names. However, he and his attorney 
have been doing so in interviews this week, claiming Gov. Mike 
Leavitt, departing Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Frank 
Joklik, Salt Lake Mayor Deedee Corradini, Atlanta Mayor Andrew 
Young and bid committee board members were in the know. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt, Joklik, Corradini and Young have denied knowing about  
the hundreds of thousands of dollars in scholarships, cash payments 
and expensive gifts that went to International Olympic Committee 
members during Salt Lake's bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The expenditures are being investigated by the Justice  
Department, by ethics panels of SLOC and the U.S. Olympic Committee 
and by Utah Attorney General Jan Graham, who also was on the bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, SLOC said its ethics panel's report will be  
released at a board of trustees meeting next Tuesday or Thursday. 
Leavitt and SLOC chairman Robert Garff scheduled a news conference 
this afternoon to discuss reorganization of the SLOC board of 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, who was chairman of the bid committee, has resigned but  
remains on the job until he is replaced. Welch, who had been 
president of SLOC but resigned after being charged with spousal 
abuse in 1997, was stripped Jan. 8 of his pension and 
$10,000-per-month consulting contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Welch confirmed that the bid committee took $50,000 in cash to  
Budapest in June 1995, when the IOC chose Salt Lake, but said it 
was for paying the expenses of hundreds in the Salt Lake 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	He also confirmed an earlier Associated Press report that the  
son of IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo said 
he could influence four or five IOC votes for $30,000 to $35,000 on 
the eve of the 1995 vote in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	--Opponents of the games said they won't wait for the end of the  
legislative session before launching a petition drive aimed at 
putting the 2002 Winter Games on the 2000 general election ballot. 
The petition is phrased to say that Utah would not guarantee or 
reimburse the debt or obligations of any organization playing host 
to the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. John Dingell of Michigan is asking the General Accounting  
Office to investigate whether Salt Lake is being rewarded with $150 
million in federal funds for roads, airport and mass transit 
improvements to help it stage Olympics it secured by shady means. 
</P>
<P>
	--USA Today said the son of IOC member Kim Un-yong of South Korea  
was employed by a Utah company, Keystone Communications, at the 
request of the bid committee. It had previously been reported that 
First Security Bank of Utah employed two IOC relatives and Keystone 
one, but the identity of the Keystone employee had not been 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the arrangement was confirmed Wednesday by  
David Simmons, former chief executive of the satellite TV broadcast 
provider. Simmons said he Jung Hoon, known to him as John Kim, 
during the early 1990s and that the man worked at the company's New 
York office. He said the bid committee reimbursed Keystone for a 
portion of the salary, but he declined to say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	--The world doping summit ended today with more bad news for  
scandal-battered Olympic leaders: They failed to win approval of 
strict anti-drug penalties or get the spotlight off their bribery 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	A watered-down six-point resolution adopted at the end of the  
three-day session called by the IOC laid the groundwork for an 
anti-drug agency and mandatory two-year bans from competition for 
athletes using banned performance-enhancers. But IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch's hopes of heading the new office were dashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``These issues are bigger than the IOC,'' British Sports  
Minister Tony Banks said. ``It might come as a surprise to the IOC 
to find there is actually something bigger than the IOC, but there 
actually is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--A gold-medal swimmer from Canada said he was quitting a string  
of Olympics-related positions because of IOC responses to the Salt 
Lake scandal. Mark Tewksbury, who won the 100-meter breaststroke in 
1992, said he had ``lost confidence in the leadership'' of the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	--Officials in the Japanese city of Sapporo faced allegations  
they made payoffs in a failed bid for the Winter Games more than 30 
years ago. Japan's largest newspaper, Yomiuri, reported that 
Sapporo's bid committee gave $2,800 each to four IOC members in 
1964, apparently to win their votes. After bidding unsuccessfully 
for the 1968 Games, Sapporo was chosen as the site for the 1972 
Winter Games.

	U.S. Troops May Go To Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is seriously  
considering sending U.S. troops to enforce the peace if a 
settlement is reached in war-scarred Kosovo. ``The Balkans are an 
explosive area. They touch other difficult areas, and unless we can 
contain and ultimately defuse the ethnic hatreds in that region 
they can embroil us ... in a much larger conflict,'' Clinton said. 

</P>
<P>
	Serbs To Attend Kosovo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Serbian parliament voted today  
to send a delegation to the peace conference in Kosovo after 
blasting NATO and the West for threatening force if they stayed 
away. The West is ``knocking on an open door,'' Serbian Premier 
Mirko Marjanovic told parliament. ``We stay open for a peaceful 
solution'' of the Kosovo crisis. The vote was 227-3 with three 
abstentions. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Urges Prayers for Peace  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton addressed a prayer breakfast  
with members of Congress and other prominent figures, urging 
leaders to put aside grievances and seek genuine reconciliation. 
The president made no mention of his impeachment trial in the 
Senate on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. Clinton 
was also planning a brief review with Yasser Arafat following the 
47th annual National Prayer breakfast. 

</P>
<P>
	Italy Votes Down Sperm Donations  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy's lower house has voted to ban the use of  
donated sperm. The move overturns a key provision of a proposed 
government bill on fertility treatments. Italy has no law 
regulating assisted fertility. Some women in their late 50s or even 
well into their 60s have come here for post-menopausal attempts at 
pregnancy. The proposed law outlaws fertility treatment for women 
over the age of 52, as well as the sale of sperm and eggs.

	King Hussein To Head Home  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jordan's King Hussein, who is undergoing  
treatment for cancer at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is 
expected to return home very soon, The Associated Press was told 
today. The source, a Western diplomat who asked not to be further 
identified, had no comment on the king's condition. On Tuesday, the 
monarch was reported in stable condition after a bone marrow 
transplant. 

</P>

	Clintons Decry Story on Chelsea  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife say they are  
``profoundly saddened'' by People magazine's decision to do a cover 
story on daughter Chelsea. The Clintons said People chose to run 
the story ``despite personal appeals with respect to her privacy 
and her security from her parents.'' The magazine hits the street 
tomorrow with a cover photo of Chelsea with her mother and the 
headline: ``Hillary &AMP; Chelsea -- Grace Under Fire.''

	Lawyers Argue for Pinochet Trial  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Spain's claim that more than 50 Spaniards were  
victims of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet's regime 
makes it the appropriate country to try him, lawyers argued today 
in Britain's highest court. After 11 days of complex legal 
arguments, lawyers for the Spanish government made a final push to 
persuade the House of Lords to uphold the 83-year-old general's 
arrest on charges of grave human rights abuses. 

</P>
<P>
	Rushdie Said Given a Visa  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- India, the first country to ban the book ``The  
Satanic Verses,'' has granted a visa to its author, Salman Rushdie, 
for the first time since the 1980s, the BBC reported. Rushdie's 
lawyer collected the visa from the Indian High Commission in 
London, British Broadcasting Corp. radio said. India, Rushdie's 
birthplace, banned ``The Satanic Verses'' after it provoked angry 
protests from Muslims in 1988, and in 1996 Rushdie's book ``The 
Moor's Last Sigh'' was withdrawn from bookshelves within weeks of 
its release.

<HEADLINE> How Declaration of Wrongdoing Died </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a private meeting of Senate Republicans,  
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici stood up Thursday and told 
his colleagues that a declaration accusing President Clinton of 
wrongdoing without ousting him from office would not be offered at 
the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody objected, and an idea pushed by GOP lawmakers for days  
was suddenly dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was described by several people who attended the  
closed-door meeting at the Capitol. It ended a 24-hour drama over 
whether the ``finding of fact'' alternative for punishing Clinton 
would emerge as a possible endgame solution for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici and other GOP senators actually knew 18 hours earlier  
that the proposal was doomed, according to congressional officials 
familiar with the private deliberations, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	At a private meeting Wednesday, Assistant Majority Leader Don  
Nickles told GOP senators that more than a dozen Republicans would 
vote against the plan unless five to 10 Democrats signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional four Republicans -- Phil Gramm of Texas, Judd Gregg  
of New Hampshire, Bob Smith of Oregon and Richard Shelby of Alabama 
-- opposed the plan outright, the sources said. Several believed 
that giving Republicans such political cover would embolden more of 
them to vote against the articles of impeachment than they would 
without the alternative, handing Clinton an even bigger victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., revealed Thursday he  
also secretly opposed the idea of voting on a declaration accusing 
Clinton of wrongdoing before voting on the articles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have felt all along that really what we ought to do is do  
what the Constitution and the rules provide: go through the 
impeachment trial, get to the articles of impeachment vote and vote 
on those, and then move on,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the plan died, Republicans had decided to pursue language  
for a declaration they believed was likely to draw support from 
Democrats. One, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, had already 
expressed support for the concept. ``William Jefferson Clinton 
wrongfully engaged in conduct to delay the discovery and to cover 
up the existence of evidence and to alter testimony,'' a draft 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lieberman was asked by reporters Wednesday whether he knew  
of any other Democrats who were open to the idea, and the senator 
shook his head. It sent an ominous message to the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the GOP caucus met again at 10:30 a.m. Thursday, the  
plan was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans felt the party couldn't afford another partisan  
vote where it wasn't necessary, officials said. They left the 
meeting proclaiming that the Democrats, spurred by the White House, 
had killed ``findings of fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have blocked it,'' said Sen. Larry Craig of  
Idaho, one of the few GOP leaders who had been open to the 
``findings'' idea. ``We don't want this to break into a partisan 
melee.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today following  
comments by a U.S. Treasury official urging Japan to exert monetary 
policy to ease upward pressure on interest rates. Japanese stocks 
fell for the fourth consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 74.46 points,  
or 0.53 percent, closing at 14,086.85. The average has now fallen a 
total of 412.40 points in four days, including Wednesday's 
188.52-point fall of 1.31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 113.78 yen, up 1.40 yen  
from late in Tokyo on Wednesday and also above its late New York 
level of 112.87 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged during the day from 112.85 yen to 113.98 yen.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency moved higher on dollar-buying by U.S. funds  
after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said overnight that the 
U.S. government's strong-dollar policy has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the American currency were comments by a senior  
Japanese monetary official who voiced caution concerning the yen's 
recent appreciation against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yen had strengthened a bit too quickly recently,''  
Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the Finance Ministry's International 
Bureau, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kuroda added he did not believe the yen would rise further.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.52 yen, up from  
127.32 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also said Wednesday that Japanese officials should focus  
on monetary policy to stem a rise in interest rates. Traders said 
that encouraged hopes that the steady fall in Japanese bond prices 
seen since late last year may be nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on Japanese government bonds have surged recently on  
nervousness over the government's plans to finance its economic 
stimulus measures by boosting the bond supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 2.170 percent from Wednesday's finish of 2.335 
percent, its highest level since July 1997. Its price rose to 97.12 
yen from 95.88 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks started moderately higher following  
an overnight rise on Wall Street. But prices fell later amid 
renewed concern over Japanese corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 6.38 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,090.77. 
The TOPIX closed down 16.58 points, or 1.49 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was about 337 million  
shares, up from Wednesday's 303 million shares. Declines 
outnumbered advances 640 to 480, with 165 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also reacted negatively to Wednesday's comments by  
Ichiro Ozawa, who heads the Liberal Party, a coalition government 
partner with the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa opposes a proposed scheme that would set up a body to  
absorb shares sold as companies unwind their cross-shareholdings. 
Groups of Japanese companies have long held shares among each 
other, but many are now trying to sell such shares.

<HEADLINE> TB Outbreak in California Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Tuberculosis can spread rapidly among  
HIV-infected inmates and be transmitted to their visitors and 
prison employees and result in secondary transmissions, health 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in the Centers for Disease Control  
and Prevention's weekly report based on TB outbreaks in two 
California prisons in which 32 people were infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberculosis is a highly infectious lung disease transmitted by  
airborne bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those sickened, nine were former inmates on parole and  
another was the HIV-positive wife of one of the inmates who was 
infected after visiting her husband. In addition, 12 prison 
employees had positive TB skin tests but did not come down with the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fastest and largest documented spread of the disease  
in the prison system's history, said corrections spokeswoman Terry 
Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the outbreak, California has placed HIV-infected inmates  
in respiratory isolation and started them on multidurg therapy for 
TB even when another pulmonary process is diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 million to 3 million people worldwide die from TB every  
year, including 100,000 children, according to the World Health 
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Journalism Class Cracks Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A convicted double-murderer who spent the last 16  
years on death row -- recently coming within two days of execution -- 
may go free now that another man has allegedly confessed to the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter cried, ``Thank you, God,'' upon hearing Wednesday  
that a private investigator and group of journalism students 
announced they had videotaped the confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was two days away from lethal injection in September  
when he won a stay from the Illinois Supreme Court on an appeal 
that claimed his IQ of 51 was too low for him to be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer is hoping Porter will be released within days. The  
state's attorney's office said it is investigating the alleged 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a heavy load lifted up and something just came off  
my whole body,'' Porter said at a news conference Thursday. 
``Seventeen years has been a long time for me and my family. ... I 
never gave up hope about getting out. I prayed to my God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was convicted of shooting to death an 18-year-old man and  
a 19-year-old woman on Chicago's South Side in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	But Northwestern University journalism professor David Protess  
was not convinced. Protess, defense lawyers, an investigator and 
some of Protess' journalism students hit the streets in search of 
witnesses who might be able to exonerate Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, they talked to William Taylor, who at the trial  
identified Porter as the killer. While talking with the group, 
Taylor allegedly recanted his testimony, saying police pressured 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last month, a nephew of a woman formerly married to Alstory  
Simon said Simon once said he had ``taken care of'' the 18-year-old 
victim over a drug debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, students in Northwestern's investigative  
reporting class went to Milwaukee and tracked down the ex-wife, 
Inez Jackson. After questioning, she identified her former husband 
as the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really an amazing thing to watch,'' said student Cara  
Rubinsky, 21, of Pittsburgh. ``It was a good lesson in how to get 
people to talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, private investigator Paul Ciolino confronted Simon  
with a videotape of his former wife's statement and her signed 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon at first denied the killing, then broke down while  
watching the videotape in which his ex-wife said she couldn't keep 
the crime secret anymore. He allegedly said he fired at the two in 
self defense when he thought the male victim was reaching for a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have close to busted off about six rounds,'' Simon said  
on a videotape made by Ciolino. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Simon's attorney were unsuccessful.  
</P>
<P>
	``My students certainly feel that they've contributed to saving  
a life,'' Protess said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is not the first in which the professor and his  
students have saved a life. In June 1996, four men who had spent 18 
years behind bars for murder were released after Northwestern 
students working with Ciolino discovered new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Protess' students are busy working on other cases.  
</P>
<P>
	``The best way of learning is by doing, and what better training  
can you do than to search out the facts from the slums of Milwaukee 
to death row and ultimately to the police and prosecutors, too,'' 
Protess said. 
</P>
<P>
	It makes his class a hit with students.  
</P>
<P>
	Syandene Rhodes-Pitt, 21, of Houston went to an Illinois state  
prison to question a witness in the Porter case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very exciting,'' she said. ``I'd never been to prison  
before ... getting frisked, it was all very serious and a little 
bit scary.''

<HEADLINE> Fehr Enlisted To Stop Cuba Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress met with the chief of the  
major league baseball players' union Thursday to seek his help in 
blocking a pair of planned exhibition games between the Baltimore 
Orioles and a Cuban all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers are among several who object to the games as  
``insensitive to the lack of human rights in Cuba,'' said Ivette 
Mendez, spokeswoman for Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd be playing and giving the world the view, 'Hey,  
everything is okay in Cuba,'' Menendez said afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended the 45-minute meeting with Reps. Dan Burton, R-Ind.;  
Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.; Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.; and Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla. Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen are Congress' 
only two Cuban-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The group met with Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major  
League Baseball Players Association. A person answering the 
telephone in Fehr's office Thursday night said Fehr was not there. 
</P>
<P>
	The games were planned after the Clinton administration decided  
in January to ease the four-decade-old U.S. trade embargo against 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, negotiations on setting up the games have run into  
roadblocks. The Clinton administration wants any proceeds from the 
games used to help the Cuban people. Cuban officials say any 
profits should go to Cuban doctors doing hurricane relief work in 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	The original idea was for the Orioles to play in Havana in late  
March, with the Cuban team playing afterwards in Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Posthumous CD From INXS Singer Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A posthumous solo album by Michael  
Hutchence will be released by midyear. 
</P>
<P>
	V2 Records' Australian general manager, Greg Johnson, said the  
company had secured a ``worldwide deal'' to release material that 
Hutchence had been working on before his death. Hutchence, the 
singer with INXS, hanged himself in a Sydney hotel room in November 
1997 at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Thursday said that the company struck a deal with  
Hutchence's estate, and Hutchence's father Kel welcomed the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be fulfilling Michael's greatest wish,'' Kel Hutchence  
said. ``He's been working on this album for probably three to four 
years and I heard a little bit of it and I think it will be a 
wonderful thing in the memory of Michael.''

<HEADLINE>  Neuheisel's Coaches Violated Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel vowed to make things happen for  
the Washington Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the new coach finds himself in trouble with the Pac-10 and  
perhaps the NCAA less than a month after leaving Colorado to come 
to Seattle for $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Neuheisel acknowledged that five Washington  
assistant coaches were in four prospects' homes last Sunday during 
a cooling-off period for recruits. That was a violation of NCAA 
recruiting rules because the Sunday before letter-of-intent day is 
considered a quiet period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies turned themselves in to the Pac-10 on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was illegal to be off campus,'' Neuheisel said. ``I'm  
embarrassed by it. Unfortunately, this was an error. I take full 
responsibility for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, both a UW official and new Colorado  
coach Gary Barnett contended Neuheisel violated another NCAA rule 
when he telephoned some of his former Colorado players. Barnett 
calls that tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know coach Neuheisel has called some of them in their homes  
and has tampered a little bit,'' Barnett told the Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, categorically false,'' Neuheisel responded. ``What  
I did was say good-bye to some of my former athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called them, wished them well, told them to stick together  
and I enjoyed my time with them. It was something I'd hoped to do 
to every one of the kids at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never, ever did I ever mention anything with respect to  
transferring or the University of Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had attempted to call Barnett on Tuesday, but Barnett  
did not return his call. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado wrote a letter of protest to the Huskies last Thursday  
and sent copies of it to the NCAA, the Pac-10 and the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	UW compliance director Ralph Bayard said Neuheisel needed  
Colorado's permission to talk to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayard said Colorado accused Neuheisel of trying to get  
Buffaloes players to transfer to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Huskies athletic director Barbara Hedges, who hired Neuheisel on  
Jan. 9, ``was upset, obviously,'' Bayard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bayard: ``They'll (the NCAA) probably contact the athletes  
at Colorado to find out exactly what was said. But it would be kind 
of ridiculous to get on the phone and to actually talk about coming 
to this institution knowing full well that if you're talking to 
somebody there's another party who knows what you said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said he had not been aware that the Sunday visits were  
a rules violation. When a high school coach mentioned the problem 
Monday, Neuheisel said he talked to Hedges and Bayard, then called 
the Pac-10 headquarters to report the violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the rule against the Sunday visits has been on the  
books since 1995, Neuheisel said he wasn't aware of it and it 
didn't come up before because he'd always finished his recruiting 
visits earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, we arrived late,'' Neuheisel said. ``Normally,  
our recruiting efforts are way done by this time and there isn't 
any need to be in anybody's home on that Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said the Huskies visited kicker John Anderson, of  
Boyton Beach, Fla.; cornerback Chris Massey, of Moreno Valley, 
Calif.; cornerback Domynic Shaw, of Oakland, Calif., and safety 
Clayton Hawthorne, of Victoria, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel expects a light slap on the wrist for the violation.  
The four players in question were immediately declared ineligible 
by UW officials, but the Huskies expect to get their eligibility 
back in the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no official sanction other than maybe a letter  
of reprimand (from the Pac-10) for myself,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Different Bulls Team To Face Jazz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- There is a certain spot on the Delta  
Center floor where Michael Jordan hit the final, 
championship-winning shot of his incomparable career. 
</P>
<P>
	The next member of the Chicago Bulls to shoot on that hallowed  
ground could be Rusty LaRue. 
</P>
<P>
	The wretched remains of the six-time world champions will return  
Friday to the scene of their club's last triumph, a Game 6 NBA 
Finals win over the Utah Jazz that capped Jordan's career and 
signaled the end of Chicago's basketball reign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a delicious bit of payback, the Jazz, who saw their  
championship dreams twice crushed by Jordan and his teammates, have 
the opportunity to throw the first punch in what will probably be a 
season of beatings for the depleted Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie coach Tim Floyd has the dubious honor of beginning his  
rebuilding project in one of the NBA's most hostile environments. 
</P>
<P>
	A ripple of excitement spread through Salt Lake City two weeks  
ago when the NBA released its shortened schedule and a rematch 
between the conference champions was right at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd and the Bulls realize that, Jordan or no Jordan, Jazz fans  
will always have it in for anybody wearing Chicago's red and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to boo us as soon as we get off the airplane,''  
said Ron Harper, the only remaining starter from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to know this is a different team, and I'll pass this  
word,'' Floyd said with a laugh. ``I think regardless of who is 
coming in, the Bulls or any other team, Utah is going to be sending 
a statement early and quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While their fans may think otherwise, the Jazz players aren't  
attaching any special meaning to the meeting. For them, running 
with the Bulls is just the first lap in a race they hope will end 
in the champions' circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of 50 games we've got to play well in to make a  
run at the playoffs,'' Karl Malone said. ``Michael, Scottie 
(Pippen) and Dennis (Rodman) were the Bulls. It's not like that any 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Chicago bears only faint resemblance to the Bulls of eight  
months ago, the biggest change the Jazz made was allowing utility 
big man Antoine Carr to sign with the Rockets. He has been replaced 
by Thurl Bailey, who has been out of the league since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in basketball and in other sports like to build it  
up and tear it down, but that's not what we're trying to do,'' 
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We've got a bunch of quality players 
together, and they've played together for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, who manned the bench at Iowa State last year and has  
never played or coached professionally, is up against Sloan, a 
former Bulls playing great who begins his 11th season in Utah, by 
far the longest tenure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's in a tough situation,'' Sloan said of Floyd. ``I'm  
sure he'll make the best of it, but it would be a really tough 
thing to do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls franchise is making a definite effort toward a fresh  
start. The seven remaining players and three assistant coaches from 
last year's team quietly received their championship rings 
Wednesday at the Bulls' practice facility, rather than during a 
public ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, Brent Barry and Toni Kukoc are definite starters for the  
Bulls on Friday. Beyond that, it gets murky: Floyd will likely 
start journeymen Andrew Lang or veteran Bill Wennington at center 
and Mario Bennett or Dickey Simpkins at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost both of its preseason games to the Indiana Pacers,  
but also showed more life than some expected. In particular, Kukoc 
scored 32 points in the Bulls' 89-83 loss in their final 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not the same team, but they're still the Bulls,'' Jeff  
Hornacek said. ``We respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Pitt's Cummings Out With Back Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh's basketball team, already rocked  
this season by a player arrest and coach Ralph Willard's 
resignation, will be without leading scorer Vonteego Cummings for 
at least one game and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings has a stress-related back injury that will sideline him  
for Saturday's game against No. 9 St. John's and, likely, Monday's 
game at Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers (11-10, 2-8 Big East) hope the 6-foot-5 Cummings  
can return for their Feb. 11 game at Rutgers, but it depends how he 
responds to rest and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard said Cummings has played in pain for several weeks and  
was hurting so badly following Tuesday's 76-58 loss at Georgetown 
that the senior guard was ``crying in the locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been bothering him for a while,'' Willard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Willard, who resigned Monday after failing to take Pitt to the  
NCAA tournament in his four-plus seasons as coach, initially 
suspected Cummings had a stress fracture in his back. Such an 
injury could have sidelined Cummings indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	But a CAT scan performed Wednesday by Dr. Craig Bennett of  
Pitt's medical staff determined that Cummings has a stress reaction 
in his back, an injury not as serious as a fracture. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings scored eight of his 10 points in the first half of the  
Georgetown game, but was noticeably bothered by his injury in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered by NBA scouts to be a likely first-round draft  
choice, Cummings has clearly been off his game in recent weeks, a 
slump that has coincided with Pitt's string of 10 losses in its 
last 15 games. The Panthers started 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the reason we're losing these games is me,'' Cummings  
said after the Georgetown game. ``Something is wrong with my back. 
I don't know what it is. I'm good for the first half but in the 
second half I'm no good. I have to help my team more. If I can't, I 
shouldn't play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings' scoring average has fallen to 16.6 overall and 13.8 in  
the Big East, and he is shooting 42.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings has played up to his early-season form only once in  
recent weeks, a 31-point performance in an 86-65 loss at Villanova 
on Jan. 19. Hours before that game, Pitt freshman guard Fred Primus 
was arrested on theft charges for stealing $2,200 worth of jewelry 
and was thrown off the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days later, guard Kellii Taylor rejoined the Panthers after  
missing six games for alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard resigned Monday, two days after a 60-54 upset of  
then-No. 23 Miami, after athletic director Steve Pederson could not 
assure him of returning next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson has already begun looking for a successor, with former  
St. John's coach Fran Fraschilla among those mentioned as being 
interested. He was fired last spring and is scouting this season 
for the New York Knicks.

<HEADLINE> Treasury To Hold Refunding Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department plans to sell $35  
billion in five-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds at its 
quarterly refunding auctions next week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's down from $38 billion sold during the last quarterly  
refunding auction in November. The figure hasn't been lower in 
eight years. That's in line with the government's growing annual 
surplus. It recorded a $69.2 billion surplus in fiscal 1998, the 
first in 29 years, and this week projected a $79.3 billion surplus 
for fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said Wednesday that it will sell $15 billion in  
five-year notes on Feb. 9, $15 billion in 10-year notes on Feb. 10 
and $10 billion in 30-year bonds on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the sales will be used to redeem $27 billion of  
maturing publicly held securities and to raise $8 billion in new 
cash.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Seeks Mining Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Forest Service wants a two-year ban on new  
hard-rock mining claims on 429,000 acres of national forest land on 
the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Forest Service has a long and storied history of working  
to protect the incredible fish, wildlife, cultural and scenic 
resources of this area,'' Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck said in 
announcing the move Wednesday in his second annual ``State of the 
Forests'' speech at the University of Montana in Missoula. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to continue that tradition,'' Dombeck said in  
disclosing his request to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, whose 
agency oversees mining operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service also will cut back on roaduilding, rely less  
on logging revenues to fund agency operations and launch a new 
effort to protect and restore watersheds on forest land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montana land being withdrawn from new mining claims includes  
400,000 acres in the Lewis and Clark National Forest and 29,000 
acres in the Helena National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of the Rocky Mountain Front goes well beyond that of  
any oil or minerals we could extract from it,'' said Sen. Max 
Baucus, D-Mont., who had asked the Forest Service to consider 
placing the area off limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Front is known for its wildlife, including elk, bighorn  
sheep and grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a two-year period of public comment before the  
agency decides whether to bar new mining claims there for up to 20 
years. The Forest Service announced in 1997 that oil and gas 
drilling would be banned in the area for 10 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	There were roughly 104 mining claims on the land in 1996, but  
nearly all have been inactive, said Forest Service spokesman Chris 
Wood. The old claims could still be exercised if they are proven 
valid, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dombeck also pledged to protect other forest-wilderness areas.  
</P>
<P>
	In future, the agency ``will rarely build new roads into  
roadless areas, and if we do, it will be in order to accomplish 
broader ecological objectives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service has been considering a plan that would halt  
road building in 35 million acres of roadless land for up to 18 
months while the agency drafts a new road policy. 
</P>
<P>
	While pledging to move ahead with that effort, Dombeck said he  
wants to act aggressively to get rid of roads that are not needed 
or maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service is only able to maintain about 18 percent of  
its roads to a desired standard. With Congress' help, Dombeck said 
he wants to increase the amount of adequately maintained roads to 
24 percent by next year, and increase the miles of road the Forest 
Service scraps or repairs by 50 percent over 1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	As for agency funding, Dombeck acknowledged the Forest Service  
relies too much on logging receipts to cover overhead costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that timber production on national forests has declined  
by 70 percent in less than a decade, such an approach is 
unsustainable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service will seek legislation and make changes  
internally to reduce reliance on those revenues, which are not 
subject to congressional authorization or open to public scrutiny, 
Dombeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The forest chief also said he would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Make watershed improvement a priority in all future forest  
plans. Budget requests and employee evaluations will be linked to 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	--Add 74 million acres of state and private forest land by next  
year to the 442 million public and private acres the Forest Service 
already evaluates for forest health. 
</P>
<P>
	--Create a wilderness advisory group and use forest-management  
plans to better manage and identify undeveloped areas in national 
forests.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Climate Watcher Inadequate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government advisory panel says it has  
concerns about the accuracy of data being used to fuel the intense 
debate over possible climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deficiencies in the accuracy, quality and continuity of the  
records ... place serious limitations on the confidence that can be 
placed in the research results,'' the National Research Council 
said in a study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Climate change has become a hot topic with the growing concern  
that rising levels of certain chemicals in the atmosphere could 
trap additional heat from the sun, causing the Earth's temperature 
to rise. Scientists and politicians on both sides of the issue 
regularly trade jabs, citing various studies of temperature 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear we do not have a climate observing system ...  
This may be a shock to many people who assume that we do know 
adequately what's going on with the climate, but we don't,'' said 
Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder, Colo., who independently reviewed the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a weather observing system primarily now and the big  
swings in weather from day to day are easy to catch ... but for 
climate we are interested in more subtle changes from year to year, 
especially trends,'' Trenberth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Blackmon, a member of the committee that prepared the  
new study, noted that a few years ago the government began 
installing new weather recording systems at airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers soon began noticing what seemed like a climate  
change but turned out to be merely the instrument change, said 
Blackmon, also of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
</P>
<P>
	When instruments are changed without an overlap to compare their  
readings, differences in the devices may result in confusion, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was illustrated just last month when scientists at  
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and others at the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that last 
year was the hottest on record -- but came up with different 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Data provided by NASA researchers indicated an average 1998  
worldwide temperature of 58.5 degrees Fahrenheit, while NOAA 
estimated it at 58.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike sciences where strict laboratory controls are the rule,  
climate researchers have to rely on observations collected in 
different countries and using differing instruments, Thomas R. 
Karl, chairman of the committee that prepared the report, noted in 
his forward. Karl heads the National Climatic Data Center in 
Asheville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Adequate weather and climate records go back only a bit over a  
century in the United States and not much longer in other 
countries. During that period, instruments for measuring such 
things as temperature, humidity and wind have changed constantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems even occur with the most modern observing machines,  
noted Trenberth. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Research Council faulted the federal government for  
not coordinating climate studies and failing to have one agency 
organize the data and make sure information is consistent. The 
National Research Council is the research arm of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

<HEADLINE> January Retail Sales Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Big discounts in the weeks following Christmas  
drove many Americans to shop in January, pushing up sales at the 
nation's biggest retailers to better-than-expected levels. 
</P>
<P>
	From discounters to department stores, most fared well in  
January, which is typically considered a time that merchants drop 
prices to clear out their winter inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting a message from the American public: They will  
spend as long as the price is right,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail 
consultant and president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper 
Montclair, N.J. ``In January, they got what they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The healthy results pleased merchants who had anticipated that  
consumers would scale back their spending in 1999 amid expectations 
that global financial turmoil would slow down U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers continue to benefit from low unemployment and  
inflation, which also have helped to raise consumer confidence. 
Separately today, the Labor Department reported the number of 
Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits 
fell by 9,000 to 292,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underlying strength in the economy is still there and  
consumers are still spending,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, managing 
director at Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	January's figures followed a mixed Christmas for retailers, who  
faced a slow start to the season but managed to achieve respectable 
sales by slashing prices right before and after the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Discounters were the big winners. Shoppers continue to flock to  
stores like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart for their affordable prices 
and wide selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty stores also showed healthy sales gains, especially  
those specializing in home furnishings, electronics and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	After a tough holiday season, department stores generally  
bounced back in January, enticing shoppers with steep discounts. 
They also benefited from seasonal winter weather, which bolstered 
sales of sweaters and coats. 
</P>
<P>
	There were exceptions, notably J.C. Penney, which continued to  
struggle at its department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For most retailers, the fiscal year ended in January, and  
analysts expect strong fourth-quarter and year-end earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 6.4 percent in January. It rose 3.4 percent in December and was 
up 5.1 percent in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 10.3 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 17.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 2.6 percent, total sales down 3.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 8.5 percent, total sales up 9.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.1  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 13 percent, total 
sales rose 6.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 9.6 percent, total sales up  
15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 7.3 percent, total sales up 7  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 5.3 percent, total  
sales up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 11 percent, total sales fell 5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 15 percent, total sales up 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Elway Sees Pro Bowl As Another Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- John Elway may strap on his Denver Broncos  
helmet for the final time this weekend, but even if he does retire, 
he won't look back on the Pro Bowl as his final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I haven't looked that far ahead. Anyway, if it  
is the last one, the one I'll still remember (as his football 
finale) was last week,'' said Elway, MVP of the Broncos' 34-19 
Super Bowl victory over Atlanta on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, a nine-time all-star, said his four kids convinced him to  
come to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl this time because ``They love it 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He missed last year's game because of an injury and expects to  
be in for only one or two series in Sunday's AFC-NFC matchup, 
saying, ``I'll just play it by ear and try to do something good out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He smiled and added, ``Anyway, (Doug) Flutie's a lot younger  
than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is 38 and Flutie, a Pro Bowl rookie, is 36. The other AFC  
quarterback is 35-year-old Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie suddenly appeared at Elway's locker in Aloha Stadium,  
grinning and demanding to know why Elway got No. 7 for his red AFC 
jersey, since that's Flutie's number with Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won the coin toss,'' Elway shot back. ``You flipped a coin  
and you lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway missed four starts this season because of injuries, but  
said he feels fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in pretty good shape right now,'' he said. ``The heat has  
been a big part of it; Miami, now here. It's good on the old 
joints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway planned to make this season his last, but he just might be  
lured back again by the prospect of winning an unprecedented three 
consecutive Super Bowls. He said after the win against Atlanta that 
he expected to announce a final decision in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver teammate Terrell Davis, also among the 10 Denver players  
that give the Pro Bowl a distinct Broncos flavor, laughed and said 
he wasn't going to give Elway an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will physically threaten him. I will physically persuade  
him. I will sabotage every single vehicle he might drive away in,'' 
Davis said. ``He has to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not over yet, we just got started. You go tell him I said  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, apparently feeling a bit hassled by the blur of  
activities and travel, said things seemed even more hectic at the 
Super Bowl and afterward this time than they did when the Broncos 
won it last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went right back for the parade. ... I checked my car phone  
and I had 30 or more messages, and I thought, `I'll just have to 
wait to get to those,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need some time to slow down and try to get organized, get  
the bills paid and all that stuff.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Legislation Moving Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress, with a strong push from a new House  
speaker and continued public clamor, is likely to approve new rules 
for HMOs this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Any law is likely to give patients the right to complain to an  
outside mediator if an insurance company turns down care, and 
provide guarantees that a health insurance plan will pay for 
reasonable visits to an emergency room and other basic care. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in conflict are key issues such as whether patients should  
be allowed to sue HMOs when care is denied, and whether plans must 
pay for what doctors consider ``medically necessary'' care. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate committees already are looking for compromises,  
and even the fiercest opponents say 1999 is likely to produce a 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our hope that with a fresh start and open minds, we can  
find a bipartisan consensus solution,'' Senate Finance Committee 
Chairman William Roth, R-Del., and the panel's top Democrat, Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York said in a joint statement late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They said their staffs were meeting with interest groups in a  
``serious effort'' to find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the issues that could receive attention in Congress  
this year, this is the one,'' said Chip Khan, who heads the Health 
Insurance Association of America. ``There is a train going down the 
track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything really points to action,'' agreed Neil Trautwein of  
the National Association of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the House narrowly passed a GOP bill along party  
lines. In the Senate, no legislation was ever considered because 
Republicans and Democrats couldn't even agree on the rules for 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year looks different:  
</P>
<P>
	--Both House and Senate leaders have said legislation will be  
produced through the committee process, which forces the parties to 
work together. Last year, Democrats backed President Clinton's plan 
and Republicans met in secret to craft their approach. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the House, Democrats picked up five seats in the November  
elections. Last year, the Democratic HMO bill failed by just five 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the Senate, GOP leaders have introduced their own modest  
legislation. A year ago, they were saying they might not back 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	--And newly installed House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has  
signaled his interest in seeing HMO legislation become law. He 
chaired last year's GOP task force, knows the issues and has 
promised a vote before year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Politically, many Republicans would like this issue off the  
table before the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any candidate up for re-election is anxious for something to  
be achieved in this area,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., who 
introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's exit polls found HMOs were not a top issue for most  
voters, though candidates of both parties campaigned on it across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The essential arguments for and against legislation have not  
changed. Supporters say patients need protection from health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care plans that deny 
needed care, trying to keep costs low. Opponents say new 
regulations will increase the cost of insurance, cause employers to 
drop coverage and leave more people uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	But even opponents, including the HMO trade group, are open to  
modest regulations, including the right to take disputes over 
coverage to an independent panel. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear how hard opponents will lobby against legislation  
this year. Opponents spent $60 million to lobby on managed care 
regulations and other issues during the first half of 1998, 
according to a study by The Associated Press last November. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Health Plans is looking ahead to  
2000, trying to keep HMOs out of the presidential race by releasing 
polls of GOP voters in New Hampshire and Iowa that show minimal 
interest in the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some insurance companies are acting on their own to  
address complaints. Just Thursday, Sierra Health Services of Nevada 
became the latest company to voluntarily offer its members external 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that anti-managed care comments and anecdotes  
create a concern that HMOs may not provide life-saving treatment 
for severely ill patients,'' the company's chief executive officer, 
Dr. Anthony M. Marlon, said in a statement. ``Outside independent 
review should give our members peace of mind.''

<HEADLINE> Coin Collection Considered Jack Pot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, N.H. (AP) -- Most people feel great when they finally  
fill that old jelly jar with coins, take it to the bank and find 
out they have accumulated a couple of hundred nickels, dimes or 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Multiply that amount by about 8,000, and you might get an idea  
how David Sundman feels. He is president of Littleton Coin Co., and 
has just bought what is being described as the largest known hoard 
of American coins: more than 1.7 million Indian Head cents, Liberty 
Head nickels and Buffalo nickels, some worth hundreds of dollars 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be the last collection of that size to be found in the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll never, I don't think, see anything like this again,''  
Sundman said. ``Usually stories get bigger and get repeated, and 
I've never heard anybody talk about anything even half this size. A 
third this size would be a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coins, mostly from the 19th century, were collected by a  
resident of the Midwest, who doesn't want his name or even the 
state he lives in known. 
</P>
<P>
	He kept them in canvas bags and 55-gallon drums, hidden behind  
the walls of his house. Littleton bought several hundred bags 
through an agent and they have been gradually arriving at the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Each bag holds 4,000 to 5,000 coins, Sundman said. And each coin  
is a piece of American history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Head cents are dated 1880-1909 and have been out of  
circulation since the 1950s. The Liberty Head nickels are dated 
1883-1912 and also have been off the street since the '50s, and the 
Buffalo nickels, dated 1913 to 1938, have been gone since the '60s, 
Sundman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundman said his company paid several million dollars for the  
hoard, and he expects to be able to sell the coins, one at a time, 
for as much as $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With nowhere else in the building to store such a huge hoard,  
the bags are stashed in Sundman's office in a pile about six feet 
tall, four feet deep and three feet wide. The hoard weighs 7.6 
tons, and if placed end to end, the coins would stretch nearly 22 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the coins are being counted, sorted by year and mint  
marks and graded according to their condition. Sorters and graders 
also look for rarities, and already have found a 3 1/2-legged 1936 
Buffalo nickel worth $475 and a three-legged 1937 Buffalo nickel 
worth about $375. 
</P>
<P>
	The sorting is expected to take a year, Sundman said. Then the  
coins will be added to the company's catalogs sent to collectors 
all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the 1997 book, American Coin Treasures and Hoards,  
this hoard surpasses the previous record-size find by a long shot. 
The previous record was set in the 1950s when 1 million 1950 
nickels were accumulated by a Texas collector, author Q. David 
Bowers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never believe it until you get it and own it; then it's  
real,'' Sundman said. ``Now, it's real.''

<HEADLINE> Report Studies Minority Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A decade after the Federal Reserve Bank's  
groundbreaking study of discrimination in lending, an interest 
group says challenges still remain in closing the credit gap 
between white- and minority-owned businesses, though the situation 
is improving. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Thursday by the Boston-based Organization for  
New Equality concluded minorities were less likely than whites to 
own their own businesses, and if they did, they were less likely to 
finance it through commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The group cited census data showing minorities made up 27.8  
percent of the U.S. population in 1998, but owned only 16.3 percent 
of domestic businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	It follows findings from the Treasury Department and the Small  
Business Administration's 1995 National Survey of Small Business 
Finance. The survey found that while commercial banks are the most 
prevalent source of funding for small businesses nationwide, only 
41 percent of minority business owners get their financing there. 
That compared to 51 percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts for ONE said, however, that banks across the country  
are refocusing on lending to minority-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Numerous new initiatives have given attention to this  
important issue,'' the organization said in its report. ``Progress 
in fostering the growth of minority-owned business is being made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, banks have made great strides in standardizing loan  
criteria to factor out race. 
</P>
<P>
	But certain credit scoring practices are still causing problems,  
the group said. While it is illegal for a bank to consider race, 
color, religion, national origin, gender or marital status in 
lending decisions, they can still consider the location of the 
applicant's residence or business. 
</P>
<P>
	Since minorities are more likely to be from inner-city or  
low-income neighborhoods, their chances of credit approval may be 
hurt when those locations are taken into the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	ONE also conducted a survey of its own in 1998. Of 200 minority  
business owners, they found 89 percent had applied for bank credit 
but only 43 percent of those applicants received it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-nine percent of respondents resorted to alternative  
financing and paid an average of 59 percent more interest. 
</P>
<P>
	To help remedy the situation, the organization suggested that  
banks be allowed to collect data on the race and gender of credit 
applicants so research can be done about how well their financial 
needs are being met. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also wants banks to do a better job of informing  
applicants about credit requirements and how to improve their 
chances of being approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining discrepancies in lending rates are costing the  
nation some 8.8 million jobs, ONE said, concluding that the 
positions would have been created along with the founding of more 
minority-owned businesses.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Prayers for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, at a prayer breakfast with  
members of Congress and other prominent figures, today urged 
leaders to put aside grievances and seek genuine reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president made no mention of his impeachment trial in the  
Senate on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. But Sen. 
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., prayed to God that ``at this time of 
difficulty for the president, that you hear his prayer, that you 
help him with the work he is doing with his family and his clergy, 
that you accept his atonement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Clinton said that often in the past, going back  
to the Crusades and the Old Testament, people turned to God to help 
them in war and conflict. ``I do believe that even though Adolf 
Hitler preached a perverted form of Christianity, God did not want 
him to prevail,'' the president said. ``But I also know that when 
we take up arms or words against one another, we must be very 
careful in invoking the name of our Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke before an audience of several thousand people at  
the 47th annual National Prayer Breakfast, bringing together 
members of Congress, the courts, the administration, the diplomatic 
corps and the leaders of several countries. Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat attended, causing a few lawmakers to stay away in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Several in the audience approached Arafat, seated at a front  
table with Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., with greetings and 
handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and others said the prayer breakfast was an occasion  
when politics are set aside in the spirit of good will. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he stayed up late with his wife, Hillary,  
Wednesday night, talking about what he would say. He stressed the 
theme of peacemaking, noting progress in Northern Ireland, the 
Middle East, Bosnia and elsewhere while citing challenges in Kosovo 
and other global hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to pray for peace,'' Clinton said. ``I ask you to  
pray for the peacemakers.'' In particular, he and others asked for 
prayers for Jordan's King Hussein, who is battling for his life 
against cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged the audience to pray ``that our purpose will  
reflect God's will, to pray that we can all be purged of the 
temptation to pretend that our willfulness is somehow equal to 
God's will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged listeners to remember ``that all the great peacemakers  
in the world, in the end, have to let go and walk away, like 
Christ, not from apparent but from genuine grievances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Nelson Mandela can walk away from 28 years of oppression in  
a little prison cell, we can walk away from whatever is bothering 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He singled out the family of the late Israeli Prime Minister  
Yitzhak Rabin. ``If Leah Rabin and her family can continue their 
struggle for peace after the prime minister's assassination, then 
we can continue to believe in our better selves,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Gators-Hurricanes Rivalry Rekindled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Florida Gators and Miami Hurricanes plan to  
renew their heated football rivalry after a 15-year hiatus with a 
home-and-home series in 2002-03. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great news for the teams, the coaches, the fans and all  
the people of Florida who have missed this game,'' Hurricanes 
athletic director Paul Dee said Thursday. ``We're really looking 
forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resumption of the series is contingent on the NCAA adding a  
12th game. Last month, the NCAA Division I Management Council 
approved a 12th game in years when there are 14 Saturdays from the 
start of the season to the last weekend in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I's aren't dotted and the T's aren't crossed, so I'm not  
prepared to announce anything,'' Florida athletic director Jeremy 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee said the schools will make a formal announcement Friday. He  
noted that players who signed national letters of intent this week 
will be seniors when the series resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida and Miami played consecutively from 1944-87. The series  
was discontinued with hard feelings 12 years ago after the 
Hurricanes routed Florida 31-4 and went on to the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools had been negotiating to resume their rivalry at a  
neutral site, most likely Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	But Florida leaned toward keeping the games on campus because,  
other than Florida State, the Gators don't traditionally play host 
to marquee teams in their non-conference matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee said there have been no discussions about continuing the  
series beyond 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start with the first move, and you go from there,'' he  
said. ``We haven't been able to play because of various 
circumstances. We can look forward from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida leads the series 25-24.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Terror Threat Still High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Security at U.S. embassies around the world  
has been beefed up considerably since last August's terrorist 
attacks on two embassies in east Africa, but the dangers posed by 
international terrorism remain high, Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright told Congress today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly no single arrest or shutdown of a terrorist  
operation will be sufficient,'' Albright told a Senate 
Appropriations subcommittee on terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	She defended President Clinton's request for $300 million for  
next year for increasing embassy security in the budget he sent to 
Congress. But Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the subcommittee chairman, 
said it falls about $700 million short of what he said an 
interagency study panel said was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the president's anti-terrorism program appeared to be  
``put together on the back of an envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are at the beginning stages. ... We're working very  
hard and I think we all need to work together on this,'' Albright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the administration was upgrading security in all 122  
overseas diplomatic posts. ``We have decided that there is no such 
thing as a no-threat embassy,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	The near-simultaneous bombing attacks last Aug. 7 on the U.S.  
embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, killed 
250 people and injured more than 5,500. Twelve Americans were 
killed, all in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, testifying before the same panel,  
told the panel, that ``there is a threat and it's real'' of a 
terrorist attack involving weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Such weapons ``are there and are being considered for use,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As to a possible new terrorist attack in this country, ``We're  
not going to prevent them all,'' she said. ``There is not way we 
can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, FBI Director Louis Freeh told Sen. Ben Nighthorse  
Campbell, R-Colo., the FBI had ``a number of very good leads'' on 
the perpetrators of an Oct. 12 fire at Vail, Colo., that destroyed 
four ski lifts, a restaurant, a picnic facility and a utility 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been intensely pursued,'' Freeh said.  
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said he had been concerned over the lack of apparent  
progress in the investigation and was worried about ``copycat'' 
attacks on other Colorado ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	An underground group of environmental activists that calls  
itself the Earth Liberation Front has claimed responsibility for 
the fire and for one in December at U.S. Forest Industries 
headquarters in Medford, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said the fires caused $12.5 million in damage. He  
showed the committee large before-and-after photos of the burned 
lodge, which had been made of logs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see what they gain by burning down a log building.  
They've got to cut down more logs to rebuild it,'' Campbell said.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Egypt Helps Modern Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An innovation introduced by the pharaohs of  
ancient Egypt is proving valuable to modern science. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Egyptian agriculture and the nation's well-being  
depended entirely on the Nile River's annual floods, the pharaohs 
created nilometers, devices to measure the height of the river 
flood. 
</P>
<P>
	Now researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology are  
using Nile records to estimate the frequency in the past of the El 
Nino climate phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	An early discovery is a period just over 1,000 years ago that  
had relatively frequent El Ninos, similar to the pattern of the 
last 20 years, according to a paper in the Feb. 15 edition of 
Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers Elfatih A. B. Eltahir and Guiling Wang looked at  
Nile flood records back to A.D. 650 -- a few hundred years after the 
last pharaohs but many centuries before the nilometers were no 
longer used -- to develop an estimate of past El Ninos. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino, an unusual warming of the water in the eastern tropical  
Pacific Ocean, can have worldwide impact on weather. Sea surface 
temperature records go back only to the late 1800s, so climate 
researchers have looked for other ways to determine when past El 
Ninos might have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	When an El Nino is under way, rain is reduced over the sources  
of the Nile. Studies have found that about 30 percent of the change 
in water flow on the Nile at Aswan can be attributed to El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	The new paper shows frequent El Ninos between about 750 and 1000  
with a reduction after that, and then an increase again in the 
latter years of this century. It did not speculate on the reason 
for the correlation between the two periods.

<HEADLINE> Boston Won't Appeal Quota Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- After considering the fragility of school  
affirmative action programs nationwide, the Boston School Committee 
decided not to challenge a court ruling that overturned a 
race-based admissions policy for one of its most prestigious 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee decided Wednesday not to appeal an appeals court's  
rejection of admission policies at the Boston Latin School. 
Officials felt the case was unlikely to win at the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when racial preferences are under fire, the decision  
points to the importance of choosing which battles are worth 
fighting since an unfavorable Supreme Court decision could have 
undone such programs around the country, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that the court has been most set against is  
quotas or anything that looks like a quota,'' said Richard Fallon, 
a constitutional scholar at Harvard Law School. ``They have 
consistently, in all of their cases, said how skeptical they are of 
quotas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fallon and several other legal experts said several of the  
justices, most notably Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and 
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, are generally seen as 
strongly opposed to the concept. 
</P>
<P>
	Some saw the Boston case as particularly poorly suited for a  
Supreme Court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the perspective of the School Committee or other school  
districts that want some kind of race-conscious remediation, this 
wouldn't be the plan that you'd want before the court,'' said Wendy 
Parmet, a professor at Northeastern University's law school. 
</P>
<P>
	The admissions system struck down last year by the appeals court  
admitted half of students to the school based on entrance exam 
scores and grades only, while the other half were admitted based on 
scores, grades and race. A previously rejected plan had set aside 
35 percent of seats for blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1978 case of Bakke vs. University of California, the  
Supreme Court struck down the use of racial quotas in school 
admissions, but it did allow schools to consider race in deciding 
which students to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the past decade, the court has twice rejected set-aside  
plans for minority government contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston case centered on a ninth-grader who claimed in 1997  
that she was denied entrance to the school despite scoring better 
than minorities who were admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Greenfield, who teaches a seminar on the Supreme Court at  
Boston College Law School, described the court as being in a state 
of flux on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is the reluctance to ask the court to make these  
decisions is a reluctance that is shared among the justices 
themselves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said many court observers expect two or three justices  
could retire in the coming years, possibly giving the next 
president the ability to dramatically reshape the court's stance on 
affirmative action.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Falls 62.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fierce sell-off in technology shares sent  
stock indexes spinning lower Thursday, handing the technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite the third-biggest point loss in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 62.31 to 9,304.50. The  
blue-chip index swung widely during the day, falling 91 points in 
the morning then heading up 31 before retreating a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component and technology leader IBM lost 5 11/16 to 169 5/8 and  
was responsible for nearly 24 points of the Dow's loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad market indexes, however, were a much bigger story. The  
Nasdaq skidded 83.34 to 2,410.07, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500-stock index lost 23.58 to 1,248.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners beat advancers 9 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange.  
Volume was 1.03 billion shares on the Big Board, off slightly from 
Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Some market pundits and observers have been warning for months  
that the screamingly high valuations on technology shares, 
particularly on those of Internet companies, could not hold up 
forever. Some worried that technology had been so responsible for 
the market's overall advances, that once the technology bubble 
burst, the entire market would cave in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology is the key'' to the market's high valuations, said  
Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. By jumping 
the technology ship, ``in effect the street is saying, you have 
reached valuations that I cannot justify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wachtel added however that Thursday's declines don't necessarily  
signal a trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the month of January, the Nasdaq composite went up 14  
percent, and in one day of correction, people ask whether it's all 
over,'' Wachtel said. But one day of contraction doesn't make a 
pattern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the stocks of online brokerages, which had been posting  
strong gains for the second day in a row, finally succumbed after 
New York state's attorney general said he was looking into trading 
irregularities at these firms. Most of them ended lower, with 
Siebert Financial losing 6 1/4 to 43 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's brief foray into positive territory was due to a rise  
in economically sensitive stocks, such as Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing, International Paper and Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these stocks ended in the positive column after the  
Federal Reserve Board released minutes of its December meeting 
indicating that it didn't plan to raise interest rates. Higher 
rates would hurt big manufacturers because their borrowing needs 
are relatively great. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of computer chip makers Advanced Micro Devices and Intel  
were lower on talk of a price war in computer chips. AMD fell 2 1/6 
to 18 7/8. Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock after the company pulled 
out of two high-profile technology conferences. Shares of Intel, 
which lowered its chip prices last month, fell 8 5/8 to 130 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market paid little mind to several pieces of good economic  
news. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the number of new unemployment claims  
fell 9,000 in the week ended Jan. 30. The Commerce Department 
reported a 2.3 percent jump in orders to U.S. factories in 
December. Retailers reported strong January sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other major stock indexes, the NYSE composite fell 7.53 to  
591.05, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 6.15 
to 707.12. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.95 to 
417.79. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo dropped 0.53  
percent. The CAC-40 in Paris lost 0.51 percent, and the DAX in 
Frankfurt ended 0.15 percent lower. The FT-SE 100 index in London 
closed nearly flat.

<HEADLINE> China Banks Face $100B in Bad Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAIKOU, China (AP) -- Gold letters over the door still spell out  
the bank's name. Tellers wait on customers and an electronic board 
overhead flashes foreign currency exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The only sign of the disaster that struck Hainan Development  
Bank last year is a notice pasted to the door: It says the bank was 
declared insolvent on June 21 and taken over by a major state 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hainan bank was already shaky when it was ordered in 1997 to  
absorb credit unions ruined by a stock speculator who couldn't pay 
his debts. The added burden was too much, and it became the first 
bank to fail in modern China. Auditors are still adding up the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, offers just  
a hint of the tasks ahead as China struggles to clean up its banks. 
They face up to $100 billion in bad debts due to mismanagement and 
misguided lending -- a legacy of the communist planned economy. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of delay, China is launching a massive effort to  
remake its banks along Western lines, slashing their debts and 
turning them into moneymaking tools to revive a sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad-loan problem has become the greatest obstacle to  
developing a socialist market economy,'' Gao Shangquan, a senior 
government adviser, said at a seminar last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first major step, the government announced in January  
that each of its four main commercial banks will create an agency 
to take over the banks' bad loans. The strategy apparently is to 
repackage and resell some debts, while writing off others. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they are distinctly different from the Resolution Trust  
Corp., the independent agency that cleaned up U.S. savings and 
loans in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, this is what we need. We will see whether we will have  
to change this later,'' said Wang Mengkui, director of the Chinese 
Cabinet's Development Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation with the Hainan bank highlights the dual problems  
plaguing Chinese banking: mismanaged local institutions and a 
costly mandate for government banks to bail out struggling state 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks have lost money financing golf courses, hotels and other  
speculative investments, or through graft by managers who took 
bribes to approve fraudulent loans. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the economy slowed in recent years and losses at state  
companies mounted, many borrowed to cover expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ``nonperforming loans'' make up 20 percent of total  
lending, Central Bank governor Dai Xianglong says. Economists say 
that equals some $100 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside estimates say the problem is even more serious than  
Chinese officials acknowledge, with delinquent loans accounting for 
up to half of total lending. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, a much smaller 5 percent rate of bad loans in  
Thailand led to a crippling bank crisis there in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, banks have survived in part because of a steady inflow  
of deposits. With few stocks or other investments available, the 
famously frugal Chinese bank up to 40 percent of their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	China also is the East Asian nation to escape the region's  
financial crisis, thanks to foreign exchange controls and other 
barriers isolating it from the outside financial world. 
</P>
<P>
	China hasn't put a price on bank reform. But Germany's Deutsche  
Bank estimates it could cost up to $430 billion -- half of China's 
annual economic output. 
</P>
<P>
	As banks tighten lending standards, loans to keep state  
companies afloat are expected to end. But the credit squeeze could 
lead to widespread layoffs -- an unsettling prospect for communist 
leaders already facing unrest among unemployed workers. 
</P>
<P>
	So, before banking reform begins in earnest, China has to  
complete a 17-month-old overhaul aimed at making state industry 
profitable, said George Leung, an economist for HSBC Group in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the two reforms could take a decade, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they would rather take a gradual approach than an  
American-style `big bang' to fix everything at once,'' Leung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, major questions remain: Will reforms lead to a wave of  
bank closures? Will foreigners be allowed to buy Chinese banks? And 
most important: How will China pay for it all? 
</P>
<P>
	Economists suggest selling bonds to tap China's huge savings  
pool. Bonds were sold successfully last year to raise bank capital 
to minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese economists have proposed a Western-style deposit  
insurance fund and officials have announced plans for a regulatory 
``early-warning system'' to monitor bank problems more closely.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Cuts Key Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England cut its base interest rate by  
a half point to 5.5 percent Thursday, a larger-than-expected change 
which pushed stock prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index was up 79.5  
points at 6,019.8. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth rate reduction in the securities repurchase  
rate in as many months, but it left British rates well above the 3 
percent level set by the 11 countries participating in the new euro 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must close the interest rate gap with the euro-zone as soon  
as possible, to maintain business competitiveness and enhance the 
prospect of the U.K. joining the single currency at the earliest 
opportunity,'' said a statement from the British Chambers of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Denmark's Central Bank cut its securities repurchase  
rate and discount rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 3.5 percent 
and 3.25 percent respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark is one of four European Union members staying out of the  
monetary union.

<HEADLINE> NATO Force May Be Sent to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Bosnia-weary Congress is reacting  
skeptically to the Clinton administration's suggestion that U.S. 
troops may be needed to help enforce a peace plan in war-scarred 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	There remains no such plan, despite NATO's efforts to force the  
warring parties to the bargaining table this weekend. But the 
administration's national security team has been making the rounds 
on Capitol Hill laying groundwork for such a deployment in case a 
peace plan is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not at this time support ground troops in Kosovo, because  
I do not know what the game plan is,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, R-Texas, after a briefing by Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen. ``I do not 
know what the exit strategy is, and I don't know how many of our 
forces would be involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments echoed those of many lawmakers.  
</P>
<P>
	Later, Albright made a hastily arranged decision to deliver a  
major policy address on Kosovo to a foreign policy group today. A 
senior official, asking not to be identified, said Albright planned 
to explain why Kosovo was important to the national interest. The 
official declined to say whether Albright planned any major 
disclosures in the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying Wednesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee,  
Cohen said the promise of some U.S. peacekeeping presence might be 
crucial for nailing down a support for a peace plan from Kosovo's 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen predicted a three- to five-year stay if troops are  
introduced but said the U.S. ground presence would be ``relatively 
small,'' and that Europeans should comprise the bulk of the force. 
The United States would retain the lead responsibility for any 
airstrikes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any U.S. ground force would be sent into the southern Serbian  
province only after a viable peace accord is agreed to by the 
warring factions, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told  
the committee he envisions a U.S. contingent of 2,000 to 4,000 
troops, but he said that was just a guess as NATO hadn't yet 
decided on the size of the overall force. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee, said he supports U.S. participation in a ground force 
once a peace pact is in place. 
</P>
<P>
	But Warner said: ``Many of my colleagues quite properly are  
concerned that we're moving into another Bosnia -- open-ended 
situation, when (the) administration in years past has set 
deadlines, and those deadlines have not been met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. troops have been in Bosnia for three years. The U.S. troop  
contingent in that former Yugoslav republic now stands at 6,900, 
with the total NATO force at 32,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said there is support in Congress for use of air power if  
necessary to convince Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``that 
he must negotiate in good faith'' or for forcing Kosovo Albanians 
to hold up their end of the bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration must make a separate, and strong, case to win  
congressional support for ground forces, Warner suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration shared with lawmakers a draft of a  
U.S.-sponsored three-year peace plan that would dramatically reduce 
Serbian control over Kosovo and give the province considerable 
self-government powers -- while still allowing some continued 
Serbian military presence. Kosovo is the southernmost province of 
Serbia, the dominant republic of the two left in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also pledged to provide a series of  
benchmarks to be used as a basis for extricating U.S. troops once 
they are sent in, congressional and administration sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft of the peace plan suggested reducing the number of  
Serbian troops in the province from the current 25,000 to about 
4,000, according to administration and congressional officials, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. The plan would limit those troops 
to serving as a border patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., insisted  
in a letter to President Clinton on ``an immediate and complete 
withdrawal of all Serb police, security, army and paramilitary 
forces from Kosovo prior to any U.S. deployment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Rubin defended some continued  
Serb military presence in Kosovo. ``The fact of the matter is that 
Kosovo is part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' he said. 
``The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a country; Kosovo is not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People might want to wish away the existence of Serbs, but  
there are Serbs there,'' Rubin said. ``And there have been 
provocations on both sides in Kosovo.''

<HEADLINE> AARP Urged To Back Medicare Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leaders of a commission advising Congress  
and President Clinton on Medicare urged retirees Thursday to 
support fundamental changes to the nation's health insurance 
program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't leave it the way it is,'' Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,  
co-chairman of the panel, told the national legislative council of 
AARP, the nation's largest organization of older adults. ``We need 
to do more than just spend more money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the other co-chairman of  
the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, were 
among those trying to woo the powerful ``gray lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without changes, Medicare is expected to run short of cash just  
as baby boomers begin to retire. Clinton has suggested using money 
from government surpluses. The commission is due to make its own 
recommendations March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and Thomas are trying to solidify support for a  
significant change in Medicare, in which the program would help 
retirees buy their own health insurance so the government can begin 
shifting away from paying individual medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say competition among private insurers to enroll  
Medicare beneficiaries could save the government money and improve 
the elderly's access to the latest medical advances. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would not have Congress legislating every year what's the  
best available health care,'' said Breaux. 
</P>
<P>
	However, AARP leaders raised concerns about whether such a  
system could guarantee adequate benefits at affordable prices. 
Clinton, in a speech to the group Wednesday, said he also could not 
accept changes that did not include such assurances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to get into a system where you don't have a  
defined benefit package and you're shifting an inordinate amount of 
cost to beneficiaries,'' said AARP executive director Horace Deets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the AARP has also been critical of another change  
the commission is strongly considering: raising the Medicare 
eligibility age from 65 to 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and Thomas offered reassurances Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Although under their plan insurers could offer policies that  
would vary in benefits and out-of-pocket costs, all would have to 
cover at least a minimum level of care, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the proportion of insurance costs Medicare would cover  
would stay the same from year to year -- unless Congress voted to 
change it -- so that if prices rise, taxpayers would share the 
burden with retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not just saying to every senior, 'Here's some money, go  
buy your health insurance,''' Breaux said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Doping Summit Struggles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
moved to end a drug summit with a semblance of unity by trying to 
paper over three days of discord with a revised doping policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakened by the biggest scandal in Olympic history, the IOC  
could not prevent its plans for an international doping agency from 
slipping from its grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	After scrambling through the night to come up with an acceptable  
compromise final statement for the 600 delegates, the IOC issued a 
draft declaration today. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration, set up by leading summit officials, said the  
IOC would organize a multilateral meeting with governments and 
international institutions ``within three months, to define the 
structure, mission and financing of the agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The draft declaration conceded ``there may be a provision for a  
possible modification of the two-year (drug) sanction,'' a phrase 
that went a long way in meeting the concerns of big federations, 
such as the world soccer and cycling bodies, who opposed a two-year 
ban favored by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, the IOC leadership now also has to deal  
with a revolt of rank-and-file members who object to proposed 
reforms to approve Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Canada and indeed throughout the world, there is a high  
degree of cynicism, a high degree of skepticism and a high degree 
of mistrust in the IOC as an organization,'' Renn Crichlow, a 
former world champion kayaker from Canada told the doping summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have criticized we have done so as friends, and  
friends tell you the truth,'' British sports minister Tony Banks 
said, adding the IOC should not get a chance to lead the $25 
million doping agency. 
</P>
<P>
	With friends like this, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
might have been happy his enemies stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest challenge to Samaranch's eroding power came  
across town as 42 IOC members, many of whom he backed to join the 
exclusive club, opposed plans for overhauling the process for 
electing Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The voice of the members is very, very loud,'' Italian IOC  
member Mario Pescante. He said an ``overwhelming majority'' of 42 
members came out against plans to strip the general assembly of 
voting rights in the 2006 Winter Games election. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have some bad apples, they should be thrown out, but  
don't tell us the whole general assembly is corrupt,'' Pescante 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like taking the candy away from the bad boy -- you won't  
get the vote any more,'' U.S. member Jim Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions issue also turned the members of the Olympic  
family against one another. Athletes demanded a tougher stance, 
while soccer and cycling wanted to make sure any sanctions would be 
acceptable to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If international federations, national federations and  
national Olympic committees run scared of lawyers they are failing 
the majority of our athletes,'' said Britain's Princess Anne, an 
IOC member. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such calls for tougher sanctions across all sports, the  
conference moved to allow federations to impose shorter penalties 
in ``exceptional circumstances'' for fear of being overruled by 
civil courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The creation of the international doping agency was held up by  
continued wrangling between governments and the IOC over who should 
control the body. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Islamic Law Adopted in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Thousands of opposition supporters  
celebrated today in Chechnya after the breakaway republic's 
president bowed to their demands and ordered the adoption of 
Islamic law. 
</P>
<P>
	But 1,500 opposition leaders and representatives meeting in a  
stadium in Grozny called for more concessions, including the 
abolition of Chechnya's parliament and the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the stadium where the congress took place, an estimated  
7,000 people, mostly armed with rifles and clad in military 
fatigues, also celebrated the new changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The order by President Aslan Maskhadov was seen as a major  
victory for hard-liners, who have sought to establish an Islamic 
state since the republic won de-facto independence from Russia in a 
1994-96 war. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov on Wednesday revoked parliament's legislative  
functions and ordered the body to cooperate with Muslim leaders to 
write an Islamic constitution within three months. 
</P>
<P>
	His decision came after heavy pressure from the opposition, who  
accuse him of being too sympathetic with the Russian government and 
threatened to oust him if he didn't meet their demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov has been unable to rein in armed gangs behind a wave  
of political violence and kidnappings. He passed the decree on the 
condition that the opposition support him, though no official 
agreement was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leaders praised Maskhadov's move, but pushed for more  
concessions, including disbanding the parliament and getting rid of 
the presidency completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not introduce Islam now, under the next parliament  
and president things will get even worse,'' said Karavan Saiyev, a 
field commander with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the president's decree will change all aspects of  
Chechnya's life, including education and the military, the Interfax 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it wasn't immediately clear whether Maskhadov planned to  
introduce a strict version of Islamic rule -- such as that imposed 
by Afghanistan's Taliban -- or whether he intended to settle for a 
milder version. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leaders said the move would only make Chechnya more  
stable and establish its authority among other nations. No country 
has recognized Chechnya's independence, and Moscow still regards 
the republic as part of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Chechens were not as excited about Maskhadov's plans to  
throw out the region's present constitution, which outlaws anything 
but a secular state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I'd been killed in the war,'' said a Chechen woman who  
asked to remain anonymous. ``Those who could afford to leave 
Chechnya have already done so, and we have been left here 
absolutely defenseless.''

<HEADLINE> Williams to DiMaggio: Keep Battling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Splendid Splinter has some words of  
encouragement for the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, back in his hometown for a few days, says his  
thoughts have been with one of his contemporaries, Joe DiMaggio, 
who underwent lung cancer surgery in October and suffered 
postoperative infections that nearly killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel awfully, awfully bad about that,'' Williams said. ``But  
it happens to a lot of people when they get 80, 82, 84, 86. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to battle through with it and you've got to hope it  
ain't going to hurt and you hope that you're going to be able to 
get still some things done and accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who turned 80 in August, said he hasn't spoken  
recently with the 84-year-old DiMaggio, but has been in contact 
with his brother, Dom, a former teammate with the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio, according to his doctor, has been making progress  
since his release from a hospital on Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so damn good,'' said Williams, who batted .406 in 1941,  
the same season that DiMaggio hit in 56 straight games to set one 
of baseball's greatest records. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the current state of the game, Williams said he was  
invigorated by watching last year's home run record chase between 
Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was terrific,'' said Williams, who hit 521 career  
homers. ``I told somebody, `That contest between McGwire and Sosa, 
got me to feeling every time Sosa got up and McGwire got up, like I 
was pretty near playing.' That was something, wasn't it? And the 
way they conducted themselves. That little guy, Sosa, was so great. 
And I hope I'm going to get a chance to meet him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Williams has had several strokes this decade, he still  
tries to remain as active as possible. On Friday, he'll join with 
San Diego Padres executives and a few players to announce plans to 
refurbish a Little League park in his old North Park neighborhood 
and name it Ted Williams Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said Little League is one of his pet causes, as are  
impromptu hitting sessions with youngsters at his Florida home. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the rest of the time I'm breathing, anything I can do for  
baseball, talking about it or giving some information that I think 
is correct, or answering questions, I'm the easiest guy in the 
world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the third field in San Diego to be named in honor of  
Williams, who was born and raised here and was a member of the 
original 1936 Pacific Coast League Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the 60th anniversary of pro baseball in San Diego, the  
Padres announced plans to build or refurbish 60 youth baseball 
fields. Ted Williams Field will be the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big deal for us,'' Padres owner John Moores said. ``I'm  
very grateful that he's going to be there. It's a good thing for 
baseball. There are going to be a lot of kids out there for the 
first time who will get a chance to see an American icon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Williams achieved fame in Boston, the Padres enjoy the  
few links he has to San Diego. For instance, Williams wore No. 19 
with the PCL Padres, the same number currently worn by another 
pretty good Padres lefty, Tony Gwynn. Williams is the only big 
leaguer since World War II with a higher career average than 
Gwynn's, .344 to .339. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like he's an alum,'' Moores said of Williams.

<HEADLINE> White House: Economy Growth To Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, already in the longest  
period of uninterrupted growth in peacetime history, will keep 
expanding this year, but at a slower pace as recessions in 
one-third of the globe push America's trade deficit higher, the 
administration said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual report card on the economy, the president's  
Council of Economic Advisers said that the current recovery, which 
will celebrate its eighth birthday next month, is doing even better 
than the nation's two other lengthy expansions in the 1980s and 
1990s because inflation is still a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration used this year's ``Economic Report of the  
President'' to trumpet the benefits the long recovery has provided, 
highlighting significant increases in wage gains for low-income 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expansion, unlike recent previous ones, is both wide and  
deep,'' President Clinton said in his message transmitting the 
report to Congress. ``All income groups, from the richest to the 
poorest, have seen their incomes rise since 1993.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said typical family incomes have risen by $3,500 when  
adjusted for inflation and black and Hispanic households, ``who 
were left behind during the last economic expansion, have also seen 
substantial increases in income.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government statistics have shown wage gains for various  
low-income groups have increased during the past two years but 
private economists noted that these gains were occurring after 
years of stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many workers are climbing out of deep holes after having  
fallen behind for two decades,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist 
for the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the economy's good performance was not accidental  
but the result of the sound policies of his administration, 
including successful efforts to halt years of soaring federal 
deficits and begin producing federal surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans said the administration's report failed to give  
enough credit to the policies of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan and the efforts of the GOP to push budget balancing and 
welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., head of the House Ways and Means'  
subcommittee on human resources, said ``One of the key reasons that 
more low-income Americans are working for higher wages is that 
welfare reform has helped millions of families off welfare rolls 
and onto payrolls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's forecast projected that overall growth, as  
measured by the gross domestic product, will decline to 2.4 percent 
this year, a significant slowdown after the 3.9 percent expansion 
in 1998. With last year's growth, the economy wrapped up a 
three-year stretch of the best growth performance since the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	But Janet Yellen, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers,  
noted that inflation in the current expansion is much 
better-behaved than in the other two lengthy periods without 
recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the 1982-89 period and the 1961-69 period, inflation  
started to rise significantly by the seventh year, sowing the seeds 
of recessions as the Federal Reserve stepped in to combat rising 
price pressures with interest rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expansion has been not only long, but excellent,  
particularly in its record on inflation,'' Yellen told reporters at 
a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	The current expansion is the longest in peacetime history and if  
it lasts until next February it will become the longest on record, 
surpassing the 106 months of the 1961-69 recovery, a period that 
covered the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration predicted that inflation will rise slightly  
this year, to 2.3 percent, while unemployment, now 4.3 percent, is 
expected to increase slightly to 4.9 percent by year's end. The 
administration's projections are in line with private economists' 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The dip in overall economic growth will result from a slowing in  
consumer spending and business investment and a further expansion 
in the trade deficit, which the administration said would probably 
set another record. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slowdown, Yellen said a recession is unlikely,  
although some unforeseen event, such as a huge stock market 
correction that forced a bigger-than-expected retrenchment by 
consumers, could wrench the economy into a downturn.

<HEADLINE> Panel Warns NASA of Looming Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A safety oversight panel warned NASA  
on Thursday that it's headed for a crisis because of cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Space shuttle safety, while satisfactory for now, could suffer  
in the future as a result of inadequate job skills and other 
shortfalls in the work force, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel 
said in its annual report to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hiring freeze of the past several years has all but killed  
the usual pattern of bringing `new blood' into the agency to 
replace those who are leaving,'' the report said. ``Although the 
hiring freeze has now been lifted, budgetary restrictions make it 
all but impossible to replace experienced persons who are 
leaving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel described the situation as a looming crisis.  
</P>
<P>
	``Budget and personnel ceiling constraints on the hiring of  
engineers, scientists and technical workers are moving NASA toward 
a crisis of losing the core competencies needed to conduct the 
nation's space flight and aerospace programs in a safe and 
effective manner,'' the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last year, the shuttle work force totaled about 21,000  
nationwide, mostly contractors. That's down about one-third from 
six years earlier, according to NASA statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety panel, which was formed in the wake of the deadly  
Apollo spacecraft fire in 1967, urged that more money go toward 
hiring and training at Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center 
in Houston and Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget cuts also have forced NASA to put off improvements to the  
shuttle fleet and the international space station, the panel said. 
Astronauts connected the first two pieces of the station in orbit 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though both programs are presently operating at an  
acceptable level of risk, there are identified improvements that 
could make them even safer,'' the panel's chairman, Richard 
Blomberg, wrote in a letter accompanying the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel cited, among other things, outdated shuttle computers  
and an inadequate supply of spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
	An added burden for Kennedy workers, the panel noted, is the  
uncertainty surrounding the shuttle flight schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule has been in disarray for more than a year because  
of delays in launching pieces of the international space station -- 
Russian money problems are to blame -- as well as ongoing problems 
with an X-ray telescope.

<HEADLINE> Cendant, Royal Auto Deal Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cendant Corp. is dropping plans to acquire part  
of Royal Auto Club Ltd. after British antitrust regulators demanded 
that Cendant divest from its Green Flag breakdown assistance 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The $758.8 million deal had been announced in May. It was driven  
by expected cost savings and synergies between Royal Auto Club and 
Green Flag, said Cendant vice chairman Stephen P. Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Cendant intends for Green Flag to compete with RAC and  
others in Britain's auto breakdown services market, Holmes said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant's shares fell 56 1/4 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $21.87 1/2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant, which owns brand names such as Ramada, Avis and Century  
21 real estate, has been shedding businesses since an accounting 
scandal surfaced in April from the operations of CUC International 
Inc., one of the companies that merged in December 1997 to create 
Cendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant has lost $20 billion of its market value since revealing  
accounting irregularities in April. Ten directors associated with 
CUC have resigned, and investors filed one of the largest 
class-action lawsuits in history in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Money set aside for the Royal Auto Club purchase will instead be  
used to reduce debt and repurchase Cendant shares, Holmes said. 
Cendant recently announced it was boosting its stock buybacks by 
$200 million, to $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant, which moved its headquarters to New York from  
Parsippany, N.J., last month, has more than 35,000 employees and 
operates in more than 100 countries.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake To Revamp Games Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Stung by outrage over the Olympic bribery  
scandal, officials Thursday unveiled a sweeping reorganization plan 
for the committee running the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to move into the next era, the next phase,'' said  
Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics clamoring for a role will get some of the 17 or 18 new  
spots on SLOC's board of trustees. The board's executive committee 
will be replaced with a new management group ordered to keep a 
tight rein on planning. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Garff and Gov. Mike Leavitt will be voted on  
Feb. 11 by the committee's board of trustees. That vote will come 
two days after it gets a report from an independent ethics panel 
investigating Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have found the bid committee gave more than $1  
million in cash, free medical care, travel and scholarships to IOC 
members or their relatives before the 1995 IOC vote giving Salt 
Lake the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff said he and Leavitt have not offered the job of SLOC chief  
executive to anyone, and refused to discuss Mitt Romney, the man 
believed to be the front-runner. Romney is a Boston venture 
capitalist and former Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief executive would replace Frank Joklik, who resigned  
Jan. 8 but remains on the job until he is replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17 or 18 new board members, to be chosen by Leavitt and  
Mayor Deedee Corradini, likely will be ready to join the board on 
Feb. 11, Garff said. ``We have a reasonable expectation it will be 
approved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt also elaborated on a statement that he knew little about  
the excessive spending on International Olympic Committee members 
by a few bid executives. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he met about 50 IOC members and their families, posed  
for photographs and gave obligatory gifts of diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not ever personally see a gift of great value,'' Leavitt  
said. ``I was doing everything I could to be charming. I was doing 
my diplomatic duty as the governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know that the international students he met  
were sons and daughters of IOC members, some supported by bid 
money, and he repeated an earlier assertion that the lavish 
spending was hidden from him and the bid committee by bid 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was there a pattern of deception? Yes,'' Leavitt said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They had to hide it. I didn't see it and I don't know of  
anyone else who did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt dismissed allegations to the contrary by Tom Welch, the  
former bid committee president who has been blamed for the 
excesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not unexpected from someone who is feeling a lot of  
pressure because of past actions,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff and Leavitt declined to say whether board members who also  
were on the bid committee will remain on SLOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to see if any of those people are implicated,''  
Garff said. ``We will review those facts and then take decisive 
action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt declined to say whether restructuring of the board might  
mean ridding it of prominent businessmen who are doing business 
with SLOC. Community groups have demanded the resignations because 
of conflicts of interest, but SLOC's ethics policy has required 
only that those with conflicts dismiss themselves before any votes 
touching their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization is designed to broaden community  
representation and give more responsibility to a management 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	City council members and activist groups have demanded more  
community representation on the committee, which numbers 33 persons 
appointed by Leavitt and Corradini. 
</P>
<P>
	But the enlarged board of trustees would lose its  
decision-making authority, playing only an advisory role for the 
management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members still would serve on standing committees for  
audit, budget and investment, community relations, compensation and 
facilities-environment. 
</P>
<P>
	They also would elect from their ranks seven members for the  
management committee, which would directly oversee the committee 
employees planning the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the seven, the management committee would include  
Leavitt, Garff, Corradini, a new SLOC president and chief 
executive, four athletes, three U.S. Olympic Committee officials 
and two IOC representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, Welch denied he told CNN in a telephone  
interview on Wednesday that the bid committee took $50,000 in cash 
to Budapest, where the IOC chose Salt Lake for the games. In a news 
release on Thursday, Welch said he told CNN that he didn't know 
about any cash, but if it was carried to Budapest, it was to pay 
routine expenses of the Salt Lake delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Welch was not simply quoted out of context in this report;  
Mr. Welch was misquoted entirely,'' said Tom Schaffer, his lawyer.

	Serbs To Attend Kosovo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Serbian parliament voted today  
to send a delegation to the peace conference in Kosovo after 
blasting NATO and the West for threatening force if they stayed 
away. The West is ``knocking on an open door,'' Serbian Premier 
Mirko Marjanovic told parliament. ``We stay open for a peaceful 
solution'' of the Kosovo crisis. The vote was 227-3 with three 
abstentions.

	Clinton Urges Prayers for Peace  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton addressed a prayer breakfast  
with members of Congress and other prominent figures, urging 
leaders to put aside grievances and seek genuine reconciliation. 
The president made no mention of his impeachment trial in the 
Senate on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. But Sen. 
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged the audience that ``at this time 
of difficulty for the president, that you hear his prayer.'' 
Clinton was also planning a brief review with Yasser Arafat 
following the 47th annual National Prayer breakfast.

	GOP Struggling With Clinton Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are struggling with proposals that  
would conclude President Clinton committed wrongdoing without 
removing him from office. The White House and Democrats insist the 
concept is unconstitutional in an impeachment trial. Senate 
Republicans are meeting today in search of a consensus.

	Clintons Decry Story on Chelsea  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife say they are  
``profoundly saddened'' by People magazine's decision to do a cover 
story on daughter Chelsea. The Clintons said People chose to run 
the story ``despite personal appeals with respect to her privacy 
and her security from her parents.'' The magazine hits the street 
tomorrow with a cover photo of Chelsea with her mother and the 
headline: ``Hillary &AMP; Chelsea -- Grace Under Fire.''

	Lawyers Argue for Pinochet Trial

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Spain's claim that more than 50 Spaniards were  
victims of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet's regime 
makes it the appropriate country to try him, lawyers argued today 
in Britain's highest court. After 11 days of complex legal 
arguments, lawyers for the Spanish government made a final push to 
persuade the House of Lords to uphold the 83-year-old general's 
arrest on charges of grave human rights abuses.

	Yeltsin Meets With Top Officials

	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin conferred with two top  
officials today on efforts to stamp out corruption and political 
extremism in Russia, the Interfax news agency said. He then took a 
trip to his office in the Kremlin, where he was expected to meet 
with aides later in the day. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and 
presidential chief-of-staff Nikolai Bordyuzha met the president in 
the morning at the sanitarium outside Moscow where Yeltsin, 68, is 
recovering from an ulcer.

	Rushdie Said Given a Visa

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- India, the first country to ban the book ``The  
Satanic Verses,'' has granted a visa to its author, Salman Rushdie, 
for the first time since the 1980s, the BBC reported. Rushdie's 
lawyer collected the visa from the Indian High Commission in 
London, British Broadcasting Corp. radio said. India, Rushdie's 
birthplace, banned ``The Satanic Verses'' after it provoked angry 
protests from Muslims in 1988, and in 1996 Rushdie's book ``The 
Moor's Last Sigh'' was withdrawn from bookshelves within weeks of 
its release.

the controversy -- and attempted to spread the blame. ``I am 
saddened and dismayed that so many feel the need to isolate 
responsibility for what -- at the time -- were cooperative 
decisions,'' Welch said in a ``Dear Friends'' fax to reporters.

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks Extend Hebert Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Goalie Guy Hebert, the only player who  
has remained on the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim roster since the NHL 
team's inception in 1993, signed a three-year contract extension 
Thursday. Terms were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebert, 32, has appeared in 41 games for the Ducks this season  
with a 16-18-7 record and a 2.31 goals-against average. He also has 
a career-high five shutouts this season, including Wednesday 
night's 3-0 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we strive to build an identity for the club -- and (we) want  
to build a winner here in Anaheim -- we believe that ... one of the 
major players here is Guy Hebert,'' Mighty Ducks president and 
general manager Pierre Gauthier said. ``To be able to keep him in 
our organization for the foreseeable future is a great step for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guy is special. He's an original Mighty Duck and means a lot  
to this franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hebert would have become an unrestricted free agent after this  
season, and Gauthier said he wanted to sign the goalie to avoid any 
distraction later on. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebert was Anaheim's first player, selected second overall in  
the 1993 NHL expansion draft from the St. Louis Blues. His 1997-98 
season was cut short due to an injured right shoulder, which 
required surgery last April. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a career record of 115-132-33 with a 2.91 career  
goals-against average.

<HEADLINE> Home Run King Aaron Savors Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Will 755 go the way of 61?  
</P>
<P>
	Hank Aaron, who 25 years ago this season passed Babe Ruth as the  
career home run leader, said it could happen if last year began a 
trend. Mark McGwire hit 70 and Sammy Sosa 66 to top Roger Maris' 
1961 single-season record of 61. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, if they keep hitting home runs the way they hit  
them last year -- 50, 60, 70 -- you know they could catch the record 
pretty quick,'' said Aaron, who retired with 755 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added Wednesday, he thinks his record is probably safe.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not because I don't think that players have the ability, but I  
think it's the longevity of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron chatted at a luncheon hosted by CNN News Group chief Tom  
Johnson to preview Friday's official tribute. President Clinton and 
a host of other political and sports leaders will celebrate Aaron's 
65th birthday, begin baseball's commemoration of his record's 25th 
anniversary and raise funds for the Chasing the Dream Foundation he 
and wife Billye started to provide grants to children. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron said his highest salary was $225,000, while players making  
millions every season aren't as likely to play so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our players today are going to make so much money that they  
don't need to keep playing. It was a long time before I even made 
$50,000,'' Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one in particular with an excellent chance would be  
Ken Griffey Jr. He's young, he's had some great years and in a 
couple years he's probably going to sign one of the biggest 
contracts of all time. Whether he's going to keep focused on how 
high his ability can carry him is something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, 29, has 350 homers.  
</P>
<P>
	Comparing eras, Aaron said today's players work more with  
weights and are generally stronger, but that starting pitching and 
the overall level of competition was higher in his first decades of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he wouldn't trade his low-paying days in the Negro  
Leagues or his 1950s-1960s years playing against many future Hall 
of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Aaron, senior vice president of the Atlanta Braves,  
doesn't argue with those who call the 1998 Yankees the best team in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be very honest, that Yankee team last year was very  
scary,'' he said. ``That team is about as good as you're going to 
put together. I think it was good enough to beat anybody, really.''

<P>
	ST. MATTHEWS, Ky. (AP) -- A minivan with a 9-year-old girl alone  
inside crashed into a video store Thursday, killing one man and 
injuring another. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, whose name was not released, was with her mother  
inside a Blockbuster Video store and asked to go outside to the 
minivan, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the mother gave the girl the keys and was inside the

	The van backed up and hit a tree and curb before accelerating  
forward into the store, said Sgt. William Fitzgerald of the police 
department in St. Matthews, a Louisville suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities did not know if the van's ignition was on when it  
crashed. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Report To Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The seemingly unstoppable U.S. economy should  
keep rolling along this year even as the global economic turmoil 
pushes America's trade deficit to another record high, the Clinton 
administration predicted today. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing the annual ``Economic Report of the President,'' the  
administration said the economy seemed well-positioned for 
continued growth in part because inflation is at a significantly 
lower level now than at the same period in the country's two other 
lengthy expansions, in the 1960s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, on the verge of another American century, our economy is  
at the pinnacle of power and success,'' President Clinton 
proclaimed in his message transmitting the report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expansion, unlike some previous ones, is both wide and  
deep,'' Clinton said, noting wage gains among a number of 
disadvantaged groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages for blacks and Hispanics have posted rapid gains in the  
past two years, according to the report, prepared by the 
president's Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, employment rates among male high school dropouts,  
single women with children and immigrants have all increased, the 
council said. Hourly wages for men in the bottom 10 percent of wage 
earners have increased by 6 percent since 1993, after adjusting for 
inflation, after having fallen during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration economists gave credit for the turnaround to the  
long recovery pushing unemployment down to a three-decade low last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you run a strong economy long enough, it really does get  
down to the bottom,'' said Rebecca Blank, one of three economists 
on the council. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's forecast projected that overall growth, as  
measured by the gross domestic product, would decline to 2.4 
percent this year, a significant slowdown after the 3.9 percent 
expansion in 1998. With last year's growth, the economy wrapped up 
a three-year stretch of the best growth performance since the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	But CEA Chairman Janet Yellen noted that inflation in the  
current expansion is much better-behaved than in the other two 
lengthy periods without recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In both the 1982-89 period and the 1961-69 periods, inflation  
started to rise significantly by the seventh year, sowing the seeds 
for recessions as the Federal Reserve stepped in to combat rising 
price pressures with interest rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expansion has been not only long, but excellent,  
particularly in its record on inflation,'' Yellen told reporters at 
a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	The current expansion is the longest in peacetime history and if  
it lasts until next February it will become the longest on record, 
surpassing the 106 months of the 1961-69 recovery, a period that 
covered the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	The good performance on inflation last year, when consumer  
prices rose just 1.6 percent, was helped by the Asian crisis, which 
pushed one-third of the globe into recession and triggered steep 
price drops for oil and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration predicted that inflation would rise slightly  
this year, to 2.3 percent, while unemployment, now 4.3 percent, was 
expected to increase slightly because of the growth slowdown, to 
4.9 percent at the end of the year. The administration's 
projections are in line with private economists' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The dip in overall economic growth expected this year will  
result from a slowing in consumer spending and business investment, 
two of the driving forces behind the recovery, and a further 
expansion in the trade deficit, which the administration said would 
probably set another record. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the slowdown, Yellen said a recession is unlikely,  
although some unforeseen event, such as a huge stock market 
correction that forced a bigger-than-expected retrenchment by 
consumers, could topple the economy into a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Some private economists are forecasting a recession year because  
of the disruptions they expect from the Year 2000 computer problem, 
when some older computer programs will misread 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's advisers, however, said that all the work being  
done to upgrade both private industry and government computers 
could actually boost GDP growth slightly this year and will lessen 
the chances of a serious disruption to the U.S. economy next 
January.

<HEADLINE> Economic Data Signal Strong Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The strongest surge in factory orders in more  
than a year, an unexpected dip in applications for unemployment 
benefits and big sales gains at America's retailers all show the 
economy is starting 1999 with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
	During the final three months of 1998, the economy grew at a  
robust 5.6 percent pace, the strongest in 2 1/2 years, and it looks as 
if the momentum carried over into the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders to U.S. factories jumped 2.3 percent in December, the  
biggest increase in 13 months, the Commerce Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the number of Americans filing first-time  
applications for unemployment benefits fell by 9,000 to a six-week 
low of 292,000 last week, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	And major retail chains reported in New York that January proved  
to be a better-than-expected month as shoppers snatched up 
discounted merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have everything they need to justify spending with  
gusto and they are devouring everything in sight,'' said economist 
Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ``They have jobs, 
income and confidence. What more do they need?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a two-day private meeting that ended on Wednesday, Federal  
Reserve policy-makers decided to leave short-term interest rates 
unchanged despite signs of economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes released Thursday of an earlier meeting, Dec. 22,  
revealed that policy-makers thought the outlook for 1999 was 
``subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty in both 
directions.'' But the minutes said that if they determined the 
economy was running too fast, they had ``time to react to potential 
inflationary pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, many economists, including Sohn, worry the economy is  
overheating, developing imbalances that include an overvalued stock 
market and labor shortages. On Thursday, the Dow Jones average of 
industrial stocks fell 62 points to 9,304.50. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's economic advisers, in their annual report,  
predicted the economy's longest peacetime expansion will continue 
through the year. But the Council of Economic Advisers said growth 
will slow to 2.4 percent in 1999, down from 3.9 percent in 1998, as 
recessions in one-third of the world push the U.S. trade deficit 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing has been among the U.S. sectors hardest hit by the  
world slump, but if the December report is an indication, it is 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, manufacturing was not in recession in the last  
quarter and certainly is not now,'' said economist Jerry 
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
``This strength is clearly visible in the orders numbers, which 
have increased in six of the last seven months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the impact of the global slump was clearly visible in  
orders for all of 1998, which rose just 2.1 percent to $4.03 
trillion. That compared with a healthy 5.4 percent gain in 1997 and 
was the weakest year since orders posted a 2.3 percent decline 
during the recession year of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness was particularly pronounced at U.S. blast furnaces  
and steel mills, which are competing with cheap steel imported from 
Russia, Brazil and Korea. Their orders fell 12.5 percent, the 
biggest decline in at least 15 years. And the increase for aircraft 
was anemic, 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, however, orders for computers and office  
equipment surged 19.4 percent, the biggest gain in 14 years. Orders 
for communications equipment jumped 12.1 percent. And they jumped 
6.9 percent for stone, clay and glass products, reflecting a 
building boom spurred by low interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Travel Industry Passes Y2k Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Travel agents and airlines said on Thursday that  
computerized booking for Jan. 1, 2000 began without any problems, 
an indication that the industry's Year 2000 debugging efforts have 
been successful. 
</P>
<P>
	No major difficulties were reported related to the possible  
inability of some computer systems to recognize the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta's computerized reservation systems are performing  
precisely as planned,'' said Charlie Feld, chief information 
officer for the Atlanta-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	At United Airlines in Chicago, the first reservations were  
booked shortly after midnight, and the system sailed on without 
problem. Like Delta, United and other airlines had been changing 
and testing their computer systems for months and were confident -- 
but Thursday was the real test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really felt we were ready,'' said spokeswoman Kristina  
Price, who estimated United has spent $70 million on its Year 2000 
Project. ``We think this was the first major milestone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The day has gone by without a hitch. We're very excited it  
went so smoothly,'' said Jennifer Hudson of Sabre Group, which is 
largely owned by American Airlines' parent company and has 40,000 
travel agencies using its reservations system. ``We had tested and 
re-tested for this day for months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Worldspan, an Atlanta-based system owned by Delta, Northwest  
Airlines and TransWorld Airlines, no Y2K-related glitches were 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one carrier still isn't booking flights for Jan. 1,  
though. Ed Stewart, Southwest Airlines' director of public 
relations, said Southwest always leaves a four- to six-month lead 
time on bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to depend on the people in reservations,'' he  
replied, when asked when it will start taking Jan. 1 bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	The computerized reservations systems used by major airlines and  
many car rental and other travel industry businesses display dates 
for sale only 331 days in advance. Thus, Thursday became the first 
day to book travel for next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	For efficiency, most computer software was designed to recognize  
years by just the final two digits rather than all four. For the 
year 2000, computer systems that have not been reprogrammed will 
interpret double zero to mean 1900 and many could stop functioning 
-- a syndrome dubbed ``the Y2K bug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The travel industry expects the period around New Year's Eve and  
Jan. 1, 2000, to be busy, with people heading to celebrations and 
other gatherings. Cruise packages have been particularly popular 
for millennium-related celebrations, travel agents say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanelle Johnson of Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Atlanta said some  
cruises, particularly to the Caribbean, are already sold out. She 
added that travel agents are expecting to become increasingly busy 
as prices are set for fly-and-drive land vacation packages in the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	She and other travel agents say some people worried about a  
Y2K-caused catastrophe have asked whether it will be safe to 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have told them we don't expect there to be a problem,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> States To Divide $5B Tobacco Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco states reached a tentative  
agreement Thursday on dividing a $5.15 billion trust fund for 
farmers that would be financed by the major cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The distribution plan will use the 1998 basic quota system set  
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said North Carolina Attorney 
General Mike Easley and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most equitable way and what our farm groups want  
here. All states come out pretty much even with that,'' Easley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton said Phil Carlton, the lawyer for four  
largest U.S. tobacco companies, would prepare a final draft of the 
proposed agreement, and the states' representatives would meet 
again to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 people met behind closed doors at a Raleigh hotel to  
work out the distribution plan. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina, the largest flue-cured tobacco state, and  
Kentucky, the biggest burley tobacco producer, would receive the 
biggest shares under the proposal -- 38.34 percent and 29.97 
percent, respectively, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said Tennessee would get 7.65 percent; South  
Carolina, 7.01 percent; Virginia, 6.65 percent; and Georgia, 5.91 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The other tobacco quota states will receive less than 5 percent,  
based on their 1998 basic quotas. Maryland and Pennsylvania tobacco 
farmers are not part of the quota system, and their shares of the 
settlement still must be worked out, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The private trust fund was created last month by tobacco-growing  
states and cigarette makers following last fall's $206 billion 
settlement between the tobacco industry and 46 states. The fund was 
created to aid tobacco farmers expected to be squeezed by the 
higher cigarette prices and curbs on tobacco promotion that are 
part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund will be financed by contributions over 12 years  
by Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco 
Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. The payments could begin 
as early as April. 
</P>
<P>
	Burley's share of the basic quota was 44 percent in 1998;  
flue-cured tobacco farmers got the other 56 percent, according to 
the U.S. Farm Service Agency. Using that formula to divide the 
trust fund money, burley states would get $2.256 billion and 
flue-cured states, $2.892 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Burley-tobacco states and states that grow flue-cured tobacco  
entered Thursday's meeting at odds over how to divide up the trust 
fund money. Each backed formulas that favored their crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny McKinney, chief executive officer of Burley Tobacco  
Growers Cooperative in Lexington, Ky., said each state must work 
out how to distribute the money to the farmers and how much goes to 
quota owners, tenants who work tobacco acreage and lessees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it leaves here and goes back to the state level, that's  
when the civil war starts,'' he said. ``It's going to get pretty 
hateful pretty darn quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major tobacco states involved in setting up the trust fund were  
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and 
Kentucky. Other involved were Maryland, West Virginia, Indiana, 
Florida, Alabama and Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Seeks Mining Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Forest Service wants a two-year ban on new  
hard-rock mining claims on 429,000 acres of national forest land on 
the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Forest Service has a long and storied history of working  
to protect the incredible fish, wildlife, cultural and scenic 
resources of this area,'' Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck said in 
announcing the move Wednesday in his second annual ``State of the 
Forests'' speech at the University of Montana in Missoula. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to continue that tradition,'' Dombeck said in  
disclosing his request to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, whose 
agency oversees mining operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service also will cut back on roaduilding, rely less  
on logging revenues to fund agency operations and launch a new 
effort to protect and restore watersheds on forest land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montana land being withdrawn from new mining claims includes  
400,000 acres in the Lewis and Clark National Forest and 29,000 
acres in the Helena National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of the Rocky Mountain Front goes well beyond that of  
any oil or minerals we could extract from it,'' said Sen. Max 
Baucus, D-Mont., who had asked the Forest Service to consider 
placing the area off limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Front is known for its wildlife, including elk, bighorn  
sheep and grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a two-year period of public comment before the  
agency decides whether to bar new mining claims there for up to 20 
years. The Forest Service announced in 1997 that oil and gas 
drilling would be banned in the area for 10 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	There were roughly 104 mining claims on the land in 1996, but  
nearly all have been inactive, said Forest Service spokesman Chris 
Wood. The old claims could still be exercised if they are proven 
valid, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dombeck also pledged to protect other forest-wilderness areas.  
</P>
<P>
	In future, the agency ``will rarely build new roads into  
roadless areas, and if we do, it will be in order to accomplish 
broader ecological objectives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service has been considering a plan that would halt  
road building in 35 million acres of roadless land for up to 18 
months while the agency drafts a new road policy. 
</P>
<P>
	While pledging to move ahead with that effort, Dombeck said he  
wants to act aggressively to get rid of roads that are not needed 
or maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service is only able to maintain about 18 percent of  
its roads to a desired standard. With Congress' help, Dombeck said 
he wants to increase the amount of adequately maintained roads to 
24 percent by next year, and increase the miles of road the Forest 
Service scraps or repairs by 50 percent over 1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	As for agency funding, Dombeck acknowledged the Forest Service  
relies too much on logging receipts to cover overhead costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that timber production on national forests has declined  
by 70 percent in less than a decade, such an approach is 
unsustainable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service will seek legislation and make changes  
internally to reduce reliance on those revenues, which are not 
subject to congressional authorization or open to public scrutiny, 
Dombeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The forest chief also said he would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Make watershed improvement a priority in all future forest  
plans. Budget requests and employee evaluations will be linked to 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	--Add 74 million acres of state and private forest land by next  
year to the 442 million public and private acres the Forest Service 
already evaluates for forest health. 
</P>
<P>
	--Create a wilderness advisory group and use forest-management  
plans to better manage and identify undeveloped areas in national 
forests.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Owner Gives Sons Top Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell on  
Thursday promoted his son David to president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell also announced on Thursday that he has made his son John,  
38, the team's vice president of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
	David Modell, 37, spearheaded the search to hire the Ravens' new  
head coach, Brian Billick. He also worked on the recently announced 
agreement that names the team's new $223 million stadium after 
PSINet. The Internet service provider will pay the Ravens about 
$100 million over the next 20 years to put its name on the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	John Modell, who coordinates game-day entertainment for the  
team, is also the composer of the Ravens' fight song, Art Modell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a family business, and this is the logical next step for  
both David and John,'' Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell said his sons ``earned these promotions,'' adding the two  
have worked for the franchise longer than nearly any other staff 
member.

<HEADLINE> Rykodisc Offering Recordings on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bucking recording industry titans, the prominent  
independent label Rykodisc said Thursday it will sell a small part 
of its music catalog over the Internet using a controversial 
technology that contains no protection against bootlegging copies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rykodisc will make roughly 175 recordings available using the  
technology called MP3, through www.GoodNoise.com, a Web site for 
downloading music files. 
</P>
<P>
	CD-quality tracks from artists such as Louis Armstrong, Bad  
Finger and Frank Zappa will be available for 99 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always tried to get ahead of industry issues that are  
staring us in the face,'' said Lars Murray, director of new media 
for Salem, Mass.-based Rykodisc. ``We have to do that because, as a 
smaller label, we're not in the position to set industry trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The MP3 format allows for easy transfer of songs off the  
Internet and is proving increasingly popular with artists 
frustrated with the major record labels' distribution practices. 
</P>
<P>
	During last summer's Intel New York Music Festival, the Scottish  
rock band The Jesus and Mary Chain recorded a performance and made 
it available to fans via a Web site. The band gained publicity, but 
its labelSub Pop Records received no money from the thousands of 
fans who downloaded the file. 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely why the major record labels view MP3 with  
suspicion. MP3 doesn't offer copy protection, which means that once 
downloaded, a file can be copied endlessly and played on a $200 
Walkman-like device called a Rio. This worries the recording 
industry, which fears the Internet could cut into its revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in  
Cambridge, Mass., called the Rykodisc move a ``huge boost'' for the 
company and MP3. ``It's a clear sign that indy music is willing to 
test the waters on a new form of distribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, selling music over the Internet makes up only 0.3  
percent of total record sales, which hit $12.2 billion in 1997, but 
projections from Forrester show the Net could account for up to 30 
percent of all music sales by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The recording industry set up the Secure Digital Music  
Initiative in December last year to develop a secure format for 
digital distribution by this fall, but Rykodisc's move indicates 
the smaller labels might not wait. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray emphasized the MP3 offerings were not intended to bypass  
retailers, who handle more than half of all music sales, according 
to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the business of selling CDs and what we hope this is  
going to do is let people get a taste of the artists and then go 
and buy the full length CD,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rykodisc is one of the largest independent record labels and is  
considered a trendsetter in the industry. Although the company is 
privately held and it doesn't release sales figures, it's small 
compared to the big record companies such as Sony or Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs Rykodisc plans to offer account for only about 3  
percent of its total catalog, which also includes such artists as 
Elvis Costello and David Bowie. Most of the tracks being offered 
via the Web are older ones unlikely to compete with hot sellers in 
the local record store. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy O'Connell, manager of rock band Throwing Muses, said  
Rykodisc was right to take the lead in adapting to a new customer 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to change our business model to suit our listeners as  
often as possible,'' he said. ``Whether its switching from vinyl to 
discs to digital music.''

<HEADLINE> Death Row Conviction Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Anthony Porter lists a few simple things he'd  
like to do -- hug his mother, eat a steak -- now that another man has 
allegedly confessed to shootings that put Porter on death row 16 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors aren't ready to grant those wishes just yet.  
</P>
<P>
	Porter spoke to reporters a day after journalism students, a  
professor and a private investigator said they captured another 
man's admission of the shootings on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not angry now,'' Porter said Thursday. ``I thank God  
everything came out all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was sentenced to die for the 1982 slayings of Jerry  
Hillard, 18, and Marilyn Green, 19, who were gunned down in a 
Chicago park. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to die by lethal injection Sept. 23, 1998, but  
the state Supreme Court stopped the execution two days earlier amid 
questions about Porter's mental fitness. Defense attorneys argued 
Porter, who has an IQ of 51, could not understand what was 
happening to him or help in his appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then questions arose about the integrity of the conviction. A  
prosecution witness allegedly recanted his testimony implicating 
Porter, saying police had pressured him. 
</P>
<P>
	And two weeks ago, students in Northwestern University's  
investigative reporting class, who were looking into Porter's 
claims of innocence, tracked down a witness in Milwaukee who 
identified her ex-husband as the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, journalism professor David Protess, private  
investigator Paul Ciolino and several students visited the witness, 
Inez Jackson, who said her former husband, Alstory Simon, pulled 
the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	They confronted Simon on Wednesday with Jackson's statement and  
her signed affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon at first denied the shootings, but then allegedly said he  
fired at the two in self defense when he thought the male victim 
was reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must have close to busted off about six rounds,'' Simon said  
on the videotape made by Ciolino. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Richard Devine has seen Simon's videotape and was  
trying to decide what to do about it, spokesman Bob Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terri Marroquin, one of Porter's attorneys, said she understood  
that investigators from the state's attorney's office interviewed 
Simon on Wednesday. Benjamin declined to comment on details of the 
investigation, and Simon's attorney did not return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``My students certainly feel that they've contributed to saving  
a life,'' Protess said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case would not the first in which the professor and his  
students save a life. In June 1996, four men who had spent 18 years 
behind bars for murder were released after Northwestern students 
working with Ciolino discovered new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter said he wants to hug his mother, seven children and six  
grandchildren. He said he also wants to help people in his 
community and ``teach them right from wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A steak would be fine and maybe some dinner rolls,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Forwards Might Not Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers could really use  
Dennis Rodman tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because starting forwards Robert Horry and Rick Fox might  
have to sit out the opening game of the abbreviated NBA season 
against the Houston Rockets at the Forum in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry's wife went into labor Thursday, prompting him to return  
to his Houston home. Team spokesman John Black said it was 
uncertain whether Horry would return in time to play against the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox sat out his third straight day of practice because of sore  
ankles. He said he hoped to play in the opener, but decided to wait 
until today's shootaround to determine his status. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's practice, Fox, in civilian clothes, spent time  
shooting baskets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers coach Del Harris said Fox won't start tonight even if he  
is able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's missed too much,'' Harris said. ``We'll put him in there  
some and see how he goes. He hasn't been effective in a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris listed several possible starting lineups.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep Houston guessing,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	If Horry is back in time, he will start at one forward position.  
It could be at power forward with Kobe Bryant at small forward, or 
it could be at small forward with Elden Campbell, Corie Blount or 
Travis Knight at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the Lakers' first 10 games are against playoff teams  
from last year -- Houston, Utah, San Antonio twice, Minnesota, 
Indiana and Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we started with 11 wins,'' Harris recalled. ``You've  
just got to believe you're as ready as anybody. We're hoping we 
come out of the gate strong. There aren't that many bad teams 
you're going to play, anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About the first three opponents -- Houston, Utah and San Antonio  
-- Harris said, ``This is like opening with Duke, Stanford and 
Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there was nothing new on the Rodman front Thursday as  
the Lakers turned in their 14-player opening-night roster to the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has played on five of the last 10 NBA championship  
teams, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls, recently 
mentioned the Lakers as one of the teams he was interested in 
joining, and the Lakers have expressed an interest in Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you we're fielding calls from several teams that  
are expressing serious interest in Dennis, and he's weighing his 
options,'' Andrea Marozas, a spokeswoman for International Creative 
Management, which represents Rodman, said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the situation who spoke on the condition of  
anonymity said there is no time frame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard a thing about it,'' Lakers co-captain  
Shaquille O'Neal said. ``I don't want to think about it until it 
happens. It's up to him, it's not up to us. We said openly and 
publicly we wouldn't mind having him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to his agent. I'm sure (executive vice president)  
Jerry (West) is doing everything he can.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles, Fetters Cut Minors Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Fetters and the Baltimore Orioles agreed  
Thursday to a minor league contract and the reliever will go to 
spring training with the major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetters, 34, hopes to be part of a bullpen that has undergone a  
radical change during the offseason. Alan Mills, Jimmy Key and 
Armando Benitez are gone, and the list of newcomers includes Mike 
Timlin, Heathcliff Slocumb and Ricky Bones. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetters spent most of the 1998 season with Oakland before  
finishing with the Anaheim Angels. The right-hander had a combined 
2-8 record with five saves in nine chances a 4.30 ERA. He struck 
out 43 and walked 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetters, who has played 10 years, allowed only five homers in  
1998 and has allowed an average of just three per year over the 
last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He has appeared in 395 games in his career and is 18-33 with a  
3.49 ERA and 85 saves in 112 save chances. His best season was in 
1996 with Milwaukee, when he pitched in a career-high 61 games and 
had a career-best 32 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetters will be one of 14 non-roster players to be invited to  
spring training. The others are: pitchers Terry Burrows, Dave 
Evans, Doug Linton, Carlos Medina and Matt Snyder; catchers Tim 
DeCinces, Julio Vinas and Jayson Werth; infielders Esteban Beltre 
and Jesse Garcia; and outfielders Darnell McDonald, Mike Murphy and 
Ricky Otero.

<HEADLINE>  Jazz, Bulls Game Won't Be the Same  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When the wretched remains of the Chicago  
Bulls take the court tonight against the Utah Jazz, it's only an 
NBA Finals rematch in the most technical sense. 
</P>
<P>
	But that won't matter to the Utah fans. After two agonizing  
finals losses to Michael Jordan and Co., they have a healthy 
dislike for anyone in red and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to boo us as soon as we get off the airplane,''  
said Ron Harper, the only remaining starter from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to know this is a different team, and I'll pass this  
word,'' rookie Bulls coach Tim Floyd said with a laugh. ``I think 
regardless of who is coming in, the Bulls or any other team, Utah 
is going to be sending a statement early and quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's left of the six-time champions will be back at the scene  
of their club's last triumph, a Game 6 NBA Finals win over the Jazz 
that capped Jordan's career and signaled the end of Chicago's 
basketball renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a delicious bit of payback, the Jazz, who saw their  
championship dreams twice crushed by Jordan and his teammates, have 
the opportunity to throw the ceremonial first punch in what will 
probably be a season of beatings for the depleted Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	While their fans may think otherwise, the Jazz players aren't  
attaching any special meaning to the meeting. For them, running 
with the Bulls is just the first lap in a race they hope will end 
in the champions' circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of 50 games we've got to play well in to make a  
run at the playoffs,'' Karl Malone said. ``Michael, Scottie Pippen 
and Dennis Rodman were the Bulls. It's not like that any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Chicago bears only faint resemblance to the Bulls of eight  
months ago, the biggest change the Jazz made was allowing utility 
big man Antoine Carr to sign with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been replaced by Thurl Bailey, who has been out of the  
league since 1994, and center Todd Fuller, who was acquired from 
Golden State on Thursday for a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in basketball and in other sports like to build it  
up and tear it down, but that's not what we're trying to do,'' 
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We've got a bunch of quality players 
together, and they've played together for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, who manned the bench at Iowa State last year and has  
never played or coached professionally, is up against Sloan, a 
former Bulls playing great who begins his 11th season in Utah, by 
far the longest tenure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's in a tough situation,'' Sloan said of Floyd. ``I'm  
sure he'll make the best of it, but it would be a really tough 
thing to do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls franchise is making a definite effort toward a fresh  
start. The seven remaining players and three assistant coaches from 
last year's team quietly received their championship rings 
Wednesday at the Bulls' practice facility, rather than during a 
public ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, Brent Barry and Toni Kukoc are definite starters for the  
Bulls tonight. Beyond that, it gets murky: Floyd will likely start 
journeymen Andrew Lang or veteran Bill Wennington at center and 
Mario Bennett or Dickey Simpkins at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz will counter with four of their five starters from last  
year's finals. Only center Greg Foster, who may not play with a 
fractured ankle, will be missing, and a slimmed-down Greg Ostertag 
likely will take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost both of its preseason games to the Indiana Pacers,  
but also showed more life than some expected. In particular, Kukoc 
scored 32 points in the Bulls' 89-83 loss in their final 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not the same team, but they're still the Bulls,'' Jeff  
Hornacek said. ``We respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Cghina Banks Face $100B in Bad Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAIKOU, China (AP) -- Gold letters over the door still spell out  
the bank's name. Tellers wait on customers. An electronic board 
overhead flashes foreign currency exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The only sign of the disaster that struck Hainan Development  
Bank last year is a notice pasted to the door. It says the bank was 
declared insolvent June 21 and taken over by a major state 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hainan bank, known in Chinese as Haifa, was already shaky  
when it was ordered in 1997 to absorb credit unions ruined by a 
stock speculator who couldn't pay his debts. The added burden was 
too much, and Haifa became the first bank to fail in modern China. 
Auditors are adding up the final cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Haifa Bank, on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, offers  
just a hint of the tasks ahead as China struggles to clean up its 
banks. They face an avalanche of up to $100 billion in bad debts 
due to mismanagement and misguided lending -- a legacy of a 
communist planned economy. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of delay, China is launching a massive effort to  
remake its banks along Western lines, slashing their debts and 
turning them into money-making tools to revive a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad-loan problem has become the greatest obstacle to  
developing a socialist market economy,'' Gao Shangquan, a senior 
government adviser, said at a January seminar sponsored by an 
official think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first major step, the government said last month that  
each of its four main commercial banks will create an agency to 
take over that bank's bad loans. The agencies appear to be intended 
to repackage and resell some debts, while writing off others. 
</P>
<P>
	As bank subsidiaries, they are distinctly different from the  
Resolution Trust Corp., the independent agency that cleaned up U.S. 
savings and loans in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, this is what we need. We will see whether we will have  
to change this later,'' said Wang Mengkui, director of the Chinese 
Cabinet's Development Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation with Haifa highlights the dual problems plaguing  
Chinese banking: mismanaged local institutions and a costly mandate 
for big government banks to bail out struggling state companies 
regardless of the borrowers' ability to repay. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks have lost money financing golf courses, hotels and other  
speculative investments, or through graft by managers who took 
bribes to approve fraudulent loans. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the economy slowed in recent years and losses at state  
companies mounted, many borrowed to cover expenses but no longer 
even make interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Such ``nonperforming loans'' make up 20 percent of total  
lending, central bank governor Dai Xianglong has said. That 
includes 6 to 7 percent for which there is no hope of repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say the 20 percent figure equals some $100 billion in  
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside estimates say the problem is even more serious than  
Chinese officials acknowledge, with delinquent loans accounting for 
up to half of total lending. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, a much smaller 5 percent rate of bad loans in  
Thailand led to a crippling bank crisis there in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, banks have survived in part because of a steady inflow  
of deposits. With few stocks or other investments available, the 
famously frugal Chinese bank up to 40 percent of their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	China also is the only banking industry among major East Asian  
economies to escape the region's financial crisis, thanks to 
foreign exchange controls and other barriers isolating it from the 
outside financial world. 
</P>
<P>
	China hasn't put a price or schedule on bank reform. But  
Germany's Deutsche Bank estimates it could cost up to $430 billion 
-- equal to half of China's annual economic output. 
</P>
<P>
	As banks tighten lending standards, loans to keep state  
companies afloat are expected to end. But the credit squeeze could 
lead to widespread layoffs -- an unsettling prospect for communist 
leaders already facing unrest among unemployed workers. 
</P>
<P>
	So, before banking reform begins in earnest, China has to  
complete a 17-month-old overhaul aimed at making state industry 
profitable, said George Leung, an economist for HSBC Group in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the two reforms could take a decade, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have a rough idea of what they want to do. But come to  
the details, and I think they are still learning,'' Leung said. ``I 
think they would rather take a gradual approach than an 
American-style 'big bang' to fix everything at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major questions remain: Will reforms lead to a wave of bank  
closures? Will foreigners be allowed to buy Chinese banks? 
</P>
<P>
	And most important: How will China pay for it all?  
</P>
<P>
	Economists suggest raising money by selling bonds to tap China's  
huge savings pool. Bonds were sold successfully last year to raise 
bank capital to minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese economists have proposed a Western-style deposit  
insurance fund. Officials have announced plans for a regulatory 
``early-warning system'' to monitor bank problems more closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is accomplished, there won't be financial crises in  
the future,'' said Chi Fulin, a government economist who studied 
the Haifa Bank collapse.

	But the trial judge said there was substantial evidence  
independent of the letters to support the jury's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense claims that six jailhouse letters said to be written  
by Markhasev were actually the work of a convicted forger, David 
Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the letters stated Markhasev went to Bel-Air to rob an  
apparent drug dealer. ``I went to rob a connection and obviously 
found something else,'' it stated. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez, who is serving a 91-year-to-life term for several felony  
convictions, was accused by the defense of faking the letters to 
gain favor with prison authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Markhasev was convicted last July for killing Ennis Cosby, 27,  
who was shot in January 1997 while fixing a flat tire near a 
freeway off-ramp. He was sentenced in August to life in prison 
without parole.

<HEADLINE> Sherman Douglas Signs With Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Free-agent point guard Sherman Douglas signed  
a contract with the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, one day 
before the start of the abbreviated NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-year deal was believed to be worth between $2 million  
and $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers also announced that rookie forward Brian Skinner, a  
first-round draft choice, and veteran guard Scott Brooks have been 
placed on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, 32, averaged 8.0 points and 4.0 assists for the New  
Jersey Nets last season, but took his game to another level in a 
first-round playoff series against the NBA champion Chicago Bulls, 
averaging 18.3 points and 8.3 assists in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been waiting to see if Rod Strickland would re-sign with  
the Washington Wizards. Once that happened Wednesday, the Clippers 
were the only team left that could pay him much more than the 
veteran minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sherman is somebody we've been talking about for a long  
time,'' said first-year Clippers coach Chris Ford, who coached 
Douglas in Boston and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas was taken by the Miami Heat with the 28th overall  
selection of the 1989 draft after playing his college ball at 
Syracuse. In nine professional seasons, the 6-foot-1, 198-pounder 
has averaged 11.8 points, 6.5 assists and 2.3 rebounds in 656 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, who practiced with the Clippers on Thursday, had his  
best season in 1990, when he averaged 18.5 points and 8.5 assists 
in 73 games with the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner, the 22nd selection in last summer's draft, underwent  
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Wednesday and is expected to 
be sidelined for at least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks strained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee  
in the Clippers' preseason opener against the Los Angeles Lakers 
last Friday night, and will be out about four weeks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Courts AARP on Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is trying to get the most  
powerful lobby for older Americans to line up behind his plans for 
using projected budget surpluses to help shore up Social Security 
and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans on Medicare -- especially Americans with lower  
incomes -- should be able to count on a defined set of benefits and 
protections without having to worry about excessive new costs they 
can't begin to afford,'' Clinton told a legislative council meeting 
of the American Association of Retired Persons on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Corry, AARP's director of federal affairs, said the  
president's position ``still leaves open a lot of room for debate, 
but it does begin to anchor the debate, and that is very helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of a bipartisian Medicare commission are exploring  
whether the government could still guarantee health benefits under 
a premium support system designed to foster competition among 
private companies that would offer health plans to Medicare 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reiterated on Wednesday his position that the long-term  
solvency of both Medicare and Social Security must be secured 
before any of the federal budget surplus is spent on broad-based 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to treat this as real serious or solemn,'' said Ari  
Fleischer, majority spokesman for the House Ways and Means 
Committee. He pointed to a recent Congressional Budget Office 
report that found Clinton-supported spending last year shrank the 
projected surplus by $51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing for the president to say these words. It's  
another to judge his actions,'' Fleischer said. He added that 
Republicans don't see tax cuts and Social Security and Medicare 
reform as an either-or choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to work together across party lines to make these  
decisions. We have to work together across generational lines to 
make these decisions,'' Clinton told the seniors' group. ``I ask 
you to join with me to make sure that our country meets that 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His condemnation of a GOP-proposed income tax cut echoed of the  
poll-tested rhetoric he used in the 1996 campaign to slam the tax 
plan of his Republican opponent, Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Clinton said, the GOP plan would ``benefit clearly the  
wealthiest Americans -- who have, I might add, done quite well as 
the stock market has virtually tripled in the last six years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The familiar, partisan-edged rhetoric was unfortunate, AARP's  
Corry said. 
</P>
<P>
	His group has been careful not to alienate the Republican  
majority in Congress by choosing sides in the debate that is 
unfolding just as the 2000 campaign grinds into gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't do Social Security and Medicare legislation from one  
side of the aisle,'' Corry said. ``We hope people aren't just 
trying to stake out positions to sharpen differences for the 
election campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Providence Journal CEO Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Stephen Hamblett, publisher and CEO of  
the Providence Journal Co., is stepping down next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamblett, who has led the company for 12 years, will be  
succeeded by Howard G. Sutton, an assistant publisher, president 
and chief operating officer for the daily newspaper, the company 
announced Thursday. Sutton will join the board in April. 
</P>
<P>
	When the A.H. Belo Corp. of Dallas bought the Journal Co. in  
1997, Hamblett agreed to retire late this year. But Hamblett, who 
turns 65 this year, says he told Belo he might retire earlier if 
the merger went smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the merger has exceeded my highest expectations, and  
Howard, who has just completed a year as assistant publisher, has 
proven to me that he is both ready and the most qualified person to 
succeed me as publisher and CEO,'' Hamblett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamblett plans to continue as chairman of the Journal Co.  
through 2000. He will remain a director through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamblett, vice chairman of The Associated Press board of  
directors, said he plans to leave the AP board when his term ends 
in April.

<HEADLINE>  Jazz, Bulls Game Won't Be the Same  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When the wretched remains of the Chicago  
Bulls take the court tonight against the Utah Jazz, it's only an 
NBA Finals rematch in the most technical sense. 
</P>
<P>
	But that won't matter to the Utah fans. After two agonizing  
finals losses to Michael Jordan and Co., they have a healthy 
dislike for anyone in red and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to boo us as soon as we get off the airplane,''  
said Ron Harper, the only remaining starter from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to know this is a different team, and I'll pass this  
word,'' rookie Bulls coach Tim Floyd said with a laugh. ``I think 
regardless of who is coming in, the Bulls or any other team, Utah 
is going to be sending a statement early and quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's left of the six-time champions will be back at the scene  
of their club's last triumph, a Game 6 NBA Finals win over the Jazz 
that capped Jordan's career and signaled the end of Chicago's 
basketball renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a delicious bit of payback, the Jazz, who saw their  
championship dreams twice crushed by Jordan and his teammates, have 
the opportunity to throw the ceremonial first punch in what will 
probably be a season of beatings for the depleted Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	While their fans may think otherwise, the Jazz players aren't  
attaching any special meaning to the meeting. For them, running 
with the Bulls is just the first lap in a race they hope will end 
in the champions' circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of 50 games we've got to play well in to make a  
run at the playoffs,'' Karl Malone said. ``Michael, Scottie Pippen 
and Dennis Rodman were the Bulls. It's not like that any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Chicago bears only faint resemblance to the Bulls of eight  
months ago, the biggest change the Jazz made was allowing utility 
big man Antoine Carr to sign with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been replaced by Thurl Bailey, who has been out of the  
league since 1994, and center Todd Fuller, who was acquired from 
Golden State on Thursday for a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in basketball and in other sports like to build it  
up and tear it down, but that's not what we're trying to do,'' 
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We've got a bunch of quality players 
together, and they've played together for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, who manned the bench at Iowa State last year and has  
never played or coached professionally, is up against Sloan, a 
former Bulls playing great who begins his 11th season in Utah, by 
far the longest tenure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's in a tough situation,'' Sloan said of Floyd. ``I'm  
sure he'll make the best of it, but it would be a really tough 
thing to do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls franchise is making a definite effort toward a fresh  
start. The seven remaining players and three assistant coaches from 
last year's team quietly received their championship rings 
Wednesday at the Bulls' practice facility, rather than during a 
public ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, Brent Barry and Toni Kukoc are definite starters for the  
Bulls tonight. Beyond that, it gets murky: Floyd will likely start 
journeymen Andrew Lang or veteran Bill Wennington at center and 
Mario Bennett or Dickey Simpkins at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz will counter with four of their five starters from last  
year's finals. Only center Greg Foster, who may not play with a 
fractured ankle, will be missing, and a slimmed-down Greg Ostertag 
likely will take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost both of its preseason games to the Indiana Pacers,  
but also showed more life than some expected. In particular, Kukoc 
scored 32 points in the Bulls' 89-83 loss in their final 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not the same team, but they're still the Bulls,'' Jeff  
Hornacek said. ``We respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Apple Sales Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Washington fresh apple sales are stronger  
than expected this winter, partly the result of low prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nation's top apple-producing state, almost 40.3 million  
boxes of apples have been sold so far this season out of a record 
100 million-box crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for a 42-pound box of Washington apples is  
$11.85, but growers need about $12.50 to break even, said Dan 
Kelly, assistant manager at the Washington Growers Clearing House 
in Wenatchee, which tracks sales in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The apple crop two years ago was almost the same size -- 99  
million boxes -- and the season-to-date sales for the same period 
were 38.5 million boxes. But the average price was $15.98. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's just cutting losses at this point with the  
price,'' Kelly said this week. ``This is one of the worst years 
we've seen for quite some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time prices were so low was 1982, when the average was  
$9.78 a box. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the old law of supply and demand,'' Kelly said. ``The  
positive part is we are selling the crop, but we're not getting 
real good money for most of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, growers this year produced an estimated 265 million  
boxes, the second-largest crop on record. Sales have also picked up 
this winter in other parts of the country, including the Southeast 
and the Midwest, said Jim Cranney, vice president of the McLean, 
Va.-based U.S. Apple Association, an industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of the movement this winter is the result of a  
stronger-than-anticipated export market, despite Asia's financial 
troubles. One out of three Washington apples is sent out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Also giving apple sales a boost was the December citrus freeze  
in California. Four days of bitter cold there did an estimated $656 
million damage. Additionally, there's been some loss of banana 
production in hurricane-ravaged Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all export markets have improved. Sales to Thailand are  
flat and they are down 22 percent in Indonesia compared to a year 
ago. Shipments to Mexico have been limited by trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh apple prices also have been driven down indirectly by the  
influx of cheap apple juice concentrate from China, which the U.S. 
Apple Association is accusing of dumping the product at an unfairly 
low price. 
</P>
<P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pecans bought for Thanksgiving pies might stay  
tasty until Memorial Day barbecues, with an edible coating being 
developed by scientists with the Agriculture Department's research 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The coating can keep pecans fresh up to 10 months in storage at  
room temperature and could preserve the natural flavor of the nuts. 
The coating could help promote year-round consumption of pecans. 
</P>
<P>
	Made from all-natural cellulose, the coating is sprayed on pecan  
nutmeats by processors. Cellulose is relatively inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists with the research service tested three cellulose  
derivatives. The best one gave the pecans a high gloss and delayed 
color changes in the nuts. Dark-colored pecans are often associated 
with rancidity, when oxygen enters the nut and breaks down some of 
its fat. The cellulose did not leave the pecans feeling oily. 
</P>
<P>
	The coatings, which are generally recognized as safe by the Food  
and Drug Administration, would need to be listed on the label as an 
ingredient. They could help promote year-round consumption of 
pecans. 
</P>
<P>
	The coatings were developed at the ARS Citrus and Subtropical  
Products Research Laboratory in Winter Haven, Fla., in conjunction 
with the ARS Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut Research Laboratory in 
Byron, Ga.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Despositions Into Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans moved today to bring  
President Clinton's impeachment trial to a prompt conclusion as 
Majority Leader Trent Lott signaled a lack of support for live 
testimony and GOP lawmakers shrank from an effort to declare the 
president guilty without ousting him. House prosecutors made a 
last-ditch effort to summon Monica Lewinsky to testify before 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from a closed-door meeting with fellow Republicans,  
Lott declared the Senate was ``on track'' for a final vote on the 
two articles of impeachment by Feb, 12, or perhaps a day earlier. 
Democrats renewed a call for a formal censure of the president, but 
only after the trial ends with his acquittal on charges of perjury 
and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators began laying the groundwork for the trial finale,  
unanimously voting to admit into the official trial record the 
depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and 
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. The three had been interviewed 
in private by House prosecutors earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But against long odds, House prosecutors pressed to further  
summon Ms. Lewinsky for live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it is eminently fair that we be allowed to  
present at least one witness live to you, the central witness in 
the cast of this entire proceeding and that is Monica Lewinsky,'' 
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said in making the plea. 
</P>
<P>
	White House special counsel Gregory Craig opposed Ms. Lewinsky's  
live appearance and the release of the videotapes, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is a bad idea,'' Craig told the senators, arguing  
the tapes would ``produce an avalanche of unwelcome'' testimony 
``into the living rooms of the nation.'' He argued that only 
written transcripts should be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Aware that they are short the votes needed to convict Clinton or  
call live witnesses, the House prosecutors showed their frustration 
on the Senate floor. ``If one senator has failed to personally sit 
through ... every deposition, that senator is not equipped to 
render a verdict on the impeachment trial,'' Rep. James Rogan, 
R-Calif., chided. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said Ms. Lewinsky had been ``very  
guarded,'' choosing her words carefully to ``provide the very 
minimum of truth'' during her deposition earlier this week. ``Her 
testimony is clearly tinted and some might even say tainted by a 
mixture of her continued admiration for the president, her desire 
to protect him and her own personal views of right and wrong,'' 
Bryant lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	The request for Ms. Lewinsky's appearance was expected to lose  
as several Republicans already had indicated they would join the 45 
Democrats in opposing in-person testimony. ``It does not appear 
that the votes are there for live witnesses,'' Lott told reporters 
before the trial resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors had a fallback plan with better a chance for  
approval -- a request to show excerpts of the videotaped depositions 
in their closing arguments. To help that argument, Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson provided the first quotations from Jordan's deposition 
Tuesday concerning efforts to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky around 
the time she was emerging as a witnesses in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan testified Clinton had asked him to find the former intern  
a job and ``the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms. 
Lewinsky.'' Hutchinson argued the testimony showed Jordan was an 
unwitting agent for a president eager to thwart Mrs. Jones' lawyers 
from learning about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the proceedings, White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff  
wrote Lott today that Clinton would not submit to a deposition, as 
GOP senators requested. ``It is neither necessary nor appropriate 
for the president to testify,'' Ruff wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been trying to find an exit from a trial that  
is unpopular with the public. Democrats have increasingly referred 
to the proceedings as a ``Republican trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes, the more it becomes a partisan trial, a  
Republican trial,'' Democratic leader Tom Daschle told reporters. 
He said the Democrats were drafting a proposal to censure Clinton 
and expected to have it completed in a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Republicans also indicated today that prospects were  
dimming for a proposal that would conclude Clinton committed 
wrongdoing without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have blocked it. We don't want this to break  
into a partisan melee,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. And Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the proposal ``an effort for 
politicians to protect themselves politically. The way out is to 
vote 'guilty' or 'not guilty' and live with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the Democratic alternative would  
be written less legalistically than the articles of impeachment 
``and more in moral terms of censure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``finding of fact'' proposal pushed by some Republicans  
accuses Clinton of lying to the grand jury. They would like to vote 
on that before the actual articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged lawmakers and others at a  
prayer breakfast to help Clinton, who participated in the event. 
Lieberman asked ``at this time of difficulty for the president, 
that you hear his prayer, that you help him with the work he is 
doing with his family and his clergy, that you accept his 
atonement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans held a party meeting to search for a solution to the  
``findings of fact'' dilemma, unhappy to have the trial end with a 
straight acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to convict a  
president and remove him from office -- a margin both parties agree 
is not within reach -- but the ``finding of fact'' would only need a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want to show portions of the videotapes as  
part of further evidence presentation, but only as a fallback 
position if they can't get live witnesses. Democrats have been 
united in opposition to live testimony, and even Republicans who 
viewed the videotapes of Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan appeared 
unenthusiastic about calling them.

<HEADLINE> Pebble Beach Fans Treated to Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Cameras clicked, crowds cheered and  
fans begged for autographs. It was more like a movie premiere than 
a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The quartet of Tiger Woods, Kevin Costner, Mark O'Meara and Ken  
Griffey Jr. attracted the biggest and most boisterous galleries for 
the first round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had something for every fan. Actor Costner, who  
perfected his stroke for the film ``Tin Cup,'' was paired with 
Woods, a native Californian who gained local fans at Stanford, 
while O'Meara, who has won here five times, was paired with 
All-Star outfielder Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God Jordan didn't come,'' said one fan as he snaked his  
way through the pack gathered around the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, of course, is the newly retired Michael Jordan, who was  
expected to make an appearance here -- paired with Woods. The Dream 
Team was scrapped, however, when Jordan injured his hand with a 
cigar cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's absence and the tournament's history of bad weather  
didn't deter the crowd, which was four deep in spots at the start 
of the day and grew larger with each hole on the Spyglass Hill 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here for anyone in particular,'' said 14-year-old  
Ashley Miller, who gave her real allegiance away with her white 
Seattle Mariners jacket. ``We just want to get some autographs and 
be near them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley and her friends Jessica Anderson and Marisa Boyne, also  
14, routinely positioned themselves at the players' walkway between 
each hole, armed with pens. They weren't having much luck with 
autographs, but it was better than school, they admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing hooky,'' giggled Jessica.  
</P>
<P>
	Griffey was easily the crowd favorite, mugging with O'Meara and  
joking with the crowd. On the first hole at Spyglass, one of three 
courses used in the Pro-Am, a fan shouted out ``Let's go Griff!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still nervous,'' Griffey shrugged after his tee shot went  
right and into the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK Griff,'' the fan replied. ``We'll go find it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Another shot into the trees on the No. 5 hole had Griffey  
scrambling for a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to pick it up,'' he helplessly said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Awww,'' the crowed lamented, and Griffey obliged by navigating  
a tangle of tree limbs to knock his ball back on the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and O'Meara, meanwhile, concentrated on their rounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who finished the day at even-par 72, grew so frustrated  
after hitting out of a sand trap on the tricky No. 3 hole that he 
threw his club down in disgust. He crossed his arms and stared at 
the waves of the Pacific Ocean, a stone's throw from the green.

<HEADLINE> Asst. Principal Gags, Binds Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An assistant principal is under investigation for  
gagging an 8-year-old girl and binding her wrists with masking tape 
as punishment for acting up in class, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official at Onesimo Hernandez Elementary School was placed  
on leave when her boss, the principal, spotted the bound girl in a 
classroom Monday and called police. 
</P>
<P>
	The assistant principal, who wasn't identified, acknowledged the  
discipline was wrong, according to a police report. But she said 
the girl's mother had instructed her to ``use whatever discipline 
is necessary to keep my child in line,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The assistant principal is under investigation by police and  
school officials but had not been charged by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's mother told The Dallas Morning News that the taping  
took place in the presence of other students after she spoke out of 
turn and struck another child in class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her to discipline her, but I didn't say she could tape  
her like that,'' said the mother, who wasn't named to protect the 
girl's identity.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Ventura Plans Return to Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura had to give up his job  
as a radio talk show host to run for governor. Now he's planning a 
return to the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura plans to resurrect his radio call-in show as a way of  
both connecting with the public and stumping for his proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be more than a tool during the legislative session,''  
Ventura said Wednesday. ``It will be my way of getting out the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura spokesman John Wodele said arrangements are being worked  
out with radio stations and no decisions have been made about which 
stations might carry it or when the program might air. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, meantime, is starting his term as one of the  
Minnesota's most popular governors ever. He got a 72 percent 
approval rating in the Star Tribune/KMSP-TV Minnesota Poll. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the highest ever measured by the poll, which dates to  
1947, during a governor's first few months of office, and equals 
the highest rating ever measured by the poll, matched only by C. 
Elmer Anderson in 1954 and Rudy Perpich in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dropped in Cordero Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAYAGUEZ, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Charges stemming from an  
altercation between Cleveland Indians outfielder Wilfredo Cordero 
and his wife's former husband were dropped after the two men 
reached an agreement, lawyers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero was charged with disturbing the peace after police said  
he got into a fight with Felix Perez Torres at a Mayaguez hotel 
early New Year's Day. He had been released without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Torres, who once was married to Cordero's wife, Ana  
Echevarria, had been charged with assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Borges Velez Collado accepted an out-of-court settlement  
reached last month, said Cordero's lawyer, Eudaldo Baez Cruz, and 
Perez Torres' lawyer, Janet Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, 27, agreed Wednesday to a $500,000, one-year contract  
with the Indians. He was with the Chicago White Sox last season and 
is currently playing winter league ball with the Mayaguez Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero has a .278 batting average with 71 HRs and 336 RBIs in  
719 games during seven major league seasons. He was an All-Star 
with Montreal in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he pleaded guilty to beating and threatening his wife.  
He received a 90-day suspended sentence and was ordered to attend 
counseling sessions.

<HEADLINE> IOC Official Criticizes McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A top Olympic official called Mark  
McGwire a ``souped up'' hero, worshiped by Americans who don't care 
about fighting drugs in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who used a muscle-building supplement during the season  
he hit a record 70 home runs, was attacked again Thursday at the 
conclusion of the International Olympic Committee's anti-doping 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The closer you are to the Olympic movement, the more you are  
concerned about doping,'' IOC vice president Dick Pound of Canada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farther away from it you are, the less you care. All of a  
sudden you are in Mark McGwire land, and this is a national hero 
all souped up,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire openly uses androstenedione, which is banned by the IOC,  
NFL, NCAA and other bodies. The dietary supplement is not banned by 
Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire and America's attitude toward doping in sports came in  
for frequent criticism after White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey 
told delegates at the start of the meeting Tuesday that the IOC 
must institute reforms to regain credibility in the anti-doping 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sebastian Coe of Britain, a two-time Olympic 1,500-meter  
champion, cited reports that sprinter Dennis Mitchell escaped a 
drug ban by claiming his positive test resulted from sex and 
drinking beer the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The case ``stretched credibility to a breaking point,'' said  
Coe. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch referred to McCaffrey and  
the U.S. doping situation in his wrapup news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very thankful he's so interested in the IOC, but we also  
told him he had many problems in his own country with doping,'' 
Samaranch said.

<HEADLINE> Money Market Mutual Fund Assets Up / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds increased by $8.86 billion to $854.44 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $6.77 billion to $701.80 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets increased by $2.09 billion to $152.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds increased by $10.54  
billion to $595.42 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets increased by $9.59 billion 
to $544.36 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds increased by $946.4 
million to $51.06 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.450 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.430 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose to  
4.41 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.40 percent in the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.44 percent from 4.48 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.51 percent from 4.50  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 
4.54 percent from 4.58 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
54 days, unchanged from the previous week, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.21 percent as of 
Wednesday, down from 2.22 percent in the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
held steady at 0.99 percent from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield was 4.13  
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 4.14 
percent. But yields remained unchanged on 1-year CDs at 4.29 
percent, fell to 4.34 percent from 4.36 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs and 
fell to 4.48 percent from 4.49 percent on 5-year CDs.

<HEADLINE> 2 Executed in Oklahoma, Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MCALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- A man who killed his mother, his  
stepfather and a store clerk when he was 16 was put to death early 
today after telling his family his execution would do nothing to 
change their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the people who are hating me right now and are here  
waiting to see me die, when you wake up in the morning, you aren't 
going to feel any different,'' Sean Sellers said before he was 
executed by injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him touch your  
hearts. Don't hate all your lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time in 40 years an American was put to  
death for crimes committed at age 16. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time earlier, a hitchhiker who beat, robbed and killed a  
man by running him over with his own car and stabbing him more than 
30 times with a screwdriver was executed by injection in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Darick Gerlaugh, 38, was the seventh American Indian executed in  
the United States since the death penalty was restored in 1976, and 
the first permitted to use a sweat lodge for purification 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlaugh kept his eyes shut while the death warrant was read and  
had no last words. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers' final statement angered relatives who witnessed his  
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took his last dig at us. ... It is very presumptuous that  
he would know how we would still feel,'' stepsister Noelle Terry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers, 29, killed a convenience store clerk shortly after his  
16th birthday and, six months later, his mother and stepfather, 
Wanda and Paul Bellofatto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sean's been not a part of our family since he decided to pull  
the trigger on our father and his mother,'' said stepbrother Lorne 
Bellofatto. ``Pretty much he's been dead to us since then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlaugh was one of three men convicted of kidnapping, robbing  
and killing 22-year-old Scott Schwartz in 1980. The three were 
hitchhiking from Chandler to Phoenix and planned to rob whoever 
stopped to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
	While the two other men held Schwartz down, Gerlaugh repeatedly  
ran over him with his car, then helped stab him.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Boss Upset at NHL Summit Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- International hockey boss Rene  
Fasel says the NHL failed to represent the interests of North 
American fans and players by snubbing the world doping summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed that despite our invitation, the NHL Players  
Association and the NHL did not send representatives here to 
participate in the discussion to find a solution for them,'' said 
Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been easier if they were here to ask their  
opinion, but I cannot speak for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day world conference, which resulted in a diluted  
antidrug resolution, was an attempt to crack down on drugs in sport 
and harmonize antidoping sanctions among international federations. 
</P>
<P>
	For Fasel, that posed a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Americans were criticized for lecturing and calling for  
antidoping reforms here when they still have doping problems in 
their country,'' Fasel said. ``Of course, everyone does. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's why I was rather quiet here. I'm also sitting on a  
fence. The NHL has no antidoping rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fasel said the IIHF would organize talks with the NHL in order  
to resolve the long-standing deadlock between the two bodies on the 
issue of doping. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the mandates for the new antidoping agency is to step up  
out-of-competition testing. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL players have mostly been free of drug testing throughout the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out-of-competition testing is a problem we'll have to discuss  
and resolve with the NHL,'' Fasel said. ``If athletes cheat, they 
must be caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's my problem. Like basketball, in the world  
championships we use 80 to 120 players who play for the NHL where 
there are no antidoping tests, no antidoping lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fasel maintained hockey doesn't have the major doping problems  
of many other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we have some anabolic steroid and human growth hormone  
problems,'' Fasel said. ``But in North America, most NHL players 
come from our system, through the CHA and AHL, where we run the 
antidoping programs and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Canada, since the Ben Johnson affair, has become the most  
rigorous and tough on doping control.''

<HEADLINE> African Elephants Almost Extinct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Keepers at the Indianapolis Zoo are treating  
two pregnant African elephants -- Kubwa and Ivory -- as if they were 
their species' last hope. 
</P>
<P>
	They almost could be. Fewer than 500,000 of the creatures remain  
in the wild, and fewer than 300 are in zoos worldwide, according to 
the International Species Information System. 
</P>
<P>
	Although past efforts to breed the animals in captivity have  
largely failed -- only four have been born at zoos in the past 
decade -- zookeepers hope a new artificial insemination technique 
could reverse the dwindling numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a successful breeding program, ``in 20 years we may not  
have any elephants left in captivity,'' said Debbie Olson, the 
Indianapolis Zoo's director of elephant conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubwa and Ivory are believed to be the first African elephants  
impregnated via the groundbreaking procedure, using semen collected 
from male elephants at zoos in Missouri and Florida. In June, a zoo 
in Springfield, Mo., announced the first successful artificial 
insemination of a smaller Asian elephant. 
</P>
<P>
	The successful birth of baby elephants next year would be an  
important step toward keeping African elephants in zoos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that this is a panacea for the issue,'' said  
Michael Hutchins, director of conservation for the American Zoo and 
Aquarium Association. ``But it is a tool that will give us more 
options in our efforts to sustain the captive population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And scientists say lessons learned from the insemination process  
could also help a species threatened by poaching and habitat 
destruction to survive in the wild where the current population of 
African elephants is down from more than a million in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The past breeding efforts were largely doomed, as zoos had few  
male African elephants available for breeding and researchers knew 
little about the reproductive cycle of the females, which stand 8 
feet tall and weigh between 6,000 and 10,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of artificial insemination first emerged about a decade  
ago as a way for the 12 bull African elephants in accredited North 
American zoos to reproduce without the expense and danger of moving 
the huge animals, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Zoo in Portland recently spent $14,000 to move a  
female elephant 130 miles to a zoo in Tacoma, Wash., for breeding, 
said Mike Keele, coordinator of the elephant breeding program for 
zoos in North America. That's twice the cost of each attempt at 
insemination, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubwa and Ivory are the only two of the zoo's five female  
African elephants to become pregnant. Two other attempts failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Zookeepers got the good news in July, when an ultrasound  
confirmed the 22-year-old Kubwa was pregnant. Her calf is due in 
March 2000 after a 22-month gestation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivory, a 17-year-old cow, is due to deliver her calf in  
September 2000. Keepers were ecstatic when an ultrasound Jan. 29 
revealed she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that the first time wasn't a fluke,'' said Olson.  
</P>
<P>
	She hopes the research will anchor a breeding program to help  
the African elephant multiply, and the lessons learned -- just in 
time -- from Kubwa and Ivory can only help further that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much better off to understand that now, while we have the  
animals,'' said Keele.

<HEADLINE> Auto Sales Up 12 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. sales for cars and light trucks increased by  
12 percent over the start of 1998, as the sales momentum from the 
end of the year carried through to 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, said  
Wednesday its sales were up 4 percent. The increase was mainly due 
to a rise in passenger car sales, as its light truck division saw 
nearly a 4 percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	As a group, GM, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG had a 9  
percent increase in U.S. sales. Foreign automakers did even better: 
Asian companies had an 18 percent increase, while European 
companies were up 21 percent, based on the daily sales rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry was amazingly strong,'' said analyst Maryann  
Keller of ING Baring Furman Selz. ``With all the year-end clearance 
sales, I would have thought people who wanted to buy a car would 
have come in and bought a car last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most automakers that offer pickups, minivans or sport utility  
vehicles reported surging sales on the highly profitable models, 
though GM did not. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials said the company was still working through delays  
from labor strikes last summer that slowed the retooling needed to 
build new versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 
pickups. They said GM would add enough capacity to build 250,000 
more trucks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plants are going full-blast, but inventories aren't where  
we want them to be,'' said Donald DeVeaux, director of North 
American market analysis for GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of GM's truck lineup -- such as the Chevy Tahoe,  
Jimmy SUVs and the Chevy Venture minivan -- were also down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somewhat surprising, because the truck market is larger  
than just pickup trucks,'' Keller said. ``While GM has an inventory 
problem in the pickup sector, they have no shortage of SUVs or 
minivans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger car sales were up 11 percent over a slow January last  
year. The Oldsmobile division got the biggest boost, thanks to the 
new Alero. Pontiac and Buick also saw sales increases due to 
midsize sedans, namely the Pontiac Grand Am and Buick Century. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn's decision to sell all its SC coupes with a third door on  
the driver's side appeared to pay off. The model's sales were up 26 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Japanese automakers reported wildly different results.  
Mitsubishi Motors Co. said its sales were up 18.7 percent, while 
struggling Mazda Motor Co. said it sales fell 3.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller and GM officials said much of the increases came from  
good economic times -- low interest rates, high employment, cheap 
new car prices -- rather than sales incentives. As long as those 
factors didn't change, they said, the industry would do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people buy a car using some method of financing,'' Keller  
said. ``The actual dollar level of incentives in the market today 
is a few hundred dollars less than it was in summer, but the 
consumer is probably getting that much benefit from lower interest 
rates and low finance charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a dream.''

<HEADLINE> Travel Industry Passes Y2k Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Travel agents and airlines said on Thursday that  
computerized booking for Jan. 1, 2000 began without any problems, 
an indication that the industry's Year 2000 debugging efforts have 
been successful. 
</P>
<P>
	No major difficulties were reported related to the possible  
inability of some computer systems to recognize the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Delta's computerized reservation systems are performing  
precisely as planned,'' said Charlie Feld, chief information 
officer for the Atlanta-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	At United Airlines in Chicago, the first reservations were  
booked shortly after midnight, and the system sailed on without 
problem. Like Delta, United and other airlines had been changing 
and testing their computer systems for months and were confident -- 
but Thursday was the real test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really felt we were ready,'' said spokeswoman Kristina  
Price, who estimated United has spent $70 million on its Year 2000 
Project. ``We think this was the first major milestone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The day has gone by without a hitch. We're very excited it  
went so smoothly,'' said Jennifer Hudson of Sabre Group, which is 
largely owned by American Airlines' parent company and has 40,000 
travel agencies using its reservations system. ``We had tested and 
re-tested for this day for months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Worldspan, an Atlanta-based system owned by Delta, Northwest  
Airlines and TransWorld Airlines, no Y2K-related glitches were 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one carrier still isn't booking flights for Jan. 1,  
though. Ed Stewart, Southwest Airlines' director of public 
relations, said Southwest always leaves a four- to six-month lead 
time on bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to depend on the people in reservations,'' he  
replied, when asked when it will start taking Jan. 1 bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	The computerized reservations systems used by major airlines and  
many car rental and other travel industry businesses display dates 
for sale only 331 days in advance. Thus, Thursday became the first 
day to book travel for next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	For efficiency, most computer software was designed to recognize  
years by just the final two digits rather than all four. For the 
year 2000, computer systems that have not been reprogrammed will 
interpret double zero to mean 1900 and many could stop functioning 
-- a syndrome dubbed ``the Y2K bug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The travel industry expects the period around New Year's Eve and  
Jan. 1, 2000, to be busy, with people heading to celebrations and 
other gatherings. Cruise packages have been particularly popular 
for millennium-related celebrations, travel agents say. 
</P>
<P>
	Lanelle Johnson of Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Atlanta said some  
cruises, particularly to the Caribbean, are already sold out. She 
added that travel agents are expecting to become increasingly busy 
as prices are set for fly-and-drive land vacation packages in the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	She and other travel agents say some people worried about a  
Y2K-caused catastrophe have asked whether it will be safe to 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have told them we don't expect there to be a problem,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oil Wants Saudi Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson headed  
Thursday for Saudi Arabia, where he hopes to advance talks on 
getting U.S. oil companies back into the kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said one priority of his three-day visit will be to  
boost the idea of American companies again becoming involved in 
Saudi Arabia's energy exploration and production. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my trip moves the process forward, it will be a successful  
trip,'' Richardson told reporters before departing. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing economic pressures because of low oil prices, the Saudi  
government last September began discussing with seven U.S. oil 
companies the possibility of renewed American involvement in the 
kingdom's oil and gas exploration and development. No U.S. company 
has been involved in such activities since the kingdom nationalized 
its oil industry in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson will be the first energy secretary to visit Saudi  
Arabia since 1990, a fact he has characterized as unusual since the 
kingdom has the world's largest oil reserves and is the No. 2 
exporter of oil to the United States. Venezuela exports the most 
oil to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary said he will discuss ``a broad range of bilateral  
interests'' with Saudi Petroleum Minister Ali al-Naimi. ``These 
discussions underscore the importance of the kingdom and our 
bilateral relationship to energy security and stability 
worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson met with al-Naimi and with Saudi Crown Prince  
Abdullah last September in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	During that visit, the crown prince quietly met with executives  
from seven major U.S. oil companies to explore ways the Americans 
might invest in the kingdom's oil industry. Industry experts expect 
these discussions to continue for a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saudi overture caught many in the U.S. oil industry by  
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia has been hit hard by the free fall of worldwide oil  
prices and the drop in demand from Asia because of that region's 
economic downturn. With declining oil revenues, the kingdom's 
budget was expected to report as much as a $15 billion deficit for 
1998, some analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Saudis for the first time are considering  
long-term capital investment by American oil companies in the 
kingdom's oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who met with Abdullah last September included senior  
executives from Mobil Corp., Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc., Chevron 
Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum 
Co.

<HEADLINE> Glimpse of Secret Depositions Given </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky told House prosecutors she met  
for breakfast with presidential confidant Vernon Jordan in late 
1997 because she wanted to ``cushion the shock'' for President 
Clinton in case their affair was exposed by a friend, according to 
testimony released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the Dec. 31, 1997 meeting, Jordan was helping the  
former White House intern find a job in New York. But Ms. Lewinsky 
testified she was less interested in the job search and more 
``hoping that I could give a little information and that would get 
passed on'' to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of that meeting was I had gotten to a point where  
Linda Tripp wasn't returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to 
devise some way ... to ... cushion the shock of what would happen 
if Linda Tripp testified all the facts about my relationship,'' Ms. 
Lewinsky was quoted in a brief excerpt of her testimony disclosed 
at the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakfast meeting at the Park Hyatt hotel in Washington,  
which occurred just three weeks before the affair was exposed, has 
long been of interest to prosecutors, in part because it occurred 
as Ms. Lewinsky was emerging as a potentially damaging witness in 
Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky testified that during the breakfast, she understood  
Jordan to be telling her to destroy notes she had written to the 
president. Jordan denies instructing her to do so but acknowledges 
he discussed the notes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Ms. Lewinsky had never told the president she had  
confided her relationship to Mrs. Tripp. She was unaware that Mrs. 
Tripp had tape recorded some of those conversations and would soon 
hand them over to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and discuss the 
affair with Mrs. Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The recollection by Ms. Lewinsky was included in a mere nine  
lines of her testimony that was made public Thursday, the day 
before the full transcript of her question-and-answer session was 
to be released. On Saturday, television viewers will get to see 
video snippets of that testimony played at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after the breakfast, Jordan denied to Starr's federal  
grand jury that he had ever had breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky. Jordan 
later changed his story to say he couldn't recall the breakfast 
meeting when prosecutors produced a restaurant receipt for it. 
</P>
<P>
	And a few pages of Jordan's testimony this week to House  
prosecutors that also was released Thursday showed he acknowledged 
he had indeed had the breakfast. He still insisted, however, that 
he never instructed Ms. Lewinsky to destroy drafts of notes she had 
written Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said in his new testimony that he was ``certain that Ms.  
Lewinsky talked to me about notes,'' but the excerpts released by 
the House didn't mention whether he told her to go find them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not deny, despite my testimony before the grand jury,  
that on (Dec. 31) I was there with Ms. Lewinsky, but I did testify 
before the grand jury that I did not remember having a breakfast 
with her on that date, and that was the truth,'' said Jordan.

	Senate: No Live Lewinsky Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today voted against summoning  
Monica Lewinsky for live testimony in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. With support from several Democrats, however, 
Senate Republicans approved the House prosecutors' request to show 
at the trial this weekend ``all or portions'' of the videotaped 
depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and 
White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. Republicans also shrank from 
a plan to declare the president guilty without ousting him from 
office.

	Serbs OK Talks; US May Send Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is considering  
sending U.S. ground troops to Kosovo as peacekeepers. Serbia's 
parliament voted to send a delegation to peace talks beginning 
Saturday in Paris. The Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for Kosovo 
to secede from Serbia, already had agreed to attend. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said the United States might send as many 
as 4,000 troops, but additional planning is required before the 
Pentagon can recommend the size of the force.

	U.S. Still Vulnerable to Terrorism  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite progress in combating terrorism, the  
United States remains vulnerable to bombing attacks, both at home 
and at its far-flung outposts, Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright and Attorney General Janet Reno told Congress today. Only 
about 10 percent of the planned work has been performed on 
upgrading U.S. embassies since last August's twin bombings in 
Africa, Albright told a Senate hearing on anti-terrorism. 

</P>
<P>
	Gun Makers Lobby Against Lawsuits  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Gun makers and the National Rifle Association are  
lobbying state officials to outlaw lawsuits seeking to recover the 
cost of gun-related violence. ``It may bankrupt us, but we are 
never going to settle,'' said Bob Baker, president of Freedom Arms 
Inc., which manufactures high-end revolvers in Freedom, Wyo. Five 
cities -- Chicago, New Orleans, Atlanta, Bridgeport, Conn., and the 
unified Miami-Dade County government in Florida -- have sued various 
gunmakers. Atlanta filed its suit today.

	Iraq Seeks To Improve Air Defenses  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein is seeking to  
improve Iraq's capacity to attack U.S. and British warplanes, the 
official media reported today, hours after the Pentagon said recent 
airstrikes were taking a heavy toll. Saddam met today with his 
military chiefs to discuss ``ways of developing air defense means 
in our country to confront the continuing American and British 
aggression,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported.

	Trial Begins in Italy Gondola Crash  
</P>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A court-martial began today for a  
Marine pilot whose jet clipped an Italian ski gondola cable, 
killing 20 people. Capt. Richard Ashby's trial on 20 counts of 
involuntary manslaughter began one day after the first anniversary 
of the tragedy that happened when the wing of his EA-6B Prowler 
sliced through cables supporting the Mount Cermis gondola in 
Cavalese, Italy.

	Cuba Repeats Threat To Cut Phones  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- The government today threatened to cut off all  
phone links with the United States if a Cuban-American group wins a 
lawsuit seeking to seize millions of dollars from Cuba's phone 
company. A suit brought by relatives of Cuban-Americans killed when 
Cuba shot down their private planes over the Florida Straits in 
1996 is seeking to garnish the wages U.S. phone companies have paid 
to their Cuban counterpart, ETECSA. The U.S. government is fighting 
against the lawsuit.

	States To Divide $5B Tobacco Trust  
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco states reached a tentative  
agreement today on dividing a $5.15 billion trust fund for farmers 
that would be financed by the major cigarette makers. North 
Carolina, the largest flue-cured tobacco state, and Kentucky, the 
biggest burley tobacco producer, would receive the biggest shares 
under the proposal -- 38.34 percent and 29.97 percent, respectively, 
sources said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended lower after a day of wide swings,  
as aggressive profit-taking in technology shares overwhelmed 
strength in industrial names. The Dow lost 62.31 to close at 
9,304.50. NYSE decliners led advancers 1,898-1,093. The Nasdaq 
ended down 83.34 at 2,410.07.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson once  
again faces jail time and the possible loss of his boxing license. 
Tyson goes to court tomorrow to be sentenced on two counts of 
second-degree assault stemming from an altercation following a 
minor traffic accident in August. The sentence will help determine 
whether Tyson will have to return to jail in Indiana for violating 
probation for a rape conviction.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Still Vulnerable to Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite progress in combating terrorism, the  
United States remains vulnerable to bombing attacks, both at home 
and at its far-flung outposts, Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright and Attorney General Janet Reno told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 10 percent of the planned work has been performed on  
upgrading U.S. embassies since last August's twin bombings in 
Africa, Albright told a Senate hearing on anti-terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think from our perspective we don't need any more  
legislative authority, but we do need ... money,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said there has been much progress in foiling would-be  
terrorist plots and in improving coordination among agencies. 
Still, she said, ``we're not going to be able to prevent them all. 
There is no way we can do that. And we have got to be prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general said that of particular concern was ``the  
threat of a cyberattack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just now in this past year, we have been able to see instances  
in which 17- and 18-year-old hackers can intrude into sensitive 
computers across this country. If they can do that, our 
cybersystem, our cyberinfrastructure, is at risk,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said that government agencies are working together ``with  
personnel and technology that can match the wits of the smartest 
criminals and the smartest terrorist.'' But she said states and the 
private sector need to do more to fight this new brand of 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said security at U.S. embassies around the world has  
been beefed up considerably since simultaneous bombings last Aug. 7 
at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people, 
including 12 Americans. She also said the administration's 
five-year plan for combating terrorism is progressing. 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, there is much to be done. ``Our strategy must be  
long-term. The five-year plan is only the beginning. Certainly no 
single arrest or shutdown of a terrorist operation will be 
sufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The advance of technology has given us new means to counter  
terrorists, but it has also enabled terrorists to develop more 
powerful weapons and to travel, communicate, recruit and raise 
funds on a global basis,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh testified before a  
Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the budgets of 
their agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the subcommittee chairman, said  
President Clinton's budget request for $300 million to upgrade 
embassy security next year falls about $700 million short of what 
he said an interagency study panel said was needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg said the president's entire anti-terrorism program, which  
also includes a request for $2.8 billion in new spending, appeared 
to be ``put together on the back of an envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Albright defended the program. ``I think we are at the  
beginning stages. ... We're working very hard and I think we all 
need to work together on this,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh told the panel that during fiscal 1998, which ended last  
Sept. 30, the FBI had ``prevented 10 planned terrorist acts'' 
through its investigations, nine of which he said were planned by 
an Illinois-based white supremacist group that plotted to bomb 
buildings across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	On the related subject of nuclear terrorism, a bipartisan group  
of 58 House members announced on Thursday they were reintroducing 
legislation to make it ``official policy'' of the United States to 
deploy a national missile defense to protect against incoming 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has its own missile defense program and put  
money for it in the budget Clinton submitted last week. But that 
provides for a decision by mid-2000 on whether to go ahead with 
such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	``A commitment to deploy is essential,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon,  
R-Pa., the principal sponsor. He said moving forward with such a 
system -- and not delaying a decision -- would send a message to 
``rogue nations'' like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Weldon and others introduced a similar bill last year. It never  
was enacted, although a spending bill passed in mid-October and 
signed by Clinton earmarked roughly $1 billion in additional funds 
for development of a national missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Armed Services Committee debated its version of  
measure on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Millrose 60 Meters a Test Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sprinters Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines will  
be part of an experiment tonight that could become popular in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of competing in a customary 60-meter final with six  
invited runners in the field, they will run in two heats, with the 
winners meeting in a match-race final at the Millrose Games in 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be great for track and field,'' said Gaines, ranked  
No. 4 in the world at 100 meters. ``It should help bring track and 
field back in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, ranked No. 3 in the world in the 100 and expected to  
reach the final with Gaines, said, ``If we can continue on this 
track for the next couple of years, we will see a resurgence of 
track and field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller will be in the first heat, along with Cheryl Taplin and  
Beverly McDonald of Jamaica. Gaines will go in the second heat with 
Savetheda Fynes of the Bahamas and Aspen Burkett. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will come back about 45 minutes later for the final.  
</P>
<P>
	The final will resemble the ballyhooed 150-meter match race  
between Michael Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200- and 400-meter gold 
medalist, and Canada's Donovan Bailey, the Atlanta Games' 100-meter 
champion. That 1997 event at Toronto's SkyDome turned into a bust 
when Johnson pulled up lame halfway through the race, but the 
novelty created a huge wave of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	For Miller, a possible match race would not only be a new  
experience, but so will competing indoors. She also will be making 
her debut under John Smith, her coach since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who also coaches three of the world's top five men's  
sprinters -- No. 1 Maurice Greene, No. 2 Ato Boldon of Trindad &AMP; 
Tobago and No. 5 Jon Drummond -- along with many other world-class 
performers, and has coached several Olympic gold medalists, 
replaced Miller's father, as her coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennox Miller won the Millrose 60-yard dash in 1968 and 1969,  
and if his daughter wins tonight, they would be the first 
father-daughter champions in the meet's 92-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Inger Miller said her coaching switch was not over any major  
differences with her father, but she just wanted a change. 
</P>
<P>
	The major differences, she said, were that ``I never trained for  
indoors ... and I wanted to train with the best sprinters in the 
world. I went from training with no one to training with about 15 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For my esteem and my mental strength, it does wonders,'' she  
added. ``It helps to have their encouragement. It makes it fun. 
They've helped me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaines, the runner-up to Carlette Guidry at last year's Chase  
Millrose Games, also trains with men, but none is world-class. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world indoor record-holder for the men's 60 at 6.39  
seconds and the meet record-holder at 6.46, set last year, and 
Drummond, who top the men's sprint, are jealous they won't be 
competing in a match race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want that, too,'' Greene said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let us in,'' Drummond said, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the sprints, the meet -- the first of the newly  
formed Golden Spike television series -- will feature other key 
matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the men, there will be Mark Crear and Reggie Torian in the  
60 hurdles, Mark Everett and Tyree Washington in the 500, Johnny 
Gray and Rich Kenah in the 800, and Jeff Hartwig and Lawrence 
Johnson in the pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's matchups include Melissa Morrison and Angie Vaughn  
in the 60 hurdles, Joetta Clark and Meredith Valmon in the 800, 
Suzy Hamilton and Regina Jacobs in the mile, and Tisha Waller and 
Amy Acuff in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Track and field in the United States is starting its way  
back,'' Craig Masback, executive director of USA Track &AMP; Field, 
said. ``Perhaps it's a long road, but it's on its way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The head-to-head competition will be the core events. We are  
doubling the number of meets and TV coverage over last year. This 
is the dawn of track's new age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TV series also will include the Los Angeles Invitational on  
Feb. 13, the D.C. Invitational on Feb. 19 at Fairfax, Va., and the 
USA Championships Feb. 26-27 at Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Karl Brings Deep Rotation to Bucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- When George Karl arrived in Milwaukee,  
his first order of business was to upgrade the Bucks' bench. 
</P>
<P>
	A deep rotation became even more essential when the lockout  
compressed the 1999 season into 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Karl never figured he'd get this much help.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you said we could get Dell Curry and Vinny Del Negro, that  
would probably have been above our expectations,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, 34, a 12-year NBA veteran who averaged 9.4 points for the  
Charlotte Hornets last season, showed his worth immediately after 
signing a one-year, $1 million contract by scoring 21 points in 26 
minutes of an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you need to prove something every year you're in the  
league, that you can still play and contribute to your team,'' 
Curry said. ``Coming here to Milwaukee has really rejuvenated me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Del Negro, 32, the ninth-year veteran who left the San Antonio  
Spurs as a free agent during the lockout to play in Europe, signed 
a four-year deal to back up Ray Allen at shooting guard and Terrell 
Brandon at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry and Del Negro, who averaged 10.4 points last year for the  
Spurs, will team with Michael Curry, Armen Gilliam and rookie 
Robert Traylor to provide a solid second unit. 
</P>
<P>
	That should save minutes for starters Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson,  
Tyrone Hill, Terrell Brandon and Ervin Johnson as the Bucks try to 
end their seven-year playoff absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Traylor's a player. I think Armen can win games for  
you and then you've got three guards in Vinny and Dell and 
Michael,'' Karl said. ``That's pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will no longer be a concession, as it was under former  
coaches Mike Dunleavy and Chris Ford, when the Bucks starters take 
a breather. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've got a low block presence, you've got a  
defender, you've got a shooter, you've got a good decision-maker, 
you've got a rookie that's going to play with enthusiasm,'' Karl 
said. ``There's a lot of things out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And an upgraded bench means a livelier starting lineup, Allen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so important. Because last year I had guys backing me  
up who were hesitant on shooting and scoring,'' Allen said. ``Dell 
and Vinny, they come in to score. ... I think they continue the 
fluidity of our offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Karl instituting the same trapping defense he employed in  
Seattle, the Bucks starters will feel blessed for the breaks on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said in his first two years in the league, he hated to  
come out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You felt like when you went to the bench, you were sitting  
soft. You go to sit on the sideline and you know you're not going 
to put on your shooting shirt because you're going to go right back 
into the game,'' Allen said. ``Coach wants you to rest, but at the 
same time you can't let your whole offense self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, now we have a better sense of reliance in the guys coming  
off the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, who took the SuperSonics to the playoffs seven straight  
seasons before being fired for his playoff failures, said the 
improved bench will be essential in the short season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the more people you win games with the better you're  
going to be,'' he said. ``I think giving guys opportunities, it's 
the kind of way I think this team should go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if I was coaching in Seattle, I don't know if I'd go that  
way,'' Karl added. ``We won a lot of games just by being smart and 
old and slow and sloppy. But we knew how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And until the Bucks do, they'll have to rely on more players as  
they scale the slippery slope to the NBA's upper echelon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think the older teams have the advantage more than the  
deep teams,'' Karl said. ``I've always felt the older guys kind of 
know how to win those games when they're tired and ugly. They kind 
of they have a subconscious nature to them of figuring out how hard 
they have to play, what level of intensity they have to get to, 
what demands of the fundamentals they have to give the game to be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think sometimes taking this energy and these fresh legs  
and this depth is a little overrated than just a sense of how to 
win basketball games,'' he added. ``I think personally the 
old-timer who knows how to win basketball games is a lot more 
valuable than the young, ambitious, energetic athlete who has no 
idea how to win basketball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's where Curry and Del Negro come in.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Olympic Champ Smirnov Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YONGPYONG, South Korea (AP) -- Former Olympic and world champion  
cross-country skier Vladimir Smirnov retired Thursday after being 
beaten by fellow Kazak Andrey Nevzorov in the men's 30-kilometer 
race at the Asian Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had many good moments. I have no regrets,'' said  
Smirnov, who won the 50-kilometer gold at the 1994 Winter Olympics 
at Lillehammer and three golds at the 1995 World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, who also won the bronze in the 30-kilometer classic  
event at last year's Olympics at Nagano, had said he was retiring 
before but had continued to compete. He is 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov on Sunday won the men's 15-kilometer race. He took  
another gold in the 40-kilometer relay race with three other Kazaks 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov plans to settle down in Sweden, where his family has  
been living for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	China dominated the games' action on the ice Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Song Li took the gold medal in the women's 1,500-meter  
speedskating with a clocking of 2 minutes, 8.66 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Chengjiang won the men's figure skating competition.  
</P>
<P>
	And the Chinese women's hockey team won the gold medal with a  
10-2 victory over Kazakstan to finish with a 3-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
	After five days of competition, China has collected 12 gold  
medals, two more than South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Economic Data Signal Strong Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The strongest surge in factory orders in more  
than a year, an unexpected dip in applications for unemployment 
benefits and big sales gains at America's retailers all show the 
economy is starting 1999 with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
	During the final three months of 1998, the economy grew at a  
robust 5.6 percent pace, the strongest in 2 1/2 years, and it looks as 
if the momentum carried over into the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders to U.S. factories jumped 2.3 percent in December, the  
biggest increase in 13 months, the Commerce Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the number of Americans filing first-time  
applications for unemployment benefits fell by 9,000 to a six-week 
low of 292,000 last week, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	And major retail chains reported in New York that January proved  
to be a better-than-expected month as shoppers snatched up 
discounted merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have everything they need to justify spending with  
gusto and they are devouring everything in sight,'' said economist 
Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ``They have jobs, 
income and confidence. What more do they need?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a two-day private meeting that ended on Wednesday, Federal  
Reserve policy-makers decided to leave short-term interest rates 
unchanged despite signs of economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes released Thursday of an earlier meeting, Dec. 22,  
revealed that policy-makers thought the outlook for 1999 was 
``subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty in both 
directions.'' But the minutes said that if they determined the 
economy was running too fast, they had ``time to react to potential 
inflationary pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, many economists, including Sohn, worry the economy is  
overheating, developing imbalances that include an overvalued stock 
market and labor shortages. On Thursday, the Dow Jones average of 
industrial stocks fell 62 points to 9,304.50. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's economic advisers, in their annual report,  
predicted the economy's longest peacetime expansion will continue 
through the year. But the Council of Economic Advisers said growth 
will slow to 2.4 percent in 1999, down from 3.9 percent in 1998, as 
recessions in one-third of the world push the U.S. trade deficit 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing has been among the U.S. sectors hardest hit by the  
world slump, but if the December report is an indication, it is 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, manufacturing was not in recession in the last  
quarter and certainly is not now,'' said economist Jerry 
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
``This strength is clearly visible in the orders numbers, which 
have increased in six of the last seven months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the impact of the global slump was clearly visible in  
orders for all of 1998, which rose just 2.1 percent to $4.03 
trillion. That compared with a healthy 5.4 percent gain in 1997 and 
was the weakest year since orders posted a 2.3 percent decline 
during the recession year of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakness was particularly pronounced at U.S. blast furnaces  
and steel mills, which are competing with cheap steel imported from 
Russia, Brazil and Korea. Their orders fell 12.5 percent, the 
biggest decline in at least 15 years. And the increase for aircraft 
was anemic, 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, however, orders for computers and office  
equipment surged 19.4 percent, the biggest gain in 14 years. Orders 
for communications equipment jumped 12.1 percent. And they jumped 
6.9 percent for stone, clay and glass products, reflecting a 
building boom spurred by low interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Pols Urge IOC To Be More Democratic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
invited politicians to dinner and found them less than gracious. 
Now the IOC can't get rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
	After dominating the talks at the world drug summit for three  
days, government representatives told the IOC they won't be able to 
control their pet project -- a new international doping agency -- 
despite coughing up $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they demanded a bigger role for themselves and opened  
the prospect of months of divisive negotiations before the agency 
is ever launched. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, one politician after another told the IOC to  
open its books and become more democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 European Union nations also refused to endorse a  
toned-down antidoping declaration the IOC prepared. It was accepted 
by acclamation from most of the 600 delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the IOC has found now is that once you open the door to  
government involvement, you cannot exclude them,'' British Sports 
Minister Tony Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC and governments will have to find an acceptable  
compromise on who will lead the new international doping agency. 
The next meeting must happen ``within the next three months,'' the 
conference decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The governments want to keep the IOC as far away as possible  
from a leadership role, though IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
refused to rule himself out to lead the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the encroaching inevitability of increasing  
government involvement, the IOC wants the politicians to at least 
buy themselves a place at the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governments must be prepared to put their money and  
efforts where their mouths are,'' IOC vice president Dick Pound 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to entertain a situation where they come and  
tell us how we spend our money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks said the IOC will have to start showing much more  
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has to realize that once they start on the process of  
democratization, you cannot decide to stop it,'' he said. ``We are 
here as partners, and if we are here as critics, it is because we 
are friendly critics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch criticized U.S. antidrug chief Barry McCaffrey,  
suggesting the White House was in no position to lecture the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very thankful he is so interested in the IOC,''  
Samaranch said. ``But we also told him he had many problems in his 
own country on doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don Porter, president of the international softball federation,  
said the governments are way out of line. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're off base if they talk about cleaning house. They need  
to look at their own house,'' he said. ``They are trying to 
intimidate the conference, the federations and the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banks said the politicians were only here to reflect public  
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``I strongly reject accusations of grandstanding,'' he said.  
``What did they expect? We would just sit politely and say 
nothing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz pleaded  
for time for the Olympic family to adapt to the new reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the IOC's first experiences with democracy, and  
they had to learn how to deal with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Banks warned the days that the sporting bodies could set  
their own rules were over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only governments should legislate,'' he said. ``The IOC cannot  
legislate.''

<HEADLINE> Monica:'Mixed Feelings' for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky told House prosecutors she  
still has ``mixed feelings'' for President Clinton and continues to 
admire him. She insisted he did not encourage her to lie when he 
informed her in a late-night call that she might become a witness 
in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony slated to be made public Friday and obtained by The  
Associated Press late Thursday, Ms. Lewinsky also cast doubt on 
Clinton's sworn testimony that he told her she might have to turn 
over gifts he gave her if they were subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did the president ever tell you to turn over the gifts,'' Rep.  
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., asked during a deposition videotaped Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that I remember,'' Ms. Lewinsky answered.  
</P>
<P>
	In one point in the deposition, Bryant asked the former White  
House intern ``do you still have feelings for the president'' a 
year after she was thrust unwillingly into the impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings,'' she replied. When pressed to describe  
those feelings, she said: ``I think what you need to know is my 
grand jury testimony is truthful, irrespective of whatever those 
mixed feelings are in my testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She answered ``yes'' twice when asked if she still admired the  
president and appreciated ``what he is doing for this country as 
the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also described in details the call she got after 2 a.m. on  
Dec. 17, 1997, in which the president informed her that she was on 
the witness list in the Jones lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it broke his heart ... that my name was on the witness  
list,'' Ms. Lewinsky said. She then paused, and asked ``Can I take 
a break please. I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the questioning resumed, Ms. Lewinsky was asked what her  
reaction was to learning she might be called as a witness in the 
politically charged Jones sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared,'' she responded.  
</P>
<P>
	She testified again that in that call, Clinton suggested she  
could file an affidavit to avoid being deposed. But when asked 
whether the president suggested what she might say in the 
affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky responded, ``There was no discussion of 
what would be in an affidavit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I necessarily thought at that point it would  
have to be false,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky testified that Clinton at one point in the  
conversation reminded her of the cover stories they had devised 
earlier to hide their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that the president said something like, ``You can  
always say you were coming to see (Oval Office secretary) Betty 
(Currie) or bringing me papers,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, was that in connection with the affidavit?'' Bryant  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe so, no,'' she said, striking down a theory  
prosecutors have held that the cover stories had been suggested to 
her to encourage her to file a false affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky also told the prosecutors that she met for  
breakfast with presidential confidant Vernon Jordan on Dec. 31, 
1997 because she wanted to ``cushion the shock'' for Clinton in 
case their affair was exposed by her friend, Linda Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Jordan was helping Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New  
York. But she testified she was less interested in the job search 
and more ``hoping that I could give a little information and that 
would get passed on'' to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point of that meeting was I had gotten to a point where  
Linda Tripp wasn't returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to 
devise some way ... to ... cushion the shock of what would happen 
if Linda Tripp testified all the facts about my relationship,'' Ms. 
Lewinsky was quoted in a brief excerpt of her testimony disclosed 
at the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakfast meeting at the Park Hyatt hotel in Washington,  
which occurred just three weeks before the affair was exposed, has 
long been of interest to prosecutors, in part because it occurred 
as Ms. Lewinsky was emerging as a potentially damaging witness in 
Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky testified that during the breakfast, she understood  
Jordan to be telling her to destroy notes she had written to the 
president. Jordan denies instructing her to do so but acknowledges 
he discussed the notes. 
</P>

	At the time, Ms. Lewinsky had never told the president she had  
confided her relationship to Mrs. Tripp. She was unaware that Mrs. 
Tripp had tape recorded some of those conversations and would soon 
hand them over to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and discuss the 
affair with Mrs. Jones' lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Karl Brings Deep Rotation to Bucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- When George Karl arrived in Milwaukee,  
his first order of business was to upgrade the Bucks' bench. 
</P>
<P>
	A deep rotation became even more essential when the lockout  
compressed the 1999 season into 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Karl never figured he'd get this much help.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you said we could get Dell Curry and Vinny Del Negro, that  
would probably have been above our expectations,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, 34, a 12-year NBA veteran who averaged 9.4 points for the  
Charlotte Hornets last season, showed his worth immediately after 
signing a one-year, $1 million contract by scoring 21 points in 26 
minutes of an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you need to prove something every year you're in the  
league, that you can still play and contribute to your team,'' 
Curry said. ``Coming here to Milwaukee has really rejuvenated me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Del Negro, 32, the ninth-year veteran who left the San Antonio  
Spurs as a free agent during the lockout to play in Europe, signed 
a four-year deal to back up Ray Allen at shooting guard and Terrell 
Brandon at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry and Del Negro, who averaged 10.4 points last year for the  
Spurs, will team with Michael Curry, Armen Gilliam and rookie 
Robert Traylor to provide a solid second unit. 
</P>
<P>
	That should save minutes for starters Ray Allen, Glenn Robinson,  
Tyrone Hill, Terrell Brandon and Ervin Johnson as the Bucks try to 
end their seven-year playoff absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Traylor's a player. I think Armen can win games for  
you and then you've got three guards in Vinny and Dell and 
Michael,'' Karl said. ``That's pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will no longer be a concession, as it was under former  
coaches Mike Dunleavy and Chris Ford, when the Bucks starters take 
a breather. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you've got a low block presence, you've got a  
defender, you've got a shooter, you've got a good decision-maker, 
you've got a rookie that's going to play with enthusiasm,'' Karl 
said. ``There's a lot of things out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And an upgraded bench means a livelier starting lineup, Allen  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so important. Because last year I had guys backing me  
up who were hesitant on shooting and scoring,'' Allen said. ``Dell 
and Vinny, they come in to score. ... I think they continue the 
fluidity of our offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Karl instituting the same trapping defense he employed in  
Seattle, the Bucks starters will feel blessed for the breaks on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said in his first two years in the league, he hated to  
come out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You felt like when you went to the bench, you were sitting  
soft. You go to sit on the sideline and you know you're not going 
to put on your shooting shirt because you're going to go right back 
into the game,'' Allen said. ``Coach wants you to rest, but at the 
same time you can't let your whole offense self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, now we have a better sense of reliance in the guys coming  
off the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl, who took the SuperSonics to the playoffs seven straight  
seasons before being fired for his playoff failures, said the 
improved bench will be essential in the short season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the more people you win games with the better you're  
going to be,'' he said. ``I think giving guys opportunities, it's 
the kind of way I think this team should go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if I was coaching in Seattle, I don't know if I'd go that  
way,'' Karl added. ``We won a lot of games just by being smart and 
old and slow and sloppy. But we knew how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And until the Bucks do, they'll have to rely on more players as  
they scale the slippery slope to the NBA's upper echelon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think the older teams have the advantage more than the  
deep teams,'' Karl said. ``I've always felt the older guys kind of 
know how to win those games when they're tired and ugly. They kind 
of they have a subconscious nature to them of figuring out how hard 
they have to play, what level of intensity they have to get to, 
what demands of the fundamentals they have to give the game to be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I think sometimes taking this energy and these fresh legs  
and this depth is a little overrated than just a sense of how to 
win basketball games,'' he added. ``I think personally the 
old-timer who knows how to win basketball games is a lot more 
valuable than the young, ambitious, energetic athlete who has no 
idea how to win basketball games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's where Curry and Del Negro come in.

<HEADLINE> Shaky Philippine Cease-Fire Holding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- After two weeks of sporadic clashes  
that threatened to escalate into all-out war, Philippine officials 
and Muslim rebels say a shaky cease-fire is holding and they hope 
to find a peaceful end to nearly 30 years of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were holding a second day of informal talks today  
in southern Cotabato city on how to buttress the temporary 
cease-fire and avoid a repeat of the recent clashes. The 
discussions will set the stage for talks next week on an agenda for 
formal peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Soriano, a former army general who is the government's  
chief negotiator, said the skirmishes will not impede the 
preliminary peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The road to peace is long and winding and difficult,'' he  
said. ``I am still very optimistic that sooner or later we will be 
able to attain a peace agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Haj Murad, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation  
Front, said the rebels believe Muslim self-rule in the southern 
Philippines can be achieved without violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that if there is a way to solve this by peaceful  
means, we have to solve this now because it has been almost 30 
years,'' he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The MILF is the larger of two groups fighting for a separate  
Islamic state in the southern Philippines. It broke away from the 
Moro National Liberation Front in 1978 after that group shifted its 
goal to autonomy from complete independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The southern region that the rebels want for their own country  
was once primarily Muslim, but large numbers of Christians from 
other parts of the Philippines migrated there during this century 
and now control many aspects of political and economic life. Many 
Muslims hope to be able to preserve their own religious and 
cultural traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Calm in the southern Philippines is a crucial part of the  
government's efforts to woo back investment after the Asian 
financial crisis. It also would allow development projects to 
proceed in Mindanao, home to most of the nation's Muslim minority 
and one of its poorest areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Aguirre, President Joseph Estrada's national security  
adviser, said he believes the MILF demands can be satisfied through 
``creative'' negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government can give them substantial autonomy that will be  
allowed by the constitution so that their own way of life through 
Islam can be pursued,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have accused the other of starting the recent  
clashes. The military claims it responded to rebel ``harassment'' 
of government outposts in Maguindanao province, while the MILF says 
their camps were attacked by army troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The military's Southern Command said 10 soldiers were killed and  
15 were wounded in the clashes. The rebels claims nine of its 
fighters died and eight were wounded. More than 107,000 people were 
driven from their homes, the regional Muslim autonomous government 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada said he will exhaust all peaceful means to resolve the  
conflict, but insisted that the government will refuse to negotiate 
over sovereignty and territorial integrity and will respond to 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want peace, we will give them peace. If they want war,  
we will give them war,'' he said last week. ``If they don't fire we 
will not fire. But if they fire once, we will fire 10 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Eliseo Mercado, a Catholic priest who leads a  
cease-fire monitoring committee, said the talks this week are 
providing hope. The two sides discussed violations ``without 
pointing fingers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is good is there is no antagonism. They listened to and  
respect each other,'' he said. ``The confidence was broken but now 
the trust is coming back, so that's good.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Recreates Part of Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. worked into the morning hours  
Thursday to recreate parts of a video demonstration for its 
antitrust trial that was challenged by the government, but the 
company said it couldn't duplicate one important test in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the overall results vindicated its claims that  
government efforts to disable Internet functions within its Windows 
software cause serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally ``tied'' its  
Internet browser software into Windows, which forced consumers who 
use its dominant computer operating system also to use its browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft began showing its new 70-minute video, which was  
recorded under the scrutiny of government lawyers and computer 
experts, in early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The company acknowledged, however, that it was unable to  
duplicate one segment that purported to show the government's 
tinkering caused its Internet software to run dramatically slower. 
</P>
<P>
	On the original video, a Microsoft employee said: ``It's taking  
a very long time, however -- unusually long -- to access that Web 
site. That's a result of the performance degradation that has 
occurred because of running the (government) program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Directly disputing that, Justice Department lawyer David Boies  
showed that the title bar of the Internet software suggested 
Microsoft's test actually used a version of Windows unaffected by 
the government's modifications. ``When the string, as you put it, 
that labeled the machine as a (government) machine was there 
earlier, it popped right up, and you didn't have this delay,'' 
Justice Department lawyer David Boies asked the company's witness. 
``Right? Remember?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it couldn't guarantee in its tests overnight that  
two identical IBM laptop computers achieved comparable connection 
rates to the Internet, ensuring a fair demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Mark Murray said Thursday that the new video  
``resolves once and for all any questions about the reliability of 
our evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had criticized  
Microsoft's earlier demonstration as unreliable after Boies pointed 
out inconsistencies in some segments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge also told lawyers in a private meeting that he  
didn't believe Microsoft's witness, senior vice president James 
Allchin, had deliberately falsified the tests, according to a 
transcript obtained Thursday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that he deliberately falsified this, but it  
does cast doubt on reliability of that exhibit altogether,'' the 
judge said in Wednesday's meeting at the close of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Steven Holley promised, ``I'm confident and  
represent to the court as an officer of the court that we did 
nothing to these demonstrations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think he did,'' the judge replied. But he added that  
Boies ``has done a very professional job of discrediting those 
tapes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one segment of the original video, nine icons were visible in  
the background on the test computer's screen; in another, one icon 
was missing. Later, it reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft initially explained that the title bar had changed --  
but nothing else -- when an engineer removed online software from 
Prodigy Communications Corp. prior to taping its demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with the further discrepancies, Allchin explained  
that Microsoft had edited together video segments of several 
different computers with different software packages so it appeared 
a single computer was being tested.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Trial Starts in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot whose jet clipped a ski  
gondola cable and killed 20 people in Italy last year cannot be 
forced to testify about a missing videotape shot before the 
accident, a judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The setback for prosecutors came before lawyers began  
questioning potential jurors to hear the case of Capt. Richard 
Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, also ruled prosecutors cannot  
see unpublished notes and tapes about the case belonging to CBS' 
``60 Minutes'' and Rolling Stone magazine. A ``60 Minutes'' program 
on the cable car tragedy was telecast Jan. 24; the Rolling Stone 
story was published in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen Marine officers -- all of equal or superior rank to Ashby  
-- were summoned as possible jurors at the court-martial. The 
selection process is expected to continue Friday. Opening arguments 
are planned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	An EA-6B Prowler radar-jamming jet flown by Ashby severed the  
Mount Cermis gondola cable in the Italian Alps on Feb. 3, 1998. The 
jet was supposed to be at a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet when it 
hit the cable, suspended 370 feet above the valley. 
</P>
<P>
	During a motions hearing before jury selection, Nunley said the  
case against Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, was weak 
and he would be inclined to dismiss it. Because he isn't the 
presiding judge in that case, however, Nunley refused a defense 
motion to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
	The court-martial of Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., begins  
March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter and  
faces a maximum sentence of more than 200 years. He also is charged 
with obstruction of justice for allegedly destroying the tape. He 
will be tried separately on that charge. Schweitzer faces the same 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Both formally entered innocent pleas Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Nunley said if Ashby decides to testify, forcing him to talk  
about what happened to the missing videotape would violate his 
constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby had brought his personal video camera on the flight, and  
he gave it to Schweitzer to use, the judge said. A week after the 
flight, another member of the jet's four-man crew was told the tape 
had been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Online Brokerage Has Line Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Online investors were unable to buy or sell  
stocks through ETrade for a second straight session today, as a 
software problem continued to plague the Internet brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who signed on hoping to place trades were met with a  
message that read, ``Access to some areas of your account may be 
temporarily unavailable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trading function was unavailable for 75 minutes Wednesday  
morning, and about 5 percent of ETrade's customers were unable to 
trade electronically throughout the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the problem again affected the entire trading function  
for about an hour, beginning at around 10 a.m. EST. By 11 a.m., 
service was restored to about 75 percent of customers, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers at the Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm took telephone  
orders, but a swarm of jilted online traders jammed the lines, 
traders and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem resulted from a change in the software used to  
process trades. The company has refused to specify the problem, but 
a spokeswomen late Wednesday said it had been identifed and fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	When the system was still down Thursday morning, enraged  
investors immediately turned to Internet chat rooms to disparage 
ETrade. Dubbing the brokerage EtrytoTrade or ETrash, many 
threatened to move their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: Is it possible to actually ever access  
anything long enough to close an account?'' wrote one trader. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Crisci, an ETrade customer who trades over the Internet  
several times a week, said he is frustrated enough to look into 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge violation of a trust,'' he said. Crisci said  
Wednesday's outage prevented him from canceling an order to buy 
stock, resulting in an unspecified loss. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear how many people have been affected by the outage.  
ETrade is one of the largest of the increasingly popular online 
brokerages, processing an average of 40,000 trades per day in the 
final three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first online brokerage to falter.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are growing pains throughout the entire industry,'' said  
Julio Gomez, founder of Gomez Advisors, a Cambridge, Mass., 
research firm that focuses on electronic commerce. ``Since 
Thanksgiving, all the big firms have been pushing the outer limits 
of their capacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increased volume has been fueled in part by the rise of  
Internet stocks, which have soared in recent months. Day traders, 
who try to reap profits from short-term swings in stock prices, 
have also embraced the online brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
	Online investors often complain about sluggish connections or  
delayed trades during busy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said ETrade's troubles mirrored the old woes of America  
Online, which experienced persistent delays and outages in 1997 as 
millions of new Internet users signed onto its service. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending heavily to upgrade its systems, AOL continued to  
thrive. It currently has 15 million customers, plus 2 million 
through its subsidiary CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
	``AOL was unmercifully castigated for its problems,'' said Phil  
Leigh, an Internet analyst with Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St. 
Petersburg, Fla. ``But it came out much stronger. So will the 
Internet brokerages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the burgeoning industry, ETrade currently ranks third in  
volume behind Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and Waterhouse Securities, and 
third in accounts behind Schwab and Fidelity Investments, Gomez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade handled 2.8 million total transactions in its most recent  
fiscal quarter, up from 1.6 million in the same period of 1997. The 
company has wooed investors by offering a wide range of financial 
information on its site, including free real-time stock quotes for 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that while regular upgrades are necessary in the  
highly competitive market, the Internet brokerages must be careful 
to ensure good service. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time goes by, customers will grow fed up with delays,''  
Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday, shares of ETrade fell $3, or about 5 percent. This  
morning, however, the shares recovered a bit, rising 37 1/2 cents to 
$55.62 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade has set up a special e-mail address for investors who  
want to ask questions or lodge complaints: service2(at)etrade.com.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today following  
comments by a U.S. Treasury official urging Japan to exert monetary 
policy to ease upward pressure on interest rates. Japanese stocks 
fell for the fourth consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 74.46 points,  
or 0.53 percent, closing at 14,086.85. The average has now fallen a 
total of 412.40 points in four days, including Wednesday's 
188.52-point fall of 1.31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 113.78 yen, up 1.40 yen  
from late in Tokyo on Wednesday and also above its late New York 
level of 112.87 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged during the day from 112.85 yen to 113.98 yen.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency moved higher on dollar-buying by U.S. funds  
after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said overnight that the 
U.S. government's strong-dollar policy has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the American currency were comments by a senior  
Japanese monetary official who voiced caution concerning the yen's 
recent appreciation against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yen had strengthened a bit too quickly recently,''  
Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the Finance Ministry's International 
Bureau, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kuroda added he did not believe the yen would rise further.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.52 yen, up from  
127.32 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also said Wednesday that Japanese officials should focus  
on monetary policy to stem a rise in interest rates. Traders said 
that encouraged hopes that the steady fall in Japanese bond prices 
seen since late last year may be nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on Japanese government bonds have surged recently on  
nervousness over the government's plans to finance its economic 
stimulus measures by boosting the bond supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 2.170 percent from Wednesday's finish of 2.335 
percent, its highest level since July 1997. Its price rose to 97.12 
yen from 95.88 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, stocks started moderately higher following  
an overnight rise on Wall Street. But prices fell later amid 
renewed concern over Japanese corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 6.38 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,090.77. 
The TOPIX closed down 16.58 points, or 1.49 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was about 337 million  
shares, up from Wednesday's 303 million shares. Declines 
outnumbered advances 640 to 480, with 165 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also reacted negatively to Wednesday's comments by  
Ichiro Ozawa, who heads the Liberal Party, a coalition government 
partner with the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozawa opposes a proposed scheme that would set up a body to  
absorb shares sold as companies unwind their cross-shareholdings. 
Groups of Japanese companies have long held shares among each 
other, but many are now trying to sell such shares.

<HEADLINE>  Robinson Says He's Gotten Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Eugene Robinson, who in less than 24 hours was  
charged with soliciting sex from an undercover officer and burned 
on the biggest play in Atlanta's Super Bowl loss to Denver, is 
touched by the support he's getting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very encouraged by the support I've received. My  
teammates and my friends, everybody has been very supportive,'' 
Robinson said after Wednesday's Pro Bowl practice. 
</P>
<P>
	His Falcons teammates at the Pro Bowl said their respect for  
Robinson hasn't diminished. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've ever been around Eugene for 15 minutes, you'd  
realize what a great person he is,'' running back Jamal Anderson 
said. ``We still think about him, respect him, the same way we 
always have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jessie Tuggle went to Robinson's room to speak with  
him Saturday night after he heard of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with him, looked him in the eyes and told him, `I  
still believe in you. You've got to go on like it never happened.' 
We talked about everything we had done to get where we were (in the 
Super Bowl), and what we had to do in the game,''' Tuggle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He does worry that the incident might cost Robinson eventually.  
</P>
<P>
	``It may hurt his career at some time in the future,'' Tuggle  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Tuggle and Anderson said they don't believe any  
distractions caused by Robinson's arrest played a part in the 
Falcons' 34-19 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went into the game absolutely the same as we would have  
anyway,'' Tuggle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Anderson: ``I'd love to be able to use that as an excuse,  
but it sure didn't affect anything in terms of my running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was some speculation that Robinson might pass up the Pro  
Bowl because of his public troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, there he was wading into a group of autograph  
seekers, chatting and signing caps, footballs and assorted items 
thrust at him. 
</P>
<P>
	A little later, he yelled, ``Good try, Brandon, atta boy,'' as  
his son futilely tried to chase down an older boy running with the 
ball on the Pro Bowl practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson's wife, Gia, their 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, and  
Brandon are with him in Hawaii for Sunday's all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how everything is going with his family, Robinson replied,  
``It's good. I think everything is going very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson obviously is trying to get on with his life.  
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I don't intend to do is cower and hide,'' the  
Falcons' safety said. ``That's not my personality. God made me a 
person who really likes and cares about people. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, on the advice of his attorney, he would not answer  
questions about his arrest last Saturday night for allegedly 
offering an undercover police officer $40 for oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
	After the mostly sleepless night that followed, he started for  
the Falcons on Sunday and let the Broncos' Rod Smith get behind him 
for an 80-yard TD reception. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrest around 9 p.m. EST Saturday came just 12 hours after  
Robinson, nicknamed ``The Prophet'' for his religious beliefs, 
received the 1999 Bart Starr Award from the Christian group 
Athletes In Action, annually honoring an athlete of high moral 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson declared his innocence after the arrest, but he still  
apologized publicly on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 35, is expected to be arraigned on the misdemeanor  
count within the next 30 days. He could have charges dropped 
through a diversion program commonly offered in such cases. If he 
is not offered pretrial intervention, Robinson could face a maximum 
penalty of about 60 days if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame To Consider Its Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	College football's biggest dog wags its tail Friday, in London  
of all places. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Notre Dame's Board of Trustees will meet to decide  
whether the school should pursue membership in the Big Ten 
Conference -- academic, as well as athletic -- or continue going it 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone but the Irish were taking this vote, the matter would  
be worth a few paragraphs on a sports page or and an article in an 
education journal. 
</P>
<P>
	But let these trustees make the wrong call on this one, let them  
take away Notre Dame's independence and the last little bit of 
romance out of the college game, and thunder won't be the only 
thing they shake down from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had a vote,'' former Notre Dame coach Dan Devine said by  
telephone Thursday from his home in Phoenix, ``I'd say stay 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you grow up playing sports, you love the idea that a team  
would go any place and play anybody at any time. That was what 
Notre Dame always stood for. I don't think it should change now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the trustees go ahead and vote to align Notre Dame with the  
Big Ten, even though the Irish wouldn't begin playing conference 
games until the 2007 season, some dominoes would begin falling 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	For starters, every other football-playing conference in the  
country would have to start thinking seriously about bumping up its 
glamour quotient. For most, that could mean raiding other 
conferences for the kind of high-profile programs that would make 
them as attractive to the TV networks and bowl committees as the 
Big Ten would suddenly become. 
</P>
<P>
	But that isn't the most important consequence.  
</P>
<P>
	Ever since Knute Rockne took over the Irish program in 1918,  
Notre Dame has occupied a special place on the American sporting 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, under Rockne's guidance, the small Catholic  
university in rural Indiana became the first real national football 
program. Back then, Notre Dame was a poor man's school, its roster 
packed with sons of Irish, Italian, Polish and German ancestry, a 
focal point for a country fast filling up with immigrants and just 
beginning to fall in love with sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Free from the constraints of a conference schedule, the Irish  
were free to challenge the giants of the game -- Army, Nebraska and 
USC -- and did. The Irish rode the trains to both coasts and any 
point in between. They might be in Yankee Stadium one weekend, 
Soldier Field the next, and the Coliseum the weekend after. In the 
days before television, a cheap ticket and a subway ride -- hence 
the term ``subway alumni'' -- was usually all it took to cheer, or 
boo, the Irish in person. 
</P>
<P>
	Times, obviously, have changed. Notre Dame rarely goes anywhere  
as an underdog anymore. If anything, just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	The school pretty much has its pick of recruits every year, and  
it's the only program with its own television contract. Notre Dame 
conducts business pretty much the same way that all football 
powerhouses do -- taking the occasional gamble on an athlete, hiring 
and firing coaches based on performance, looking for the best bowl 
payout. 
</P>
<P>
	A sharp business sense is one of the reasons Notre Dame is even  
considering affiliating with the Big Ten. When its basketball 
program began foundering as an independent a few years ago, the 
Irish joined the Big East in that sport and others. But it held the 
football program out of the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, sports aren't the only consideration. The  
academic benefits Notre Dame would gain by joining a conference 
packed with top-flight graduate schools are considerable. That 
might weigh most heavily in the minds of the 55 trustees when they 
cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	But they should remember how Notre Dame gained the prestige it  
enjoys today. Few people doubt the tradition of excellence it has 
established -- academic and athletic -- would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Irish give up their independence and join the Big  
Ten, a decade or two from now, it will be tough to distinguish them 
from the other universities who happen to be good at football. 
</P>
<P>
	Devine tells a story about a high school that opened near his  
Phoenix home a few years ago. The coach had no formal ties to Notre 
Dame, but adopted the uniform colors and the fight song out of 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``And wouldn't you know,'' Devine added with a chuckle, ``with  
their first class of seniors, they won the Class 5A state 
championship.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers May Be Rodman's Only Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If Dennis Rodman wants to play for a  
championship contender this season as previously stated, the Los 
Angeles Lakers might be his only option. 
</P>
<P>
	And his earning potential with them is extremely limited  
compared to what he's made in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the Orlando Magic, Miami Heat and Houston  
Rockets, all possible destinations for the 37-year-old Rodman, 
indicated Wednesday they aren't interested in his services. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt, Rodman's quirky ways are a significant factor.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder in each of the last seven  
seasons, expressed a desire to play for the Magic, who are coached 
by Chuck Daly -- Rodman's coach with the Detroit Pistons from 
1986-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic general manager John Gabriel indicated the chances of that  
happening are slim, mainly because Rodman has made it clear he 
wishes to receive special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on one phone call, this thing had a pulse a couple days  
ago,'' Gabriel said from Orlando, Fla. ``It's coming close to dying 
out here real fast as we get ready to start our season (Friday 
night against the New York Knicks). 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to meet with him. We respect him very much as a  
player, but there was process for this organization in regard to 
issues off the floor that we're going to stick to. If that process 
doesn't happen, this signing won't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers executive vice president Jerry West has expressed an  
interest in Rodman, but in the team can only offer a veteran 
minimum starting salary of $1 million under the new labor deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who earned a total of $18 million from the Chicago Bulls  
in the last two seasons, recently mentioned the Lakers as one of 
the teams he would be interested in joining. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal has pushed in recent days for the Lakers to  
sign Rodman, who has played on five NBA championship teams in the 
last 10 years, including three straight with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team can use his physical ability,'' said first-year  
Lakers guard Derek Harper, who, like Rodman, is 37 years old and 
nearing the end of his playing career. ``The problem with Dennis is 
how he's going to conduct himself off the basketball court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West reportedly spoke with one of Rodman's new agents, Steve  
Chasman, earlier this week to see if there was interest on Rodman's 
part in playing for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasman has served as Rodman's talent agent for over a year and  
works for International Creative Management. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chasman is not a certified agent with the players  
union, meaning he can't negotiate a contract for Rodman. Rodman is 
also represented by Andrew Reif and Richard Levy, and both are 
certified with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Marozas, a spokeswoman for ICM, said there would be no  
comment Wednesday on Rodman's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Manley formerly represented Rodman, but ended his  
affiliation with him last week.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Study Plankton Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Plankton may not look like much -- masses of  
tiny plants drifting about in the ocean -- but scientists are paying 
increasing attention to its role in the global climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the big questions in oceanography is how the ocean  
responds to changes in climate. One thing that's very important is 
the role of phytoplankton in cycling carbon and other elements'' 
taken up from the atmosphere, said Michael J. Behrenfeld of Rutgers 
University in New Brunswick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scientists are worried that the Earth's climate may be  
warmed by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
One of the natural systems removing carbon dioxide is plankton. 
They use it in their respiration and store some of it when they die 
and sink to the bottom of the seas. 
</P>
<P>
	But in some areas the growth of plankton is limited by the lack  
of certain nutrients, such as iron, nitrogen or phosphorus. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld and co-researcher Zbigniew S. Kolber report in  
today's edition of the journal Science that they have developed a 
way to tell when that limiting factor is a lack of iron. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of experiments in 1993 and 1995, scientists added  
liquefied iron compounds to areas with limited plankton and 
observed a massive bloom of the plants. But that type of experiment 
can only be done on a small area, Behrenfeld explained in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In NASA-funded research, Behrenfeld discovered that during a  
24-hour cycle, plankton show a pattern of fluorescence which, 
though not visible to the naked eye, can be measured by shipboard 
instruments. This pattern varies if the plants have insufficient 
iron, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld said his system can be used to test for lack of iron  
over large areas, helping scientists better understand plankton 
growth and the problems it faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Theoretically, it also could identify prime areas that could be  
enriched with iron to cause increased growth of plankton with the 
aim of removing more carbon from the air -- what some call the 
``Geritol solution'' to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld, however, was reluctant to call for action  
immediately, warning that ``there are a lot of uncertainties in 
that step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term addition of iron could result in a complete change in  
species distribution in a region, he said, and ``there is a lot of 
understanding that needs to be gained about ecological responses'' 
before iron enrichment can be recommended.

<HEADLINE> Airline Passengers Want More Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oversold flights, frequent flier miles that  
are hard to redeem and horror stories about passengers being 
trapped on planes are fueling a wave of complaints about the 
airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	They've also triggered a congressional response and some sharp  
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real point is to make sure that the airlines bring some of  
their creativity and extraordinary entrepreneurial skill into 
making sure that the passengers who use their service get through 
it without feeling like a dish rag,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have written a bill that would  
give passengers 48 hours to cancel tickets that are currently 
nonrefundable. Among other things, the bill would require airlines 
to explain why flights are delayed and tell frequent fliers how 
many seats are available if they want to cash in their miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airlines got freedom with deregulation, and frankly a lot of  
them exploited that freedom unfairly,'' Wyden explained. ``It seems 
to me you have a situation where airline profits are going through 
the roof and passenger service is being left at the gate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines, and even some pro-traveler groups, beg to differ.  
</P>
<P>
	``We as airline passengers keep telling airlines what we want is  
low fares, low fares, low fares,'' said David Stempler, president 
of the Air Travelers Association, a group that serves passengers 
and tries to expand air service. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you start mucking around with that system that has a very  
delicate balance, it's possible fares will go up for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While there are signs that airline profits may have peaked, the  
numbers still show that this is a gold-plated era for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Major U.S. carriers posted net profits of $5.1 billion last  
year, down just slightly from their all-time record of $5.2 billion 
in 1997. Alone, United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, had 
net earnings of $1.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Collectively, U.S. airlines also carried an estimated 615  
million passengers in 1998, with planes filled to near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways ended the year with a record average of 72.7 percent  
of its seats filled. With load factors so high, there are few seats 
between passengers, little extra room for standbys and almost no 
margin for relief when a flight is canceled and passengers have to 
be rebooked. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects are being felt across the system. The Transportation  
Department reported Tuesday that passengers filed 9,606 service 
complaints with the department in 1998, not a huge number in itself 
but 25 percent more than in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, airlines posted a mishandled baggage rate of  
5.16 complaints per 1,000 passengers, compared with 4.96 per 1,000 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Jarvis, a law professor and author of ``Travel Law: Cases  
and Materials,'' a textbook on passenger problems, said airlines 
can afford to be rough with passengers because competition has 
fallen since the industry was deregulated in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that's partly to blame for the increase in stories about  
unruly passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're packing more people into planes, you're giving them  
less service and what you're giving them is not very friendly 
service,'' Jarvis said. ``What you've done is create an environment 
for unruly behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United has been the bluntest among the major carriers in  
admitting current problems. Its ads no longer brag about whisking 
customers through the ``friendly skies'' but rather make the more 
modest claim that United's service is ``rising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means trying to improve on-time performance by giving extra  
time between connecting flights. It also means making passengers 
more comfortable with new planes, cushier seats and individual 
video screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do try to be responsive to the traveling public,'' said  
United spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``We are a transportation business, 
but we're also a service business. And we try to focus on that with 
all our employees.''

<HEADLINE> Davis Urges Elway To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Note to John Elway: Terrell Davis cautions that  
retirement is not in your best interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, the Denver running back who was the Super Bowl MVP last  
year, plans to do whatever it takes to get Elway, the 1999 Super 
Bowl MVP, back on the Broncos for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will physically threaten him. I will physically persuade  
him. I will sabotage every single vehicle he might drive away in,'' 
Davis said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to come back. It's not over yet, we just got started.  
You go tell him I said that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway will strap on his Broncos helmet for at least one more  
game; he plans to play a series or two in Sunday's Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver quarterback said, however, that even if he does  
retire, he won't consider the all-star game his football finale. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I haven't looked that far ahead. Anyway, if it  
is the last one, the one I'll still remember was last week,'' said 
Elway, who guided the Broncos to a 34-19 Super Bowl victory over 
Atlanta on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, a nine-time all-star, said his four kids convinced him to  
come to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl this time because ``they love it 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He missed last year's game because of an injury and expects to  
play sparingly in the AFC-NFC matchup, saying, ``I'll just play it 
by ear and try to do something good out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He smiled and added, ``Anyway, Doug Flutie's a lot younger than  
I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is 38 and Flutie, a Pro Bowl rookie, is 36. The other AFC  
quarterback is 35-year-old Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie suddenly appeared at Elway's locker in Aloha Stadium,  
grinning and demanding to know why Elway got No. 7 for his red AFC 
jersey, since that's Flutie's number with Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won the coin toss,'' Elway shot back. ``You flipped a coin  
and you lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway missed four starts this season because of injuries, but  
said he feels fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in pretty good shape right now,'' he said. ``The heat has  
been a big part of it; Miami, now here. It's good on the old 
joints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, apparently feeling a bit hassled by the blur of  
activities and travel, said things seemed even more hectic at the 
Super Bowl in Miami than they did when the Broncos beat Green Bay 
in San Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went right back for the parade. ... I checked my car phone  
and I had 30 or more messages, and I thought, `I'll just have to 
wait to get to those,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need some time to slow down and try to get organized, get  
the bills paid and all that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway planned to make this season his last, but the prospect of  
winning an unprecedented three consecutive Super Bowls might sway 
him toward returning. He said after the win over Atlanta that he 
expects to announce a final decision in the next few months.

<HEADLINE> Senators May Reject Live Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A majority of senators now oppose live  
testimony in President Clinton's impeachment trial, Senate 
Republicans' comments indicated today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as GOP senators continued to struggle with proposals  
that would conclude Clinton committed wrongdoing without removing 
him from office, the Senate's Democratic leader said there could be 
a censure motion instead -- perhaps as soon as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	As for live testimony, the Senate's 45 Democrats are united  
against bringing Monica Lewinsky and other witnesses into the 
Senate chamber, according to Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and more 
than six Republicans now have said in interviews they also oppose 
live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of 51 votes would prevent the further testimony.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's anything to add by calling them in,''  
said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. added, 
``Don't want it, don't need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and Kay Bailey  
Hutchison of Texas added their voices against witnesses, a position 
taken by at least three GOP senators Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, meanwhile, said any ``findings of fact'' resolution by  
the Republicans on Clinton's transgressions -- voted on as part of 
the impeachment process -- ``is unconstitutional. Our hope is that 
we can move to the articles very quickly and then move to a 
censure, perhaps as early as tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the political arguments began, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,  
D-Conn., urged lawmakers and others at a prayer breakfast to help 
Clinton, who participated in the event. Lieberman asked ``at this 
time of difficulty for the president, that you hear his prayer, 
that you help him with the work he is doing with his family and his 
clergy, that you accept his atonement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans held a party meeting to search for a solution to the  
``findings of fact'' dilemma, unhappy to have the trial end with a 
straight acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to convict a  
president and remove him from office -- a margin both parties agree 
is not within reach -- but a so-called finding of fact would only 
need a majority. Critics argue there is no constitutional 
alternative to conviction and removal in a trial that could be 
completed by Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the trial resuming today, the issue was not on the  
agenda. Senators have had a week-long break during which House 
trial managers took depositions from Monica Lewinsky, presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate today was considering whether to make public the  
videotaped depositions and whether any or all of the witnesses 
should appear in person on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want to show portions of the videotapes as  
part of further evidence presentation, but only as a fallback 
position if they can't get live witnesses. Democrats have been 
united in opposition to live testimony, and even Republicans who 
viewed the videotapes of Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan appeared 
unenthusiastic about calling them. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Senate officials conceded it would be difficult to secure  
enough votes to prevail on a call for live testimony, particularly 
with public opinion in favor of a swift end to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead House prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he was  
``not particularly interested'' in showing all the videotapes if 
live witnesses were rejected, but would instead show excerpts. The 
White House then could use portions of the video for its defense, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said there were ``no bombshells or anything like that'' in  
the depositions, but added the managers who questioned the three 
witnesses believed their responses would be useful to the 
prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans, however, were not convinced of the need for  
live witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to support appearances of witnesses before the  
U.S. Senate,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island added, ``I'm against it'' and  
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., commented, ``I am not persuaded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans considered draft language of a  
statement that would find that Clinton ``willfully provided false 
and misleading'' grand jury testimony, and impeded efforts to 
uncover evidence in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The two articles of impeachment under consideration charge the  
president with grand jury perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle called the proposal an  
``extralegal'' device that could turn the entire proceeding into a 
``Republican trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart added, ``I think it's  
understandable as people work toward trying to figure out a way to 
bring this process to an end ... but in the rush to do that ... 
they shouldn't try to trample on the Constitution in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators also sent Clinton a letter, asking him to  
submit voluntarily to a sworn deposition to answer questions in the 
case. The president already has said he would not do either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your knowledge, intent, actions and omissions are central to  
the charges. ... Personal answers from you should prove beneficial 
in our efforts to reconcile conflicting testimony,'' the 
Republicans wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came as Blumenthal was questioned in a heavily  
secured room on the fourth floor of the Capitol, which is 
off-limits to the public and the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	A source familiar with the deposition, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said Blumenthal repeated testimony he had given a grand 
jury last year concerning a conversation he had with Clinton about 
the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the former White 
House intern. The president lied to him, Blumenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources said the question-and-answer period lasted only  
about an hour but extensive time was spent over objections to 
certain questions asked by Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	A few of the questions involved Kathleen Willey, the former  
White House volunteer who contends Clinton groped her near the Oval 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bit of back and forth, Blumenthal ended up answering two  
minor questions about the matter, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> This Prince Is a Producer, Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It may have been the first news conference with  
a filmmaker preceded by a coaching session on what to call him. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly not Your Royal Highness. Your Majesty is too medieval,  
if not presumptuous. ``Titanic'' director James Cameron already 
claimed King of the World. Even Prince is discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	It's Edward. Edward Windsor.  
</P>
<P>
	There's a protocol to addressing the youngest of Queen Elizabeth  
II's four children. If he's on state business, it's Prince Edward. 
But he drops formality and becomes plain Mr. Windsor when he's in a 
Manhattan conference room to talk to reporters about his three-part 
documentary ``Crown and Country,'' which premieres Sunday at 10 
p.m. EST on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	A half hour with the prince is pleasant enough, if a bit stuffy  
and boring. Quite like his film, actually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Windsor, who runs his own movie company,  
produced and wrote the documentaries. He's also the on-screen 
narrator, walking through London palaces and historic buildings 
that he knows through official functions in his other life. 
</P>
<P>
	He's no amateur, displaying a surprising comfort level and  
affability on camera. He also clearly did his homework, at one 
point correcting on-screen a misstatement by an historian, and 
noting that King Charles I wore three shirts to his beheading so as 
not to shiver in the January cold and appear afraid. 
</P>
<P>
	While Windsor insisted he wasn't making an historical film -- as  
if the words themselves scream UNSPEAKABLY DULL -- ``Crown and 
Country'' is not enticing to any viewer who doesn't come prepared 
with a deep interest in English royalty. 
</P>
<P>
	This is his family he is talking about, his ancestors, although  
you wouldn't know that from his documentary, so careful is he to 
avoid mixing the personal and professional. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, he can't win. Emphasize his blue blood, and that gets  
the attention instead of the story he's trying to tell. Windsor 
seems accustomed to being resented for who he is, not judged on 
what he does. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter what profession I would move into, it would  
be the same prejudice there,'' he says wearily when asked if he 
felt a special need to prove that he's a skillful filmmaker, not 
making it on his name. 
</P>
<P>
	He can certainly claim to have paid his dues. In the 1980s, the  
stage-struck prince worked as a lowly backstage assistant on Andrew 
Lloyd Webber hit musicals such as ``Cats'' and ``Starlight 
Express.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His film company, Ardent Productions, made another installment  
of ``Crown and Country'' that aired last year on PBS. He hopes to 
diversify into other topics, feeding his interest in science and 
technology. He likes producing and doesn't seem all that excited 
about on-camera work. 
</P>
<P>
	The years of training not to talk about himself -- stiff upper  
lip and all that -- have taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Might his background give him a special interest in the stories  
he tells on film? ``The personal connection is irrelevant,'' he 
says, sounding appalled at the very notion. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't even bother trying to learn much about his royal wedding  
to public relations executive Sophie Rhys-Jones, which was 
announced last month. Windsor deflects questions with the skill of 
a champion fencer. 
</P>
<P>
	What does he expect married life to be like? ``I don't think I  
dare answer that, because it would come back to haunt me,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always made a very clear distinction between what I  
regard to be the private side and the public side, and that will 
continue,'' he says. ``As you may have seen, I don't talk that much 
about the private side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So there are no stories about Edward the toddler hiding behind  
columns at Westminster Abbey, to which he has now returned with a 
camera, almost as a tourist. It's in the things he chooses to 
emphasize that something can be gleaned about his own interests. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Windsor devotes much time to the story of King  
Charles I's public execution -- a fascinating story that most brings 
this documentary to life. Perhaps a royal neck ached in sympathy? 
</P>
<P>
	Windsor recalled the first time he walked as a youngster into

	YOU ARE ALL DISEASED: Some things remain consistent on HBO --  
they always come back to George Carlin. The veteran comedian 
returns for his 11th stand-up special, ``You Are All Diseased,'' 
airing live from New York's Beacon Theater Saturday at 9:30 p.m. 
EST, tape delayed in other time zones. ``I'm kind of like a 
favorite crazy uncle that they tolerate,'' he said earlier this 
week. And despite nearly 40 years in show business, Carlin says 
he's getting even more popular among teen-agers. ``We skew young,'' 
he said. ``I think it's the anti-authoritarian tone.''

<HEADLINE> `Charlie Brown' Still a Good Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bless the little round-headed boy. He never  
gives up. Maybe that's why 30 years later, ``You're a Good Man, 
Charlie Brown'' remains a modest but appealing show, a gentle paean 
to persistence guaranteed to cheer the hardest heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that ``Charlie Brown'' is exactly what it was in 1967 when  
the musical revue opened off-Broadway for a marathon four-year run. 
Director Michael Mayer has tinkered and tugged on the material and 
quickened the pace of this version now playing at Broadway's 
Ambassador Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer has also assembled a splendid cast, six performers who  
have a real talent for playing the characters created by Charles M. 
Schulz in his legendary comic strip ``Peanuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulz's little crew, whether read in newspapers or watched on  
television specials, are old friends for a lot of us fans of the 
funnies. We are protective of them. Yet these actors satisfy our 
sense of the familiar while bringing something surprising to their 
interpretations. They can be childlike without being childish, not 
an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the character of Sally Brown, Charlie's little sister,  
who was not in the original but has been added to this production. 
As played by the scene-stealing Kristin Chenoweth, she projects a 
fierce loony logic that children will understand and adults will 
wish they could emulate. Chenoweth, all blond curls and kewpie-doll 
voice, doesn't let a joke get past her. 
</P>
<P>
	Is there anyone who doesn't identify with Charlie Brown, bruised  
and battered by life and a bevy of highly critical friends? The lad 
retains our sympathy because he always tries to do the right thing. 
Anthony Rapp perfectly captures his wide-eyed earnestness that 
somehow survives his lack of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	These are no self-esteem problems with Snoopy, a hedonistic  
hound whose main concerns seem to be eating and sleeping. Roger 
Bart delivers a sly, impish performance. Bart is a superb physical 
comedian as well, turning Snoopy into a more gleefully athletic 
canine than one remembers in the original. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilana Levine, as the professional termagant Lucy, does crabby to  
nerve-shattering perfection. B.D. Wong's Linus, Lucy's 
blanket-dependent brother, is cheerfully professorial, eager to 
overexplain everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Wayne Mathis's ingratiating smile may be at odds with  
the sobriety of the piano-playing Schroeder, but he cuts loose in 
one of the more sparkling new songs, ``Beethoven Day,'' a hymn to 
his favorite composer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie Brown'' is a form of entertainment Broadway hasn't  
seen much of in recent years -- a revue. It used to be a staple in 
less-demanding days before the advent of television. If one sketch 
wasn't terrific, another would come along in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Such is the case here, although author Clark Gesner, who wrote  
the sketches, music and lyrics, has a pretty high batting average. 
And some of them -- the book report on Peter Rabbit and Snoopy's 
hymn to ``Suppertime,'' for example -- remain fresh and funny no 
matter now many times you hear them. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer and set designer David Gallo have framed the show in a  
proscenium of yellowed newspapers. The bold bright colors of the 
set, large cutouts of simple objects such as a tree, a dog house or 
a bench, give the feeling of a comic strip come to life. 
</P>
<P>
	That's another reason why this show has been so successful over  
the past three decades. ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' has 
remained remarkably faithful to its original, often inspired 
source.

<HEADLINE> Donald O'Connor: Critical Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Entertainer Donald O'Connor, whose  
talents at singing, dancing and comedy graced '50s musicals such as 
``Singin' in the Rain,'' was in critical condition Thursday with 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 73, was taken to Desert Regional Medical Center on  
Saturday, and his condition began deteriorating on Tuesday, 
hospital spokesman Tom Wixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was moved to intensive care because of some heart and lung  
failure,'' Wixon said. ``He's on a ventilator and listed in 
critical condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, who lives in Sedona, Ariz., was the featured player in  
the Fabulous Palm Springs Follies, a performing arts group at the 
Historic Plaza Theatre in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he just wasn't feeling well,'' Follies spokeswoman  
Joelle Casteix said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor appeared in several movie musicals in the 1950s, and in  
1952, he got the biggest role of his career as Gene Kelly's friend 
in ``Singin' in the Rain,'' considered one of the greatest musicals 
in Hollywood history. 
</P>
<P>
	One of its most famous scenes is the ``Make 'Em Laugh'' number,  
in which O'Connor's acrobatic and comic talents add much to the 
song. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other '50s musicals he appeared in were ``Call Me  
Madam,'' and ``There's No Business Like Show Business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also was known for the ``Francis'' series of comedies, which  
featured a bumbling O'Connor and a talking mule. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on Aug. 28, 1925, in Chicago, to circus performers who went  
into vaudeville, O'Connor joined his family's act when he was an 
infant. He made his film debut at age 11 in a dancing scene with 
two of his brothers in ``Melody for Two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a contract actor for Paramount, he played adolescent roles in  
several films, including Huckleberry Finn in ``Tom Sawyer -- 
Detective'' (1938) and as a child Beau in ``Beau Geste'' (1939) 
before returning to vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
	In the '40s he went back to movies, playing high-energy juvenile  
leads opposite such actresses as Gloria Jean and Susanna Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	In television, he won an Emmy for ``the Colgate Comedy Hour'' in  
the early 50s, and appeared in ``The Donald O'Connor Texaco Show'' 
from 1954-55.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines, Pilots Argue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines and its pilots are once again  
bristling at one another, this time over whether some pilots are 
being underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship between the airline and its pilots has been  
rocky over the past couple of years, resulting in a brief strike in 
1997 and a slowdown last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the most recent dispute is whether AMR Corp.,  
the parent of the nation's second-largest airline, is too slowly 
absorbing recently purchased Reno Air into American's system, 
thereby paying Reno's 300 pilots on a lower pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our contract states that American Airlines pilots do the  
flying for American Airlines,'' said Allied Pilots Association 
spokesman Capt. Jim Philpot. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law bars a strike over the issue and pilots don't have a  
lot of legal recourse, although they could refuse to volunteer for 
overtime, which could force the cancellation or delay of flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``You end up with very distraught and unhappy pilots,'' said  
Philpot. ``Having unhappy pilots is not productive for this 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AMR took over Reno six weeks ago in a $124 million acquisition  
to help it compete on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our contention and belief that the Reno pilots should  
have been on our seniority list as of the 23rd of December, when 
AMR took control of Reno,'' said union spokesman Drew Engelke. 
``They should be governed by the pay and work rules of our 
contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AMR said it will take a year to 18 months to fully merge the two  
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't go out and integrate two airlines in a few  
months,'' said AMR spokesman John Hotard. ``We just can't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, AMR said the Reno pilots must be retrained  
for American Airlines' jets and that the low-fare carrier's planes 
must be reconfigured. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little progress in negotiations between the pilot  
union and AMR on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the airline prohibited pilots from trading  
flights, locking them into their schedule for the month. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is no agreement, the union board on Friday is scheduled  
to consider whether pilots should quit volunteering for extra 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, pilots decided against accepting overtime to  
protest a passenger-sharing deal AMR made with Calgary, 
Alberta-based Canadian Airlines Corp. That job action resulted in 
more than 450 flights being canceled during the busy summer season. 
</P>
<P>
	If pilots refuse to volunteer for overtime this time around, the  
company expects fewer canceled flights than last year's protest. 
That's because planes are not as full in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute is the latest in the contentious relationship  
between AMR management and its unions, dating back to former chief 
executive Robert Crandall and the pilots' brief strike two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Carty, who succeeded Crandall as CEO, has said publicly that  
one of his goals in his position is to ease the distrustful 
relationship. Still, in a meeting with the union board in January, 
he called the group ``dysfunctional'' and walked out of the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are discouraged by the lack of progress to date at the  
negotiating table,'' union president Rich LaVoy told pilots 
Thursday on a union hotline. ``I am concerned that AMR management 
is not taking the association as seriously as it should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union wants AMR to drop code-sharing plans between American  
and Reno, which allow passengers to book flights on either airline 
through one call, and retroactively pay and promote the pilots 
effected at both airlines. The union also wants the company to 
acknowledge a violation of the contract has been made.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Presbyterian clergy and lay people met recently to discuss ways  
to slow shrinkage of many congregations. Among those attending the	
gathering was Tara Bradley-Steck, an elder in a Pennsylvania church	
who is also an AP writer.	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The good thing about conventions is this: You  
find out you're not alone in your problems. The bad thing is this: 
You find out you're not alone in your problems. 
</P>
<P>
	At a recent conference in Los Angeles to redevelop and  
revitalize churches, about 680 ministers and elders -- the latter 
including me -- were given a pretty grim assessment of the 
situation: From New Mexico to Minnesota, Washington to Georgia, 
Presbyterians are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing members at a rate of 35,000 to 40,000 a year for the past  
two decades, the 2.6 million-member Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) 
has concluded that it is becoming increasingly irrelevant, not only 
to baby boomers but more significantly to Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't lose members to other churches, we lose them to the  
weekend,'' said Steve Boots, who works on congregational 
redevelopment at Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) headquarters in 
Louisville, Ky. ``People are doing more church shopping, but the 
net gain is not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an elder who hoped to find ways to help turn around the same  
problem of declining members and lack of vision at a small, aging 
church in suburban Pittsburgh, the news made me pause and wonder: 
How can this be solved if so many are in the same boat? 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1802, Deer Creek Presbyterian Church in Gibsonia,  
Pa., grew to almost 400 by the end of World War II, despite the 
fact that it was in what was then a rural area. Now, the farmers 
have been replaced by accountants and architects, and the area has 
turned into a suburb, yet fewer than 90 people are members and many 
of them are well over 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades ago, the church had everything -- men's and women's Bible  
study groups, youth groups, several Sunday school classes, choirs, 
chicken dinners, vacation Bible school. What it has now is a bank 
account that is more often in the red than the black. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is also a sense of commitment among some in the church  
who simply aren't willing to close the doors. It was they who sent 
our minister, another elder and me to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the people attending the four-day conference, the third  
such in as many years, came with a host of complaints that sounded 
remarkably similar. More importantly, they came to learn ways to 
make worship services more passionate and creative, to draw people 
of all ages and races into congregations and to focus on mission 
work and community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless we take dramatic action and implement some of these  
changes, church consultant Bill Easum of Port Aransas, Tex., told 
us, ``three out of four churches will be out of business in the 
next 26 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The great churches today think small, not big,'' he said.  
``The first rule of a church should be to help people grow, not the 
church grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Presbyterians' troubles are not unique. It has been a rough  
three decades for ``Mainline Protestant'' denominations, usually 
defined as predominantly white groups affiliated with the National 
Council of Churches and World Council of Churches. The Christian 
Church (Disciples of Christ), Episcopal Church, United Church of 
Christ and United Methodist Church have also suffered steady 
membership declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, church attendance among most denominations has been  
flat -- about 40 percent, according to Gallup polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy percent of the people in our community have no church  
affiliation, so we have a lot of room to grow,'' said Roger Kelsey, 
an elder with First Presbyterian Church of Smyrna, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	But can it? The Presbyterian Church is older and whiter than  
most and it has had a hard time attracting new members to replace 
those who die. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are losing our own sons and daughters,'' said the Rev.  
Douglas Oldenberg, the moderator of the General Assembly, the 
church's chief legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents of the baby boomers are traditional churchgoers,  
but baby boomers are looking for something different, not just to 
do what their parents did,'' said Jean Watley of Tacoma, Wash., 
another conference organizer. ``Plus, there's more competition than 
there used to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders have focused on five dynamics that are necessary  
for redevelopment: Creating spiritual energy; determining a 
congregation's past and future identity; building a ministry team 
among the pastor and lay people; re-entering the community to 
determine whether the church reflects the neighborhood; and 
developing a ministry plan for the entire congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot has to do with how well preachers preach and whether  
they're really reaching out to the people in the community,'' 
Oldenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revitalization is a noble pursuit, said the Rev. Steve Yamaguchi  
of Paramount Presbyterian Church in Paramount, Calif., but often 
the efforts are too little, too late, and they have to be from the 
bottom up, rather than the top down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Officially being called a redeveloping church was like being  
called terminal,'' said Yamaguchi, whose Japanese-American 
congregation of about 150 dwindled to about 25 by the mid-1980s but 
now boasts about 130 regular worshippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategy is good: Churches are dying, so we'll establish a  
committee for redevelopment, and funds will be made available for 
them. But in our presbytery, every church that had been labeled 
`redeveloping' eventually died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yamaguchi said when he was hired 12 years ago, he targeted his  
ministry not only to the older Japanese but to a younger audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intentionally used my guitar on the first Sunday from the  
pulpit,'' he said. ``I tried to preach in ways that were accessible 
to the people I was preaching to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conference participants traveled to several churches undergoing  
redevelopment around Los Angeles, including Immanuel Presbyterian 
Church in Hollywood, a dense and diverse area. Immanuel's 
membership dwindled from 5,000 members 50 years ago to about 100 by 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Immanuel is part of a cluster of six Presbyterian  
churches -- three serving Korean, Hispanic and Taiwanese 
congregations and three multiethnic. The cluster supports four 
mission agencies, including an economic development corporation and 
neighborhood youth organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds gather for worship in five services conducted in  
several languages, and 600 to 800 youth gather for after-school 
athletic, art and academic training. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cluster does things that none of the churches could do by  
themselves,'' said the Rev. Frank M. Alton, Immanuel's pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	Yamaguchi said his church didn't really turn around until the  
``congregation was blessed with the misery of losing its building'' 
in Long Beach and moved into a run-down building in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	The new church ``wasn't beautiful, but it kicked us out of that  
confidential, captivity mode and into the wilderness mode, and that 
allowed people to be a little more open to doing things 
differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one person can turn around a church, but a few determined  
people can have a big impact. That's the most important thing we 
learned at the conference. The point is to start now.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Looking To Take Next Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The retirement of Michael Jordan and  
the gutting of the Chicago Bulls may have boosted the championship 
hopes of several NBA teams, but not the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	They had such hopes, Jordan or no Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	And as coach Del Harris pointed out, the Bulls haven't been the  
problem since Shaquille O'Neal joined the Lakers before the 1996-97 
season to make them serious title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone, John Stockton and the rest of the Utah Jazz have  
been the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're 0-0 against Chicago in playoff series, unfortunately,''  
Harris said. ``Utah has beaten us the last couple of years. And the 
West is really loaded this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six Western Conference teams -- the Lakers, Jazz, San Antonio  
Spurs, Houston Rockets, Phoenix Suns and Seattle SuperSonics -- seem 
capable of reaching the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
	And several others appear much improved over last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Harris believes the time is right for his team.  
And it's possible the Lakers might get the power forward some 
believe they need in Dennis Rodman, the quirky seven-time 
rebounding champion who has said he wants to play in Los Angeles 
but remains on the sidelines as the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this can be a breakthrough year for us,'' Harris  
said. ``Shaq is 27, Michael was 28 when he won his first 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, O'Neal turns 27 next month.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready, all of us associated with him are ready,'' Harris  
said. ``We're here to give it our best shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a lot of changes in the league. Our team  
hasn't changed that much. It's an advantage to have the carryover 
in personnel. If you look at the good teams, that's what they've 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers return the same starting lineup -- O'Neal, Robert  
Horry, Rick Fox, Eddie Jones and Derek Fisher -- from the team that 
finished last season 22-3 before overpowering Portland and Seattle 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it's also the same starting group that was swept by  
the Jazz in the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending last-minute moves, a total of nine players are back from  
the team that went 61-21 during the regular season last year. In 
addition, they acquired Travis Knight, who played for them as a 
rookie two years ago, from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The only key player to leave was Nick Van Exel, who was traded  
to Denver. A change of scenery was probably best for both the 
player and team. 
</P>
<P>
	Former great Magic Johnson, now a part owner, believes the  
Lakers will profit from being swept by the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get embarrassed, you go one of two ways,'' he said.  
``You come back fighting or you give up. I think what happened is 
going to make us mentally tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the key is O'Neal's health.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be his league now,'' Johnson said. ``Shaq  
wants to win so bad. He's just waiting to take that position as the 
No. 1 guy. This is his time, without a doubt. He knows it, he's 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said O'Neal was ``deeply hurt'' after the Lakers were  
swept by the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal doesn't deny it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know deep down we didn't play well and they played well,''  
O'Neal said. ``We'll probably meet up again. I would love to be a 
part of (NBA) history). To accomplish that, we'll probably have to 
go through Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking Van Exel's place as a backup to Fisher is 37-year-old  
Derek Harper, who is being counted on to add leadership to a team 
that remains significantly younger than many of the top contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of talking the talk, you've got to walk the walk,''  
Harper said. ``There's a price to pay in order to be the best. I 
have a role to play. I'm very comfortable, I'll play it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the abbreviated schedule calls for 50 games in 90 days,  
Harris said depth will be of the utmost importance this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sixth man is always important,'' he said. ``This year, the  
seventh, eighth and ninth men will be important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means reserves like Harper, Knight, Kobe Bryant, Elden  
Campbell and Corie Blount will probably all be counted on more than 
usual.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Test Tailors AIDS Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Deciphering the genetic code of each patient's  
AIDS virus appears to help doctors tailor treatments to improve the 
chance of thwarting HIV's dogged ability to develop resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the elements that makes HIV such a difficult foe is the  
sloppy way it makes copies of itself. Each new version is slightly 
different from its predecessor. Mutant forms quickly arise through 
random genetic changes that are able to resist the most powerful 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, doctors have increasingly turned to individual  
resistance testing. A study released Thursday shows this pays off: 
Analyzing patients' viruses for genetic signs of resistance seems 
to improve treatment outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates vary, but perhaps 30 percent to 60 percent of all  
people taking the AIDS drug cocktails are considered treatment 
failures, because HIV can still be found in their blood. Either 
their virus never disappeared completely or it rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the tests, doctors often must rely on trial and error to  
put together fresh combinations of medicines. Coming up with these 
strategies, sometimes called salvage therapy, is an increasingly 
important part of long-term AIDS care. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear the test helps you choose more active drugs for  
patients who are failing therapy,'' said the study's director, Dr. 
John Baxter of Cooper Hospital in Camden, N.J. He presented the 
latest data Thursday at the 6th Conference on Retroviruses and 
Opportunistic Infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Douglas Richman of the University of California, San Diego,  
estimated that as many as two dozen of these tests are now on the 
market, although they have received little testing to make sure 
they do any good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I think it's premature,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Baxter's study, financed by the National Institute of Allergy  
and Infectious Diseases, doctors performed genetic analysis on the 
viruses of 78 patients who had failed treatment, while a comparison 
group of 75 received their usual care. 
</P>
<P>
	The test analyzed viral genes that produce two essential  
proteins -- protease and reverse transcriptase. Both of these 
proteins are targets of standard AIDS drugs. When the genes become 
mutated, they produce forms of these proteins that elude the 
effects of the medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	After analyzing the tests and determining the specific mutations  
in each patient's virus, Baxter and two other virologists then made 
treatment suggestions to the patients' doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors precisely followed the virologists' advice only  
about half the time, although 83 percent said the information 
influenced their treatment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	At the study's start, median viral levels were 28,000 copies per  
milliliter of blood. All were switched to new drug regimens, but 
those whose viruses were tested did much better. Their viral levels 
dropped to 815, compared to 7,950 in the comparison group. After 
eight weeks, half of those in the test group had no measurable 
virus in their blood, compared with one-quarter of the other 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter said the testing may be useful to tailor first-time  
treatment for those who are newly infected with HIV. This could 
become especially important if viruses that are immune to multiple 
drugs become more widespread, as many fear. 
</P>
<P>
	A French study, conducted by Dr. Pierre Dellamonica of  
University Hospital Center in Nice, was released at an AIDS 
conference in Glasgow, Scotland in November. It produced similar 
results using a genetic test developed by Visible Genetics Inc.

<HEADLINE> This Prince Is a Producer, Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It may have been the first news conference with  
a filmmaker preceded by a coaching session on what to call him. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly not Your Royal Highness. Your Majesty is too medieval,  
if not presumptuous. ``Titanic'' director James Cameron already 
claimed King of the World. Even Prince is discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
	It's Edward. Edward Windsor.  
</P>
<P>
	There's a protocol to addressing the youngest of Queen Elizabeth  
II's four children. If he's on state business, it's Prince Edward. 
But he drops formality and becomes plain Mr. Windsor when he's in a 
Manhattan conference room to talk to reporters about his three-part 
documentary ``Crown and Country,'' which premieres Sunday at 10 
p.m. EST on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
	A half hour with the prince is pleasant enough, if a bit stuffy  
and boring. Quite like his film, actually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Windsor, who runs his own movie company,  
produced and wrote the documentaries. He's also the on-screen 
narrator, walking through London palaces and historic buildings 
that he knows through official functions in his other life. 
</P>
<P>
	He's no amateur, displaying a surprising comfort level and  
affability on camera. He also clearly did his homework, at one 
point correcting on-screen a misstatement by an historian, and 
noting that King Charles I wore three shirts to his beheading so as 
not to shiver in the January cold and appear afraid. 
</P>
<P>
	While Windsor insisted he wasn't making an historical film -- as  
if the words themselves scream UNSPEAKABLY DULL -- ``Crown and 
Country'' is not enticing to any viewer who doesn't come prepared 
with a deep interest in English royalty. 
</P>
<P>
	This is his family he is talking about, his ancestors, although  
you wouldn't know that from his documentary, so careful is he to 
avoid mixing the personal and professional. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, he can't win. Emphasize his blue blood, and that gets  
the attention instead of the story he's trying to tell. Windsor 
seems accustomed to being resented for who he is, not judged on 
what he does. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter what profession I would move into, it would  
be the same prejudice there,'' he says wearily when asked if he 
felt a special need to prove that he's a skillful filmmaker, not 
making it on his name. 
</P>
<P>
	He can certainly claim to have paid his dues. In the 1980s, the  
stage-struck prince worked as a lowly backstage assistant on Andrew 
Lloyd Webber hit musicals such as ``Cats'' and ``Starlight 
Express.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His film company, Ardent Productions, made another installment  
of ``Crown and Country'' that aired last year on PBS. He hopes to 
diversify into other topics, feeding his interest in science and 
technology. He likes producing and doesn't seem all that excited 
about on-camera work. 
</P>
<P>
	The years of training not to talk about himself -- stiff upper  
lip and all that -- have taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Might his background give him a special interest in the stories  
he tells on film? ``The personal connection is irrelevant,'' he 
says, sounding appalled at the very notion. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't even bother trying to learn much about his royal wedding  
to public relations executive Sophie Rhys-Jones, which was 
announced last month. Windsor deflects questions with the skill of 
a champion fencer. 
</P>
<P>
	What does he expect married life to be like? ``I don't think I  
dare answer that, because it would come back to haunt me,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always made a very clear distinction between what I  
regard to be the private side and the public side, and that will 
continue,'' he says. ``As you may have seen, I don't talk that much 
about the private side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So there are no stories about Edward the toddler hiding behind  
columns at Westminster Abbey, to which he has now returned with a 
camera, almost as a tourist. It's in the things he chooses to 
emphasize that something can be gleaned about his own interests. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Windsor devotes much time to the story of King  
Charles I's public execution -- a fascinating story that most brings 
this documentary to life. Perhaps a royal neck ached in sympathy? 
</P>
<P>
	Windsor recalled the first time he walked as a youngster into  
the Banqueting House, the last remaining room of the Palace of 
Whitehall. Here is where Charles I stepped through a window onto a 
platform built for his beheading in 1649. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had one of those very strange experiences,'' he says. ``I  
just felt that there was something quite momentous that had 
happened in this room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Windsor learned about his ancestors in school like most British  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just learned them as characters in history along with  
everyone else,'' he says. ``The only difference is I've come to 
appreciate them more as characters and ordinary people put in 
extraordinary situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	YOU ARE ALL DISEASED: Some things remain consistent on HBO --  
they always come back to George Carlin. The veteran comedian 
returns for his 11th stand-up special, ``You Are All Diseased,'' 
airing live from New York's Beacon Theater Saturday at 9:30 p.m. 
EST, tape delayed in other time zones. ``I'm kind of like a 
favorite crazy uncle that they tolerate,'' he said earlier this 
week. And despite nearly 40 years in show business, Carlin says 
he's getting even more popular among teen-agers. ``We skew young,'' 
he said. ``I think it's the anti-authoritarian tone.''

<HEADLINE> Imported Vehicle Sales Rise in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sales of imported vehicles in Japan rose 3 percent  
to 15,919 in January from the previous year, the first jump in 
nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Thursday attributed the 3 percent rise in sales to  
the low level of sales last year and said the jump should not be 
interpreted as a signal that Japan's economy is recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Imported passenger car sales rose 6.1 percent to 15,595, while  
imported truck sales plunged 56.9 percent to 324, the Japan 
Automobile Importers Association report said. No buses from 
overseas were sold in January, compared to five the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures included vehicles produced abroad by Japanese  
automakers. The rise in auto import sales was the first since March 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of foreign carmakers dropped 1.2 percent in January to  
13,642 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	By country, sales of vehicles imported from the United States  
rose 30 percent to 3,932. General Motors' sales rose 8.2 percent to 
1,004, but Ford's sales fell 47.2 percent to 207 and Chrysler's 
dropped 46.1 percent to 318. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of vehicles produced in Germany rose 4.9 percent to 7,123.  
Mercedes-Benz was Japan's top-selling imported car, with a total of 
3,241 sold, an increase of 33.4 percent from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	British-made vehicle sales fell 38.9 percent to 229. Sales from  
France rose 47.8 percent to 615. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, another Japanese auto association announced Thursday  
that Japan's sales of mini-vehicles soared 28.8 percent in January 
from the previous year to 123,122. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp rise in January follows a 17.5 percent rise in  
December, a 30.2 percent rise in November and a 12 percent rise in 
October, the Japan Mini Vehicles Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of mini-vehicles were helped by the introduction of models  
built to new safety standards introduced last October. Consumers 
were also turning to smaller and less expensive cars amid Japan's 
recession, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said  
sales of new cars, trucks and buses fell 6.2 percent in January, 
falling for the twenty-second straight month.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Bomb Goes Off in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- A gasoline bomb went off as delegates from  
one of Nigeria's main political parties were voting to select a 
presidential candidate earlier this week, injuring four people, 
local media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb was thrown Tuesday at a convention of People's  
Democratic Party members in the southeastern city of Port Harcourt 
as the group was choosing a candidate for its southern region to 
send to the party's national convention, the Lagos Press newspaper 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officials were unavailable Thursday for comment on  
suspects in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb landed on a table where votes were being counted,  
destroying all the ballots and sending thick smoke billowing 
throughout the room. Four people were slightly injured, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, Nigeria is holding groundbreaking presidential and  
national elections called by military leader Gen. Abdulsalami 
Abubakar. The move will allow the handover of power to a civilian 
government after 39 years of mostly military rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The Port Harcourt convention was attended by 3,000 party members  
as well as a number of presidential hopefuls, including former Vice 
President Alex Ekwueme and former oil minister Chief Don Etiebet. 
</P>
<P>
	But other party leaders eyeing a presidential bid boycotted the  
meeting, calling it unconstitutional. They said they would only 
recognize the results of the national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	National assembly elections are scheduled for Feb. 20, with  
presidential voting on Feb. 27.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on Microenterprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is recognizing outstanding  
``microenterprises'' and urging Congress to increase such small 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House ceremony today honoring six successful  
micro-businesses, Clinton was highlighting what administration 
officials said was a 150 percent increase for microenterprise in 
his fiscal 2000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Microenterprises typically are businesses that employ five or  
fewer people and need less than $25,000 in credit to get up and 
running. More than small businesses, people launching such ventures 
need training and technical assistance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget Clinton sent to Congress on Monday included $15  
million for technical support and research on innovations that can 
help new businesses and a doubling, to $32 million, of the Small 
Business Administration's Microloan Program, which links loans to 
microentreprenuers with training. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms receiving recognition from the president today are The  
Micro Industry Credit Rural Organization of Tucson, Ariz.; The 
Detroit Entrepreneurship Institute Inc.; The Northeast Entrepreneur 
Fund Inc. of Virginia, Minn.; The Institute for Social and Economic 
Development of Iowa City, Iowa; The Montana Microbusiness Finance 
Program of Helena, Mont.; and The Corporation for Enterprise 
Development of Washington.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Would Get Most From Gas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Transportation  
Committee counterpunched a Clinton administration highway proposal 
Thursday, showing states exactly what they'd get if extra gas-tax 
money were sent to them instead being spent on other federal 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	California would lead all comers with an extra $121 million in  
highways funds starting Oct. 1, according to an analysis by Rep. 
Bud Shuster, R-Pa. Illinois would get $45 million more, while the 
pothole-laden District of Columbia would bring up the rear with an 
additional $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster opposes a provision in the proposed $45.5 billion  
Transportation Department budget that would divert about half the 
unexpected almost $1.5 billion in gas tax money to nonhighway 
transportation programs. 
</P>
<P>
	American drivers generated the funds by buying cheap gas and  
fuel-guzzling sports-utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster says that under terms of last year's $203 billion  
national highway bill, any extra money generated by the gas tax 
should be returned to the states. His breakdown shows the states' 
revised shares based on the distribution formula created in the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am concerned by the president's attempt to rewrite the law  
and redistribute these funds,'' Shuster said in a statement 
released along with his state-by-state breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the chorus was Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., chairman of  
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's budget proposal would upset the delicate  
balance finally achieved in those (highway) negotiations,'' Chafee 
wrote in a letter to Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the proposal on Monday, Slater conceded the  
administration was reworking the highway bill funding formula. He 
said diversions were justified because states still were going to 
get more highway money, and the rest would go to ``programs that we 
think are strategic and keeping with the overall needs identified 
by the administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They include $730 million for road, bridge and clean-air  
programs, $291 million for mass transit, $250 million for research 
and $125 million for automotive safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also wants to spend $35 million for rail  
improvements and $25 million for transportation preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	States are already scheduled to receive significant road and  
bridge money under the highway bill. There are already $25 billion 
worth of highway projects in the pipeline, and even without the 
extra gas money, California would still get close to $2.5 billion 
in road funds on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois' take would be $905 million, while the District of  
Columbia would get $106 million even without any of the extra gas 
tax money. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster's spokesman, Scott Brenner, said: ``We'll listen to  
their proposals, but we have no plans to reopen the legislation 
right now. The bill's not even a year old.''

<HEADLINE> Movie Critic Siskel Taking a Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Movie critic Gene Siskel is giving his thumb a  
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	He's taking a leave of absence from the TV show he shares with  
fellow critic Roger Ebert to concentrate on his recovery from brain 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel said Wednesday that he also will suspend his reviews for  
the Chicago Tribune, Chicago's WBBM-TV, CBS's ``This Morning'' and 
TV Guide while he spends time recuperating at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a hurry to get well because I don't want Roger to get  
more screen time than I,'' Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel had emergency surgery May 11 to remove a growth in his  
brain. Soon after, he was screening movies for ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' 
from his hospital bed and phoning in his reviews to Ebert on the 
show's set. 
</P>
<P>
	He resumed his full workload within a few weeks of the surgery  
but said he's now taking his doctor's advice to take some time off. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel and Ebert are perhaps the nation's most recognizable  
movie critics with their trademark ``thumbs-up'' and 
``thumbs-down'' reviews. Siskel hopes to return next fall to the 
show he has hosted with Ebert for 23 years. Ebert taped this 
weekend's program solo for the first time.

<HEADLINE> D.C., Ga. Get Suspicious Packages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police and FBI agents retrieved packages  
purporting to contain anthrax that were delivered to The Washington 
Post and the Old Executive Office Building on Thursday in an 
apparent hoax, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar scares prompted police to cordon off a four-block area  
in downtown Atlanta, after a package was delivered to the NBC News 
bureau there with a note claiming it was anthrax. Earlier in the 
day, a postal worker in Columbus, Ga., opened a parcel with a note 
reading, ``You have been exposed to anthrax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the past is any indication, this is all a hoax,'' said FBI  
spokesman Frank Scafidi of the scares in the District of Columbia 
and Georgia. ``In Los Angeles a few weeks ago, these things were 
popping all over the place. These sound similar to those widely 
reported incidents. It sounds like another spike, just more of the 
same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, an analysis showed that the substance contained  
inside the package received by the Post was harmless. FBI Agent 
Elisa Foster said the parcel received by the Post ``contained 
rambling threats and claimed that whoever opened the letter was 
exposed to a poisonous substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after noon, FBI agents in blue windbreakers and District  
of Columbia police entered the Old Executive Office Building next 
to the White House to retrieve the second package. No details on 
that parcel were immediately available, but the building was not 
evacuated. The building houses offices of members of the 
president's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, several floors of the building where the NBC bureau  
is located were evacuated and about a dozen people went through 
decontamination showers set up by emergency officials. Some were 
then taken to hospitals as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency officials in Georgia said they were not sure if either  
of the packages actually contained dangerous material. It was not 
clear when lab tests would be completed.

<HEADLINE> MCI Launches New Internet Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Analysts say MCI Worldcom's planned consumer  
Internet service, which is being bundled with discounts for 
customers of MCI WorldCom's long distance service, may struggle due 
to heavy competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the bundling deals, which were stressed in announcement  
this morning, just don't pull in the bodies,'' said Gary Arlen, 
president of Arlen Communications Inc. in Bethesda, Md.. He noted 
that another long-distance company Sprint recently merged its 
struggling Internet service with Earthlink, another Internet 
service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI Worldcom unveiled its new Internet service Thursday,  
replacing a business sold last year to win government approvals for 
WorldCom's acquisition of MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service, which will give customers access to the  
Internet by dialing a local telephone number, was created through a 
joint venture with the online network CompuServe, a unit of 
Internet giant America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, the nation's second biggest long-distance  
telephone company, will offer an introductory rate of $16.95 a 
month for 150 hours of Internet access. After three months, the 
price will go up by $3 a month, although MCI WorldCom's 
long-distance customers will continue to pay the discounted rate. 
Additional online hours will cost 99 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
	No financial details about the relationship with CompuServe were  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, MCI Communications agreed to sell its Internet  
businesses to address complaints that its planned combination with 
WorldCom would put too much control of Internet access in one 
company's hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials didn't immediately respond to  
questions Thursday about whether the new service posed any 
antitrust concerns, but MCI WorldCom officials said they didn't 
expect any objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``No conditions were placed on actions going forward,'' said  
John Donoghue, senior vice president of marketing for MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the divestiture of MCI's Internet assets, MCI WorldCom  
still controls a major portion of the so-called Internet backbone, 
or the actual pipes that carry online traffic from network to 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	CompuServe, which operates a members-only online service and  
Internet sites, will provide a Web site with Internet search and 
messaging capabilities as well as news, stock quotes and other 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relationship with CompuServe allows us to focus on what we  
do best and lets CompuServe do content, navigation tools,'' said 
Donoghue. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Internet service is part of an effort by long-distance  
companies toward offering a variety of telecommunications services 
in one package. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom already offers Internet access for large  
businesses. On Wednesday, the company announced that it has begun 
offering local calling service in New York through an arrangement 
with Bell Atlantic, a regional phone monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, AT&AMP;T Corp. announced an alliance with Time  
Warner Inc., expanding its effort to offer high-speed Internet 
access via cable TV lines.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Am Fans Treated to a Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Jordan wasn't there, and it  
was just as well. The crowds tailing Tiger Woods and his quartet 
was huge, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly retired basketball megastar was expected to make an  
appearance at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, paired with Woods. 
The Dream Team was scrapped, however, when Jordan cut a finger with 
a cigar cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans apparently weren't deterred from showing up. Woods  
ended up with actor Kevin Costner in a foursome with Mark O'Meara 
and Ken Griffey Jr. Early Thursday morning, crowds were four-deep 
at the Spyglass Hill course, one of three used in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	By the afternoon, the fairways were swamped.  
</P>
<P>
	Allan Hammer just happened to be wearing a cap that said ``Field  
of Dreams.'' Then he just happened to be standing next to Kevin 
Costner. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, who starred in the movie immortalized on Hammer's  
hat, smiled as he signed it with a magic marker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't usually ask for autographs,'' said Hammer, a South  
Dakota resident. ``It's the only one (hat) I brought. I just wanted 
to get something for my grandson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans braved cool temperatures and sometimes biting winds off the  
Pacific Ocean, hoping to catch a glimpse of the actor, All-Star 
outfielder, five-time Pro-Am winner and youthful golf superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing hooky,'' Jessica Anderson, 14, said with a  
giggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica and her friends Ashley Miller and Marisa Boyne, also 14,  
routinely positioned themselves at the players' walkway between 
each hole, armed with pens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here for anyone in particular,'' said Ashley, who  
betrayed her allegiance with a white Seattle Mariners jacket. ``We 
just want to get some autographs and be near them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey was easily the crowd favorite, mugging with O'Meara and  
joking with the crowd. On the first hole at Spyglass, a fan shouted 
out ``Let's go Griff!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still nervous,'' Griffey said with a shrug after his tee  
shot went into the trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK Griff,'' the fan replied. ``We'll go find it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Another shot into the trees on the No. 5 hole had Griffey  
scrambling for a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to pick it up,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Awww,'' the crowed lamented, and Griffey obliged by navigating  
a tangle of tree limbs to knock his ball back on the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and O'Meara, meanwhile, concentrated on their rounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who finished the day at even-par 72, grew so frustrated  
after hitting out of a sand trap on the tricky No. 3 hole that he 
threw his club down in disgust. He crossed his arms and stared at 
the waves of the ocean, a stone's throw from the green. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara fared slightly better, ending up with a 1-under 71. He  
frequently conferenced with Griffey, and after sinking a perfect 
putt on the No. 5 hole, the baseball star bestowed him with an 
animated hug.

<HEADLINE> Car Salesman Killer Executed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man convicted of killing a car salesman  
whose bullet-riddled body was tied to a truck bumper and dragged 
down a dirt road was executed by injection Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Leslie Fry, 23, pleaded guilty to murder and robbery in the  
February 1994, slaying of Leland A. Jacobs, who worked for a 
Richmond-area Ford dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	In a final statement, Fry said he was ``sorry for what I've  
done, and I have made peace with myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs was shot 11 times with a .22-caliber handgun. His necktie  
was tied to the rear bumper of the Explorer. A medical examiner 
testified that Jacobs probably was still alive when he was dragged. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer who had a warrant for Fry's arrest in an  
unrelated case spotted Fry and an accomplice, then-17-year-old 
Bradford A. Hinson, leaving the scene and stopped them. Fry 
confessed to the killing when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinson was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery and is  
serving an 88-year sentence.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Egypt Helps Modern Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists trying to unravel the mysteries of  
El Nino are studying floods on the Nile, using information 
collected by instruments introduced in the days of the pharaohs. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual Nile floods were vital to Egyptian agriculture, so  
the ancient pharaohs introduced the nilometer, a device to measure 
the height of the river flood. 
</P>
<P>
	Now researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are  
finding those records useful in estimating the frequency of the El 
Nino climate phenomenon in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	They have discovered a period, just over 1,000 years ago, that  
had relatively frequent El Ninos, similar to the pattern of the 
past 20 years, according to a paper in the Feb. 15 edition of 
Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers Elfatih A.B. Eltahir and Guiling Wang looked at Nile  
flood records dating back to A.D. 650 -- long after the pharaohs but 
still recorded using the nilometer system -- to develop an estimate 
of past El Ninos. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino, an unusual warming of the water in the eastern tropical  
Pacific Ocean, can have worldwide impacts on weather. Sea surface 
temperature records go back only to the late 1800s, so climate 
researchers have looked for other ways to determine when past El 
Ninos might have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	When an El Nino is under way, rain is reduced over the sources  
of the Nile. Studies have found that about 30 percent of the change 
in water flow on the Nile at Aswan can be attributed to El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper shows frequent El Ninos between about 750 and 1000  
with a reduction after that, and then an increase again in the 
latter years of this century. It did not speculate on the reason 
for the correlation between the two periods.

<HEADLINE> BMW Shares Jump on Rumor of Ouster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Shares of luxury carmaker Bayerische  
Motoren Werke AG jumped Thursday amid fresh speculation that the 
company's chief would be ousted over heavy losses at its British 
Rover subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has declined to comment on reports that Bernd  
Pischetsrieder, an engineer who took over the company's top job in 
1993, would be replaced at a supervisory board meeting on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But BMW shares closed 6.5 percent higher in Frankfurt Thursday.  
Analysts attributed the rise to hopes that Pischetsrieder's 
departure could open the way for BMW to join the current wave of 
carmarker alliances. Pischetsrieder has consistently ruled out BMW 
as a partner in any merger or joint-venture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once he's gone, a new round of talks (with potential partners)  
will become possible,'' said Harry Gegenwart, head of customer 
trading at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW is seen as an attractive takeover target, particularly for a  
U.S. car company, due to its strong position in the luxury car 
market in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	A Belgian newspaper, La Libre Belgique, quoted the head of  
General Motors' European operations, Michael Burns, as expressing a 
possible interest in BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what car makers GM would be interested in, Burns replied:  
``Manufacturers with which we would have synergies. Speculatively, 
I would mention the BMW group. It operates in a premium luxury 
segment where we're weaker. It would be an ideal partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, a GM spokesman in Detroit later dismissed the report as  
``completely incorrect'' and denied that Burns had made the 
comment. ``There has been no discussion with BMW management,'' the 
spokesman, John Mueller, said. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW was one of the likely targets mentioned when it became known  
that Ford was seeking a European partner. Ford announced this month 
that it was buying Volvo's car division instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidation in the auto industry took a big step forward when  
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG merged with Chrysler Corp. last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last year, Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech floated the  
idea of joint ownership of BMW and Volkswagen, but BMW dismissed 
such a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	But Georg Stuerzer, an analyst at Bayerische HypoVereinsbank in  
Munich, cautioned that a change in BMW's top brass won't 
necessarily open up BMW for a merger. Any change in merger strategy 
would require approval by the Quandt family, which owns 42 percent 
of the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly magazine Stern reported Wednesday that supervisory  
board chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim is dissatisfied with 
Pischetsrieder's management of the Rover unit. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion in Rover since  
acquiring the British automaker in 1994. Analysts expect Rover to 
post a pretax loss of around $590 million for 1998.

 *Herbert Klynn    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Herbert Klynn, an award-winning graphic  
designer and artist who helped create cartoon shorts featuring Mr. 
Magoo and Madeline and animated TV shows including ``The Lone 
Ranger,'' died Wednesday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Klynn's 50-year career included the creation of the innovative  
graphic titles for the ``I Spy'' 1960s TV series starring Bill 
Cosby and Robert Culp, and ``The Duck Factory,'' a 1984 sitcom 
about an animation studio that featured Jim Carrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Klynn collaborated on other projects with such prominent authors  
as Ted Geisel of ``Dr. Seuss'' fame and science fiction novelist 
Ray Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
	He was honored by the International Animated Film Society with  
an ``Annie Award'' for his contributions to the art of animation. 

</P>
<P>
 *John Service    	
</P>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- John Service, a China expert who was  
ousted from the State Department during the McCarthy era for views 
seen as pro-Communist, died Wednesday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed a political officer in 1941 and became part of  
a mission led by Gen. Joseph Stilwell to expand the Chinese war 
effort against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1944, after getting to the Communist headquarters of Mao  
Tse-tung, Service wrote a memo praising the leader. The memo, 
reportedly leaked to the Nationalist government, angered the 
powerful China lobby in the United States. Service and Stilwell 
were called back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Service was accused of treason for sharing top-secret  
documents with a left-wing publication, Amerasia. A grand jury 
voted against indicting Service. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1950, Joseph McCarthy named Service as one of 14  
Communist Party members with close ties to the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Service was cleared by a Senate committee, but in December 1951,  
amid questions of his loyalty, Secretary of State Dean Acheson 
fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	Service challenged the dismissal, and in 1956 the Supreme Court  
ruled unanimously in his favor. He rejoined the State Department, 
taking an obscure post in the Liverpool consulate before retiring 
in 1962.

Friday. She was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Willis Marie Van Schaack, St. Cyr studied ballet and worked  
as a chorus girl before making her breakthrough in vaudeville as a 
striptease artist. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Cyr also worked briefly in films, appearing in such B movies  
as ``The Naked and the Dead,'' in 1958, based on the Norman Mailer 
novel. Other films included ``The Miami Story'' in 1954 with Barry 
Sullivan, and ``Son of Sinbad'' in 1955 with Dale Robertson and 
Vincent Price.

 *J.C. Viviers    	
</P>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- J.C. ``Koos'' Viviers, a  
journalist who helped direct a probe that led to the downfall of an 
apartheid prime minister, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Viviers advised and encouraged a team of reporters who uncovered  
a secret multimillion-dollar fund used to purchase newspapers at 
home and abroad, said Mervyn Rees, one of the reporters. The 
project was aimed at changing public opinion in favor of white 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Viviers was deputy editor of the Sunday Express, which uncovered  
the scandal with reporters from a sister newspaper, the Rand Daily 
Mail. The probe led to the resignation of Prime Minister John 
Vorster in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspapers' investigation was conducted for two years and  
involved hundreds of leads in the United States, Britain and other 
countries, Rees said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Viviers became editor of the Eastern Province Herald in  
Port Elizabeth. He later became editor of the Cape Times in Cape 
Town. He was also a board member of Independent Newspapers, a 
publishing chain. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Maureen.  

</P>
<P>
 *Julius Wechter    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Julius Wechter, a marimba player with Herb  
Alpert's Tijuana Brass who composed ``Spanish Flea,'' died Monday 
of lung cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	``Spanish Flea'' was recorded by Alpert and more than 60 others.  
It was used as the theme for television's ``The Dating Game'' and 
has been heard on everything from commercials to the soundtrack of 
``Beverly Hills Cop II'' to a recent episode of the TV series ``The 
Simpsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wechter's musical career began at age 5 when he started playing  
piano. He played with small bands during college, he went on to 
play marimba for Martin Denny in Hawaii for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wechter returned to Los Angeles to do studio work with such  
performers as the Beach Boys, Sonny &AMP; Cher and the Righteous 
Brothers. That work led to a spot in Alpert's band. 
</P>
<P>
	At Alpert's urging, Wechter formed the Baja Marimba Band, whose  
trademark song was ``Comin' in the Back Door.'' The nine-person 
group recorded 18 albums in five years.

<HEADLINE> Quaker Oats Profit Almost Triples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Quaker Oats Co.'s profit nearly tripled in  
the fourth quarter, but its income from continuing operations 
slipped as a slump in its cereal business offset strong Gatorade 
sports drinks sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Cap 'N Crunch cereals, oatmeal and Rice-A-Roni  
reported Thursday it earned $73.2 million, or 50 cents a share, in 
the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $25.6 million, or 20 cents 
a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 8.1 percent to $939.8 million from $1.05 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The company has been steadily selling businesses not considered  
essential to the core cereals and sport drinks business. That has 
resulted in one-time charges against earnings and makes its 
operating income a more reliable measure of performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Income from continuing operations fell to $89.5 million, or 30  
cents a share, from $90.6 million, or 22 cents a share, the same 
period a year ago as sales in its hot cereals business fell 
sharply. Quaker blamed that on unseasonably warm weather through 
most of the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street had expected the company to post operating earnings  
of 29 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by First 
Call Corp. Quaker's stock fell $3.06 1/4 to $51.50 a share in trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Quaker's domestic and Canadian Gatorade sales continued to  
perform well in the quarter, up 14.4 percent to $151.9 million from 
$132.8 million a year earlier. Sales in Latin American inched up 
1.7 percent, while sales in Europe and the Asian-Pacific region 
slumped nearly 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, net income was $396.6 million, or $1.97 a  
share, in contrast to a loss of $1.064 billion, or $6.80 a share, 
in 1997 when the company took charges on the sale of its Snapple 
drink line. 
</P>
<P>
	Net sales fell to $4.8 billion from $5.02 billion.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Plays New Video at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to recoup its credibility in the  
courtroom over a disputed computer demonstration, Microsoft Corp. 
played a new videotape at its trial Thursday but failed to include 
an important assertion from the original video that the government 
had challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the overall results vindicated its arguments that  
government efforts to disable Internet functions within its Windows 
software cause serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recorded the new demonstration overnight in a  
conference room overlooking the White House at its law firm, under 
scrutiny of government lawyers and computer experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's video showed an IBM laptop behaving oddly, causing  
strange crashes and unusual flashing screens in parts of Windows 
after the government modified it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the system is in a very confused state,'' Microsoft  
senior vice president James Allchin said during the demonstration. 
``It's definitely not well right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The video also showed several ways to browse the Internet  
despite government attempts to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft illegally ``tied'' its  
Internet browser software into Windows, which forced consumers who 
use its computer operating system also to use its browser. It 
sought to modify Windows to refute Microsoft's claims that its 
browser is inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft acknowledged that it was unable to duplicate one  
disputed segment that purported to show that the government's 
tinkering caused its Internet software to run dramatically slower. 
</P>
<P>
	On the original video, another Microsoft employee said: ``It's  
taking a very long time, however -- unusually long -- to access that 
Web site. That's a result of the performance degradation that has 
occurred because of running the (government) program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyer David Boies showed that a title  
bar for the Internet software suggested Microsoft's test actually 
used a version of Windows unaltered by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	When Windows was tested with the government's changes, ``you  
didn't have this delay,'' Boies charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said Thursday it couldn't guarantee in its overnight  
tests that identical laptops achieved comparable connection rates 
to the Internet, which would have ensured a fair demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone situation was a real mess,'' Allchin explained. He  
said on the new video that the obviously slow Internet performance 
``has nothing to do'' with the government's changes. 
</P>
<P>
	But spokesman Mark Murray maintained that in the company's  
previous tests, Allchin had ``personally witnessed the degradation 
under lab conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had criticized  
Microsoft's earlier video demonstration as unreliable after Boies 
pointed out inconsistencies in a four-minute segments during two 
days of dramatic courtroom confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Allchin eventually explained that Microsoft had edited together  
video segments of several different computers so it appeared a 
single computer was being tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said Thursday that the flawed video had been intended as  
``an illustration of what we found in the laboratory.'' Microsoft 
lawyer Steven Holley called it ``now infamous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being ravaged under cross-examination over two days,  
Allchin maintained his humor in the new video, showed unedited 
during 70 minutes in court. 
</P>
<P>
	When Allchin confessed he wasn't sure at one point whether to  
restart the laptop for one test, he murmured: ``Well, I don't mind 
a little risk.'' Then his eyes widened, his lips pursed. 
</P>
<P>
	When one program in the test prompted him to enter his birth  
date before proceeding, he deadpanned: ``OK, apparently I was born 
yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge told lawyers in a private meeting that he didn't  
believe Allchin had deliberately falsified the tests, according to 
a transcript obtained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that he deliberately falsified this, but it  
does cast doubt on reliability of (the original video) 
altogether,'' the judge said in Wednesday's meeting at the close of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge added that Boies ``has done a very professional job of  
discrediting those tapes.''

<HEADLINE> Researchers Study Plankton Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pity the poor plankton, at the base of the  
food chain and getting no respect. 
</P>
<P>
	But those tiny oceanic plants are drawing plenty of attention  
these days from scientists studying plankton's role in global 
climate and what keeps more of it from growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the big questions in oceanography is how the ocean  
responds to changes in climate. One thing that's very important is 
the role of phytoplankton in cycling carbon and other elements,'' 
taken up from the atmosphere, explained Michael J. Behrenfeld of 
Rutgers University. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scientists believe that increasing levels of carbon dioxide  
in the atmosphere threaten to cause a rise in the Earth's average 
temperature. Plankton are one of the natural systems removing 
carbon from the air, using it in their respiration and storing some 
of it when they die and sink to the bottom of the seas. 
</P>
<P>
	But lack of certain nutrients, such as iron, nitrogen or  
phosphorus, limit the amount of plankton that can grow in large 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld and co-researcher Zbigniew S. Kolber report in  
Friday's issue of the journal Science that they have developed a 
way to tell when lack of iron is that limiting factor. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of experiments in 1993 and 1995 scientists added  
liquefied iron compounds to areas with limited plankton and 
observed a massive bloom of the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	But that type of experiment can only be done on a small area,  
Behrenfeld explained in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But in NASA-funded research, Behrenfeld discovered that during a  
24-hour cycle plankton show a pattern of fluorescence which, though 
not visible to the naked eye, can be measured by shipboard 
instruments. This pattern varies if the plants have insufficient 
iron, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld said his system can be used to test for lack of iron  
over large areas, helping scientists better understand plankton 
growth and what problems it faces. 
</P>
<P>
	Theoretically, it could also identify prime areas that could be  
enriched with iron to cause increased growth of plankton with the 
aim of removing more carbon from the air -- what some call the 
``Geritol solution'' to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrenfeld, however, was reluctant to call for action  
immediately, warning that ``there are a lot of uncertainties in 
that step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term addition of iron could result in a complete change in  
species distribution in a region, he said, and ``there is a lot of 
understanding that needs to be gained about ecological responses'' 
before iron enrichment can be recommended.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Export Sales / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rallied Thursday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade after the government reported surprising 
export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans initially retreated after the U.S. Agriculture  
Department reported soybean meal and oil exports in the past week 
were weaker than expected. But prices rallied on the government's 
news that an unknown foreign buyer had purchased 275,000 metric 
tons of soybeans for delivery this marketing year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were supported by weekly export sales of 588,300  
metric tons, well above market expectations and a sharp improvement 
over lackluster demand from the past few weeks. Corn futures also 
saw unexpected heavy export demand, but sharp gains were limited by 
expectations any rally would again prompt heavy farmer selling of 
stored crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 2 cents to $2.67 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.17 1/4 a bushel; March oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.06 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans rose 1 1/4 cents to $5.08 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange in continued enthusiasm tied to the government's 
announcement it soon will begin shipping pork and beef products to 
economically beleaguered Russia under an aid package announced late 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .38 cent to 67.35 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .50 cent to 74.30 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose the limit 2 cents to 45.92 cents a pound; March pork bellies 
rose the limit 3 cents to 60.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Rivalries Punctuate Millrose Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Wanamaker Mile, usually the flagship event  
of the Millrose Games, might be overshadowed by Suzy Hamilton and 
Regina Jacobs in the women's mile Friday night at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Even meet director Howard Schmertz thinks the rematch of last  
year's 1-2 finishers could be the premier event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton and Jacobs, also ranked 1-2 in the United States, are  
bitter rivals and their simmering feud is gaining momentum. That's 
why the women's race could take attention away from the men's mile, 
which has produced such great champions as Eamonn Coghlan, Glenn 
Cunningham, Marcus O'Sullivan, Kip Keino, Paavo Nurmi, Noureddine 
Morceli, Gil Dodds, Filbert Bayi, Ron Delany, Steve Scott and Marty 
Liquori. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good for the sport when they have matchups like  
this,'' Hamilton said. ``Everyone knows that Regina and I don't 
like each other that much and we're not that friendly. 
Personality-wise, we are totally different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs is the 1997 world indoor 1,500-meter champion, the 1997  
world outdoor 1,500 silver medalist and the winner of two medals at 
last year's World Cup, helping the U.S. women win the title for the 
first time. She agrees her battle with Hamilton is beneficial for 
track and field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an interesting rivalry because a lot of people get  
involved in it and enjoy watching us go at it and race against one 
another,'' she said. ``She has great speed. I have great speed and 
that always makes it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our competitiveness is what makes a great race. I want to beat  
her and she wants to beat me. It's not like we're friends, kiss, 
kiss, let's go out ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the pairing is important and people enjoy seeing  
people battle it out. People are coming to see the rivalries. They 
pick a side and it makes for an exciting evening. The rivalry is 
great for the sport and I wish it had happened sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hamilton-Jacobs matchup is among several highlights of the  
92nd Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be Maurice Greene and Jon Drummond in the men's 60,  
Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines in the women's 60, Mark Crear and 
Reggie Torian in the men's 60 hurdles, Johnny Gray and Rich Kenah 
in the men's 800, Jeff Hartwig and Lawrence Johnson in the men's 
pole vault, Mark Everett and Tyree Washington in the men's 500, 
Melissa Morrison and Angie Vaughn in the women's 60 hurdles, and 
Joetta Clark and Meredith Valmon in the women's 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh yes, the Wanamaker Mile will feature a matchup among two  
Americans -- 1999 U.S. leader Richie Boulet and 1998 NCAA champion 
Seneca Lassiter of Arkansas -- and two foreigners -- William Tanui, 
the 1992 Olympic 800 champion from Kenya, and two-time Millrose 
winner Niall Bruton of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those other matchups, however, is as keen as the one  
between Hamilton and Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton won last year's race in 4 minutes, 30.91 seconds, with  
Jacobs the runner-up in 4:33.26. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, 35, never has won at the Chase Millrose Games, also  
having finished second to Mary Slaney in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Howard (Schmertz) is going to keep inviting me back until I  
get it right,'' she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	This might be the year she ends the drought.  
</P>
<P>
	She had an outstanding season in 1998. In addition to her two  
medals at the World Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa -- a silver in 
the 5,000 meters, a bronze in the 3,000 -- she set the American 
record for the 5,000 (14:52.59 at Brunswick, Maine) and won the 
Fifth Avenue Mile in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And she began her indoor season this year by winning a mile in  
4:33 over the slow boarded track at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-laps-to-the-mile Garden track also is notoriously slow,  
but not as slow as San Diego's, which had not been used in about 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is making her 1999 debut, but also is coming off a big  
1998 season. In her best performance, she became the second 
American, after Slaney, to go under four minutes for 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hamilton and Jacobs plan on chasing Slaney's outdoor 1,500  
record of 3:57.12 this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only about 1 1/2 seconds from the record,'' Hamilton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She went under four minutes before I did,'' Jacobs said of  
Hamilton, ``but I'm not going to let her break the record before 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoken like a true rival.  
</P>
<P>
	The two also will compete Sunday at Boston in the New Balance  
Invitational: Jacobs, in the 3,000, where she will be chasing Lynn 
Jennings' American record of 8:40.45, and Hamilton in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night's meeting probably will be the only one between  
Hamilton and Jacobs indoors, leaving the rivalry to simmer until 
the outdoor season.

	Senate To Show Lewinsky Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today voted to permit the showing  
of portions of Monica Lewinsky's videotaped deposition after 
dealing a bipartisan brush-off to a personal appearance in 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Parts of her recorded 
deposition are to be played at the nationally televised trial 
session Saturday. Republicans retreated from their plan to find 
Clinton guilty of wrongdoing without removing him from office as 
senators moved to bring the trial to a conclusion by the end of 
next week. ``I do think it's time we get to a vote and we move on'' 
to other issues, said Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.

	King Hussein Rejects Transplant

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A gravely ill King Hussein left a U.S.  
hospital today after an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant and 
headed back to Jordan. The king's trip home came only 10 days after 
he had abruptly traveled to the United States seeking care for a 
relapse of lymphatic cancer. The condition of the 63-year-old 
Hussein ``has become critical due to the failure of the function of 
internal organs,'' the king's private physician said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is considering  
sending U.S. ground troops to Kosovo as peacekeepers if a peace 
accord is reached in the war-torn province. ``The time to stop this 
conflict in Kosovo is now,'' he said, ``before it spreads, and when 
it can be contained at an acceptable cost.'' Meanwhile, in 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Serbia's parliament agreed to join peace 
talks on Kosovo starting this weekend in France. Serbian lawmakers 
passed a strongly worded declaration that approved attending the 
talks -- but refused to grant independence for Kosovo.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two missiles that hit civilian areas in  
southern Iraq last week killed 17 people -- including 10 children -- 
and injured 100 others, according to a U.N. report obtained by The 
Associated Press today. The report did not say who fired the 
missiles that landed in the poor Al-Jumhuriya neighborhood in the 
port city of Basra and in the village of Abu Khasib, 16 miles to 
the south, on Jan. 25.

	Butler Likely To Leave UNSCOM Post  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With Russia and China demanding his  
resignation, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said today 
he was unlikely to remain at his post beyond June 30. The former 
Australian diplomat who became a focus of controversy in the arms 
inspection dispute with Iraq also said he was not seeking a spot on 
a new panel that will make recommendations on Iraq's disarmament. 
Russia and China have accused Butler and the commission of 
provoking U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq in December by 
reporting that Baghdad had failed to live up to its pledge to 
cooperate with weapons inspectors.

little mouse'' if he goes free. The judges from the House of Lords 
said they would begin private considerations and announce ``in due

General Assembly tomorrow, challenging settlement activities as a 
violation of the Geneva conventions. The move comes despite Israeli 
objections that the session violates the spirit of the fraying 
Mideast peace deal struck in October and sets a dangerous precedent

Mideast War, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

tonight. In front of a record crowd of 12,443 -- some of whom waited 
outside for nearly 24 hours before tipoff -- the Gators (16-4, 7-3 
Southeastern Conference) opened up a 14-point lead midway through

<HEADLINE> Dow Makes Up Most Losses; Off 1.55 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average erased early  
losses and swung briefly into positive territory in early afternoon 
but abruptly retreated again. The broader market remained lower 
amid a sell-off in technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 1.55 at 9,365.26. The Dow erased 91-point loss and moved up to 
positive 31 points, at 9397.96 before pulling back a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Decliners never lost their lead on advancers, however, and were  
still leading by more than 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Volume was 690.32 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, 
below Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite was down 41.33 at 2,452.08, and the  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composit was down 14.77 at 1,257.30. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad market was down on aggressive profit-taking in  
computer-related shares. Dell Computer was down 4 at 103 7/8 in Nasdaq 
trading. One exception was online trading companies, which were 
posting strong gains J.B. Oxford Holdings, an online trader, was up 
6 1/16 at 18 1/16 in leading Nasdaq volume. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was up earlier on the strength of economically sensitive  
stocks, such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up xxx at xx,x 
and International Paper, up xxx at xxx. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is growing sponsorship behind the cyclical stocks and  
economically sensitive stocks, as people gain confidence that the 
economy is going to remain positive,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, 
director of market analysis, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc., St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was also held up by Eastman Kodak, up xxx at xxx. The  
company announced it would develop new flat-panel display 
technology with Japan's Sanyo Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But the broader market was weaker, as investors pounded  
technology shares lower. Computer chip maker Advanced Micro Devices 
was down 2 1/8 at 18 13/16 in leading volume on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock after the company 
pulled out of two high-profile technology conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of competitor Intel were down 6 at 132 11/16 in Nasdaq  
trading. Intel lowered its prices in January, in a move that 
analysts fear may spark a price war in semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, stocks rose as investors were relieved that  
Federal Reserve had not raised interest rates at a policy meeting 
that wrapped up Wednesday afternoon. But talk swirled today that 
the Fed's long-term strategy will be to raise rates, in a bid to 
cool the economy in the face of a round of bullish economic data. 
</P>
<P>
	Some portfolio managers are sitting out the market ahead of  
Friday's release of January employment data, fearing that the 
report will show a drop in unemployment that could put even more 
pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates. Higher rates are not 
good for stock prices because they raise corporate financing costs 
and can cut into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a possible early peak at that data, the Labor Department said  
this morning that the number of new unemployment claims fell 9,000 
in the week ended Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other pieces of bullish economic news, the Commerce  
Department reported a 2.3 percent jump in orders to U.S. factories 
in December but said they rose just 2.1 percent for all of 1998, 
the weakest showing in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	And retailers reported strong January sales figures, but  
Wal-Mart shares were unchanged at 85 3/4, after reporting that sales 
at stores open at least a year rose 10.3 percent during the four 
weeks ended Jan. 29.

<HEADLINE>  Rivalries Punctuate Millrose Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Wanamaker Mile, usually the flagship event  
of the Millrose Games, might be overshadowed by Suzy Hamilton and 
Regina Jacobs in the women's mile Friday night at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Even meet director Howard Schmertz thinks the rematch of last  
year's 1-2 finishers could be the premier event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton and Jacobs, also ranked 1-2 in the United States, are  
bitter rivals and their simmering feud is gaining momentum. That's 
why the women's race could take attention away from the men's mile, 
which has produced such great champions as Eamonn Coghlan, Glenn 
Cunningham, Marcus O'Sullivan, Kip Keino, Paavo Nurmi, Noureddine 
Morceli, Gil Dodds, Filbert Bayi, Ron Delany, Steve Scott and Marty 
Liquori. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's good for the sport when they have matchups like  
this,'' Hamilton said. ``Everyone knows that Regina and I don't 
like each other that much and we're not that friendly. 
Personality-wise, we are totally different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs is the 1997 world indoor 1,500-meter champion, the 1997  
world outdoor 1,500 silver medalist and the winner of two medals at 
last year's World Cup, helping the U.S. women win the title for the 
first time. She agrees her battle with Hamilton is beneficial for 
track and field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an interesting rivalry because a lot of people get  
involved in it and enjoy watching us go at it and race against one 
another,'' she said. ``She has great speed. I have great speed and 
that always makes it interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our competitiveness is what makes a great race. I want to beat  
her and she wants to beat me. It's not like we're friends, kiss, 
kiss, let's go out ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the pairing is important and people enjoy seeing  
people battle it out. People are coming to see the rivalries. They 
pick a side and it makes for an exciting evening. The rivalry is 
great for the sport and I wish it had happened sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hamilton-Jacobs matchup is among several highlights of the  
92nd Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be Maurice Greene and Jon Drummond in the men's 60,  
Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines in the women's 60, Mark Crear and 
Reggie Torian in the men's 60 hurdles, Johnny Gray and Rich Kenah 
in the men's 800, Jeff Hartwig and Lawrence Johnson in the men's 
pole vault, Mark Everett and Tyree Washington in the men's 500, 
Melissa Morrison and Angie Vaughn in the women's 60 hurdles, and 
Joetta Clark and Meredith Valmon in the women's 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh yes, the Wanamaker Mile will feature a matchup among two  
Americans -- 1999 U.S. leader Richie Boulet and 1998 NCAA champion 
Seneca Lassiter of Arkansas -- and two foreigners -- William Tanui, 
the 1992 Olympic 800 champion from Kenya, and two-time Millrose 
winner Niall Bruton of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those other matchups, however, is as keen as the one  
between Hamilton and Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton won last year's race in 4 minutes, 30.91 seconds, with  
Jacobs the runner-up in 4:33.26. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, 35, never has won at the Chase Millrose Games, also  
having finished second to Mary Slaney in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Howard (Schmertz) is going to keep inviting me back until I  
get it right,'' she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	This might be the year she ends the drought.  
</P>
<P>
	She had an outstanding season in 1998. In addition to her two  
medals at the World Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa -- a silver in 
the 5,000 meters, a bronze in the 3,000 -- she set the American 
record for the 5,000 (14:52.59 at Brunswick, Maine) and won the 
Fifth Avenue Mile in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And she began her indoor season this year by winning a mile in  
4:33 over the slow boarded track at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-laps-to-the-mile Garden track also is notoriously slow,  
but not as slow as San Diego's, which had not been used in about 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is making her 1999 debut, but also is coming off a big  
1998 season. In her best performance, she became the second 
American, after Slaney, to go under four minutes for 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hamilton and Jacobs plan on chasing Slaney's outdoor 1,500  
record of 3:57.12 this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only about 1 1/2 seconds from the record,'' Hamilton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She went under four minutes before I did,'' Jacobs said of  
Hamilton, ``but I'm not going to let her break the record before 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoken like a true rival.  
</P>
<P>
	The two also will compete Sunday at Boston in the New Balance  
Invitational: Jacobs, in the 3,000, where she will be chasing Lynn 
Jennings' American record of 8:40.45, and Hamilton in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night's meeting probably will be the only one between  
Hamilton and Jacobs indoors, leaving the rivalry to simmer until 
the outdoor season.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges MIA Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China pledged cooperation in looking for  
information on U.S. servicemen missing in action from the Korean 
War, but has not agreed to open its archives to Pentagon 
investigators, defense officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert L. Jones, deputy assistant secretary of defense for  
POW/Missing Personnel Affairs, just returned from leading a U.S. 
delegation to China for a weeklong visit with Chinese and U.S. 
officials to discuss ways to resolve cases among 8,100 servicemen 
still listing as missing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said Jones used the trip ``to explore opportunities  
for access to Chinese archives,'' according to a press release, but 
Beijing hasn't opened the doors yet. Defense Secretary William 
Cohen personally asked Chinese President Jiang Zemin for archive 
access in January 1998 in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Chinese records of the war may hold the key to  
resolving the fates of many of our missing servicemen from the 
Korean War,'' Jones said in a statement. ``The Chinese have been 
very cooperative in our investigations of Southeast Asia and World 
War II losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the Chinese located sites where World War II  
servicemen crashed on the Korean Peninsula and led U.S. 
investigators to remote areas from which recovery teams brought 
back remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, China has helped three U.S. teams with logistical  
support for remains recovery operations in North Korea and has 
helped the Pentagon recover remains within Chinese territory in 
several cases of missing servicemen from the Vietnam War and World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese have pledged continued cooperation,'' Jones said.  
``We are grateful for their continued assistance in this 
humanitarian mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese forces entered the 1950-53 Korean War in the fall of  
1950 to support North Korea against the U.S.-led U.N. forces 
fighting for South Korea. China took control of the prisoner-of-war 
camps in North Korea and the Chinese also took some American POWs 
across the border into China for interrogations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon researchers were granted access to North Korea's  
archives for the first time in 1997. The Defense Department has 
taken a go-slow approach with China on what remains a delicate 
issue.

but not as slow as San Diego's, which had not been used in about 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is making her 1999 debut, but also is coming off a big  
1998 season. In her best performance, she became the second 
American, after Slaney, to go under four minutes for 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hamilton and Jacobs plan on chasing Slaney's outdoor 1,500  
record of 3:57.12 this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only about 1 1/2 seconds from the record,'' Hamilton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She went under four minutes before I did,'' Jacobs said of  
Hamilton, ``but I'm not going to let her break the record before 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoken like a true rival.  
</P>
<P>
	The two also will compete Sunday at Boston in the New Balance  
Invitational: Jacobs, in the 3,000, where she will be chasing Lynn 
Jennings' American record of 8:40.45, and Hamilton in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night's meeting probably will be the only one between  
Hamilton and Jacobs indoors, leaving the rivalry to simmer until 
the outdoor season.

<HEADLINE> Magic Counting on Penny Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- In a sense, Penny Hardaway feels like he's  
starting all over. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget that he's a four-time All-Star, two-time All-NBA first  
team and a former member of the Olympic Dream Team. He begins his 
sixth professional season Friday night feeling he has to prove 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Magic missed the playoffs last season for the first  
time in his career, largely because he appeared in just 19 games 
due to knee and calf injuries that raised questions about his 
toughness and durability. 
</P>
<P>
	He angered some players by returning from surgery earlier than  
expected to play in the All-Star game last February, only to be 
sidelined for the year the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people lost confidence in me because I was injured  
and didn't play any last year,'' said Hardaway, the subject of 
trade talks much of the season. ``I've set some goals that I'm 
going to keep personal and just try to go out and play good 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway acknowledged that the rigors of a condensed 50-game  
season will be a stern test for him physically after missing 86 
games the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm a better player mentally because I know the game  
better. I can see things a lot better now, and I think I can do 
some of the same things I did a couple of years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic are counting on it after struggling to a 41-41 finish  
without him last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has added center Ike Austin, who gives Orlando its  
first real low-post threat since Shaquille O'Neal left three years 
ago. And, general manager John Gabriel wouldn't mind adding another 
scoring option, possibly the aging Dominique Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key to climbing back to championship contention is still  
Hardaway. His move back to point guard was facilitated by the 
reemergence of Nick Anderson, who averaged almost 24 points a game 
following the All-Star break last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Penny back healthy, I really truly believe that we can  
play with anybody,'' said second-year coach Chuck Daly, who with 
the addition of Austin envisions the Magic being better equipped to 
play the tough, physical style of ball he prefers. 
</P>
<P>
	A front line of Austin, Horace Grant and Bo Outlaw, combined  
with a backcourt of the 6-foot-7 Hardaway and 6-foot-6 Anderson, 
gives Orlando one of the biggest starting lineups in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question about our strength, size  
and physical qualities when we put our best unit out there,'' Daly 
said. ``We won't be the quickest team in the league, but I'm going 
to tell you that is a very big, strong team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly remains interested in signing Dennis Rodman, whom he  
coached while leading the Detroit Pistons to two NBA championships. 
However, management is lukewarm about taking on a player with a 
history of making headlines off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins might be a more realistic option, especially with the  
Los Angeles Lakers pursuing Rodman. The 39-year-old brother of 
Magic player Gerald Wilkins last played in the NBA during the 
1996-97 season and averaged over 18 points per game for the San 
Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-time All-Star in 14 NBA seasons, Wilkins has a career  
scoring average of 25.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect for improvement has Hardaway smiling again after  
two long, mostly painful years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is going to be pretty scary,'' he said after the  
signing of Austin, whom he thinks gives Orlando a chance to be one 
of the top three teams in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to get respect around the league again. ... That's  
something we haven't had since Shaq left.''

<HEADLINE> Bunk-Bed Safety Standards Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lynn Starks-Williams grew up assuming bunk  
beds were safe. She slept and played in them as a child. As a 
parent, she bought a set for her little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	She never could have imagined the popular double-deckers as  
death traps until she walked into her daughter's bedroom one 
morning and found the 3-year-old hanging from one. 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter, Whitney, is among the 57 children who have died  
since 1990 in bunk bed accidents, usually after getting their heads 
stuck in guard rail gaps or the space between the frame and 
headboard, said the Consumer Product Safety Commission. At least 59 
others have been in ``near-misses'' since then. 
</P>
<P>
	The accidents prompted the commission Wednesday to propose  
mandatory guidelines to help reduce the number of children who die 
from getting trapped in bunk beds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe a mandatory rule offers the best opportunity we have  
to solve the tragic problem before us,'' said Commission Chairwoman 
Ann Brown. ``These deaths can be prevented, if only the companies 
who make these beds would follow the safety standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules would mirror voluntary standards that have  
existed for nearly a decade. They call for any gap to be less than 
3 1/2 inches and guardrails on both sides of the top bunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would put teeth into our effort to bring the rest of the  
industry into conformance, ... imposing little, if any, new costs 
on manufacturers who already are conforming to the voluntary 
standard,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has recalled more than a half-million bunk beds  
since November 1994, but Brown said most manufacturers adhere to 
the guidelines. Her concerns stem from the importers and small 
manufacturers who ``make 40 or 50 bunk beds in their garage and 
then go out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed standards were approved by two of the three panel  
members. Commissioner Mary Sheila Gall abstained, saying agency 
investigators have ``not produced sufficient evidence to conclude 
that a mandatory rule would significantly reduce the risk of 
serious injury.'' She said she decided to abstain rather than 
oppose the proposal because she wanted an open discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is expected to make a final recommendation in  
four to six months after receiving public comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Starks-Williams, who lives in Oklahoma City, said she  
learned through the Internet about the numerous bunk bed-related 
deaths and recalls only after her daughter died. 
</P>
<P>
	``That really just made me mad, that this had gone on so long  
and nothing had ever been done about it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	After helping Oklahoma lawmakers last year pass state standards  
on bunk bed manufacturing, Mrs. Starks-Williams said she is closely 
watching the move toward passing federal regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to let my daughter's death be in vain,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Trial Starts in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A court-martial began today for a  
Marine pilot whose jet clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 
people, with the judge ruling the defendant won't be questioned 
about a missing videotape if he testifies. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby's trial on 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter began one day after the first anniversary of the 
tragedy that happened when the wing of his EA-6B Prowler sliced 
through cables supporting the Mount Cermis ski gondola in Cavalese, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, noted today that Ashby faces  
a separate court-martial on obstruction of justice charges for 
allegedly destroying a videotape shot during the flight. Forcing 
him to testify about it during his manslaughter trial could violate 
his constitutional protection against self-incrimination, Nunley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunley added the disappearance of the tape demonstrated a  
``consciousness of guilt'' on Ashby's part. He said Ashby and his 
navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, asked after the flight what 
they should do with the tape and one of the two backseat crewmen, 
Capt. Chandler Seagraves, replied, ```I'd get rid of it if I were 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A second, blank videotape was substituted for the missing tape,  
prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer faces a separate court-martial in the accident;  
unlike Ashby, he had agreed to have the obstruction of justice 
charges combined with his manslaughter and homicide counts in a 
single trial. Charges were dismissed against Seagraves and the 
other man in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley granted motions by CBS and Rolling Stone magazine to  
quash subpoenas issued them by prosecutors for outtakes and notes 
from their interviews with Ashby and Schweitzer. CBS' ``60 
Minutes'' broadcast a segment on the case Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``The First Amendment guides me here, and most of the statements  
were self-serving anyway and not incriminatory,'' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley ruled that if Ashby takes the stand, prosecutors will be  
allowed to interview an expert witness on computer flight 
simulation. He didn't elaborate on how the testimony of the expert 
related to Ashby's participation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nunley refused a request by Schweitzer's attorneys to dismiss  
charges against him. He said that decision would be up to a 
different judge who was named to preside at Schweitzer's 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection began later today with questions directed at 15  
potential jurors, all officers of rank equal to Ashby's or higher. 
Lawyers can reduce the size of the panel if they detect an 
objectionable bias, and the court-martial can proceed with a panel 
as small as five members. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the jet was flying too low and too fast and  
that the cable wouldn't have been struck if Ashby had followed 
flight rules. The gondola cable hung about 370 feet above the 
ground, and the minimum altitude for the mission was 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say the accident was not Ashby's fault, noting  
that the 33-year-old cable system wasn't marked on the map Ashby 
was given before he began a low-level training flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., could be sentenced to more  
than 200 years in prison if convicted of all charges, which also 
include destruction of government and private property and 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two  
Austrians and one Dutch person died in the Feb. 3, 1998, accident. 
Attorneys for the victims are seeking damage payments from the U.S. 
government.

<HEADLINE> January Retail Sales Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- January proved to be a better-than-expected  
month for the nation's retailers, who saw big sales gains as 
Americans bought up deeply discounted merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong sales reported Thursday pleased merchants who had  
anticipated that consumers would scale back their spending in 1999 
amid expectations that global financial turmoil would slow down 
U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is more robust that most people expected it would  
be,'' said Steve Paspal, senior retail analyst at Sovereign Asset 
Management, a subsidiary of John Hancock Funds. ``How can that not 
help retail sales?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers continue to benefit from low unemployment and  
inflation, which also have helped to raise consumer confidence. 
Separately Thursday, the Labor Department reported the number of 
Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits 
fell by 9,000 to 292,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the healthy economic climate, consumers still are  
value-conscious. That's why many shopped in January -- which is 
typically considered a time to find good deals as retailers slash 
prices clear out their winter inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers feel that the economic situation is good for them  
right now, but they still are not frivolous spenders,'' said Kurt 
Barnard, a retail consultant and president of Barnard's Retail 
Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``They still need an 
incentive to buy, and most of the time, it's all about price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That helped discounters outperform the rest of the retail  
sector. Shoppers flock to stores like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart 
for their affordable prices and wide selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Department stores also fared well in January, luring shoppers  
with big bargains. They also benefited from seasonal winter 
weather, which bolstered sales of sweaters and coats. 
</P>
<P>
	There were exceptions, notably J.C. Penney, which continued to  
struggle at its department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty stores, including the Gap and the Limited, showed  
healthy sales gains for last month, especially those specializing 
in home furnishings, electronics and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	January's strength followed a mixed Christmas for retailers, who  
faced a slow start to the season but managed to achieve respectable 
sales by dropping prices right before and after the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts still expect solid fourth-quarter and year-end  
earnings. For most retailers, the fiscal year ended in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up 6.4 percent in January. It rose 3.4 percent in December and was 
up 5.1 percent in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported sales from  
stores open at least a year rose 10.3 percent from a year earlier, 
while total sales were up 17.3 percent. Sales from stores open at 
least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the most 
accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales up 2.6 percent, total sales down 3.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 8.5 percent, total sales up 9.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 0.1  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 13 percent, total 
sales up 6.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 9.6 percent, total sales up  
15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 7.3 percent, total sales up 7  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 5.3 percent, total  
sales up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 11 percent, total sales fell 5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 15 percent, total sales up 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Diane Sawyer Serves Bad Chili </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The idea went down as bad as the chili.  
</P>
<P>
	ABC has shelved a ``20/20'' segment where a half-dozen employees  
were fed bad chili at lunch in Diane Sawyer's home and then 
secretly videotaped to see if they complained about the food. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, which was to be part of a story on the social pressure  
put on people to lie, was abandoned after at least one of the eight 
duped associate producers expressed some discomfort about it, ABC 
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not worth it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer had invited the producers to her Manhattan apartment to  
discuss story ideas over lunch. Two vats of chili were prepared -- 
one normal, which Sawyer ate, and one heavily salted that was fed 
to the junior staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Sawyer briefly excused herself from the room, and  
the cameras zeroed in on the producers' reaction. While there were 
some complaints, Sawyer was even defended by someone who speculated 
that perhaps a top fell off a salt shaker. At no point did anyone 
complain to their boss. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sawyer explained the ruse, ``most people laughed,'' Murphy  
said. One staff member expressed concern about being on camera, but 
the others said they had no problem being in the segment. 
</P>
<P>
	But upon further reflection, ABC realized it had set up another  
experiment in social etiquette. Were the producers really 
comfortable with having their reactions televised or were they just 
saying so because they knew their bosses wanted the story on the 
air? 
</P>
<P>
	ABC decided it was best just to leave the videotape on the  
cutting room floor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, the eight producers were fed a real lunch when  
they got back to the office. Sawyer promised to treat them to 
another lunch soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel terrible if anyone was upset by this,'' Sawyer said  
Thursday. ``It was simply meant to be an innocent `Candid Camera' 
moment, catching people in the act of being polite which, for the 
record, they all were.''

<HEADLINE> Senate To Show Lewinsky Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trial-weary senators moved briskly on Thursday  
to wrap up President Clinton's impeachment proceedings, voting to 
permit the showing of portions of Monica Lewinsky's videotaped 
deposition after dealing a bipartisan brush-off to a personal 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of her recorded deposition are to be played at the  
nationally televised trial session on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	As lawmakers settled that issue, Republicans retreated from  
their plan to find Clinton guilty of wrongdoing without removing 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	With those decisions, the senators moved to bring the trial to a  
conclusion by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think it's time we get to a vote and we move on'' to  
other issues, said Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in her trial deposition, Ms. Lewinsky told House  
prosecutors she still has ``mixed feelings'' for Clinton and 
continues to admire him. She insisted he did not encourage her to 
lie when he informed her in a late-night call that she might become 
a witness in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony slated to be made public Friday and obtained by The  
Associated Press late Thursday, Ms. Lewinsky also cast doubt on 
Clinton's sworn testimony that he told her she might have to turn 
over gifts he gave her if they were ever subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did the president ever tell you to turn over the gifts,'' Rep.  
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., asked during a deposition videotaped Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not that I remember,'' Ms. Lewinsky answered.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's acquittal is assured on the charges of perjury and  
obstruction of justice, which stem from his efforts to conceal a 
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republicans backed away from their plan to find Clinton  
guilty of wrongdoing before the trial ends, Senate Democratic 
leader Tom Daschle said lawmakers in his party were putting the 
finishing touches on a censure proposal. He said he wants it voted 
on either during an interruption in the proceedings or after the 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate's decisions on Thursday, prosecutors and White  
House lawyers will have up to three hours each to make 
presentations including portions of videotaped depositions on 
Saturday. In addition to Ms. Lewinsky, lawyers questioned 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal earlier this week and recorded the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	An effort by the House prosecutors to call Ms. Lewinsky for live  
questioning was rejected, 70-30, with 25 of the Senate's 55 
Republicans joining the 45 Democrats in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla, pleaded with the senators: ``I think  
that it is eminently fair that we be allowed to present at least 
one witness live to you, the central witness in the cast of this 
entire proceeding and that is Monica Lewinsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But White House special counsel Gregory Craig argued the other  
side, cautioning that her testimony could ``produce an avalanche of 
unwelcome'' testimony ``into the living rooms of the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart said in a  
written statement: ``Today's vote rejecting the House managers' 
request for live witnesses indicates the Senate appears ready to 
bring this trial to a conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Ms. Lewinsky, said the former  
White House intern ``and her family are pleased that she does not 
have to go through the painful and humiliating ordeal of having to 
testify on the floor of the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's session unfolded as the White House formally rejected  
a request from Senate Republicans for Clinton to submit to a sworn 
deposition. ``It is neither necessary nor appropriate for the 
president to testify,'' White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff wrote 
Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote against calling Ms. Lewinsky was a rebuff to Rep. Henry  
Hyde and other House prosecutors, who had pushed the two articles 
of impeachment through the House on a near party-line vote. They 
won grudging Senate permission a week ago to depose the three 
witnesses, but only after paring their list down from a dozen or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before the vote, one House prosecutor aired his  
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one senator has failed to personally sit through ... every  
deposition, that senator is not equipped to render a verdict on the 
impeachment trial,'' said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif.. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsequent bid by Democratic Sen. Patty Murray to keep the  
videotapes out of presentations at the trial failed. The vote was 
73-27, with 20 Democrats joining 53 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Republican prosecutors -- and White House defenders --  
free to use segments of the taped depositions on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken together, the day's votes underscored that senators in  
both parties are eager for a swift conclusion to the trial, near 
the end of its fourth week. Republicans, in particular, have been 
laboring to find an exit from a proceeding that is unpopular with 
the public and that GOP strategists say is inflicting political 
damage on the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor did Demorats refrain from drawing attention to the political  
repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes the more it becomes a partisan trial, a  
Republican trial,'' Daschle told reporters before the day's session 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes unfolded on the Senate floor, with Chief Justice  
William Rehnquist presiding, as Republicans edged away from a 
confrontation over their proposal to delineate wrongdoing by 
Clinton before the final vote on his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had attacked the proposal as unconstitutional, and  
Republicans said they had no interest in provoking a partisan 
confrontation. At the same time, Republicans were divided among 
themselves over the constitutionality -- and the political wisdom -- 
of such a vote, and its passage could not be assured. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most recent form, the proposal said that Clinton  
``willfully provided false and misleading testimony to the grand 
jury'' empaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In addition, 
it said Clinton had ``wrongfully engaged in conduct to delay the 
discovery and to cover up the existence of evidence and alter 
testimony related to a federal civil rights lawsuit and a United 
States grand jury investigation.'' The lawsuit refers to the claim 
that Paula Jones filed against the president, since dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the session, the White House asked prosecutors to  
give them precise information on what video excerpts they planned 
to show on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan argued against it, quoting a former California judge as  
once saying, ``It's none of your damn business what the other side 
is going to put on.'' Majority Republicans backed him up, 54-46. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the trial began on Jan. 8, a spectator  
in the gallery disrupted the proceedings. ``God almighty, take the 
vote and get it over with,'' called out a man before he was hustled 
out by security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Police identified the man as Richard Douglas Llamas, a District  
of Columbia resident, and charged him with disruption of Congress.

<HEADLINE> IRS Clears Gingrich Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is said to have  
cleared an organization of charges that it violated its tax-exempt 
status when it helped finance a college course taught by former 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS ruled after a three-year investigation that The Progress  
and Freedom Foundation's donations to Gingrich were ``consistent 
with its stated exempt purposes,'' and that Gingrich's course and 
course book ``were educational in content,'' the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization, which posted the IRS decision on its Web page,  
welcomed what it said was a ``clean bill of health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An IRS spokesman said the agency is barred by law from  
commenting on rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one likes being audited by the IRS,'' said the foundation's  
president, Jeff Eisenach. ``In this case, though, it was important 
for the IRS to resolve the questions raised by the House ethics 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that investigation, special counsel James M. Cole concluded  
that Gingrich, in a class titled ``Renewing American 
Civilization,'' which he taught at two Georgia colleges, was funded 
by tax-exempt charities for activities that were ``substantially 
motivated by partisan, political goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich denied violating tax laws and described his college  
course as nonpartisan. But he agreed to pay a $300,000 penalty for 
his misleading statements to the ethics committee as it 
investigated the financing of the college course and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling, the IRS said the content of Gingrich's course  
``was educational and never favored or opposed a candidate for 
public office.'' It said the foundation ``did not intervene on 
behalf of candidates of the Republican Party merely by promoting'' 
themes in the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation, headquartered in Washington, D.C., says it is  
dedicated to studying the digital revolution and its implications 
for public policy.

<HEADLINE> Wallace Hopes Winter Bodes Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Rusty Wallace really doesn't care  
that it's been six years since a driver who led winter testing also 
won the pole for the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 NASCAR Winston Cup champion is just happy to be  
included among the favorites for the 1999 season's first pole as 
practice opens Friday on the 2 1/2-mile oval at Daytona International 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, the talkative Wallace has come to the season opener  
with high hopes and mouth in gear, but has gone away in a funk 
after running into all manner of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to make any predictions,'' Wallace said with a  
grin. ``I've learned not to do that and I'm just going to say I 
feel real prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two reasons Wallace has high hopes are the January lap of  
193.129 mph he ran at Daytona in his new Ford Taurus, as well as 
the full year he has spent as Jeremy Mayfield's teammate, sharing 
data and working together to make both his Penske Racing South and 
Mayfield's Kranefuss-Penske teams better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you we were as legal as you can make it when we ran  
that lap,'' Wallace said. ``We've got a fast car, and so does 
Jeremy. I really think we have a chance at the pole, no matter 
what's happened in the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Mayfield finished third and Wallace fifth at Daytona  
in their first effort as teammates. The solid start by the two was 
virtually overlooked in the excitement over the victory by Dale 
Earnhardt in his 20th attempt to win NASCAR's crown jewel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to have two identical cars in Daytona,'' Wallace said.  
``They should come off the truck and run the same speed. Right now, 
our speeds are better than they were, so we feel like we're just 
better. But no predictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winter testing can be extremely misleading, with the teams  
trying a variety of new things and not having to get their cars 
through a NASCAR technical inspection until Thursday or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just say we see a lot of things that are a bit different  
when they get to the tech shed,'' noted Gary Nelson, who oversees 
the inspection process as NASCAR's Winston Cup director. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who was the crew chief for Kyle Petty in 1993 when Petty  
led winter testing and backed it up by winning the Daytona pole, 
added, ``You know, these guys are extremely creative, and that's 
good for the sport. That's the way new things come up. We've still 
got some gray areas that they can use to experiment, but we have to 
be pretty careful not to let it get out of hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If things go according to the results of winter testing, Jeff  
Gordon, Petty and Dale Jarrett will be the top drivers vying with 
Wallace for the two front row positions that will be locked in at 
Saturday's first-round qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon was second fastest in the Daytona testing at 192.452 in a  
Chevrolet Monte Carlo, followed by Petty's Pontiac Grand Prix at 
192.452 and the Ford of Jarrett at 192.139. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, brothers Bobby and Terry Labonte swept the front row  
positions, with Bobby leading the way at 192.415. He went on to 
finish second, while Terry, working with then-new crew chief Andy 
Graves, wound up 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Terry was ninth on the speed list at 191.465, while  
Bobby was an uncharacteristic 33rd at 190.062. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't go that fast, but we learned a lot and we got our  
work done,'' Bobby said. ``I think we can give (the pole) a run 
again this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is counting out Earnhardt, either. The seven-time Winston  
Cup champion, won from fourth last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another opportunity to win,'' said Earnhardt, who was  
30th in testing at 190.130. ``Now that we've done it, there's no 
reason to think we can't do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following Saturday's qualifying, time trials will continue  
Monday and Tuesday. The speeds from those three days will 
determined the starting lineups for Thursday's two 125-mile 
qualifying races that fill positions three through 30 for the 
500-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	Positions 31 through 36 go to the fastest remaining drivers from  
the three days of qualifying, and the rest of the 43-car field is 
filled with provisional starters based on last year's top 40 in the 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	If needed, the 43rd spot in the lineup is used for any former  
series champion who fails to make it any other way.

<HEADLINE>  Victoria's Secret Webcasts Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The first Internet broadcast of Victoria's  
Secret's Spring Fashion Show turned out to be a bust for some 
people after millions of fans jammed the site, causing major 
technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Web surfers who hoped to catch a glimpse of supermodels  
strutting around in racy lingerie were instead greeted with jagged 
video and audio problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``That says to me the technology in not up to snuff,'' said  
Wendy Hargle, a computer technician in Berkeley, Calif., who tried 
to view the show. ``Someone did not anticipate the level of 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The much-hyped fashion show was held in New York and marked a  
milestone for the Internet. It was one of the first large-scale 
live video events in which a corporation invested money and 
prestige. 
</P>
<P>
	A television ad for the 14-minute event was shown during  
Sunday's Super Bowl, and other ads were placed in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was Webcast using ``streaming video'' technology.  
Streaming video allows Web surfers to view live video without 
downloading large files. The quality of the video depends on the 
number of people watching, how powerful the computers are and how 
congested Net traffic is. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the show, Anne Marie Blaire, senior manager of Internet  
brand development for Victoria's Secret, said the computers -- run 
by Broadcast.com -- were configured to handle between 250,000 and 
500,000 simultaneous viewers. Figures for the total number of 
people viewing the Web site during the show would not be available 
until later today.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Considers Big Ten Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Notre Dame never wanted to just be part of a  
crowd. For years, the Fighting Irish protected their football 
independence so fiercely that they didn't even go to bowl games, 
much less join a conference. 
</P>
<P>
	After today, even that might change.  
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the school's trustees on whether to go ahead  
with negotiations to join the Big Ten affects millions of dollars 
in bowl and TV revenues, recruiting and academics, among other 
things. More importantly, Notre Dame's status as the national, 
Catholic American university could be forever altered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notre Dame's identity nationally is so linked to football that  
people worry if the football program were restricted from a 
national schedule to a regional schedule, that would have an impact 
on the identity,'' said Notre Dame professor Gregory Sterling, who 
favors the move. ``This is touching the nerve center of the 
university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the decision affects far more than the football  
team, how joining the Big Ten would affect the Irish legacy, which 
includes 11 national championships and great coaches like Knute 
Rockne and Frank Leahy, is of utmost concern to most with ties to 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing we're really addressing here is the extent to  
which the athletic department is advanced or not by virtue of our 
football program changing its status,'' said athletic director Mike 
Wadsworth, who played football for the Irish in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	As an independent, Notre Dame takes home every cent of its gate  
receipts, all of proceeds from bowl payouts and an estimated $7 
million a year in its exclusive TV contract with NBC, which is 
expected to jump to $8 million a year for the 2000-2005 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But as a member of the Big Ten, it would enter a revenue sharing  
program that splits up a portion of each school's gate receipts 
from football and basketball, bowl revenues, TV contracts and 
proceeds from the NCAA basketball tournaments, Big Ten commissioner 
Jim Delany said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether you're up or you're down, those bowl  
revenues are there,'' Delany said. ``Whether you in the Rose Bowl 
or not, you get the money. Whether you're on ESPN or not, you get 
money. So, basically it's a shared risk, shared upside, shared 
downside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should the trustees, meeting in London to dedicate a new Notre  
Dame facility there, decide to proceed with talks to join the 
conference, school and Big Ten officials will still have to decide 
several issues. But Delany anticipates no problems to resolve those 
``competitive and financial issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be disappointing if they're not interested in taking the  
next step,'' Delany said. ``It's somewhat implicit that when we 
decided to contact Notre Dame as the first institution to talk to, 
that we felt they would be the best fit for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Problem is, an overwhelming majority of Notre Dame alumni don't  
think the Irish are a good fit for the Big Ten, in part because the 
decision has academic implications as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame, known for its undergraduate programs, trails far  
behind the Big Ten schools in research and graduate programs. Some 
see joining the Big Ten as a way to improve those programs because 
conference affiliation also includes membership in the Committee on 
Institutional Cooperation, the academic arm of the Big Ten that 
includes all 11 conference schools and the University of Chicago. 
It allows the schools to share resources freely. 
</P>
<P>
	But some also see that as a threat to Notre Dame's Catholic  
identity, especially in a conference of secular schools, and some 
Big Ten presidents have grumbled privately that Notre Dame's weak 
graduate programs are not a good fit for the Big Ten, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our brand name is something special. We'd rather be one of one  
than one of 12,'' said Chuck Lennon, executive director of the 
Alumni Association. ``Not that we're better than anybody. We're 
different, and I think that's important because there is a very 
positive feeling about the quality of the Big Ten academically and 
athletically, but it just is not the right mix for us.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Hope To Stop Cuba Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress met with baseball union  
head Donald Fehr on Thursday to seek his help in blocking a pair of 
proposed exhibition games between the Baltimore Orioles and a Cuban 
all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers are among several who object to the games as  
``insensitive to the lack of human rights in Cuba,'' said Ivette 
Mendez, spokeswoman for Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd be playing and giving the world the view, `Hey,  
everything is OK in Cuba,'' Menendez said. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended the 45-minute meeting with Fehr and Reps. Dan  
Burton, R-Ind.; Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.; Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.; 
and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla. Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen are 
Congress' only two Cuban-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The games were proposed after the Clinton administration decided  
in January to ease the four-decade-old U.S. trade embargo against 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, negotiations on setting up the games have run into  
roadblocks. The Clinton administration wants any proceeds from the 
games used to help the Cuban people. Cuban officials say any 
profits should go to Cuban doctors doing hurricane relief work in 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	The original idea was for the Orioles to play in Havana in late  
March, with the Cuban team playing in Baltimore the following 
month.

<HEADLINE> AMA, Editor Resolve Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Less than a month after firing the editor of its  
medical journal over a published sex poll, the American Medical 
Association had kind words for him in announcing an agreement that 
will let him contribute articles to the publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. George Lundberg was fired Jan. 15 by AMA President E.  
Ratcliffe Anderson Jr. after publishing the survey to coincide with 
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Ratcliffe said it 
inappropriately interjected the organization into a political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA and Lundberg issued a statement Wednesday saying they  
had resolved ``substantive differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said Lundberg ``intends to devote the same effort,  
skill and determination that he brought to JAMA for nearly two 
decades to critical medical and health issues, as well as 
contributing to scientific medical research and journalism, 
including JAMA, subject to editorial discretion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA did not elaborate, and Lundberg and his attorney did not  
return telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg's firing prompted an outcry from some in the profession  
who said it damaged the journal's credibility and editorial 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey in JAMA showed 59 percent of college students  
questioned by the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and 
Reproduction didn't consider oral-genital contact as having ``had 
sex.''

<HEADLINE> Strickland Not Thrilled With Deal </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rod Strickland, newly signed to a $40 million  
contract, chuckled when asked if he finally was getting the payday 
he deserved after 10 years as one of the NBA's best point guards. 
</P>

``That's the bottom line.''

said about him lately and that he was not thrilled with the final 
deal that got him into the Washington Wizards camp one day before 
tonight's regular season opener at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take a lot of things personal, and during the negotiations I  
took some things very personal,'' Strickland said. ``It obviously 
wasn't the deal we wanted, but it was a deal that was good enough 
to get me to play basketball this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland, who signed a four-year, $40 million deal, said he  
was ready to put the episode behind him and help the Wizards get 
back to the playoffs. To his credit, he looked in pretty good shape 
at his first practice, going the full 2 1/2 hours without dragging. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a better team with Rod,'' coach Bernie Bickerstaff said.  
``I don't know at what point we become better because of his 
conditioning. ... I'll just leave the intrigue out there. I don't 
know whether he'll start Friday. He could, but it's a good 
possibility he won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Strickland is up to speed, last year's NBA assists leader  
will team with six-time All-Star Mitch Richmond to form perhaps the 
best backcourt in the league. Without him, the Wizards certainly 
would have been also-rans in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God,'' Richmond said. ``I am so glad this got done. I am  
so glad this is over. Now we can get down to business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards still have a big question mark in the middle.  
Lorenzo Williams was declared out for the season Thursday with 
stress fractures in both feet, and Ben Wallace has a sprained 
ankle. That leaves Terry Davis, Otis Thorpe and Jahidi White to 
play center-by-committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Strickland back in the fold, at least there is enough  
perimeter talent to complement Juwan Howard and possibly make some 
noise in the shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited and overjoyed,'' Howard said. ``With him, our  
chances are good as far as making it to the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland said he thought he either would have to sit out the  
season or sign a one-year contract with another team for a minimal 
amount. Talks stalled for more than a week as Strickland's agent, 
David Falk, and general manager Wes Unseld traded barbs in public. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakthrough came when owner Abe Pollin told Unseld --  
against Unseld's wishes -- to increase the team's offer. The Wizards 
had offered three years for $27 million, while Strickland wanted 
five years at $55 million. In the final deal, all but $5 million of 
the $40 million is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	During his negotiations, Strickland was upset by the perception  
the Wizards were shortchanging him because of his age and his 
off-the-court problems last year, including a drunken driving 
conviction, a fight with a teammate in a hotel, routine tardiness 
and a poor diet. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Falk tried to improve his client's bargaining  
position by saying Strickland had improved his diet, worked himself 
into great shape and had ``changed his lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That turned out to be mere propaganda.  
</P>
<P>
	``That new man stuff?'' said Strickland, shaking his head and  
making a slashing motion across his throat. ``I'm the same person. 
Obviously I worked out real hard. I think that's why I wasn't as 
bad as I thought I might be today.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Wants Drug Smuggling Stopped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate Republicans accused President  
Clinton on Thursday of failing to get tough on drugs by funding 
programs to stop smuggling from other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., called Clinton's drug policy one of  
``Just say maybe'' rather than ``Just say no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way we can win this is to just say `no,''' he said at  
a news conference. ``This is a serious war. This is not a war you 
just say `maybe' about. This is a war you win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal 2000 seeks $17.8 billion  
for drug-fighting programs, a slight decrease from the $17.9 
billion this year, which includes $844 million in emergency 
supplemental funding. 
</P>
<P>
	About 14 percent of the 2000 funding would go to international  
and interdiction programs, compared with nearly 18 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``As this number goes down, the supply goes up,'' said Sen. Paul  
Coverdell, R-Ga. ``As the supply goes up, the price goes down. As 
the price goes down, use goes up. That's why interdiction is 
useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Republicans were upset they could find no  
evidence that Clinton funded a special program that Congress and 
the White House agreed to last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	That law authorizes $2.6 billion over three years -- $690 million  
of it in 2000 -- for equipment, training and other interdiction 
tools for the Coast Guard and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the House Judiciary  
subcommittee on crime, called the omission a travesty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not even beginning in the president's plan to wage the  
kind of war we said a couple of months ago we should do,'' McCollum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the White House drug policy office did not  
immediately return telephone calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall's anti-drug law included provisions that mandated the  
use of foreign aid as leverage to urge other nations to keep up 
anti-drug efforts, upgraded some technology and intelligence tools 
that American law enforcement officers use in intercepting illegal 
drugs and provided U.S. aircraft and helicopters to Bolivia, 
Colombia and Peru to help eradicate drug crops.

<HEADLINE> China Dissidents Set Up New Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese dissidents set up five new branches of a  
banned opposition political party today, even as a court sentenced 
an exiled democracy campaigner to jail for helping a party leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The branches of the China Democracy Party were the first  
dissidents have dared set up since China's communist rulers 
launched a crackdown on the group more than two months ago. Six 
party members have been jailed, the three most influential leaders 
to sentences of 11 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissidents in Hebei, the northern province that surrounds  
Beijing, declared their new branch in a fax sent to foreign news 
organizations in the capital. It lists the group's three officers. 
The branch secretary used a pseudonym ``Xing Min,'' which means 
``awaken the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other four branches were set up by dissidents in Henan and  
Liaoning provinces and the provincial cities of Xi'an and 
Huanggang, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights 
and Democratic Movement reported. 
</P>
<P>
	They bring to at least 16 the number of branches across China  
since three dissidents declared the party's founding in June. 
Loosely coordinated to prevent police infiltration, the branches 
have drawn between 200 and 500 members, members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alarmed by the party's appeal at a time of growing discontent  
among laid-off workers and poor farmers, Communist Party leaders 
ordered the crackdown in November. President Jiang Zemin vowed to 
annihilate challengers to the communists' 50-year monopoly on 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	The party's three most prominent members, including founding  
member Wang Youcai, were all put on trial for trying to subvert 
China's communist-led system. 
</P>
<P>
	An exiled democracy campaigner who sneaked back into China and  
gave Wang $1,000 was sentenced today to four years in prison, his 
wife said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang Ce defended himself last week at a two-hour trial against  
charges of illegally entering China and financing subversive 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intermediate People's Court in Hangzhou city called Wang's  
family today morning to tell them of the verdict, said his wife, 
Tang Xuanzhong. She said the court officer did not specify what 
Wang was convicted of. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very disappointed, of course,'' Tang said. ``We did not  
endanger state security. All of the facts prove that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wang left China in 1984, earned a doctorate in political science  
at the University of Hawaii and was chairman of an exiled political 
group, the Freedom and Democracy Party. 
</P>
<P>
	He sneaked across the border between Vietnam and Yunnan province  
in October and traveled to Hangzhou in eastern China to meet with 
Wang Youcai. Soon after, both were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang Ce ``violated Chinese law by illegally entering China and  
held forged identification and engaged in activities endangering 
national security,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Wang Ce argued his innocence. He said he sneaked into  
China because authorities refused to renew his passport. He 
contended he gave money to Wang Youcai because he was jobless and 
having financial troubles, not because he was funding subversive 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in southwestern Sichuan have sent two leaders of a  
protest by laid-off steel workers to a labor camp for disturbing 
social order, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Dingkui and Yan Jinghong were given 1 1/2 and 1-year terms on  
Jan. 20, the group said. Chinese police can sentence citizens 
without trial for up to three years in labor camps.

<HEADLINE> Heat Ready To Erase Playoff Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Any distaste from the six-month NBA lockout quickly  
dissipated for Miami Heat players. The sour feeling from May's 
early playoff exit still lingers. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Heat tip off Friday night against Detroit, they will be  
intent on erasing memories of Miami's ugly first-round ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something of a redemption year for us,'' center Alonzo  
Mourning said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat won their second consecutive Atlantic Division title  
last season but were eliminated 3-2 by the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami led the series 2-1 before the tide turned in a wild win by  
the Knicks in Game 4. A fight between Mourning and New York's Larry 
Johnson with 1.4 seconds left led to both players being suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Minus Mourning's presence in the middle and with Tim Hardaway's  
shooting touch gone cold, the Heat went on early vacation with a 
98-81 Game 5 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't forgotten how the season ended last year,'' said  
Mourning, who was spared from missing the season opener when NBA 
officials erased the rest of his suspension. ``It was a learning 
experience, without a doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat returns with its core group of players -- Mourning,  
Hardaway, forwards Jamal Mashburn, P.J. Brown and Mark Strickland 
and guards Voshon Lenard, Dan Majerle and defensive whiz Keith 
Askins. 
</P>
<P>
	It's hoped that will give them an edge over several teams that  
their remade rosters on the fly after the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be able to catch some teams in transition,'' coach Pat  
Riley said. ``There are those who had to bring in a lot of new 
faces that have to learn or be taught.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the Heat could use an old face to step up as an  
offensive threat. Mourning and Hardaway combined for 34 percent of 
Miami's points last year, with no consistent third option. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternatives narrowed as training camp opened when Lenard was  
found to have a stress fracture in his left leg. Lenard tried to 
play through it during the preseason, but didn't show the same 
intensity. He'll open the season on injured reserve and could be 
lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite his courage and his desire to play, I want to make  
sure this is taken care of. He's done until this heals,'' Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a positive note, Mashburn looks fully recovered from an  
injury-plagued few seasons which included arthroscopic knee 
surgery, a broken cheekbone and last year's broken thumb which 
caused him to miss the final two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn owns an 18.4 career scoring average and was scoring at  
a 15.1 clip last season before the injury. Riley has mused about 
keeping him in for 48 minutes while playing multiple positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been anxious,'' Mashburn said. ``I put forth a lot of  
hard work in the summer. I was ready to go by the middle of the 
summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two new faces also should provide an offensive lift. Terry  
Porter, a 14th-year veteran, was signed as a backup guard and owns 
a 13.4 career average. Clarence Weatherspoon, who can play power 
forward or small forward, has averaged 15.0 points in his six-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Subtract Lenard, and that still gives the Heat a nine-player  
rotation heavy on versatility. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley did some calculating after the NBA's 50-games-in-90-days  
schedule came out. Take away game days, travel days and rest days 
before or after back-to-back games, and just 13 days are left for 
in-season practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be nothing but games and travel,'' Riley said.  
</P>
<P>
	With cohesion and depth likely to play a bigger role this  
season, a fast start could mean a lot when it comes to playoff 
positioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Eastern Conference teams, the Heat and Indiana Pacers  
appear to have the early edge in those two categories. The Pacers 
return with their team almost completely intact and spent much of 
the lockout working out together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were here pretty much, too. We played a lot during the  
offseason,'' Brown said. ``Maybe we weren't as organized as 
Indiana, but I like our chances.''

<HEADLINE> HMOs Said to Influence Non-HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The power of managed care may be even greater  
than you'd expect. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only do health maintenance organizations help reduce the  
overall cost of health care for their members, but they appear to 
cut medical expenses for those in traditional insurance as well, 
suggests a study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Managed care seems to have a spillover effect,'' said Uwe  
Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Health expenses for patients in traditional Medicare plans tend  
to fall in regions with growing HMOs, according to a study by 
Stanford University researcher Laurence Baker. He surmises that 
doctors in regions with fast-growing HMOs order fewer tests and cut 
other costs even for their patients who aren't in HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings suggest doctors used to treating HMO patients alter  
their practice habits in treating all patients either out of 
convenience or because they agree with the more conservative HMO 
treatment style, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether patients with traditional insurance get better care  
because their care is similar to that in an HMO remains open for 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's study is one of the first to draw attention to the  
impact managed care has to all patients, not just those in HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's findings raise doubts about suspicions that doctors  
treat patients differently based on their insurance coverage, said 
Reinhardt, who wrote an accompanying editorial in this week's 
edition of JAMA. Economists, he said, have long assumed doctors 
were influenced by how they are paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This article says the world is more complicated, and doctors  
are not the economic animals that our economic models suggest they 
are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined Medicare costs from 1990 to 1994, a time when  
HMO market share increased nationally from 15 percent to 20 
percent. The study accounted for a number of factors that influence 
health costs, including the age and health status of patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker found that as HMO market share increased in a region from  
10 percent to 20 percent, Medicare hospital costs fell by 2 percent 
and Medicare physician and outpatient expenses fell by 1.5 percent. 
Medicare costs fell even more sharply in regions where HMO market 
share was bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the average Medicare expense per beneficiary was about  
$3,270. 
</P>
<P>
	Several reasons could explain how HMO cut costs for patients not  
in HMOs. The presence of health plans in a community tend to spur 
construction of more lower-cost health settings such as outpatient 
surgery centers and HMO doctors influence how non-HMO doctors 
practice, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Baker concludes the most likely cause is that doctors treat  
all of their patients the same way. And if HMOs move doctors to 
limit hospitalizations and expensive tests for their members, 
doctors follow the same approach for all their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of patients think that they can escape the effects of  
managed care by joining some other type of health plan,'' Baker 
said. ``In places with a lot of managed care that is not true.''

<HEADLINE> Clippers Sign Sherman Douglas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers might have found  
their starting point guard just one day before the start of the NBA 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Free agent Sherman Douglas, who has averaged 11.8 points, 6.5  
assists and 2.3 rebounds in 656 games spanning nine professional 
seasons, signed a contract with the Clippers on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, who signed a one-year deal believed to be worth between  
$2 million and $2.5 million, will be in uniform tonight when the 
Clippers face the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers also announced that rookie forward Brian Skinner, a  
first-round draft choice, and veteran guard Scott Brooks were 
placed on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas, 32, averaged 8.0 points and 4.0 assists for the New  
Jersey Nets last season. He starred in a first-round playoff series 
against the NBA champion Chicago Bulls, averaging 18.3 points and 
8.3 assists in three games. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been waiting to see if Rod Strickland would re-sign with  
the Washington Wizards. Once that happened Wednesday, the Clippers 
were the only team left that could pay him much more than the 
veteran minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sherman is somebody we've been talking about for a long  
time,'' said first-year Clippers coach Chris Ford, who coached 
Douglas in Boston and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1 Douglas, who practiced with the Clippers for the  
first time Thursday, was taken by the Miami Heat with the 28th 
overall selection of the 1989 draft after playing at Syracuse. He 
had his best season in 1990, when he averaged 18.5 points and 8.5 
assists in 73 games with the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner, the 22nd selection in last summer's draft, underwent  
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Wednesday and is expected to 
be sidelined for at least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks strained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee  
in the Clippers' preseason opener against the Los Angeles Lakers 
last Friday night and will be out about four weeks.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Reaches Another Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky reached another milestone Thursday  
night when he scored his 1,071st goal as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal in the New York Rangers' game against the Vancouver  
Canucks tied Gretzky with Gordie Howe, who scored that total in his 
combined 26-year career in the NHL and old World Hockey Association 
including regular season and playoffs. Gretzky is in his 21st pro 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who broke Howe's NHL career goal scoring record on  
March 23, 1994, against Vancouver, had 56 goals in the WHA with 
Indianapolis and Edmonton to go along with his regular season and 
playoff total 1,015 in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's latest achievement is not considered a record by the  
NHL, since the league does not recognize the WHA in its record 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky matched Howe's overall total Thursday night when he beat  
Garth Snow with a quick shot from the lower right circle at 16:21 
of the second period after taking a cross-ice pass from Petr 
Nedved. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the eighth goal of the season for Gretzky, who once  
scored a record 92 one year with the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said before the two greatest players in history were  
Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr,'' Gretzky said. ``This is a unique 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to have played in both the NHL and the WHA. I will  
remember this a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Cable Car Trial Begins for Pilot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Twenty people plummeted to their  
deaths when a Marine jet piloted by Capt. Richard Ashby flew low 
over the Italian Alps, struck a cable and sent the group's gondola 
crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's trial on 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter was to  
begin with jury selection today -- one day after the first 
anniversary of the tragedy that occurred when the wing of the EA-6B 
Prowler jet sliced through cables supporting the Mount Cermis ski 
gondola in Cavalese, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the jet was flying too low and too fast and  
that the cable wouldn't have been struck if Ashby had followed 
flight rules. The gondola cable hung about 370 feet above the 
ground, and the minimum altitude for the mission was 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say the accident was not Ashby's fault.  
</P>
<P>
	Two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two  
Austrians and one Dutch died in the Feb. 3, 1998 accident. 
Attorneys for the victims are seeking damage payments from the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service was held Wednesday in Italy for the victims.  
</P>
<P>
	``The pain that one year ago visited the lives of so many people  
is our pain,'' the Rev. Renzo Caserotti said. ``It is a death that 
could have been avoided, caused by an airplane that flew very low, 
outside all rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., could be sentenced to more  
than 200 years in prison if convicted of all charges, which also 
include destruction of government and private property and 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen jurors, all officers of rank equal to Ashby's or higher,  
were appointed by the same general who ordered that Ashby be 
charged. During questioning today, lawyers can reduce the size of 
the panel if they detect an objectionable bias, and the 
court-martial can proceed with a panel as small as five members, 
said base spokesman Maj. Scott Jack. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening arguments are set for Monday, and the entire proceeding  
is expected to last two weeks. The court-martial is being held at 
this sprawling Marine base in eastern North Carolina because the 
jet was stationed at nearby Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	A central defense issue is whether Ashby, the only pilot aboard  
the four-man aircraft designed to detect and jam enemy radar, 
obeyed the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and defense attorneys have agreed the 33-year-old  
cable system wasn't marked on the map Ashby was given before he 
began a low-level training flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Civilian defense lawyer Frank Spinner said air crews rely on the  
maps they are given by the government. Ashby shouldn't be blamed 
for the tragedy, which briefly strained relations between the 
United States and Italy, Spinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a Marine investigation panel ruled that the air crew  
was at fault. The report said the jet was too low and flying faster 
than the 450-knot air speed restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	All four members of the crew were charged initially, but the  
charges against the two back seat crewmen were later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., also is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter 
and will be tried after Ashby's court-martial ends. Schweitzer 
shared the front cockpit of the jet with Ashby but had no control 
stick.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Pitcher Jones Gets Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Tigers closer Todd Jones, who had one  
year left on his old contract, agreed Thursday to a three-year deal 
worth $10,125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a 30-year-old right-hander, originally agreed to a  
contract with salaries of $2.25 million in 1998 and $2.95 million 
in 1999, and gave the Tigers a $3.8 million option for 2000 with a 
$500,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal pays him $2.5 million this year, $3.65 million in  
2000 and $3,975,000 in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is starting his third year with the Tigers after spending  
his first four major league seasons with the Houston Astros. He has 
saved 59 games for Detroit over the past two seasons and is fifth 
on Detroit's career saves list. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 1-4 last season with 28 saves and a 4.97 ERA in 65  
games. He struck out 57 and walked 36 in 63 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones came to the Tigers in a December 1996 trade along with  
center fielder Brian Hunter, pitcher Doug Brocail and infielder 
Orlando Miller. Houston got catcher Brad Ausmus and pitcher C.J. 
Nitkowski.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Raid South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes attacked south  
Lebanon today shortly after rockets were fired toward Israel, 
Lebanese security officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	No rockets landed in Israeli territory, said an Israeli army  
spokesman in Jerusalem, who confirmed the air raids. There was no 
immediate word on casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli spokesman said mortar shells were fired at Israeli  
positions in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lebanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
at least two rockets were fired this morning toward the Israeli 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear what prompted the attack and there was no  
immediate claim of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour after the rockets were fired, two Israeli  
fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles at the outskirts of 
Majel Zoun, a village 25 miles southwest of Marjayoun, the main 
town in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	The village, about 3 miles north of the Israeli border, is  
believed to be used by Lebanese guerrillas as a launching pad for 
attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen in 
the occupied zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group and the  
pro-Syrian Amal movement carried out attacks against Israeli troops 
and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army in various areas along 
the front line. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate statements issued in Beirut, both Hezbollah and  
Amal, which are vying for domination of Lebanon's 1.2 million 
Shiite Muslims, claimed their fighters scored ``direct and sure 
hits'' in the mortar, rocket and machine gun attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lebanese security officials said there were no  
casualties. There were no other details of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The border region where Lebanese guerrillas confront Israeli  
troops and SLA militiamen has been generally calm in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hezbollah guerrillas operating in southern Lebanon have fired  
rockets at northern Israel in the past in retaliation for Israeli 
army attacks that targeted Lebanese civilians in the southern 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	The guerrillas also have attacked Israeli army border posts and  
some rockets have overshot the border unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to try to oust 1,500  
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied zone.

<HEADLINE> Gun Makers Seek To Deflect Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Unwilling to spend billions to settle litigation  
as the tobacco industry did, gun makers and the National Rifle 
Association are firing back, lobbying state officials to outlaw 
lawsuits seeking to recover the cost of gun-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may bankrupt us, but we are never going to settle,'' said  
Bob Baker, president of Freedom Arms Inc., which manufactures 
high-end revolvers in Freedom, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Five cities -- Chicago, New Orleans, Atlanta, Bridgeport, Conn.,  
and the unified Miami-Dade County government in Florida -- have sued 
various gun makers. Atlanta, site this week of the nation's largest 
gun and hunting trade show, filed its lawsuit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayors of other cities say they are planning similar litigation.  
</P>
<P>
	But the industry and the NRA, which boasts 3 million members and  
relies on more than 80 million registered gun owners, are using 
their considerable political clout to halt the lawsuits before the 
legal fees add up. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the mayors are going to find out is that a direct attack  
on the freedom to bear arms is the toughest briar patch they can 
jump into,'' NRA vice president Wayne LaPierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think that there is no cost, and this is a way to a quick  
buck, like tobacco money. But their cost, politically and 
economically, is going to be high, because we're determined to 
expose this for the sham that it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Georgia, where the Democratic attorney general and governor  
were both endorsed by the NRA last year, a bill banning such 
lawsuits passed the House and looks headed to easy approval in the 
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation is being considered in Louisiana, while the  
Wyoming Legislature is considering a law that would require the 
attorney general to protect state interests -- anything from filing 
a friend-of-the-court brief to actually representing a gun maker -- 
if a gun maker was sued. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said he is considering federal legislation  
that would prohibit cities from filing such suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the cities won the lawsuits, they wouldn't get anywhere  
near the $250 billion that the far wealthier tobacco industry paid 
the states to settle. 
</P>
<P>
	Only $376 million in guns were sold in 1997, according to the  
trade organization American Firearms Industry. That amounts to less 
than three days' worth of cigarette sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, whose public nuisance suit asks  
for $453 million in damages, is not after money, spokesman John 
Camper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago would not take a penny if we could just get the  
handguns off the streets,'' Camper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago suit claims gun makers and dealers purposely flood  
the suburbs with guns, making it easier for criminals in Chicago, 
which has tougher anti-gun laws, to bring one into the city. Other 
suits seek compensation for costs incurred from gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Guns were used in 13,263 homicides and 18,232 suicides in 1996,  
the last year for which government statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
	But gun makers say they are not to blame.  
</P>
<P>
	``How can manufacturers control what law enforcement can't?  
That's what we're being asked here, and it's colossally unfair,'' 
said Steve Sanetti, vice president and general counsel for Sturm, 
Ruger and Co., a Connecticut gun maker being sued. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA President Charlton Heston said mayors have never felt the  
``heat of grassroots grassfires'' that the organization, which is 
not itself a target of the lawsuits, can generate. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry focused its lobbying efforts on the  
congressional level and an newspaper advertising campaign that 
criticized tax increases in some of the proposed settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorcin Engineering, a Mira Loma, Calif., handgun maker,  
boycotted the SHOT Show -- the major trade show this week -- because 
of the Atlanta suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's president, Jim Waldorf, posted only a sign at the  
show -- challenging Mayor Bill Campbell to a boxing match. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's done in jest as a way of pointing out how ridiculous  
these lawsuits are,'' Waldorf said. ``I'm pretty sure I could beat 
him, though.''

<HEADLINE> President To Establish Race Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is establishing an office  
within the White House to continue his campaign for racial 
reconciliation, stopping short of his advisers' suggestion that he 
create a permanent commission to deal with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House Office on the President's Initiative for One  
America will be charged with keeping alive the work begun under the 
year-long race campaign that ended last September. Two senior White 
House officials, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity, said 
the move would be announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to name deputy public liaison director Ben  
Johnson to head the office, the officials said. In his current 
capacity, Johnson serves as a liaison to minority communities. He 
could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of South Bend, Ind., Johnson joined the Clinton White  
House in 1993 in the Office of Public Liaison. In the 1970s, he 
served as director of consumer programs for President Carter. He 
also was administrator for the District of Columbia's Business 
Regulation Administration from 1983-87. 
</P>
<P>
	The office he will head would be set up similarly to the White  
House Office for Women's Initiatives and Outreach, which Clinton 
established in 1995 to ensure better outreach to women and smooth 
handling of their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	In delivering its findings, Clinton's advisory board proposed  
creating a White House office on race to work in conjunction with a 
permanent commission. One official said the fact that the president 
chose to set up an office on a smaller scale did not mean the 
effort is being given a lower priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've shunned doing councils,'' the official said. ``This is  
what the president feels more confident doing. It's easier for us 
to do it this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race board suggested last June that Clinton should establish  
a race panel patterned after the Council of Economic Advisers. The 
council consists of three full-time, paid government employees in a 
position to get to the president quickly on pressing economic 
matters. The members must be confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The race office will have a staff of about four people. Its  
director would ensure that policies that tie directly to racial 
issues on the president's agenda are ``up and running,'' one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, the official said one of the office's first  
duties will be to promote items in Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget 
plan that will have major impact in minority communities, such as 
his education proposals and his request for increased spending on 
enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The office also will have a role in advancing the race report  
that Clinton expects to release this spring.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Won't Testify Live </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate moved today to bring President  
Clinton's impeachment trial to a prompt conclusion, rejecting a 
last-ditch request by House prosecutors to summon Monica Lewinsky 
for live testimony. Republicans also shrank from a plan to declare 
the president guilty without ousting him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	With several Republicans joining Democrats, the Senate rejected,  
70-30, the prosecutors' request to issue a subpoena requiring the 
young woman at the center of the impeachment drama to testify in 
the well of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, emerging from a closed-door meeting with fellow  
Republicans, Lott declared the Senate was ``on track'' for a final 
vote on the two articles of impeachment by Feb, 12, or perhaps a 
day earlier. Democrats renewed a call for a formal censure of the 
president, but only after the trial ends with his acquittal on 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators began laying the groundwork for the trial finale,  
unanimously voting to admit into the official trial record the 
depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and 
White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. The three had been interviewed 
in private by House prosecutors earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But they turned away House prosecutors who pressed for live  
testimony by Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it is eminently fair that we be allowed to  
present at least one witness live to you, the central witness in 
the cast of this entire proceeding and that is Monica Lewinsky,'' 
Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said in making the plea. 
</P>
<P>
	White House special counsel Gregory Craig opposed Ms. Lewinsky's  
live appearance and the release of the videotapes, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it is a bad idea,'' Craig told the senators, arguing  
the tapes would ``produce an avalanche of unwelcome'' testimony 
``into the living rooms of the nation.'' He argued that only 
written transcripts should be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Aware that they are short the votes needed to convict Clinton or  
call live witnesses, the House prosecutors showed their frustration 
on the Senate floor. ``If one senator has failed to personally sit 
through ... every deposition, that senator is not equipped to 
render a verdict on the impeachment trial,'' Rep. James Rogan, 
R-Calif., chided. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said Ms. Lewinsky had been ``very  
guarded,'' choosing her words carefully to ``provide the very 
minimum of truth'' during her deposition earlier this week. ``Her 
testimony is clearly tinted and some might even say tainted by a 
mixture of her continued admiration for the president, her desire 
to protect him and her own personal views of right and wrong,'' 
Bryant lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	The request for Ms. Lewinsky's appearance was expected to lose  
as several Republicans already had indicated they would join the 45 
Democrats in opposing in-person testimony. ``It does not appear 
that the votes are there for live witnesses,'' Lott told reporters 
before the trial resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors had a fallback plan with better a chance for  
approval -- a request to show excerpts of the videotaped depositions 
in their closing arguments. To help that argument, Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson provided the first quotations from Jordan's deposition 
Tuesday concerning efforts to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky around 
the time she was emerging as a witnesses in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan testified Clinton had asked him to find the former intern  
a job and ``the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms. 
Lewinsky.'' Hutchinson argued the testimony showed Jordan was an 
unwitting agent for a president eager to thwart Mrs. Jones' lawyers 
from learning about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the proceedings, White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff  
wrote Lott today that Clinton would not submit to a deposition, as 
GOP senators requested. ``It is neither necessary nor appropriate 
for the president to testify,'' Ruff wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been trying to find an exit from a trial that  
is unpopular with the public. Democrats have increasingly referred 
to the proceedings as a ``Republican trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes, the more it becomes a partisan trial, a  
Republican trial,'' Democratic leader Tom Daschle told reporters. 
He said the Democrats were drafting a proposal to censure Clinton 
and expected to have it completed in a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Republicans also indicated today that prospects were  
dimming for a proposal that would conclude Clinton committed 
wrongdoing without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have blocked it. We don't want this to break  
into a partisan melee,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. And Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the proposal ``an effort for 
politicians to protect themselves politically. The way out is to 
vote 'guilty' or 'not guilty' and live with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the Democratic alternative would  
be written less legalistically than the articles of impeachment 
``and more in moral terms of censure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``finding of fact'' proposal pushed by some Republicans  
accuses Clinton of lying to the grand jury. They would like to vote 
on that before the actual articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged lawmakers and others at a  
prayer breakfast to help Clinton, who participated in the event. 
Lieberman asked ``at this time of difficulty for the president, 
that you hear his prayer, that you help him with the work he is 
doing with his family and his clergy, that you accept his 
atonement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans held a party meeting to search for a solution to the  
``findings of fact'' dilemma, unhappy to have the trial end with a 
straight acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to convict a  
president and remove him from office -- a margin both parties agree 
is not within reach -- but the ``finding of fact'' would only need a 
majority.

<HEADLINE> Payton Spurs Organ Donation Queries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Walter Payton found something positive Thursday  
even in his desperate need for a liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame running back said the publicity engendered by  
his announcement that he has a rare liver disease has spurred 
national interest in organ donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of people are calling, finding out how to become  
donors,'' Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
	His plight made people ``realize that you never know what's  
doing to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on CBS' ``This Morning,'' Payton appeared particularly  
pleased by a comment from Mike Ditka, who was his coach with the 
Chicago Bears and now is with the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the amazing thing is to be able to give life in  
death,'' Payton said. ``And he stated that's the most precious 
thing in the world. And you know, from a coach, .... sometimes he 
can be a little wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old Payton was diagnosed with primary sclerosing  
cholangitis, which blocks the bile ducts. Without a transplant, his 
doctor says he would live about two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton said he has been holding up ``real well'' spiritually and  
mentally. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you have a good support team, it kind of makes  
things a lot easier to deal with. And, the outpouring of friends 
and people that I've never heard of, it's been very uplifting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Payton qualifies for rush status, he's expected to wait  
100 to 200 days for a liver at the Mayo Clinic, said John Wingate, 
a spokesman for LifeSource in St. Paul, which handles organ 
procurement for the upper Midwest.

<HEADLINE> India Militants Target Oil Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Separatists in the remote northern state  
of Assam warned Thursday that they oppose the Indian government's 
oil exploration in their state -- a threat that prompted authorities 
to put more than 1,500 paramilitary forces on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The forces are deployed along 725 miles of crude pipeline  
linking Assam state's pumping stations to the Barauni refinery in 
neighboring Bihar state and other oil installations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will resist any fresh moves by the colonial Indian rulers  
to plunder the region's natural resources,'' said the United 
Liberation Front of Assam, a militant outfit fighting for an 
independent homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	The ULFA declaration came as state-owned Oil India Limited  
explored the bed of Brahmaputra River state and announced it had 
struck oil in an abandoned oil field in eastern Assam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Laying of oil pipelines along public places and sending of  
crude, including all exploration and drilling works, stand banned 
in Assam state till it gains independence from India,'' Arabinda 
Rajkhowa, the ULFA chairman, said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, ULFA rebels have blown up at least 15 oil  
installations and pipelines in protest. In recent years, the rebels 
also forced a French oil exploration company, Compaigne General De 
Geophysics, to wind up operations in Assam state. 
</P>
<P>
	Militants in neighboring Nagaland state also have forced the  
state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission to wind up oil 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil India Limited and the ONGC together produce 5 million tons  
of crude annually in Assam. The oil and tea sectors are the two 
primary industries in the whole northeast, a region in turmoil 
because of several separatist uprisings.

<P>
	Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said Ms. Lewinsky had been ``very  
guarded,'' choosing her words carefully to ``provide the very 
minimum of truth'' during her deposition earlier this week. ``Her 
testimony is clearly tinted and some might even say tainted by a 
mixture of her continued admiration for the president, her desire 
to protect him and her own personal views of right and wrong,'' 
Bryant lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	The request for Ms. Lewinsky's appearance was expected to lose  
as several Republicans already had indicated they would join the 45 
Democrats in opposing in-person testimony. ``It does not appear 
that the votes are there for live witnesses,'' Lott told reporters 
before the trial resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors had a fallback plan with better a chance for  
approval -- a request to show excerpts of the videotaped depositions 
in their closing arguments. To help that argument, Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson provided the first quotations from Jordan's deposition 
Tuesday concerning efforts to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky around 
the time she was emerging as a witnesses in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan testified Clinton had asked him to find the former intern  
a job and ``the fact is I was running the job search, not Ms. 
Lewinsky.'' Hutchinson argued the testimony showed Jordan was an 
unwitting agent for a president eager to thwart Mrs. Jones' lawyers 
from learning about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the proceedings, White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff  
wrote Lott today that Clinton would not submit to a deposition, as 
GOP senators requested. ``It is neither necessary nor appropriate 
for the president to testify,'' Ruff wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have been trying to find an exit from a trial that  
is unpopular with the public. Democrats have increasingly referred 
to the proceedings as a ``Republican trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer it goes, the more it becomes a partisan trial, a  
Republican trial,'' Democratic leader Tom Daschle told reporters. 
He said the Democrats were drafting a proposal to censure Clinton 
and expected to have it completed in a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Republicans also indicated today that prospects were  
dimming for a proposal that would conclude Clinton committed 
wrongdoing without removing him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have blocked it. We don't want this to break  
into a partisan melee,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. And Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the proposal ``an effort for 
politicians to protect themselves politically. The way out is to 
vote 'guilty' or 'not guilty' and live with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the Democratic alternative would  
be written less legalistically than the articles of impeachment 
``and more in moral terms of censure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``finding of fact'' proposal pushed by some Republicans  
accuses Clinton of lying to the grand jury. They would like to vote 
on that before the actual articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged lawmakers and others at a  
prayer breakfast to help Clinton, who participated in the event. 
Lieberman asked ``at this time of difficulty for the president, 
that you hear his prayer, that you help him with the work he is 
doing with his family and his clergy, that you accept his 
atonement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans held a party meeting to search for a solution to the  
``findings of fact'' dilemma, unhappy to have the trial end with a 
straight acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to convict a  
president and remove him from office -- a margin both parties agree 
is not within reach -- but the ``finding of fact'' would only need a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want to show portions of the videotapes as  
part of further evidence presentation, but only as a fallback 
position if they can't get live witnesses. Democrats have been 
united in opposition to live testimony, and even Republicans who 
viewed the videotapes of Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan appeared 
unenthusiastic about calling them.

<HEADLINE> Chemically Castrated Man Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A convicted rapist faces 40 years in prison  
for his sexual attack on a 5-year-old girl, a sentence handed down 
more than a decade after he was lauded on national television as a 
``chemical castration'' success story. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have brought this on yourself,'' Henrico County Circuit  
Judge Buford Parsons Jr. told Joseph Frank Smith at Wednesday's 
sentencing. ``You have brought a lot of hurt to other people. You 
know what you were doing was wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 46, was convicted in November of breaking and entering,  
aggravated sexual battery and two counts of attempted oral and anal 
sodomy in a June 1993 attack on the girl in her bed. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence found at the scene was linked to Smith this summer  
after he was arrested in a peeping Tom case in the Richmond 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors suspect Smith in numerous other break-ins in which a  
man entered the homes of young girls, wearing only a bandanna. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Wednesday, the bearded and bespectacled Smith told the  
judge he was ``very, very sorry for what I've done.'' But he became 
so distraught that his lawyer finished reading his prepared 
statement. ``I ask you to please forgive me,'' Smith wrote. ``I'll 
never harm anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was sentenced to 20 years for breaking and entering, 10  
years for attempted forcible oral sodomy and 10 years for attempted 
anal sodomy. Smith received a 20-year suspended sentence for 
aggravated sexual battery. He will be eligible for parole in 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was dubbed the Ski Mask Rapist in Texas, where he was  
convicted of raping the same woman twice in 1983. As a condition of 
receiving probation, he agreed to take drugs that reduce the amount 
of the male hormone testosterone the body produces. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith moved to the Richmond area after his conviction and in  
1984 appeared on CBS's ``60 Minutes'' as a success story for 
chemical castration. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore,  
where he received his treatments, said then that chemical 
castration suppresses sexual appetite and makes it easier to treat 
offenders in psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Fred Berlin, a Johns Hopkins psychiatrist who treated Smith,  
told the judge Smith has voyeuristic pedophilia, a ``powerful 
biological force'' that controls him when he is off the drugs. 
Smith stopped taking the drugs after he was released from Johns 
Hopkins in 1989.

	CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) -- A Massachusetts church is donating sacred  
relics to replace those stolen from a Chandler church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was upset at your loss and pray that this will bring some  
relief,'' wrote Michael Krochta, a member of the parish of the Holy 
Apostles Peter and Andrew, a small Bulgarian-heritage Greek 
Orthodox Church in Auburndale, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Burglars broke into the St. Katherine Greek Orthodox Church in  
January and took tiny sacred bone fragments of five revered saints 
from the third and fourth centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Orthodox followers believe relics and physical remnants of  
saints are the sources of healing and serve to bless premises and 
answer prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Philip Armstrong, priest at St. Katherine, said he  
believed the donations include bone fragments of St. Gerasimos and 
St. Arsenios and a piece of the casket in which St. Nektarios was 
placed 77 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also received relics of our own saint,'' he said, referring  
to St. Katherine of the fourth century. ``That was a real, real 
plus.''

 *Christ's image in a wooden door    	
</P>
<P>
	WAREHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Volunteers working in an upper room of the  
Episcopalian Church of the Good Shepherd saw the image of Jesus 
Christ in the grain of a small door they were staining. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are just pulled into it,'' the Rev. Cuthbert Mandell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's God's way of showing his love for us,'' Melissa Bliss, an  
18-year-old parishioner said. ``After all, he was a carpenter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss would like to believe there was divine intervention. ``I'd  
like to think that,'' she said. ``I see God everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he believed there was divine intervention, Mandell  
said, ``I don't like to speculate on what I don't know about. It's 
so unusual, we're still sorting it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who have had religious experiences sometimes have to  
take years to figure it out. It may not be just what you see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandell added, ``If it serves to make you think of Christ one  
more time in the week, then that's a gift in itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-by-3-foot sliding door was to have been hung on a small  
closet, but the image would have faced into the closet. For now it 
is propped on a stand in the third-floor room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll keep it up here where people can come, sit on a box in  
front of it and meditate,'' Mandell said. ``People can ponder all 
the things in their hearts.''

 *New editor for Christian Century    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Rev. John M. Buchanan, a former moderator of  
the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), has been named editor and 
publisher of The Christian Century, an interdenominational journal 
and influential liberal voice of Protestantism on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan will continue as pastor at the 4,200-member Fourth  
Presbyterian Church in Chicago, where he has been since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	At the journal, he will be part of a collaborative group that  
will decide editorial direction and assignments. He succeeds James 
M. Wall, full-time editor since 1972. Wall, a Methodist, will 
become senior contributing editor, and David Heim, executive 
editor, will assume major editorial responsibility under Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Century covers developments in theology and  
religious life and deals with social issues. Published 36 times a 
year, it has a circulation of about 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment is effective Feb. 15.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect a major departure from the direction the  
Century has taken'' under Wall's leadership, he said.

 *Televangelist's church for sale    	
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The church center where televangelist Robert  
Tilton presided is for sale. The asking price is $9.1 million for 
the church, school, office space and warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Word of Faith World Outreach Center Church, founded by  
Tilton in 1976, once drew as many as 4,000 worshippers on Sunday 
mornings for televised services. Attendance has plummeted in the 
wake of a barrage of negative media attention and litigation 
against Tilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilton's lawyer, J.C. Joyce of Tulsa, Okla. said the  
congregation is too small for the facilities and needs a less 
expensive space. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of that land was bought for particular purposes, and they  
just don't need it,'' he said. ``It has become too valuable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ole Anthony of the Trinity Foundation, a Dallas religious  
watchdog group, said the church once had as many as 11,000 members, 
compared with 150 to 200 regulars today. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilton, 51, moved from Dallas in 1997 after a protracted and  
acrimonious divorce from Leigh Valentine Tilton.

<HEADLINE> AgrEvo Deal With Cargil Set Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNETONKA, Minn. (AP) -- Cargill Inc. has set aside a plan to  
sell most of its North American seed operations to a German 
company, the two firms announced in a joint statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned $650 million sale of Cargill Hybrid Seeds North  
America to Hoeschst Schering AgrEvo GmbH had already been on hold 
for several months pending resolution of a lawsuit filed against 
Cargill by Pioneer Hi-Bred International. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer filed suit against Cargill and two other seed companies  
last October in Iowa, claiming the companies bred corn hybrids 
using genetic material developed by Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill said Tuesday that it was trying to settle the lawsuit  
after tracing suspicious genetic material in its breeding program 
back to a former Pioneer employee hired by Cargill. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer filed suit Wednesday against Thomas W. Ishler of Leola,  
Pa., alleging that he was the former employee who had given its 
genetics information to its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Pioneer filed a lawsuit against Monsanto Co.,  
accusing it of wrongly obtaining Pioneer's seed genetics when it 
purchased Cargill's international seed business in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill's agreement with AgrEvo, announced last September,  
included research and production facilities in 14 U.S. states and 
one Canadian province. The Cargill division had sales of $106 
million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Team Rosters Reduced to 14 Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On cutdown day in the NBA, several dozen players gained a  
two-week lease on their professional lives. 
</P>
<P>
	In this lockout-shortened season, teams only had to reduce their  
rosters to 14 players instead of the usual 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams will be able to carry two extra players on their active  
roster until Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra spots benefited players like Kornel David and Cory  
Carr, who will be suiting up in the uniform of the world champion 
Chicago Bulls on opening night. David and Carr made the team when 
the Bulls decided to put Jeff Sanders and Charles Jones on the 
injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	One player, Saddi Washington, had good news followed by bad  
news. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington made Utah's 14-man roster, only to learn hours later  
that the Jazz had cut him in order to make room for center Todd 
Fuller, who was acquired from the Golden State Warriors for a 
future second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, a rookie guard from Western Michigan, was one of the  
stars of the NBA's Portsmouth Invitational camp for would-be 
rookies after averaging 21.6 points his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	With the expanded rosters, there were very few well-known names  
who didn't survive the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	More prominent were major players being put on the injured list,  
including Christian Laettner in Detroit, Voshon Lenard in Miami, 
Glen Rice and Anthony Mason in Charlotte, Antoine Carr and Rodrick 
Rhodes in Houston, Haywoode Workman in Indiana, Micheal Williams in 
Toronto and Lee Mayberry in Vancouver.

	Lott Sees Trial Ending Next Week  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans moved to bring President  
Clinton's impeachment trial to a prompt conclusion today. Majority 
Leader Trent Lott signaled a lack of support for live testimony and 
GOP lawmakers shrank from an effort to declare the president guilty 
without removal from office. House prosecutors made a last-ditch 
effort to summon Monica Lewinsky to testify before senators. 

</P>

	Clintons Decry Story on Chelsea  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife say they are  
``profoundly saddened'' by People magazine's decision to do a cover 
story on daughter Chelsea. The Clintons said People chose to run 
the story ``despite personal appeals with respect to her privacy 
and her security from her parents.'' The magazine hits the street 
tomorrow with a cover photo of Chelsea with her mother and the 
headline: ``Hillary &AMP; Chelsea -- Grace Under Fire.'' 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Troops May Go To Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is seriously  
considering sending U.S. troops to enforce the peace if a 
settlement is reached in war-scarred Kosovo. ``The Balkans are an 
explosive area. They touch other difficult areas, and unless we can 
contain and ultimately defuse the ethnic hatreds in that region 
they can embroil us ... in a much larger conflict,'' Clinton said. 

</P>

	Serbs Vote To Attend Peace Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's parliament voted today to  
send a delegation to Kosovo peace talks but took a tough and 
unconciliatory stance. Lawmakers insisted Belgrade won't budge on 
Western demands to give broad self-rule to the province. The 
one-sided vote -- 227-3 with three abstentions -- was the last 
remaining hurdle to an internationally brokered peace conference 
starting Saturday outside Paris and aimed at halting an 
11-month-old war that has killed 2,000 people and left hundreds of 
thousands homeless.

	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A court-martial began today for a  
Marine pilot whose jet clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 
people. Capt. Richard Ashby's trial on 20 counts of involuntary 
manslaughter began one day after the first anniversary of the 
tragedy that happened when the wing of his EA-6B Prowler sliced 
through cables supporting the Mount Cermis ski gondola in Cavalese, 
Italy.

	Italy Votes Down Sperm Donations  
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy's lower house has voted to ban the use of  
donated sperm. The move overturns a key provision of a proposed 
government bill on fertility treatments. Italy has no law 
regulating assisted fertility. Some women in their late 50s or even 
well into their 60s have come here for post-menopausal attempts at 
pregnancy. The proposed law outlaws fertility treatment for women 
over the age of 52, as well as the sale of sperm and eggs.

critical condition and is expected to arrive home tomorrow. A 
statement issued by Hussein's private physician said the

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson once  
again faces jail time and the possible loss of his boxing license. 
Tyson goes to court tomorrow to be sentenced on two counts of 
second-degree assault stemming from an altercation following a 
minor traffic accident in August. The sentence will help determine 
whether Tyson will have to return to jail in Indiana for violating 
probation for a rape conviction. It could lead boxing authorities 
to strip him of his license once again.

<HEADLINE>  Neuheisel's Coaches Violated Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel vowed to make things happen for  
the Washington Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the new coach finds himself in trouble with the Pac-10 and  
perhaps the NCAA less than a month after leaving Colorado to come 
to Seattle for $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Neuheisel acknowledged that five Washington  
assistant coaches were in four prospects' homes last Sunday during 
a cooling-off period for recruits. That was a violation of NCAA 
recruiting rules because the Sunday before letter-of-intent day is 
considered a quiet period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies turned themselves in to the Pac-10 on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was illegal to be off campus,'' Neuheisel said. ``I'm  
embarrassed by it. Unfortunately, this was an error. I take full 
responsibility for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, both a UW official and new Colorado  
coach Gary Barnett contended Neuheisel violated another NCAA rule 
when he telephoned some of his former Colorado players. Barnett 
calls that tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know coach Neuheisel has called some of them in their homes  
and has tampered a little bit,'' Barnett told the Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, categorically false,'' Neuheisel responded. ``What  
I did was say good-bye to some of my former athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called them, wished them well, told them to stick together  
and I enjoyed my time with them. It was something I'd hoped to do

transferring or the University of Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had attempted to call Barnett on Tuesday, but Barnett  
did not return his call. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado wrote a letter of protest to the Huskies last Thursday  
and sent copies of it to the NCAA, the Pac-10 and the Big 12. 
</P>
<P>
	UW compliance director Ralph Bayard said Neuheisel needed  
Colorado's permission to talk to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayard said Colorado accused Neuheisel of trying to get  
Buffaloes players to transfer to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Huskies athletic director Barbara Hedges, who hired Neuheisel on  
Jan. 9, ``was upset, obviously,'' Bayard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bayard: ``They'll (the NCAA) probably contact the athletes  
at Colorado to find out exactly what was said. But it would be kind 
of ridiculous to get on the phone and to actually talk about coming 
to this institution knowing full well that if you're talking to 
somebody there's another party who knows what you said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said he had not been aware that the Sunday visits were  
a rules violation. When a high school coach mentioned the problem 
Monday, Neuheisel said he talked to Hedges and Bayard, then called 
the Pac-10 headquarters to report the violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the rule against the Sunday visits has been on the  
books since 1995, Neuheisel said he wasn't aware of it and it 
didn't come up before because he'd always finished his recruiting 
visits earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, we arrived late,'' Neuheisel said. ``Normally,  
our recruiting efforts are way done by this time and there isn't 
any need to be in anybody's home on that Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said the Huskies visited kicker John Anderson, of  
Boyton Beach, Fla.; cornerback Chris Massey, of Moreno Valley, 
Calif.; cornerback Domynic Shaw, of Oakland, Calif., and safety 
Clayton Hawthorne, of Victoria, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel expects a light slap on the wrist for the violation.  
The four players in question were immediately declared ineligible 
by UW officials, but the Huskies expect to get their eligibility 
back in the next couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no official sanction other than maybe a letter  
of reprimand (from the Pac-10) for myself,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Neuheisel's Coaches Violated Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel vowed to make things happen for  
the Washington Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the new coach finds himself in trouble with the Pac-10 and  
perhaps the NCAA less than a month after leaving Colorado to come 
to Seattle for $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Neuheisel acknowledged that five Washington  
assistant coaches were in four prospects' homes last Sunday during 
a cooling-off period for recruits. That was a violation of NCAA 
recruiting rules because the Sunday before letter-of-intent day is 
considered a quiet period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies turned themselves in to the Pac-10 on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was illegal to be off campus,'' Neuheisel said. ``I'm  
embarrassed by it. Unfortunately, this was an error. I take full 
responsibility for it.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Taylor Enjoys Hall News Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor's hard feelings appear to be  
behind him. He's just happy to be one of the 199 members of the Pro 
Football Hall of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
	That certainly wasn't the case last weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor seemed to enjoy himself Thursday as he answered questions  
for nearly 20 minutes at a news conference for the Hall of Fame's 
five newest members. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, Eric Dickerson, Tom Mack, Ozzie Newsome and Billy Shaw --  
appearing together for the first time -- were on their way to 
Hawaii, where they will meet with officers of the Hall of Fame and 
attend Sunday's Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the New York Giants for 13 years who established  
himself as one of the dominant defensive players in NFL history, 
Taylor said he was ``very appreciative of being in the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame, class of '99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked hard for this day and am happy this day did  
come,'' he said. ``I wondered if it was all worth it. I'm here to 
say, `Yes, it is.' I wasn't sure how I would feel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't particularly overjoyed Saturday when I got the  
news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's candidacy was a topic of controversy throughout Super  
Bowl week. Suspended once while he was playing and arrested twice 
on drug charges after he retired, Taylor has struggled with 
off-the-field problems that left some voters uneasy with his 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike baseball, there is no ``citizenship'' clause in the  
football hall's bylaws. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue endorsed 
Taylor's election, which was still in question before the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The following day, in an interview with Fox Sports News, Taylor  
criticized the writers who opposed him, and said they were holding 
him to a standard they would not apply to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about his feelings of last weekend, he smiled and  
replied, ``We really don't have to go there. There were questions 
and situations I felt shouldn't have been involved in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw myself as one of the best to play the game. I gave the  
game everything I had. I'm very happy the game gave back to me. I 
can't control (the voting process). I put my heart into it every 
Sunday. I've been rewarded for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said he was torn as far as a Hall of Fame presenter was  
concerned between Giants owner Wellington Mara and former Giants 
coach Bill Parcells, now coach of the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies are next Aug. 7 in Canton, Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's a big problem there,'' Taylor said. ``It's hard for me  
to even think about which one I would take because I would snub the 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About Parcells, Taylor said, ``He allowed me to do what I do  
best. ... Create havoc, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who was wearing a Hall of Fame shirt, sweatpants, a  
dangling earring, a black bandana, dark glasses and sandals on his 
40th birthday, joked with the other future Hall of Famers along 
with the media in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a pleasure to be with these guys,'' he said.  
``Football was my life and I really enjoyed it. I have a lot of 
memories from it. I am just very happy and very humbled to have my 
name mentioned with all these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, the NFL's top defensive player three times, and  
Dickerson, the league's third-leading career rusher, were both 
elected in their first year of eligibility.

<HEADLINE> `Petticoat Junction' Star Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Meredith MacRae, one of three Hooterville  
girls at the Shady Rest Hotel in the old ``Petticoat Junction'' TV 
series, had a brain tumor removed, and her publicist said her 
prognosis is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss MacRae collapsed Jan. 27 while receiving a massage at a spa  
and she was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where surgery 
was performed the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's in great shape, a very healthy lady,'' publicist Sandy  
Pollock said Thursday. ``The tumor was on the right side of her 
brain and I know that they got it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss MacRae, 53, played Billie Jo Bradley from 1966 to 1970 on  
``Petticoat Junction,'' a comedy starring Bea Benaderet as the 
widowed owner of the Shady Rest and mother of three daughters who 
helped run the place. 
</P>
<P>
	She also played Sally, girlfriend to Tim Considine's character  
on ``My Three Sons,'' from 1963 to 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Husband Phil Neal, mother Sheila, sister Heather, and other  
family members have been cheering her up at the hospital by singing 
Broadway show tunes, Ms. Pollock said. (Miss MacRae is the daughter 
of the late actor-singer, Gordon MacRae, who played the lovesick 
cowboy Curly in ``Oklahoma!'')

<HEADLINE> History From the Horse's Mouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five million years before Walt Disney World  
made exotic animals a tourist draw, ancient horses -- some as small 
as dogs -- competed for food with rhinoceroses and elephants in a 
Florida that resembled equatorial Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	So say scientists who used the fossilized teeth of six species  
of ancient horses to reconstruct these early animals' diets and 
paint a picture of prehistoric Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Florida study is a milestone for  
paleontologists because it demonstrates that new scientific 
techniques can show how long-dead species evolved. It also 
undermined some theories based solely on how fossils look. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at the shift of climates and vegetations through  
millions of years by analyzing the tooth content of these 
mammals,'' said paleontologist Bruce MacFadden, lead author of the 
study published today in the journal Science. ``That's pretty 
cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History buffs may recall that the modern-day horse was brought  
to the Americas by Spanish explorers. But prehistoric horses roamed 
North America millions of years earlier until dying out about 
10,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	MacFadden studied the fossilized teeth of those ancient horse  
ancestors, found in central Florida phosphate mines. The six 
species ranged from a three-toed, dog-sized animal to a one-toed, 
zebra-sized equine called Dinohippus mexicanus, among the closest 
relatives of modern-day horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Paleontologists had thought ancient horses were mostly grass  
eaters because 20 million years ago they evolved long, high-crowned 
teeth, perfect for snipping gritty grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5 million-year-old Florida horses shared those long teeth.  
</P>
<P>
	But how, MacFadden wondered, could all those animals have  
competed for the same limited amount of grass? So he 
reinvestigated, examining microscopic wear patterns on the teeth 
and analyzing their carbon isotope content. 
</P>
<P>
	Isotopes are atoms of carbon that have different numbers of  
neutrons. Trees and shrubs have more carbon-13 than grasses, for 
example. When these isotopes build up in tooth enamel, they 
illustrate a creature's diet. The power of the technique is 
prompting scientists to take a fresh look at other fossils, even 
the teeth of early humans. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, eating from tender trees and shrubs, as deer do  
today, leaves microscopic round pits in teeth. Eaters of grittier 
grass, like zebras, sustain long tooth scratches. 
</P>
<P>
	MacFadden's conclusion: Despite their common teeth, some of the  
ancient horses ate only grass, some a mix of grass, leaves and 
shrubs and -- in a real surprise -- the Dinohippus, the one related 
to modern horses, ate mostly from trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	The carbon tests show ancient Florida's landscape was a lush  
mosaic of canopy-covered forests with bushes for horses to nibble, 
savanna-like grasslands and marshes, with rushes and reeds for 
other horses to chew, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some horses were tiny because they competed for food not just  
with other horses but with rhinoceros- and elephant-like beasts 
with similar grazing habits. 
</P>
<P>
	Here the tale gets more intriguing: Not much later, 4.8 million  
years ago, North America experienced a major mammal extinction that 
killed off huge beasts like rhinoceroses, as well as three of the 
horse species. 
</P>
<P>
	The smallest horses that originally ate mostly grass became  
extinct. The bigger scrub eaters, including Dinohippus, survived -- 
and then they switched their diet to the grass their smaller 
relatives left behind, said paleontologist Paul Koch of the 
University of California, Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? No one knows. But Koch suggests the spread of  
poorer-quality grasses, which were less tolerated by small animals 
with fast metabolisms than by larger horses more tolerant of lousy 
diets. 
</P>
<P>
	MacFadden's study is ``a really important paper, showing our  
ability to study ecosystems of the past,'' Koch said. ``We're 
interested in how diversity, flexibility in what you eat, affects 
survival and extinction. ... But at the same time you are a little 
unsatisfied -- you want to know more.''

<HEADLINE> Wine Label May List Health Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration plans to propose  
changes in existing wine labels that would include references to 
the health benefits of drinking wine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department is expected to announce the proposed new  
wording for the labels on Friday, according to a senior 
administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a very major accomplishment,'' said John DeLuca,  
president of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute, which has 
pushed for several years to add wording about the health effects of 
wine. ``We have every expectation it will be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeLuca said the approved statement would read: ``To learn the  
health effects of wine consumption, send for the federal 
government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.'' He said it would 
give a mailing address and a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine labels already warn that pregnant women shouldn't drink and  
that alcohol can impair driving and cause health problems. But they 
say nothing about studies suggesting that moderate alcohol intake 
can reduce the risk of heart disease in some people. 
</P>
<P>
	According to DeLuca, the new wording would not supplant the  
existing warnings on wine bottles, but would simply indicate that 
health benefits are also attributed to drinking wine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to give our people a choice,'' said DeLuca, who  
argued that it is not a marketing scheme to boost sales. ``This is 
a complex subject, but if science is saying this, the public has a 
right to know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal health officials and some senators already have voiced  
their concern that such a label would purport to make a health 
claim about wine or would encourage excessive drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher has communicated his concern that  
mentioning health benefits on a bottle would send ``mixed 
messages,'' according to a senior administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who helped craft the alcohol  
warning labels that have been in place for a decade, urged federal 
regulators in the spring of 1998 not to approve any watered-down 
label. He went one step further and introduced a bill that would 
strengthen the required warning labels. 
</P>
<P>
	And in July 1997, the Health and Human Services Department sent  
a letter to officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, which is part of the Treasury Department, urging them to 
delay approval of the labels. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLuca said findings of consumer surveys suggested a majority of  
people believed the label would not induce them to drink more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It negated the charge that this was going to lead to excessive  
drinking,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA's dietary guidelines note that ``current evidence  
suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk for 
coronary heart disease in some individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the guidelines also point out that higher levels of alcohol  
intake can raise the risk for high blood pressure, stroke, heart 
disease, certain cancers and accidents, as well as possibly causing 
cirrhosis of the liver and damage to the brain and heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines also recommend that those who drink should do so  
in moderation, which is defined as no more than one drink per day 
for women and no more than two drinks per day for men. Five ounces 
of wine is considered a drink, according to the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	After the proposed regulatory change is announced, it would be  
printed in the Federal Register and open for a public comment 
period, according to a Treasury department official. A final rule 
would be published after the comments are reviewed.

<HEADLINE> Can Stopping AIDS Treatment Work? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The tentative results of a small human experiment  
offer a glimmer of possibility that the body's own defense system 
can be trained to hold down the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The clearly risky approach attempts to mimic the success of the  
much-talked-about ``Berlin patient,'' a newly infected German man 
who stopped and started AIDS therapy and eventually quit it 
entirely, only to discover that his virus had inexplicably 
disappeared. He has remained free of HIV for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why others cannot become the Berlin patient,''  
said Dr. Franco Lori, head of the Research Institute for Genetic 
and Human Therapy at Georgetown University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori's team is one of a few exploring the idea that it may be  
possible to wean people away from the demanding regimen of AIDS 
medicines without actually curing them of their infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori presented his findings Thursday at the 6th Conference on  
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Some physicians are skeptical. They fear AIDS patients who learn  
of these attempts will stop taking the drugs on their own -- with 
potentially deadly consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is that this will be overplayed,'' said Dr. Robert  
Schooley of the University of Colorado, a conference organizer. 
``It sounds good to patients. Who wouldn't want to stop treatment? 
But the real question is whether you can change the immune 
response. I worry patients will stop therapy. Whenever that 
happens, in my experience, the virus comes roaring back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lori calls the approach stop and go. The idea: Treat people with  
standard AIDS drugs until all signs of HIV vanish from the 
bloodstream. Withhold the medicines until the virus returns. Then 
give the drugs again. Keep repeating the cycle until eventually the 
virus never comes back. 
</P>
<P>
	It probably won't be eradicated entirely, so the theory goes,  
but the body's immune defenses will be able to keep it from the 
explosive growth that is HIV's killing trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	Lori has tried the approach so far on three patients. While it's  
still too soon to know whether it will work, Lori finds the first 
few weeks' results promising. The interval before the virus returns 
is lengthening. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, he said that in more aggressive experiments on  
monkeys, the only practical nonhuman substitute for AIDS, the 
approach seems to keep the virus at bay for good. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is a much larger study involving 40 to 80  
patients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Bruce Walker is conducting similar early-stage experiments  
on patients at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ``We 
really don't have any data yet to suggest that this (stopping and 
starting therapy) is something we should be doing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not put one of my patients on this,'' said Dr. Roger  
Pomerantz of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. ``People 
have talked about this, but it's the first time I've seen anyone 
have the guts to try it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Lori's study, three patients took a combination of the drugs  
DDI, hydroxyurea and indinavir. The first time they stopped 
treatment, the virus returned in one week. Doctors treated them 
again and stopped. This time the virus stayed away for 2 1/2 weeks. 
Again doctors started and stopped the drugs. The virus disappeared 
for six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how long this will go on or whether eventually  
these cycles will put the virus into permanent retreat.

<HEADLINE> Sun-Observing Satellite Now Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A month after the gyroscope that kept it  
stable failed, the SOHO sun-observing satellite is back in 
business, keeping its balance by watching the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time a spacecraft equipped with gyroscopes has  
carried on working without them, said Bernhard Fleck, European 
Space Agency project scientist for SOHO. ``We are very pleased, 
very happy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the $1 billion satellite was returned to service  
Tuesday, using a new computer program to help it keep its 
orientation without the failed gyroscope. SOHO stands for Solar and 
Heliospheric Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble developed on SOHO last June when it began spinning out  
of control. Scientists were able to return it to service in 
September, but it was frozen, and two of its three gyroscopes 
failed, said Fleck, who is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center in Greenbelt, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The last gyroscope failed Dec. 21.  
</P>
<P>
	Without the gyroscopes to keep track of its position, the  
satellite had to constantly fire onboard jets to keep it pointed 
toward the sun, a practice that threatened to rapidly exhaust its 
fuel supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleck said engineers in the Netherlands were able to develop a  
computer program that allowed the satellite to bypass the broken 
gyroscopes and instead use a star tracker to allow it to determine 
its position. 
</P>
<P>
	With that information, three spinning momentum wheels aboard the  
craft can be directed to speed up or slow down to keep it properly 
oriented, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
	This was done on Saturday, the craft was maneuvered to a new  
position on Monday and, on Tuesday, said Fleck, ``we returned to 
normal where the spacecraft is perfectly pointing toward the sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOHO was launched in December 1995, and the mission is now  
expected to continue until 2003, allowing it to observe intense 
solar activity when the number of sunspots reaches a maximum around 
mid-2000.

<HEADLINE> White House Offers Oil Firms Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration offered some relief  
Thursday to beleaguered domestic oil and natural gas producers who 
have been battered by crude oil prices at some of their lowest 
levels since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced that independent  
producers who drill on public lands will be allowed to suspend 
operations for up to two years without losing their leases. The 
action is directed at ``stripper'' wells, which individually 
produce 15 barrels or less daily, but collectively account for 32 
percent of all oil drilled on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will help to alleviate the economic impact low oil prices  
may have on small federal stripper-oil operations,'' Babbitt said. 
``We understand what the small operators are going through, and 
this is the right decision at the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which  
represents smaller producers, welcomed Babbitt's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This action would bring some relief to a section of our  
industry hit hardest by the very low oil prices,'' said IPAA 
President Gil Thurm. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thurm prodded the administration to do more. ``At a time  
when oil revenues have been slashed and many of our members wonder 
how long they can survive without closing their businesses or 
laying off even more workers, we also need immediate emergency 
action to keep America's oil and gas industry alive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a worldwide glut, crude oil prices have plunged 55  
percent in the past two years. The depressed prices have prompted 
thousands of layoffs in the industry and had a ripple effect on the 
budgets of state and local governments that depend on oil royalties 
and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing the results of an industrywide survey taken last  
month, IPAA said more than 136,000 oil wells and 57,000 natural gas 
wells have shut down since prices crashed in November 1997 -- 
representing an economic loss of $25 billion. Some 41,000 jobs have 
been lost in the past two years, IPAA estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting producers' sentiment that the administration hasn't  
done enough, Thurm said, ``We hope that today's announcement 
represents a clear recognition by the Clinton administration that 
significant domestic oil and natural gas resources are at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has rallied behind legislation introduced by Sen.  
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and other Oil Patch legislators that 
would provide an array of tax incentives to help independent 
producers. Many also favor replenishing the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, a move that would siphon millions of barrels of oil from 
the glutted market. 
</P>
<P>
	The reserve, stored in underground salt caverns in Louisiana and  
Texas, can hold up to 752 million barrels. It stands at 560 million 
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the administration was praised for one action, it was  
criticized for another proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, warned the administration that he will  
``vigorously oppose'' a proposal to reinstate a five-cent-a-barrel 
tax to fund the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. That proposal, 
contained in the fiscal 2000 budget President Clinton submitted to 
Congress Monday, ``is the worst possible idea at the worst possible 
time,'' Gramm complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax, collected on every barrel of oil drilled domestically  
or imported, is used to finance oil pollution prevention and 
cleanup activities by various federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton is asking us to reinstate the tax for  
another 10 years and to let him collect at least $4 billion more 
from hard-pressed oil producers,'' Gramm wrote Energy Secretary 
Bill Richardson. ``What he's really asking us to do is dramatically 
accelerate the rate at which Texas oil producers go broke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Treasury, Transportation and Energy departments  
offered no comment. The White House referred calls to Treasury.

<HEADLINE> Fed Reserve Unveils Policy Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a small step toward greater openness,  
Federal Reserve policy-makers have decided that they may sometimes 
immediately announce when their thinking changes about the likely 
direction of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed to use plainer language in the section of the  
publicly released minutes of their meetings that reveals their 
stance toward interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's essentially, Toto pulling back the curtain to reveal a  
little bit more of what the wizard's all about,'' said banking 
analyst Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's monetary policy panel -- the Federal Open Market  
Committee -- meets privately eight times a year. For the past five 
years, it has publicly announced when it changes the benchmark 
interest rate on overnight loans between banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, it let consumers and stock and bond traders figure  
it out on their own by watching the movement of the rate, known as 
the federal funds rate, in credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, policy-makers say -- when they don't change the rate -- they  
will sometimes take the additional step of immediately announcing 
shifts in their thinking about the direction of future rate moves. 
Until now, investors and borrowers have had to wait until the panel 
released its minutes, roughly six weeks after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the panel cautioned in minutes of its Dec. 22 meeting,  
released Thursday, that it will only disclose changes in what it 
calls its policy bias ``when it seemed important for the public to 
be aware of an important shift in the members' views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stance is a compromise. Some members argued, according to  
the minutes, that greater disclosure ``would allow financial market 
prices to reflect more accurately the likely future stance of 
monetary policy.'' Some members opposed disclosing changes in the 
policy bias because it ``often would provoke market reactions'' and 
that, in turn, would have ``adverse repercussions on the 
committee's decision-making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ely said a practice of sometimes disclosing shifts in  
policy-makers' thinking, and sometimes not, probably would not 
survive. The first time the thinking changed, and was not 
disclosed, the Fed would be severely criticized, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis  
applauded the new policy as a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It contributes to the efficiency of the market,'' he said.  
``Withholding decisions simply adds to the uncertainties and 
volatility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes after Republicans in Congress criticized the  
International Monetary Fund for cloaking its activities in mystery 
and after the Clinton administration urged countries hit with 
financial turmoil to make their financial systems more 
``transparent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 22 minutes disclosed that the Fed's policy stance was  
neutral, equally disposed to raise or lower rates in the future. At 
the conclusion of its Feb. 2-3 meeting, it did not disclose any 
change in the stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it adopted a biased directive, as some analysts speculated,  
the (committee) doesn't consider this change 'important' enough to 
worry our pretty little head about,'' said economist Paul Kasriel 
of the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.

	Senate Votes To Show Lewinsky Tape  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trial-weary senators moved briskly Thursday to  
wrap up President Clinton's impeachment proceedings, voting to 
permit the showing of portions of Monica Lewinsky's videotaped 
deposition after dealing a bipartisan brush-off to a personal 
appearance. Parts of her recorded deposition are to be played at 
the nationally televised trial session Saturday. Republicans also 
retreated from their plan to find Clinton guilty of wrongdoing 
without removing him from office. ``I do think it's time we get to 
a vote and we move on'' to other issues, said Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss. 

</P>
<P>
	Monica:'Mixed Feelings' for Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky told House prosecutors she  
still has ``mixed feelings'' for President Clinton and continues to 
admire him. She insisted he did not encourage her to lie when he 
informed her in a late-night call that she might become a witness 
in the Paula Jones case. In testimony slated to be made public 
Friday and obtained by The Associated Press late Thursday, Ms. 
Lewinsky also cast doubt on Clinton's sworn testimony that he told 
her she might have to turn over gifts he gave her if they were 
subpoenaed. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. May Send Troops to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday he is  
considering sending U.S. ground troops to Kosovo as peacekeepers if 
a peace accord is reached in the war-torn province. ``The time to 
stop this conflict in Kosovo is now,'' he said, ``before it 
spreads, and when it can be contained at an acceptable cost.'' 
Meanwhile, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Serbia's parliament agreed to 
join peace talks on Kosovo starting this weekend in France. Serbian 
lawmakers passed a strongly worded declaration that approved 
attending the talks -- but refused to grant independence for Kosovo.

	King Hussein Rejects Transplant  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A gravely ill King Hussein left a U.S.  
hospital Thursday after an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant and 
headed back to Jordan. The king's trip home came only 10 days after 
he had abruptly traveled to the United States seeking care for a 
relapse of lymphatic cancer. The condition of the 63-year-old 
Hussein ``has become critical due to the failure of the function of 
internal organs,'' the king's private physician said.

	U.N. Report Says 17 Killed in Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two missiles that hit civilian areas in  
southern Iraq last week killed 17 people -- including 10 children -- 
and injured 100 others, according to a U.N. report obtained by The 
Associated Press Thursday. The report did not say who fired the 
missiles that landed in the poor Al-Jumhuriya neighborhood in the 
port city of Basra and in the village of Abu Khasib, 16 miles to 
the south, on Jan. 25. 

</P>

	Anthrax Scare in Nation's Capital  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police and FBI agents retrieved packages  
purporting to contain anthrax that were delivered to The Washington 
Post and the Old Executive Office Building today in an apparent 
hoax, law enforcement officials said. Similar scares prompted 
police to cordon off a four-block area in downtown Atlanta, after a 
package was delivered to the NBC News bureau there with a note 
claiming it was anthrax. Earlier in the day, a postal worker in 
Columbus, Ga., opened a parcel with a note reading, ``You have been 
exposed to anthrax.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Lawyers Argue for Pinochet Trial  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's highest court wrapped up hearings  
Thursday to determine Gen. Augusto Pinochet's fate, with opposing 
lawyers contending that human rights law would be reduced to a 
``meek little mouse'' if he goes free. The judges from the House of 
Lords said they would begin private considerations and announce 
``in due course'' their ruling whether the former Chilean dictator 
is immune from prosecution for crimes against humanity he allegedly 
committed during his 17-year rule.

York on Thursday, the Dow lost 62.31 to close at 9,304.50.

	Florida Upsets No. 5 Kentucky 75-68  
</P>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Freshman Mike Miller scored 20 points  
and coach Billy Donovan's program got its biggest boost in his 
three seasons at Florida with a 75-68 upset over No. 5 Kentucky 
tonight. In front of a record crowd of 12,443 -- some of whom waited 
outside for nearly 24 hours before tipoff -- the Gators (16-4, 7-3 
Southeastern Conference) opened up a 14-point lead midway through 
the second half and withstood a late Kentucky rally. It was just 
Florida's second victory over Kentucky (19-5, 8-2) in their last 14 
meetings.

<HEADLINE> Naughton Sings a Variety of Songs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In an evening of song as relaxed as Bing Crosby  
and as carefully structured as a show by Peggy Lee, actor James 
Naughton brought his ``Street of Dreams'' to the off-Broadway 
Promenade Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Naughton, who opened Thursday for six weeks, walks on stage in  
front of five jazz musicians, in open-neck blue shirt and black 
slacks, his only jewelry a wedding ring, singing ``I'm Just a Lucky 
So and So.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The audience knows Naughton best from Broadway musicals for  
which he won Tony Awards: ``City of Angels'' in 1990 and 
``Chicago'' in 1997. Humorous chat intersperses with the songs; at 
one point the actor kids about forgetting lines on stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Naughton has an attractive voice, a baritone which he can  
lighten or deepen into richness. Several times during the evening, 
his casual, wholesome demeanor, vocal overtones and phrasing 
strongly reminded a listener of Bing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
	His songs were chosen with care for variety. Probably the most  
remarkable was ``Lush Life,'' which has overpowered more than one 
singer. Naughton sang it with confidence, turning the singer into a 
character who might be played by Clint Eastwood -- or James Naughton 
-- worldly and tough, but vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed humor in singing Dave Frishberg's ``I'm Hip,''  
successfully testing his pitch by repeating the ending four times, 
each on a different note, and putting his voice right where he 
wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	On ``I've Been Everywhere,'' he got laughs by singing each of  
the verses -- lists of places -- faster than the one before. He sang 
two of Randy Newman's more obscure songs and such beloved trips 
down nostalgia lane as ``Stardust,'' ``The Folks Who Live on the 
Hill,'' ``She's Funny That Way'' and ``Pennies from Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For further variety, Naughton included ``Moody's Mood for  
Love,'' a bebop song. King Pleasure wrote the lyrics and jazz 
saxophonist James Moody wrote the tune, using the same chords as 
``I'm in the Mood for Love'' while creating a very different 
melody. 
</P>
<P>
	He shook his knees to John Oddo's honky-tonk piano on ``I Want  
You To Be My Baby,'' sang the Mills Brothers' ``Glow Worm'' and 
Elvis Presley's ``Are You Lonesome Tonight?'', making his voice not 
quite sincere on the spoken lines. 
</P>
<P>
	He swung ``Street of Dreams'' and sang an encore given to him by  
pianist George Shearing, a parody of a Cole Porter song called 
``You're the Pits.''

<HEADLINE>  Different Bulls Team To Face Jazz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- There is a certain spot on the Delta  
Center floor where Michael Jordan hit the final, 
championship-winning shot of his incomparable career. 
</P>
<P>
	The next member of the Chicago Bulls to shoot on that hallowed  
ground could be Rusty LaRue. 
</P>
<P>
	The wretched remains of the six-time world champions will return  
Friday to the scene of their club's last triumph, a Game 6 NBA 
Finals win over the Utah Jazz that capped Jordan's career and 
signaled the end of Chicago's basketball reign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a delicious bit of payback, the Jazz, who saw their  
championship dreams twice crushed by Jordan and his teammates, have 
the opportunity to throw the first punch in what will probably be a 
season of beatings for the depleted Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie coach Tim Floyd has the dubious honor of beginning his  
rebuilding project in one of the NBA's most hostile environments. 
</P>
<P>
	A ripple of excitement spread through Salt Lake City two weeks  
ago when the NBA released its shortened schedule and a rematch 
between the conference champions was right at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd and the Bulls realize that, Jordan or no Jordan, Jazz fans  
will always have it in for anybody wearing Chicago's red and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to boo us as soon as we get off the airplane,''  
said Ron Harper, the only remaining starter from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to know this is a different team, and I'll pass this  
word,'' Floyd said with a laugh. ``I think regardless of who is 
coming in, the Bulls or any other team, Utah is going to be sending 
a statement early and quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While their fans may think otherwise, the Jazz players aren't  
attaching any special meaning to the meeting. For them, running 
with the Bulls is just the first lap in a race they hope will end 
in the champions' circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of 50 games we've got to play well in to make a  
run at the playoffs,'' Karl Malone said. ``Michael, Scottie 
(Pippen) and Dennis (Rodman) were the Bulls. It's not like that any 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Chicago bears only faint resemblance to the Bulls of eight  
months ago, the biggest change the Jazz made was allowing utility 
big man Antoine Carr to sign with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been replaced by Thurl Bailey, who has been out of the  
league since 1994, and center Todd Fuller, who was acquired from 
Golden State on Thursday for a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in basketball and in other sports like to build it  
up and tear it down, but that's not what we're trying to do,'' 
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We've got a bunch of quality players 
together, and they've played together for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, who manned the bench at Iowa State last year and has  
never played or coached professionally, is up against Sloan, a 
former Bulls playing great who begins his 11th season in Utah, by 
far the longest tenure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's in a tough situation,'' Sloan said of Floyd. ``I'm  
sure he'll make the best of it, but it would be a really tough 
thing to do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls franchise is making a definite effort toward a fresh  
start. The seven remaining players and three assistant coaches from 
last year's team quietly received their championship rings 
Wednesday at the Bulls' practice facility, rather than during a 
public ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, Brent Barry and Toni Kukoc are definite starters for the  
Bulls on Friday. Beyond that, it gets murky: Floyd will likely 
start journeymen Andrew Lang or veteran Bill Wennington at center 
and Mario Bennett or Dickey Simpkins at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost both of its preseason games to the Indiana Pacers,  
but also showed more life than some expected. In particular, Kukoc 
scored 32 points in the Bulls' 89-83 loss in their final 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not the same team, but they're still the Bulls,'' Jeff  
Hornacek said. ``We respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Marines-Cable Car Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A court-martial began today for a  
Marine pilot whose jet clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 
people, with the judge discussing whether the defendant will take 
the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby's trial on 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter began one day after the first anniversary of the 
tragedy that happened when the wing of his EA-6B Prowler sliced 
through cables supporting the Mount Cermis ski gondola in Cavalese, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, told Ashby's attorneys today  
that they must state after the government completes its case 
whether Ashby will testify. 
</P>
<P>
	If he takes the stand, prosecutors will be allowed to interview  
an expert witness on computer flight simulation, Nunley said. He 
didn't elaborate on how the testimony of the expert related to 
Ashby's participation. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also reviewed conferences held over the past month  
with defense attorneys and prosecutors before beginning to 
interview potential jurors. Jury selection was expected to begin 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the jet was flying too low and too fast and  
that the cable wouldn't have been struck if Ashby had followed 
flight rules. The gondola cable hung about 370 feet above the 
ground, and the minimum altitude for the mission was 1,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers say the accident was not Ashby's fault.  
</P>
<P>
	Two Poles, seven Germans, five Belgians, three Italians, two  
Austrians and one Dutch person died in the Feb. 3, 1998, accident. 
Attorneys for the victims are seeking damage payments from the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service was held Wednesday in Italy for the victims.  
</P>
<P>
	``The pain that one year ago visited the lives of so many people  
is our pain,'' the Rev. Renzo Caserotti said. ``It is a death that 
could have been avoided, caused by an airplane that flew very low, 
outside all rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., could be sentenced to more  
than 200 years in prison if convicted of all charges, which also 
include destruction of government and private property and 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen jurors, all officers of rank equal to Ashby's or higher,  
were appointed by the same general who ordered that Ashby be 
charged. During questioning today, lawyers can reduce the size of 
the panel if they detect an objectionable bias, and the 
court-martial can proceed with a panel as small as five members, 
said base spokesman Maj. Scott Jack. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening arguments are set for Monday, and the entire proceeding  
is expected to last two weeks. The court-martial is being held at 
this sprawling Marine base in eastern North Carolina because the 
jet was stationed at nearby Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
	A central defense issue is whether Ashby, the only pilot aboard  
the four-man aircraft designed to detect and jam enemy radar, 
obeyed the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and defense attorneys have agreed the 33-year-old  
cable system wasn't marked on the map Ashby was given before he 
began a low-level training flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Civilian defense lawyer Frank Spinner said air crews rely on the  
maps they are given by the government. Ashby shouldn't be blamed 
for the tragedy, which briefly strained relations between the 
United States and Italy, Spinner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a Marine investigation panel ruled that the air crew  
was at fault. The report said the jet was too low and flying faster 
than the 450-knot (roughly 500 mph) air speed restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	All four members of the crew were charged initially, but the  
charges against the two back seat crewmen were later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., also is charged with 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter 
and will be tried after Ashby's court-martial ends. Schweitzer 
shared the front cockpit of the jet with Ashby but had no control 
stick.

<HEADLINE> USDA Defends Tainted Meat Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal food safety officials on Thursday  
defended their response to an outbreak of tainted meat at a 
Michigan meat processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Tainted meat from the Bil Mar plant in Zeeland has been linked  
to 11 deaths, five miscarriages and stillbirths and about 72 
illnesses in 14 states, according to the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar, a division of Chicago-based Sara Lee Corp., on Dec. 22  
recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and other packaged meat 
products sold under a variety of names. It said they could be 
tainted with listeria monocytogenes bacteria. The plant remains 
closed during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria are common bacteria but can pose a serious risk to  
people with weakened immune systems, as well as to the elderly, 
diabetics and pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and  
Inspection Service began investigating the plant Dec. 15 after 
consulting with the CDC on a rash of illnesses but did not have 
evidence of an ``intact'' contaminated product until several days 
later, said Margaret Glavin, associate FSIS administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lack of an absolutely firm link with the plant,''  
Glavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Glavin said the agency met with company officials Dec. 18  
and asked them to consider taking the product off the market. USDA 
does not have recall authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ultimately did do it,'' Glavin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen denied there was any such  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not aware of any recommendations of a market withdrawal  
or a recall,'' Herlevsen said. ``It was a voluntary action ... in 
the absence of any recommendations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the first food safety issue at the plant, officials  
said. In 1997, the plant was closed for several days after 
inspectors found a series of sanitation discrepancies, Glavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, company officials found evidence of listeria during  
environmental testing, but at that time, there was no evidence of 
listeria in the product, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the July testing, the company underwent ``very aggressive  
sanitizing and cleaning of all areas,'' Herlevsen said.

<HEADLINE>  Venezuela Reinstates Coup Seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- On the seventh anniversary of a failed  
coup that helped catapult him to the presidency, Hugo Chavez said 
Thursday that coup participants will be reinstated in the military 
and he urged a bigger role for the armed forces in civic projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments are likely to aggravate worries among Chavez's  
detractors, who doubt his commitment to democracy and fear a 
greater role for the army in a region with a history of military 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, 44, inaugurated Tuesday as president, has already named  
several former coup participants to senior government posts, 
including Caracas governor, transportation minister and secret 
police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	During a gala military parade held traditionally for new  
presidents, the former paratrooper praised the participants in his 
Feb. 4, 1992 coup attempt, an action that at the time provoked 
international condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserve justice and acknowledgment, more than me. They  
have been anonymous heroes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the military parade is held the day after the  
inauguration, but Chavez pushed it back a day to coincide with the 
anniversary of his attempted coup. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers in camouflage, their faces smeared with black war  
paint, goose-stepped in a salute to Chavez, who rode waving in an 
open car with his wife Marisabel. Parachuters descended from planes 
and fighter jets screamed overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of onlookers, many wearing Chavez's trademark red  
beret, shouted, ``Chavez! Chavez!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech, the new president urged the Supreme Court to rule  
in favor of soldiers who claim they have been passed over for 
promotions or thrown out of the armed forces because of two 1992 
coup attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced he was reactivating two elite paratrooper units,  
including his own former unit that tried to overthrow 
then-President Carlos Andres Perez, whose administration was rocked 
by mass riots and allegations of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years later, it's still not clear how many died in  
Chavez's revolt, but the number is believed to be several dozen. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez also said that he will form special civic action units in  
the military to help build highways, bridges and schools, provide 
medical service, and farm.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Prayers for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a hotel ballroom filled with world leaders  
-- plus a few House members who voted to impeach him -- a special 
prayer was offered Thursday for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	During the National Prayer Breakfast, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,  
D-Conn., asked God to bless Clinton ``at this time of difficulty,'' 
and hear the president's pleas for forgiveness and atonement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Help him in the work he is doing with his family and his  
clergy,'' Lieberman said. ``Lord, we pray that you will not only 
restore his soul and lead him in the path of righteousness for your 
name's sake, but help us join with him to heal the breach, begin 
the reconciliation and restore our national soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making no mention of his personal situation, Clinton urged  
leaders to put aside grievances and seek genuine reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout history, people have prayed to God to aid them in  
war,'' Clinton said. ``I do believe that even though Adolf Hitler 
preached a perverted form of Christianity, God did not want him to 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also know that when we take up arms or words against one  
another, we must be very careful in invoking the name of our Lord. 
The Almighty has his own designs, and all we can do is pray to know 
God's will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Lieberman, no one else mentioned Clinton's situation,  
and a few speakers took pains to note that the event was not meant 
to be a political forum. Several congressional leaders in the room, 
including House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., applauded the president when he 
was introduced along with others on the dais; Barr, however, exited 
by a side door just as Clinton rose to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's host, Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., walked the line  
between political and prayerful to joke about his ``terrific 
relationship'' with Clinton despite their political differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may not have voted with you in the four years I've been in  
Congress, but I want you to know that I care for you and love 
you,'' Largent told Clinton. ``And that's part of the mystery of 
Jesus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer by Lieberman came at the close of the breakfast, an  
annual event that brings together members of Congress, the courts, 
the administration, various diplomats and the presidents of a few 
countries. This year's breakfast was the 47th gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first prayer breakfast for Palestinian leader Yasser  
Arafat, who finally accepted after three years of invitations. He 
cordially greeted well-wishers who approached his front-and-center 
table in a ballroom filled with thousands. And he also was on the 
receiving end of a prayer -- Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pray for the peacemakers,'' Clinton said. ``Pray for Chairman  
Arafat and the Palestinians, for the government of Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton met with Arafat for about 20 minutes, said  
White House spokesman Barry Toiv. He also had brief sessions with 
the presidents of Ecuador and Benin, and the prime ministers of 
Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	He recounted a conversation he had with the late Israeli Prime  
Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Sept. 19, 1993, just before Rabin and 
Arafat sealed their peace accord with a handshake, saying Rabin's 
words resonate with him still. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, ... 'This is difficult.' And I started to make an  
argument, and before I could say anything he said, 'But you do not 
make peace with your friends,''' Clinton said. ``You do not make 
peace with your friends, but friendship can come with time and 
trust and humility, when we do not pretend that our willfulness is 
an expression of God's will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton admitted that he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton  
stayed up late the night before discussing what he would say. His 
prayer list was long and far-ranging, from the conflicts in Kosovo, 
Northern Ireland and Bosnia to religious freedom and the health of 
King Hussein of Jordan, who is suffering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to pray for all of us, including yourselves; to pray  
that our purpose truly will reflect God's will,'' Clinton said. 
``To remember that all the great peacemakers in the world, in the 
end, have to let go and walk away, like Christ, not from apparent, 
but from genuine, grievances.''

<HEADLINE> Group: NASA Headed for Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA is headed for a crisis because  
of cutbacks that could jeopardize space shuttle safety, an 
oversight group warns. 
</P>
<P>
	While shuttle safety is satisfactory for now, it could suffer in  
the future as a result of inadequate job skills and other 
shortfalls in the work force, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel 
said Thursday in its annual report to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hiring freeze of the past several years has all but killed  
the usual pattern of bringing `new blood' into the agency to 
replace those who are leaving,'' the report said. ``Although the 
hiring freeze has now been lifted, budgetary restrictions make it 
all but impossible to replace experienced persons who are 
leaving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel described the situation as a looming crisis.  
</P>
<P>
	``Budget and personnel ceiling constraints on the hiring of  
engineers, scientists and technical workers are moving NASA toward 
a crisis of losing the core competencies needed to conduct the 
nation's space flight and aerospace programs in a safe and 
effective manner,'' the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last year, the shuttle work force totaled about 21,000  
nationwide, mostly contractors. That's down about one-third from 
six years earlier, according to NASA statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety panel, which was formed in the wake of the deadly  
Apollo spacecraft fire in 1967, urged that more money go toward 
hiring and training at Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center 
in Houston and Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget cuts also have forced NASA to put off improvements to the  
shuttle fleet and the international space station, the panel said. 
Astronauts connected the first two pieces of the station in orbit 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though both programs are presently operating at an  
acceptable level of risk, there are identified improvements that 
could make them even safer,'' the panel's chairman, Richard 
Blomberg, wrote in a letter accompanying the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel cited, among other things, outdated shuttle computers  
and an inadequate supply of spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
	An added burden for Kennedy workers, the panel noted, is the  
uncertainty surrounding the shuttle flight schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule has been in disarray for more than a year because  
of delays in launching pieces of the international space station -- 
Russian money problems are to blame -- as well as ongoing problems 
with an X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the need to replace four bad circuit boards in the  
$1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory, NASA has postponed its 
launch aboard the shuttle Columbia from April until May at the 
earliest. Shuttle managers may bump the telescope-delivery mission 
behind a station ferry flight by Discovery that's targeted for late 
May.

<HEADLINE> Hearst Abduction Riveted the Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos PLH101, FX107    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Police inspector Dan Wolke still vividly  
remembers being called into the chief's office 25 years ago. He 
thought he was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told me Patty Hearst had been kidnapped,'' he recalled  
this week. ``I said, 'Who's Patty Hearst?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolke quickly found out, along with the rest of a fascinated  
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst Shaw is a married  
mother living in Connecticut, still trying to clear her name. But 
on Feb. 4, 1974, she was a 19-year-old college student abducted in 
a barrage of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	A band of radicals calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation  
Army announced that they had made her a prisoner of war to avenge 
``the crimes her mother and father have committed against the 
American people and the people of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLA was born in neighboring Berkeley, a hotbed of opposition  
to the Vietnam War. Its symbol was a seven-headed snake, and its 
rallying cry was ``Death to the fascist insect that preys upon the 
life of the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group demanded that Randolph and Catherine Hearst distribute  
$2 million worth of food to the needy before they would discuss 
freedom for their daughter. The demand later climbed to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Hearst Shaw was held for weeks in a closet. The SLA,  
led by the grandly named Field Marshall Cinque, indoctrinated her 
with radical rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	Cinque, who took his name from a famous rebel slave, was  
actually an escaped convict -- Donald DeFreeze, a father of six who 
was obsessed with weapons and was a lifelong loser in battles with 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Shaw metamorphosed into Tania, a member of the very group  
that took her prisoner. She named herself for a Bolivian woman who 
had died with Che Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after the kidnapping, she was photographed carrying a  
carbine during a SLA holdup of a San Francisco bank -- the robbery 
for which she eventually was tried, convicted and sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was overwhelming to start out with,'' Wolke said. ``One  
surprise after the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLA appeared for the first time three months before the  
kidnapping when they ambushed and murdered Oakland schools Supt. 
Marcus Foster. Two SLA members -- Joseph Remiro and Russell Little -- 
were arrested after a gunfight with police and sent to prison for 
that crime, although Little was later retried and acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was basically destroyed in May of 1974 when six  
members, including Cinque, were trapped by police in a Los Angeles 
house. As the nation watched the action live on television, 
officers riddled the place with bullets and it finally caught fire. 
All six died. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst Shaw went underground. There were scores of sightings,  
but she didn't reemerge until Sept. 18, 1975, when she was arrested 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she claimed she was the victim of brainwashing, she was  
sentenced to seven years for the bank robbery. She served about two 
years before President Carter commuted her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Since her release from prison, Hearst Shaw has become a  
celebrity. She has appeared in two movies directed by John Waters, 
in several television sitcoms, and even written novels. She 
declined to be interviewed for this story, but her husband, Bernard 
Shaw, said by telephone from New York that the family doesn't 
discuss the SLA days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, to be truthful, most people who meet her today think  
of her as an actress and author,'' he said. ``Most have seen her in 
the movies or on TV or have read one of her two books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also does charitable work for Alzheimer's and AIDS groups  
and for Meals on Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many people thought her brainwashing defense was  
far-fetched, Wolke said he is a believer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never forgot that she was a kidnap victim, a young woman,  
impressionable,'' he said. ``I never talked to her, but I believe 
most of what I've read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, he added, ``It could have been my kids.''

<HEADLINE>  Different Bulls Team To Face Jazz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- There is a certain spot on the Delta  
Center floor where Michael Jordan hit the final, 
championship-winning shot of his incomparable career. 
</P>
<P>
	The next member of the Chicago Bulls to shoot on that hallowed  
ground could be Rusty LaRue. 
</P>
<P>
	The wretched remains of the six-time world champions will return  
Friday to the scene of their club's last triumph, a Game 6 NBA 
Finals win over the Utah Jazz that capped Jordan's career and 
signaled the end of Chicago's basketball reign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a delicious bit of payback, the Jazz, who saw their  
championship dreams twice crushed by Jordan and his teammates, have 
the opportunity to throw the first punch in what will probably be a 
season of beatings for the depleted Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie coach Tim Floyd has the dubious honor of beginning his  
rebuilding project in one of the NBA's most hostile environments. 
</P>
<P>
	A ripple of excitement spread through Salt Lake City two weeks  
ago when the NBA released its shortened schedule and a rematch 
between the conference champions was right at the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd and the Bulls realize that, Jordan or no Jordan, Jazz fans  
will always have it in for anybody wearing Chicago's red and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to boo us as soon as we get off the airplane,''  
said Ron Harper, the only remaining starter from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to know this is a different team, and I'll pass this  
word,'' Floyd said with a laugh. ``I think regardless of who is 
coming in, the Bulls or any other team, Utah is going to be sending 
a statement early and quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While their fans may think otherwise, the Jazz players aren't  
attaching any special meaning to the meeting. For them, running 
with the Bulls is just the first lap in a race they hope will end 
in the champions' circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of 50 games we've got to play well in to make a  
run at the playoffs,'' Karl Malone said. ``Michael, Scottie 
(Pippen) and Dennis (Rodman) were the Bulls. It's not like that any 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Chicago bears only faint resemblance to the Bulls of eight  
months ago, the biggest change the Jazz made was allowing utility 
big man Antoine Carr to sign with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been replaced by Thurl Bailey, who has been out of the  
league since 1994, and center Todd Fuller, who was acquired from 
Golden State on Thursday for a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some teams in basketball and in other sports like to build it  
up and tear it down, but that's not what we're trying to do,'' 
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``We've got a bunch of quality players 
together, and they've played together for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, who manned the bench at Iowa State last year and has  
never played or coached professionally, is up against Sloan, a 
former Bulls playing great who begins his 11th season in Utah, by 
far the longest tenure in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``That guy's in a tough situation,'' Sloan said of Floyd. ``I'm  
sure he'll make the best of it, but it would be a really tough 
thing to do what he's doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls franchise is making a definite effort toward a fresh  
start. The seven remaining players and three assistant coaches from 
last year's team quietly received their championship rings 
Wednesday at the Bulls' practice facility, rather than during a 
public ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Harper, Brent Barry and Toni Kukoc are definite starters for the  
Bulls on Friday. Beyond that, it gets murky: Floyd will likely 
start journeymen Andrew Lang or veteran Bill Wennington at center 
and Mario Bennett or Dickey Simpkins at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost both of its preseason games to the Indiana Pacers,  
but also showed more life than some expected. In particular, Kukoc 
scored 32 points in the Bulls' 89-83 loss in their final 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not the same team, but they're still the Bulls,'' Jeff  
Hornacek said. ``We respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Gary Coleman Testifies at Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Eighty-six-pound former TV star Gary  
Coleman testified Thursday he was trying to get away from a large 
and scary woman when he hit her during a dispute over an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who played Arnold in the sitcom ``Diff'rent Strokes,''  
admitted during his misdemeanor assault and battery trial that he 
hit Tracy Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very small, very delicate, you know,'' said Coleman, who  
stands 4-foot-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't break easy, but I do break. And I was getting real  
scared, so I thought it's either fight or flee,'' Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, 30, said Ms. Fields, a 205-pound bus driver, yelled at  
him after he gave her an autograph July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``She called across the room again quite loudly, `Ain't you  
gonna put nothing nice on it?''' Coleman said. ``I thought that's 
really rude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who works for a mall security force, said Ms. Fields  
swore at him and called him a punk, so he swore back. He tore up 
the autograph and that's when she allegedly became menacing. 
</P>
<P>
	``After she bristled and got a little huffy and blocked my path  
I decided, well, she looks like she wants to slap the taste out of 
my mouth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fields claims to suffer from headaches and muscle spasms  
since the incident and has filed a $1 million lawsuit against 
Coleman.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down Sharply at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Share prices in Tokyo fell sharply Friday morning  
on the dollar's weakness against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average shed 238.96 points, or 1.70 percent,  
ending the morning session at 13,847.89. On Thursday, the average 
closed down 74.46 points, or 0.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.14 yen at midday, down 1.64 yen from late  
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its level of 112.21 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has remained under persistent selling by Japanese  
exporters amid weak sentiment toward the currency due to higher 
Japanese bond yields supporting the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on Japanese government bonds have risen recently on  
nervousness over the government's plans to finance its economic 
stimulus steps by boosting the bond supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 2.250  
percent from Thursday's finish of 2.190 percent, driving its price 
down to 96.52 yen from 96.97 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters Friday that the  
United States and Japan agree on currency policy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the U.S. currency stance has not changed and the market  
appears to be ``aware'' of the dollar-yen level considered 
comfortable by the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 127.36 yen, down  
from 128.52 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 12.37 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,078.40. The 
TOPIX closed down 6.38 points, or 0.58 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at  
9,304.50 points, down 62.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors were avoiding major moves ahead of the release  
later Friday of U.S. unemployment data for January.

<HEADLINE> Browns Cramming for Draft Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns are practicing hard.  
</P>
<P>
	They've been reviewing scouting reports, game films and medical  
dossiers. They've tested their game plan with a couple of 
walk-throughs, sharpened pencils and loaded fresh batteries into 
calculators. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, all eyes in the NFL will again be trained on  
Cleveland, and the Browns want to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	With all this preparation, you'd think the Steelers were coming  
to town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be ready for next Tuesday,'' Browns president Carmen  
Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Tuesday is when the Browns will add players to their roster  
by choosing from a list of 150 of the NFL's unwanted in the 
expansion draft. It has been hectic this week at the Browns' 
headquarters in Berea as coach Chris Palmer, his coaches -- he named 
two more Thursday -- and Browns director of football operations 
Dwight Clark plot their strategy for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few months, putting together an offensive game plan for the  
Broncos will seem simple by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first week we've had a chance to put a staff  
together and have a mock draft with Dwight,'' said Palmer, who 
admitted he lies awake at night worrying about what the Browns will 
do next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland will have an opportunity to select up to 42 players in  
the expansion draft. But because they are being required to spend 
38 percent (about $22 million) of their salary cap on players they 
take in the expansion draft, the Browns are having to weigh a 
player's worth based on a variety of factors. 
</P>
<P>
	How old is the player? How much does he make? How long is his  
contract? Is he healthy? 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns' selections will also be based on what they plan to  
do in the free-agent market, which opens next week as well. And 
beyond that, Cleveland has to gauge what it might be able to get in 
April's college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	So just because there are attractive names like Denver defensive  
back Darrien Gordon, Green Bay wide receiver Robert Brooks and Jets 
quarterback Glenn Foley on the list, don't think they're locks to 
become Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are all on there for a reason,'' Clark said.  
</P>
<P>
	Palmer used the 1995 expansion draft to qualify what the Browns  
are hoping to reap next week. Of the 66 players taken by 
Jacksonville and Carolina that year, only four remain on those 
teams' rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expansion draft allows us to get the bottom half of our  
roster,'' Palmer said. ``That will give us players No. 30 through 
45. Will they be good enough to play in this league? Yes they will. 
I think we're looking for players with upside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going through a mock draft earlier this week with Clark,  
Palmer said he was pleased with what he envisioned the Browns could 
soon look like. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was encouraged by some of the players who I think will fall  
our way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns are keeping quiet about who they might take with the  
first pick, but Clark said he is continuing to massage the list of 
about 45-50 players he is serious about possibly selecting. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the players on the list, Clark said there was at least one  
player from each of the 30 teams that interests Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this year we're looking for the best players,'' Clark  
said. ``We're trying to get as many good players as we can so we 
have a good foundation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns also announced they've signed free-agent quarterback  
James Ritchey, who played college ball at Stephen F. Austin and was 
signed by the Tennessee Oilers before the 1998 season. He also 
played for Barcelona of the NFL Europe League last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer filled two more assistant coaching vacancies by naming  
Dick Portee his offensive backfield coach and Jerry Holmes his 
secondary coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Portee, 56, has coached in the college ranks for the past 30  
years. He spent the past nine years at North Carolina State, and 
was recommended to Palmer by Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, 41, played 12 seasons in the NFL and most recently  
coached the defensive secondary at West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Juror Says Plaintiff Got Ripped Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- William Bowen says all he wants is justice.  
</P>
<P>
	After a trial judge dismissed a case following two weeks of  
testimony, he and fellow jurors thought the plaintiff got a raw 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He's so sure that he offered the woman $5,000 to help finance an  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wrong to take it away from the jury,'' Bowen said of  
the judge's action. ``We are the ones who heard all the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowen said he took an informal poll of the other jurors and they  
all agreed Joanne Bragg deserved a judgment of at least $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bragg, whose lawsuit claimed a bank helped her ex-husband  
steal money from her, has never met Bowen but is thrilled by his 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my viewpoint, it's the right thing to do,'' said Bowen,  
who owns a Burbank firm that clears titles for mortgage companies. 
``I wanted to make sure she would ultimately get her day in 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time a juror has refused to drop a case. In  
Dalton, Ga., last year, a criminal court juror reluctantly voted to 
convict a man of molesting a 13-year-old boy, then spent his own 
money to hire an attorney to appeal. The boy admitted he lied and 
the defendant was freed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bowen's offer is unusual.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've never heard of jurors in civil cases becoming that  
emotionally involved,'' Laurie Levenson, associate dean of the 
Loyola University Law School, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bragg's attorney probably can accept the juror's money since  
he did not ask for it, said Lynne Geminder, an attorney for the 
California Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bragg, a real estate broker in Hawthorne, 14 miles south of  
Los Angeles, sued Hawthorne Savings &AMP; Loan Association, claiming 
bank officers helped her ex-husband, Brian Oliver, steal an 
estimated $200,000 from their joint bank accounts from 1989 to 
1991. The two had owned and operated a construction business 
together until their 1990 divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Bragg failed to prove that Hawthorne Savings caused her  
substantial damage, Superior Court Judge William C. Beverly said 
when he dismissed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank lawyer Roger Heyman argued that Oliver used the money to  
pay off loans the couple had incurred jointly in their business -- 
not for his personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyman said Bowen shouldn't have reached any conclusions about  
the case because the trial ended before the bank presented its 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found that a little offensive,'' Heyman said. ``Courts  
admonish juries to keep an open mind until they hear both sides.''

<HEADLINE> Martha Graham Dance Company Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of the great dance masterpieces created by  
modern dance pioneer Martha Graham were performed in a special gala 
to open the first season the Martha Graham Dance Company has had in 
New York City since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The season at the Joyce Theater was made possible through the  
sale of the building where Graham worked with her company for 40 
years. Graham died in 1991 at the age of 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's audience saw three powerful solos Graham created for  
herself, the moving 1931 ``Primitive Mysteries,'' excerpts from two 
longer dances and amusing reminiscences by three former pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Randall, Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach were acting students  
at the Neighborhood Playhouse in the 1940s and took Graham's 
classes in dramatic gesture. Wallach, who did a proud Graham walk, 
said he puts at least one Graham movement in every play he does. 
Jackson, who demonstrated that she can still do several of the 
movements, said she had to burst into tears in her first movie. She 
did a Graham contraction, doubled forward and pretended to cry, 
then was able to cry. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Primitive Mysteries,'' possibly the highlight of a  
high-quality evening, Rika Okamoto was luminous dancing the young 
girl. Graham was inspired by Southwestern Spanish-American culture, 
specifically a coming-of-age celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ``Ritual to the Sun'' section of ``Acts of Light'' from  
1981, the impressive Martin Lofsnes danced smoothly and powerfully. 
Company members wore gold leotards and were bathed in bright light. 
The dance may have been designed to show aspects of Graham 
technique but its effect is light-affirming. 
</P>
<P>
	The final dance was the ``Prelude to Action'' section from  
Graham's antiwar ``Chronicle.'' Terese Capucilli received probably 
the evening's most applause as an exhorting, dynamic leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deep Song,'' a solo from 1937, is another antiwar dance.  
Christine Dakin dance with anguish and despair. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Vale danced the ``Frontier'' solo from 1935, portraying a  
pioneer woman's joy and determination. Fang Yi Sheu danced the 
funny 1932 ``Satyric Festival Song.'' It is another work drawn from 
the time Graham spent in the American southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has 24 dancers. To keep costs lower, 17 will travel  
on tour.

<HEADLINE> FCC Asked To Examine WWF Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal regulators are hearing complaints that  
the World Wrestling Federation went over the line of decency with 
its raucous Super Bowl commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Two TV watchdog groups said Wednesday the commercial should not  
have run Sunday on a program with such wide appeal as the annual 
telecast of the NFL's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	But WWF officials said most people who saw the ad -- including  
officials at Fox Broadcasting Co., which carried the telecast -- 
found nothing offensive about it and said they intend to continue 
running the ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert W. Peters, president of the group Morality in Media,  
called the WWF commercial ``one of the most vile commercials ever 
aired on network TV'' even though he conceded he hadn't seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Family Association, another group often critical of  
sex and violence on television, told the Federal Communications 
Commission that the ad fell within the agency's definition of 
indecency and should not have run in the early evening as it did on 
Sunday's Super Bowl broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Family Association, which is based in Tupelo,  
Miss., filed a complaint against its local Fox television 
affiliate, WLOV in West Point, Miss., and urged others to file 
similar complaints against their local Fox stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad in question offered a typical ``day at the office'' at  
WWF headquarters in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	WWF wrestler ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin says in the ad that the  
WWF offers ``a nonviolent form of entertainment'' just before he 
slams a folding chair against a passerby. Executives brawled in the 
lobby and office suites in the ad, and bodies shattered glass 
partitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene Roberts and the American Family Association faulted  
showed a a couple in an embrace with the woman's legs wrapped 
around the man's waist as female wrestler Sable walks by saying 
``We never use sex to enhance our image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The spot was a tongue-in-cheek parody,'' said Jim Byrne, a  
marketing executive for the WWF. ``Everything about it was so 
over-the-top that for anyone to interpret it literally is 
interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said most people got the joke. ``There will always be people  
who take themselves way too seriously who are extremely vocal,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to WLOV was referred after office hours to a lawyer in  
Washington, and calls to Fox TV network executives for comment were 
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has authority to fine broadcast license holders like TV  
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Goldstein, chief of the FCC branch that handles such  
complaints, said the agency had received 45 complaints about the ad 
via e-mail through Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters said there probably would have been no complaints about  
the ad had it run in late-night TV when children are not watching. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he was appalled that it was shown during the Super  
Bowl, which typically draws the year's biggest TV audience. ``The 
vast majority of parents wouldn't have any concern about having 
their 2-year-olds watching it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Movie Critic Siskel Taking a Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Movie critic Gene Siskel is giving his thumb a  
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	He's taking a leave of absence from the TV show he shares with  
fellow critic Roger Ebert to concentrate on his recovery from brain 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel said Wednesday that he also will suspend his reviews for  
the Chicago Tribune, Chicago's WBBM-TV, CBS's ``This Morning'' and 
TV Guide while he spends time recuperating at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in a hurry to get well because I don't want Roger to get  
more screen time than I,'' Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel had emergency surgery May 11 to remove a growth in his  
brain. Soon after, he was screening movies for ``Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' 
from his hospital bed and phoning in his reviews to Ebert on the 
show's set. 
</P>
<P>
	He resumed his full workload within a few weeks of the surgery  
but said he's now taking his doctor's advice to take some time off. 
</P>
<P>
	Siskel and Ebert are perhaps the nation's most recognizable  
movie critics with their trademark ``thumbs-up'' and 
``thumbs-down'' reviews. Siskel hopes to return next fall to the 
show he has hosted with Ebert for 23 years. Ebert taped this 
weekend's program solo for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Twins' Reliever Trombley Gets Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Twins' price-chopping offseason  
didn't cost Mike Trombley a big raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Trombley, who has become a stalwart of Minnesota's bullpen over  
the last two seasons, agreed Thursday to a one-year contract worth 
$1,475,000. That's a 247 percent raise over the $425,000 Trombley 
earned last season, when he was 6-5 with a 3.68 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	His 77 games ranked fourth in the AL, and Trombley led the  
Twins' staff by allowing opposing hitters to hit just .248. One of 
Minnesota's two players in arbitration, Trombley had asked for 
$1.85 million. The Twins had offered $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Matt Lawton, the other Twins player in arbitration,  
asked for a raise from $215,000 to $2.4 million. Minnesota has 
offered $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to afford the kind of salaries that would allow them to  
stock their team with quality veterans, the Twins are expected to 
slice their payroll to $12 million or $14 million for 1999, about 
half of what it was last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The big raise for Trombley could be a sign that his role is  
about to change. Closer Rick Aguilera, who had 38 saves last season 
and re-signed last year for $3.2 million in 1999, reportedly has 
agreed to waive his no-trade clause if the Twins can work out a 
deal he's comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
	If Aguilera leaves, Trombley probably would inherit the bulk of  
the closer's duties.

<HEADLINE> Wilkins Agrees to Terms With Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Dominique Wilkins will be back in the NBA  
this season, joining the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins, known as the ``Human Highlight Film'' when he played  
for the Atlanta Hawks, agreed to terms with the Magic on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic would not confirm the deal, but Wilkins' agent, Steve  
Kauffman, said the NBA's eighth-leading career scorer will sign 
with Orlando on Friday and could be in uniform for Orlando's opener 
against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins, 39, last played in the NBA during the 1996-97 season,  
averaging just over 18 points for the San Antonio Spurs. He spent 
part of last year in Italy after scoring 26,534 points -- an average 
of 25.3 per game -- in 14 NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte Hornets also were pursuing the nine-time All-Star,  
who needs 177 points to move ahead of Oscar Robertson into seventh 
place on the career scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wilkins' desire to play with younger brother, Gerald, and an  
effective sales pitch from assistant coach Tree Rollins swayed him 
to the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chuck (Daly) is bringing me in there just to play my  
all-around game,'' Wilkins told ABC Sports radio. ``Gerald was 
pretty excited about it. In fact, he's given me No. 21. He's going 
to wear No. 9 this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins' deal also includes a $250,000 guarantee for the  
1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-time Atlanta Hawks star likely will back up Bo Outlaw  
at small forward. 
</P>
<P>
	His deal was struck as the Magic pared the roster to the opening  
night limit of 14 players by waiving guard Ruben Nembhard.
