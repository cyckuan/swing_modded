<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Approve Security, Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from European Union (
EU) member states agreed here Friday to set up a military force
for crisis management, actually entering an initial stage of the
15-nation bloc's security and defense integration.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan was cleared at the EU summit meeting being
held in Helsinki following a minor change through moderate debate
to a report drafted by Finland, the current EU presidency holder.
</P>
<P>
Adopted by EU foreign ministers last month, the plan details
the "headline goal" of creating a rapid reaction force of up to 60,
000 troops trained, equipped and ready to intervene in future
crises.
</P>
<P>
The force should be ready for use "by the year 2003" and able
to sustain deployment "for at least one year." The EU leaders
endorsed the calls in the plan for new structures including a
standing political and security committee, a military committee
and a military staff, which would be similar to that of the
mechanism within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders said in a declaration that the objective is for
the EU to have the "autonomous capacity to take decisions and,
where NATO as a whole is not engaged, to launch and then to
conduct EU-led military operations in response to international
crises."
</P>
<P>
The draft declaration also said "NATO remains the foundation of
the collective defense of its members, and will continue to have
an important role in crisis management."
</P>
<P>
The EU would also "ensure the necessary dialog, consultation
and cooperation with NATO and its non-EU members" and specific
functions would be developed in the future.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the wording in the plan is still murky
on new relationship with the United States within NATO. Some say
the European Security and Defense Initiative could loosen NATO
ties by forging a rival pole for defense policy.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, U.S. Call for Implementation of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and the United States
have urged parties to the Lusaka agreement to implement the pact
in a bid to resolve the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and visiting U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke made the call here Friday
during their two- hour talks which mainly focused on the DRC
issue.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the President's Office, they
agreed on the urgent need for the Joint Military Commission (JMC)
to expedite its work in implementing the cease-fire agreement
signed in Zambian capital Lusaka in July this year by the parties
directly involved in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that facilitators should be chosen as soon as
possible and the JMC should be more vigorous in order to ensure
the effective implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his talks with DRC rebel leaders here Friday
evening, the U.S. official said that the discussion is
indispensable for his country to understand the Congo issue.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke reiterated his government's commitment to
peace-keeping efforts in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed this week's Nairobi agreement
between Uganda and Sudan as well as AIDS situation and its
prevention in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Holbrook, who is on a tour of nine African nations, arrived
here on Friday morning and is expected to meet with DRC President
Laurent Kabila Saturday.

Denktash, the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with U.N. officials Friday morning, Denktash said
there would be further talks Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I think we will be able to leave on Tuesday, the 14th," he

two sides are within reach but do not meet face to face, with U.N.
coordinators shuttling between them.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Praised for Its Anti-AIDS Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations Richard Holbrooke said here Friday evening that
Uganda has performed very well in its campaign against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Kampala, the U.S. envoy said that he
was deeply impressed by the Ugandan government's commitment to
fighting the pandemic and by the people's awareness about the
killer disease.
</P>
<P>
"Too many people in the rest of the world believe that the
HIV/AIDS situation in Africa is hopeless. Uganda has shown the
world what it can do to prevent the epidemic by counselling and
raising people's awareness about it," Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, however, described Uganda's current HIV
infection rate of 10 percent as still frighteningly high, and
appealed to the press to contribute to the success of the current
anti-AIDS campaign.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's performance in fighting HIV/AIDS is exemplary on the
African continent. HIV infection rate has dropped from over 30
percent to the current 10 percent due to the government's openness
and commitment about it, mass participation and active counselling
work.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who spearheads a U.S. delegation including
Undersecretary of State Susan Rice, is on a nine-nation African
tour.

<P>
The cash donation will enable the WFP to buy commodities, such
as maize, beans and salt, and quickly bring them to critical areas
with the war-torn Angola.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing some very hungry months in the highlands after
the first of the year," said Francesco Strippoli, WFP
representative and humanitarian aid coordinator in Angola.
</P>
<P>
High insecurity on the roads and widespread fighting in the
countryside have kept many cities isolated and in desperate need
of food for the past year, the WFP said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 2,000 Angolan refugees have arrived in
Zambia over the past four days following heavy fighting between
the rebel Nations Union for the Total Independence of Angola (
UNITA) and the Angolan government troops, a spokesman for the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Friday in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The largest population of new arrivals is currently
concentrated in Kalabo, on the western side of the Zimbezi plains,
according to the U.N. food agency. Of the 1,450 persons registered
Thursday morning, some 200 were military personnel from the
Angolan army.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said that there were indications that the
confrontation has intensified along the entire border between
Zambia and Angola, raising the possibility of more refugees into
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Food and non-food supplies have been dispatched to the region
and the agency's staff have been deployed to Mebeba in Angola to
coordinate the relief effort.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Kill 4 Government Soldiers: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Four government soldiers were
killed in a pre-dawn rebel attack on government military barracks
in west Uganda Friday, State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma
has confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels attacked the barracks
in Bundibugyo district at about 5:00 a.m., the state minister said
in a statement issued here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some other soldiers sustained injuries, Kavuma said without
giving the exact number.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, a total of six rebels were killed, he
said, adding that the government troops are still pursuing the
fleeing rebels.
</P>
<P>
Being repulsed by Ugandan troops in the eastern parts of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the ADF rebels sneaked into
Uganda's western districts.
</P>
<P>
The rebels attacked a prison in the same region and abducted
more than 300 inmates Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Kavuma assured the public that there is no need to
panic and that the Ugandan government is doing all it can to
ensure the safety of the common people.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Concerned Over Recognition of Two Entities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus House Speaker Spyros
Kyprianou Friday expressed concern that the U.N. Secretariat may
take the position of the "acknowledgement" of two entities in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou, who is now acting president, made the remark at the
second Euro-Mediterranean Meeting of Left-Wing Parties, which
opened Tuesday in the island's southern coastal town of Limassol.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing "proximity talks" on Cyprus in New York would yield
no result "because even the U.N. Secretary-General has decided not
to insist on talks based on the U.N. resolutions," said the top
legislator.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied 37 percent of the northern island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Proximity talks between the two Cypriot communities on the
island are underway in New York under the U.N. auspices in an
effort to reunify the island, which is also applying for
membership of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou warned that "the present movements, in New York,
Helsinki or elsewhere, aim more or less at accepting the existing
situation."
</P>
<P>
The "acknowledgement" of two entities in Cyprus has been a
philosophy promoted basically by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations Secretariat, in my view, is more or less
going slowly and gradually to adopt the same position," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Francis Wurtz, president of the Group of the United
Left in the European Parliament, expressed left-wing parties'
solidarity and support for a just solution of the Cyprus issue
based on U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> WHO Advised to Undertake Further Research on Smallpox Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of health experts have
recommended that the World Health Organization (WHO) carry out
some further research on the smallpox (variola) virus before the
two remaining collections of the virus are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The scientific and public health experts made the
recommendation to the WHO director-general here Friday at the end
of a four-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Variola Virus
Research.
</P>
<P>
The research will focus on defined priority areas, will be time
limited and will be carried out under very careful control of WHO,
the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They defined the following areas in which research could
usefully be conducted before the end of 2002: sequencing more
completely the DNA of the smallpox virus; devising tests to detect
smallpox infection in humans; and developing drugs to treat human
smallpox infections, should they reappear.
</P>
<P>
A World Health Assembly resolution in May 1999 strongly
reaffirmed the decision to destroy the remaining stocks of variola
virus, but authorized temporary retention of the stocks up to the
year 2002, subject to annual review. Extending the deadline for
destruction of the stocks was to allow the possibility, if needed,
of further international research.
</P>
<P>
The two remaining smallpox virus stocks, consolidated during
the 1980s from a number of countries' laboratories, are held at
the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in
Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Region, Russia, and at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, the United
States.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official in Beirut for Mending Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian refugees living in
Lebanon should respect the host country's authority and must not
harm its security, said a senior official of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Al Kadoumy, director of PLO's political department, made
the remark at a news conference after his talks with Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Hoss in an effort to mend strained bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
However, Kadoumy was evasive when reporters asked whether he
would press Hoss to drop the death sentence handed down by a
Beirut court on Sultan Abul-Ainayn, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's top representative in Lebanon, on charges of defying the
authority of the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
"The verdict against Abul-Ainayn is a special case because
Palestinians in Lebanon are refugees and not citizens," he said,
implying that the Lebanese court should not impose sentences on
refugees who do not enjoy equal rights with full-fledged Lebanese
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn is PLO's secretary general in Lebanon and also
head of the Lebanon branch of Arafat's mainstream faction Fatah
Movement.
</P>
<P>
He has been living in Lebanon for years and is sheltering in
the heavily-armed Rashidieh Palestinian camp, near Lebanon's
southern-most port city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Lebanese government's surprise move against
Abul-Ainayn might have been motivated by the recent re-emergence
of Fatah at the Ein El-Hilweh camp near southern port city of
Sidon.
</P>
<P>
The camp is the biggest among the 12 shanty towns that house an
estimated 360,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Ein El-Hilweh camp was dominated by the rival
Syrian-backed Palestinian factions, which are opposed to Arafat's
peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Abul-Ainayn's death sentence was announced, the
Palestinian National Authority accused Beirut of "conducting an
oppressive policy" against the refugees living in the country,
making bilateral ties plummet to zenith.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy, who came here Thursday night, will try to resolve the
dispute during his two-day visit.

The EU leaders at their two-day Helsinki summit agreed to offer
Turkey the EU candidate status on an equal footing with all other
candidates, but set certain terms for its final access to the
negotiation process, at which EU officials said Turkey may not
feel very comfortable.
</P>
<P>
A Finnish presidency official said the EU decided to send a
delegation to Ankara because Turkey's initial response to the EU
offer was "not very positive."
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, accompanied by Finland's Deputy State Secretary
Jaakko Blomberg and EU Commissioner for enlargement Gunter
Verheugen, will show his diplomatic skills for the first time
after he took office as the EU's highest security and foreign
policy official.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU decision on Turkey's member status, any
outstanding border disputes must be checked "within a reasonable
time" before the International Court of Justice and the 15-nation
bloc will review the situation by the end of 2004.
</P>
<P>
The written decision, which had been sent to the Turkish
government, said the EU "underlines that a political settlement
will facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union."
</P>
<P>
"If no settlement has been reached by the completion of
accession negotiations," the EU leader's decision on Turkey's
acceptance will be made "without the above being a precondition,"
the document said, adding the EU would take account of "all
relevant factors."
</P>
<P>
The EU also asked Turkey to improve human rights records and to
comply with the political terms set by the EU for opening
accession talks.
</P>
<P>
After Solana's departure for Ankara, EU Commissioner for
external relations Christopher Patten told reporters that the EU
delegation's visit to Ankara showed that the EU attaches great
importance to the Turkey issue.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Speeds Up Integration, Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, December 10 (Xinhua) -- West Africa is to speed up its
steps in bringing about a more peaceful and integrated sub-region
in the new millenium, said a communique released at the end of a
sub-regional summit in Togo's capital Lome on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The communique, read by Executive Secretary of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Lansana Kouyate,
targets January 1, 2004 as the launching time of the West Africa
single monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
To this end, ECOWAS leaders okayed at the 16-member
sub-regional body's 22nd summit a set of convergence criteria
which, at its core, requires ECOWAS members to lower their
inflation rate under a five percent ceiling and have an external
reserve at least equal to six months of imports by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate free movement of persons and goods, ECOWAS
leaders agreed to take necessary steps to dismantle blocks on the
roads linking their countries, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to set up a ECOWAS Investment and Development
Bank in a bid to promote sub-regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Security cooperation is believed to be the highlight in ECOWAS'
more than 20 year's history, which has the honor of restoring
peace in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
To further cooperation in this regard, ECOWAS leaders formally
approved the establishment of a mechanism for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution, said the document.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism will include a Mediation and Security Council, a
multinational stand-by force and four Zonal Observation Bureaux.
</P>
<P>
The west African leaders also urged, in the 16-page communique,
the former Sierra Leonean rebels to surrender their arms to
facilitate the implementation of the Lome peace accord signed in
this July.
</P>
<P>
They also called upon Liberia and Guinea to implement the
measures adopted at the ECOWAS mini-summit held in Nigeria's
capital Abuja last September, to reduce tensions between their
borders.
</P>
<P>
On ECOWAS' restructuring, the leaders approved the
establishment of a Community Court of Justice and a Community
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ten presidents from Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Benin,
Senegal, Mali, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire and the host
state Togo attended the two- day summit.
</P>
<P>
Other ECOWAS states also sent delegates representing their
presidents to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The next summit of ECOWAS will be held in Mali's capital Bamako
in December, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Renews Oil-For-Food Deal In Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Friday unanimously approved the renewal of the
oil-for-food program in Iraq for another period of six months
beginning December 12, 1999.

The move came after the Security Council held days of
consultations on it.

<P>
According to the resolution, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in the coming six months and use
300 million dollars of the oil revenues to import equipment and
spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council requested the U.N. secretary-general to
continue to take the actions necessary to ensure the effective and
efficient implementation of this resolution.
</P>
<P>
The council decided to conduct a through review of all aspects
of the implementation of this resolution 90 days after the entry
into force and again prior to the end of the six months of period.
</P>
<P>
The council urged all states, and in particular the government
of Iraq, to provide their full cooperation in the effective
implementation of the resolution.

the timely submission of applications and the expeditious issue of
export licenses, facilitating the transit of humanitarian supplies
authorized by the U.N. sanctions committee and to take all other
appropriate measures to ensure that urgently needed humanitarian
supplies reach the Iraqi people as rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program began to be implemented in late 1996
and is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian situation in
Iraq which has been under stringent U.N. sanctions for nine years.

<HEADLINE> Romania Hails EU Decision Over Adherence Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Friday hailed the European Union's decision on the
beginning of the admission talks with six candidate states,
including Romania, saying it was a beautiful day for Romania and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Romania now enters a decisive stage of building a new Europe,
in which it is called to participate with responsibility and full
potential, stressed Constantinescu
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile considered the day a
historic one, as it confirms the European vocation of the Romanian
people, said a governmental communique.
</P>
<P>
The decision comes in recognition of Romania's efforts and
those of the Romanian people to build up a stable democracy, a
state of law and a market economy, as well as of the progress
scored in the harmonization of the Romanian legislation with the
European one, particularly in terms of community acquired
assimilation.
</P>
<P>
It is a first step toward EU full membership and the government
is aware that the achieving of this goal takes steady and complex
efforts by all the political forces, the entire society itself,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government stays decided to haste the working out
of a strategy of development on a medium term, designed
specifically for the acceleration of the macroeconomic reform and
put into practice short-term programs for the harmonization of the
economy as agreed with the EU and the international lenders, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen at
the EU Helsinki summit officially announced that EU leaders had

countries including Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania
and Malta.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Syria will
resume their peace talks in Washington next Wednesday and Thursday,
diplomatic sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation will be headed by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak while the head of Syria's is Foreign Minister Farouq al-
Shara. It will be the first highest level meeting between Israel
and Syria since the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton will meet Barak and al-Shara and
keep them close at hand through the whole round, a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
To help oversee the talks, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is canceling a trip to Panama for ceremonies marking the
U.S. handover of the Panama Canal and may cancel a trip to the
NATO winter meeting in Brussels, another U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming talks will be focused on Syria's demands to
reclaim the strategic Golan Heights, snatched by Israel during the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
The price Barak has placed on the Golan Heights is diplomatic
recognition from Syria.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda will be security measures designed to give
Israel the protection provided by control of the plateau since
1967.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Wednesday that more vital for Israel's security than
territory "is to find a way to make peace with our neighbors."

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Issue More Salient After Macao's Return: Chinese Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan issue stands
more salient than ever after the return of Macao to the motherland
in 10 days, a spokesman of the Chinese embassy in the United
States said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao marks a new step forward in the great cause
of unification of the Chinese nation, said Yu Shuning, minister
and spokesman of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
"Generation after generation, the Chinese people have been
longing for the unification of their motherland and have waged
heroic struggle to achieve this lofty objective," he said at a
press conference in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The policy of the Chinese government towards the Taiwan issue
has been clear-cut and consistent, that is "one country, two
systems" and peaceful reunification, Yu said, but he warned that
China wound not renounce the use of force.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to discard the use of force, because that
would encourage the separatists in Taiwan and certain foreign
forces in their scheme to split Taiwan from China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people will certainly overcome the difficulties
lying ahead and realize the long-cherished goal of the
reunification of the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yu pointed out that the Chinese government's policy towards
Taiwan is even more flexible as China will not send troops to the
area and people from Taiwan can occupy high posts in the Chinese
central government.
</P>
<P>
On the great significance of Macao's return to China after more
than 400 years of Portuguese occupation, Yu said this will put an
end to the last chapter in the history of foreign aggression
against the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat noted that this serves once again as an example
for resolving problems left over by history.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that thanks to the principle of "one country,
two systems" put forward by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping,
and with the joint efforts of China and Portugal, the issue of
Macao is being solved in a comparatively smooth manner.
</P>
<P>
This event, as well as the experience of Hong Kong during the
last two and a half years, proves beyond doubt that the principle
of "one country, two systems" is of great invention which has made
a gigantic contribution to the development of mankind, he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Using Chemical Arms in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
Friday categorically denied reported assertions that Russian
troops are using chemical weapons during the current military
operation in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The ministry in a statement described such reports as "a naked
lie and a provocation," saying that Russia "is strictly observing
the international convention barring the development, production ,
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons."
</P>
<P>
Russia ratified the convention which also mandates the
recycling of chemical weapons, it said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "government representatives of Ichkeria" touring
Western countries earlier made such assertions. The tour "is a
provocation aimed at misleading Western countries' public opinion
with regard to the Chechen events," the document said.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen militants "are stirring up anti-Russian sentiments
in an attempt to derail a completion of the federal campaign to
eliminate terrorism in Chechnya and restore Constitutional order,"
it noted.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry also said that
Islamic countries consider the Chechen issue Russia's internal
affair.
</P>
<P>
An Islamic Conference Organization (ICO) delegation, which
visited Moscow and the North Caucasus on December 6-7, reaffirmed
Friday that Muslim states "do not subject to doubt Russia's
territorial integrity and need to eradicate terrorism in Chechnya,
" but "advocate a political settlement to the problem," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the ICO delegation, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharazi, expressed "confidence that both Russian federal and local
authorities are doing their best to accommodate migrants' needs,"
said the ministry.

HANOI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Vietnamese
Foreign Ministry Friday refuted International Human Rights Watch's
(IHRW) assessment on the situation of Vietnam's human rights.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Vietnam's comment on the annual report
released by the IHRW on Friday, the Vietnamese spokesman said the
IHRW's report was completely groundless as it lacks objectiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said the IHRW's assessment showed that it fails to fully
perceive what has been going on in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He said the Vietnamese people had suffered great sacrifices and
losses to gain the most essential human right -- the right to live
in peace, independence and freedom.

<HEADLINE> GA President Calls for More Attention to Basic Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his message to the Human Rights Day, which falls on December
10 every year, Gurirab, the foreign minister of Namibia, said, "
The pursuit of human rights has for a long time now become a
centerpiece of United Nations activities."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations sees economic, social and cultural rights
in an interdependent and indivisible relationship with civil and
political rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The right to development, the right to peace, the right to
clean drinking water and the right to safe environment have all
been proclaimed as basic human rights without which full and
unfettered enjoyment of fundamental freedoms would be limited," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"As we close the twentieth century, the necessary institutions
and the norms have been established," he said. "Our task, in the
coming century, must be to work harder for their universal
acceptance and compliance by all states."
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, gross violations of civil, political, economic, social
and cultural rights are still far too prevalent in the world," he
said. "Let us join hands in a global demonstration of our
rededication and solidarity to root out these violations of human
rights, once and for all."
</P>
<P>
"Let us combat racial, gender and generational discrimination
with all the means at our disposal," he said. "We must also ensure
that every society give priority to advancing respect for the
Rights of the Child."
</P>
<P>
"During the century that is coming to a close, we have together
fought a great fight for human dignity, equality and rights," he
said. "We have made remarkable progress in spreading a universal
culture of human rights across the globe."
</P>
<P>
"The twentieth century ends with the near-universal vindication
of the principle of self-determination, achievement of
decolonization, codification and adoption of the rules of
international law and of human rights conventions that are
applicable to all human beings everywhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our century ends with the world's total commitment to the rule
of law, principles of equality, economic and people's rights,
children's rights, women's rights, rights of the physically
challenged and rights attached to environmental protection," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, the General Assembly decided to designate December 10
every year as "the Human Rights Day" to mark the adoption of "the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights" on December 10 in 1948.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Appoints Two Head National Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Georgian soccer federation
named two head coaches for the national team on Friday after they
failed to make a decision between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Georgian soccer chief Mirab Zhordania told reporters that David
Kipiani and Revaz Dzodzuashvili will take over Dutchman Johan
Boskamp to share the head coaching duties.
</P>
<P>
Before the new conference the federation met for three hours
but was unable to decide between the two.
</P>
<P>
Boskamp, who was under fire for Georgia's disappointing Euro
campaign, was dismissed following Georgia's final European
qualifier against Albania on October 9.
</P>
<P>
Kipiani, 48, who coached Georgia during the 1998 World Cup
qualifiers, will also stay in his job as coach of first division
side Torpedo Kutaisi.
</P>
<P>
Dzodzuashvili, 54, who guided the Latvian national side during
the qualifiers for Euro 2000, came back last month after a brief
stint with Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad.
</P>
<P>
The two men once formed a partnership in 1997 when
Dzodzuashvili was Kipiani's assistant. But both quit in the wake
of the failure to qualify for the World Cup finals.

MOSCOW, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Second Secretary of the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow Cheri Leberknight, accused by the Russian
Federal Security Service (FSB) of espionage, left Russia Friday,
announced the FSB Public Relations Center.
</P>
<P>
Leberknight boarded Flight No. 493 bound from Moscow to Zurich
at 7:20 a.m. Moscow timet, the center said.
</P>
<P>
Russian counter-intelligence servicemen arrested Leberknight in
the process of carrying out an "espionage assignment" on November
29.
</P>
<P>
In response to Russia's action, Wednesday the U.S. FBI detained
in Washington Second Secretary of the Russian Embassy Stanislav
Gusev, who was charged with attempting to plant a bugging device
in the U.S. State Department building. He was declared a persona
non grata and bound to leave the country in 10 days.
</P>

Moscow Thursday regretted the detention of Gusev and described
as "improbable" the U.S. charges that the Russian diplomat
attempted to plant a listening device in the U.S. State Department
building.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service said Friday
that Moscow evidently does not intend to follow Washington's
example and expel American diplomats in a counter-move.
</P>
<P>
Russian government sources said a game of "tit for tat is not
our principle. In general it is a principle dating back to the
Cold War."
</P>
<P>
They said that Russia detains and expels foreign nationals only
if there is weighty proof of their unlawful operations.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Welcomes EU Decision on Its Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel on Friday called a decision by the European Union (EU) to
accept Turkey as a candidate for membership as a "positive"
development, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Presidential Palace, Demirel said
"I do not have any information about the form of the candidacy,
because the information given to me since this morning has changed
continuously."
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to make an evaluation before the final
situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen at
the EU Helsinki summit officially announced that EU members have
reached a consensus on offering Turkey the candidacy for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Lipponen said the EU had also decided to
start full membership negotiations with Romania, Bulgaria,
Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia and Malta.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been applying for full membership in the 15-nation
union since 1987. The EU leaders held that Turkey has a long way
to go in improving its human rights record, resolving its disputes
with neighboring Greece as well as settling the Kurdish
issue.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated and infuriated time and again by the EU's
rejections, Turkey cut off political dialog with the organization
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Most Investors Optimistic about Turkish Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Most investors are positive to
see a better economic prospect in Turkey in the months ahead,
according to an opinion poll conducted by the Istanbul-based
Foreign Capital Association.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 71 percent of investors envisage stronger
Turkish economic stability in the future, compared with only 15
percent two months ago, according to local press reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of investors said that they expect better
financial conditions in Turkey in the next six months while 75
percent are confident to see an improved macroeconomic picture
for investment in the same period ahead.
</P>
<P>
The poll forecast, however, that Turkey's gross national
product (GNP) will shrink 1.79 percent this year but will grow
3.58 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Turkish State Institute of Statistics
revealed that Turkey's GNP shrank by 6.1 percent in the first
nine months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The institute did not give details on the causes of decline,
but it is widely believed that earthquakes contributed a great
deal to the plunge.

<P>
DHAKA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government was
praised Friday by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) for having fulfilled its commitment in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
FAO Director General Dr. Jacques Diouf said the Bangladeshi
government was "true to its commitment in increasing agricultural
production in all best possible ways to feed its own people."
</P>
<P>
"We have been observing since 1996 the vigorous efforts of this
government in many ways including empowerment of rural women,
modern cultivation, better delivery system of agri-inputs,
efficient management in production and distribution of food," he
said, adding that all these together helped Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina earn the prestigious "Ceres Medal" of FAO.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, he also praised the sincere
efforts of Hasina's government to build up capacity at the rural
level for better yield in agriculture as well as a sound food
security system throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Diouf arrived here Thursday to hand over the "Ceres Medal" to
Hasina in recognition of her government's success in agricultural
sector.
</P>
<P>
Diouf left here Friday at the end of his two-day official visit
to Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- About 130,000 Palestinians
coming from East Jerusalem and Palestinian self-rule territories
prayed at the Aqsa Mosque Friday, the first Friday of the Muslim
holy fasting month of Ramadan, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The prayer ended with no incident and Palestinians with entry
permits to Israel were all allowed to travel to the mosque with
help from the Israeli side, the police added.
</P>
<P>
From early morning, Israeli police and transportation
authorities mobilized hundreds of buses to take the Palestinians
from checkpoints to the mosque and everything went on smoothly,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 1,000 Israeli police, border police and other
security forces have been mobilized to beef up security in East
Jerusalem, nearby Arab villages, the Old City and the Temple Mount
to prevent any possible incident from happening, the police
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the most thorniest issues to
be settled during the final-status talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Israeli-Arab war and declared the whole Jerusalem as its "unified
and eternal capital."
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the Israeli claim, the Palestinians want East
Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Auctions Elephant Hides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Department of National
Parks and Wildlife Management of Zimbabwe Friday earned 23 million
Zimbabwean dollars (600,000 U.S. dollars) from the sale of 28 tons
of elephant hides at an auction organized by Ferreira's
Auctioneers in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The auction was held to raise funds for department development
in terms of expansion of services and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Director of the department Willas Makombe said this year's
sales have surpassed 1998 earnings due to a large attendance by
both local and foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
This year's auction saw buyers from South Korea and Japan, two
of the most lucrative elephant hide markets.
</P>
<P>
Elephant hide can be used for manufacture of high quality
leather products.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Rise in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The department reported that the gain in its Producer Price
Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the
consumer, followed a 0.1 percent decline in October.
</P>
<P>
The report said that excluding the volatile energy and food
categories, the "core rate of inflation at the wholesale level was
flat in November, following a moderate 0.3 percent increase in
October.
</P>
<P>
The increase in wholesale prices, if matched at the consumer
level, should ease concerns about a potential outbreak of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been increasing at an
annual rate of 2.9 percent, compared with no change for all of
1998. The advance in this year's wholesale prices has been coming
from big rises in energy costs, which had been declining for much
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs jumped a sizable 1.4 percent in November, the
biggest increase since a 2.2 percent spike in September. That
followed a 1 percent decline in October.
</P>
<P>
The rising price of crude oil reflects a decision by oil-
producing nations to limit production as well as increased demand
from recovering economies in Asia and for winter heating fuel.
</P>
<P>
In November, heating-oil prices rose by a whopping 7.5 percent,
the largest gain since a 15.2 percent increase in July, and
residential natural gas increased by 2.7 percent, the biggest jump
in two years.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices rose only 0.1 percent in November, while
residential electric power increased by 0.7 percent, the report
said. Meanwhile, food costs picked up a scant 0.1 percent as
rising prices for eggs and processed turkeys and chickens offset
falling prices for beef, fish and fruits. In October, food prices
fell by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other factors also contributed to keeping overall wholesale
prices tame. The price of light trucks fell by 1.1 percent in
November, the biggest drop since June 1998, and cars prices rose
just 0.2 percent after two straight months of sharp increases.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Repeats 1995 Apology Over Deeds During World War Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government Friday
reiterated its 1995 apology over wrong doings during World War II,
but refused to offer any compensation to Jewish refugees who were
turned back at the Swiss border at that time.
</P>
<P>
"There is no compensation for the wrongs committed at the time.
All we can do is bow our heads to those who suffered indescribable
pain and were exposed to deportation and possibly death after they
were turned back at the Swiss border," the Swiss government said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a latest report on Switzerland's role during World
War II, the Swiss government thanked those historians, researchers
and experts who had compiled the Bergier report, which it
described as an important contribution towards a better
understanding of Switzerland's refugee policy during the Nazi rule
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government emphasized that a majority of Swiss
rejected Nazi Germany's racist ideologies and that Switzerland,
despite finding itself in a difficult situation, managed to remain
a haven of freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
It claimed the fact that so many refugees knocked on
Switzerland's borders during the war years was because the
international community failed in to implement a humanitarian
asylum policy, a fact which allowed the Nazis to move ahead with
their persecution of Jews.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government made its first-ever apology over its
refugee policy during World War II in 1995, when the cabinet
admitted that Switzerland fell short of its moral obligations to
take in more refugees at the time.

promote human rights, humanitarian assistance, development and
peace.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Lift Fish Ban Against E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The fishery ministers of
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda said here Friday that the fish export
ban to the European market should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reconfirmed to the European Union and the
European Community that fish from Lake Victoria is safe for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Researchers collected and tested samples from the lake to
verify the presence of pesticides and heavy metals, but they find
neither, the three ministers said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"Presently, the fish from Lake Victoria is being exported and
consumed in Japan, the United States, Australia and Middle East
without any complaint," they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the nine-month EU ban continues to have severe
socio- economic consequences in terms of jobs, income for the poor
riparian communities surrounding the lake and influence on the
economies of the three east African countries.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, EU suspended imports of fresh fish fillets
produced from Lake Victoria following reports that fishermen of
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have used cotton pesticides to poison
fish.
</P>
<P>
The three countries incurred great loss in foreign exchange
earnings following the trade embargo.

<TEXT>

BUENOS AIRES, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Fernando de la Rua was
sworn in Friday before the Legislative Assembly as the new
Argentine president, substituting for Carlos Menem, who ended his
second consecutive mandate.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua's assumption was the third consecutive change of a
constitutional government since the democratic restoration in 1983.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua will serve the fourth presidential period after Raul
Alfonsin and Menem.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Alberto Alvarez, De la Rua's formula mate, swore as
Argentine vice president.
</P>
<P>
De La Rua and Alvarez, of an alliance formed by the Radical
Civic Union and FREPASO, defeated in the general elections of
October 24 their rivals of the Justicialista (Peronist) Party.
</P>
<P>
President Fernando de la Rua said Friday that his government
will continue in the sacred mission of defending the Malvinas
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua underscored in his first message as president,
delivered before the legislative assembly, the values of the Latin
American integration, referring to the importance of the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur) as a regional strategic project.
</P>
<P>
He declared himself in favor of a regional defense system to
face the common challenges, and promised that the country will
redouble its permanent vigilance for peace.
</P>
<P>
He advocated for resolving the conflict between Latin Americans
through dialogue.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Anyone in Cyprus convicted of
engaging in the so-called marriage of convenience may face five
years in jail or a fine of 2,000 Cyprus pounds (4,000 U.S.
dollars), or both, local media reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A draft bill to this effect has been approved by Cypriot
cabinet and put before the parliament on Thursday for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The bill, if approved, will be an amendment to the Aliens Law
now in force.
</P>
<P>
The bill refers a marriage of convenience as "one contracted by
a Cypriot citizen or a foreign legal resident of Cyprus, with a
foreigner for the exclusive purpose of permitting the stay in
Cyprus of the foreigner."
</P>
<P>
The bill defines the condition Immigration Department officers
can use to prove a marriage as one of convenience and bar the
entry to a foreigner on such grounds or to cancel a residence
permit.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago Cypriot police started an investigation into
marriages of convenience, in which Cypriots marry foreigners in
order to get residence permits for them.

<HEADLINE> 5 People Killed in 2 Plane Crashes in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 10 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed in two separate aircraft crashes in South Africa's
Mpumalanga Province Friday, bringing to three the number of air
crashes in less than a week, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the first accident at 4:30 p.m. Friday, a Cessna-172 crashed
with four people on board. All the occupants were killed.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed in a mountainous area due to the rainy and
misty conditions, South African police spokeswoman Olga Marais was
quoted as saying. However, the plane did not burst into flames
when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
The second crash, involving a helicopter, happened in Verena at
about 5: 00 p.m. Police spokesman Malcolm Mokomene said police
could only identify one body in the helicopter, which suffered
severe fire damage in the crash.
</P>
<P>
A local resident said four people were in the helicopter when
her husband came across the crash site. It was he who phoned the
local police.
</P>
<P>
The two crashes Friday came after Monday's crash in Germiston
which killed 10 people in one of the worst civil aviation
accidents in almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
South African Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Trevor
Abrahams said three accidents in one week had not occurred in
South Africa since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"This is a black week for South Africa aviation," he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 people have died this month in six airplane
accidents, by far the highest number of fatalities for any month.

LIMA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori canceled at the last moment the attendance of Argentine
presidential assumption on Friday due to internal affairs in his
country.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian press attributed President Fujimori's absence from the
assumption of Argentine President Fernando de la Rua to the
presence of political rivals in the ceremony and to matters
related to the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori canceled at the last moment his trip to Buenos Aires
to avoid meeting with Peruvian presidential candidates Luis
Castaneda and Alberto Andrade, and with legislators who criticize
his government, said the "Republic" daily.
</P>
<P>
The opposition magazine "Caretas" said that the commander of
the armored division, Gen. Luis Cubas Portal, will be promoted to
chief of the 2nd Military Region, with headquarters in Lima.
</P>
<P>
Cubas will contribute to the official strategy for a Fujimori
second consecutive reelection, which is rejected by the opposition,
it added.

<HEADLINE> Way Clear for N.Irish Disarmament, Says Monitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The head of the international
arms decommissioning body in Northern Ireland, General John de
Chastelain, Friday described his first meeting with the Irish
Republican Army last weekend as "frank and useful".
</P>
<P>
The general also confirmed that further talks with the IRA will
take place.
</P>
<P>
In his report on progress on the arms issue, General de
Chastelain said it would be best if a timetable for
decommissioning could be agreed with paramilitary representatives.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Commission would be prepared, if necessary, to
say that decommissioning should start within a specified period.
</P>
<P>
The general's report to Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson and Irish Justice Minister John O'Donaghue was made
public within hours of his meeting on Friday with representatives
acting on behalf of the loyalist paramilitary, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters (UFF).
</P>
<P>
The publication was given a cautious welcome by Ulster Unionist
deputy leader John Taylor who described it as "progress - but
still only a holding statement".
</P>
<P>
Taylor said: "It simply confirms that decommissioning can take
place. There is still no confirmation of what everyone requires:
that decommissioning will take place."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams welcomed the de Chastelain
Report, saying it had put in place "the last element of the
Mitchell Review".
</P>
<P>
The UFF,the loyalist group, appointed five representatives
earlier this week to discuss the issue of arms decommissioning
following the IRA's announcement that it had appointed a person to
speak to the commission.
</P>
<P>
They were appointed to liaise with the commission on Wednesday,
in a move which meant that all the main paramilitary groups have
now committed to talks about arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Volunteer Force and IRA have also appointed
representatives who have already met with the commission.
</P>
<P>
Progress on the decommissioning issue will be crucial to the
survival of the power-sharing executive set up at Stormont last
week.
</P>
<P>
Also On Friday, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern opened the
way for talks with Britain on reducing border security with a
forthright statement that policing of the frontier must change due
to moves towards a lasting peace in the British province.
</P>
<P>
At a summit of European Union leaders in Finland, Ahern said he
had discussed the scaling down of security levels in Northern
Ireland with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
"We have changed the whole situation and the level of security
also has to change," Ahern told reporters in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Adams, the leader of the IRA's political wing, said de
Chastelain's statement put in place the last piece of the review
of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement carried out recently by U.
S. mediator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
De Chastelain had now firmly put the issue of guerrilla arms"
where it always should have been since the Good Friday Agreement",
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a voluntary process which cannot be imposed and which
is clearly the responsibility of the decommissioning commission to
resolve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams said it was up to London, Dublin and Northern Ireland's
political parties to show that politics worked.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of the improving security situation, one of the
British province's main interrogation sites for guerrilla suspects
-- Castlereagh Holding Centre in Belfast -- is to shut by the end
of the month, police announced on Friday.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Stand-By Credit for Latvia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved on Friday a 16-month Stand-By credit of 45
million U.S. dollars for Latvia to support the government's 2000
economic program.
</P>
<P>
The government of Latvia does not intend to make drawings under
the Sand-By credit and will treat it as precautionary, the IMF
said.
</P>
<P>
"Directors welcomed the Latvian authorities' resolve to return
to a path of prudent fiscal policies and to complete a well-
focussed structural reform agenda under the requested stand-by
arrangement," IMF Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This policy stance, coupled with a continued tight monetary
policy, is expected to lay the foundation for durable growth
driven by the private sector and to ensure that Latvia's external
position remains sustainable," Sugisaki said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the impact of the Russian crisis on Latvia's trade
and financial sectors has been more severe than expected earlier,
but it appears that the economy has bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
The country's real gross domestic product is expected to grow
by about 1 percent this year and 4 percent in 2000. Inflation is
expected to remain subdued at about 3 percent during 1999-2000.

LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) - London's stock market ended
higher Friday in a rally underpinned by sharp gains in some big
index stocks.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 Index closed 58.7 points, or 0.88 percent ahead
at 6739.5, as Marks &AMP; Spencer takeover talk sent sparks through

Shares jumped 37.25p to 300p in heavy turnover as investors
ignored a denial from the struggling retailer that it is in talks.
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic trading led to a 19 percent rise in the long
sluggish share price for the largest clothing retailer in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The movement was so dramatic that the company felt compelled to
issue a statement to the London Stock Exchange. Its brief release
said that it knew of no reason for the rise.

In Frankfurt, the electronically traded Xetra Dax lost 20.16

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ECOWAS Trying to Catch Up in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, December 10 (Xinhua) - The 22nd Summit of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ended Friday in Togo's
capital Lome, with a stronger commitment to building up
integration upon stability and peace.
</P>
<P>
Ten heads of state, and six representatives of heads of state
attended the two-day meeting, which, due to its timing, was
called west Africa millenium summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit's discussions are based upon two reports, submitted
by west African countries' finance and foreign ministers as a
result of their meetings which ended only a day before the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The proposed establishment of the mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, management and resolution, which was approved later
by the summit, is a highlight of the two reports.  The
mechanism, first adopted in last year' s Abuja ECOWAS summit,
include a Mediation and Security Council, a multinational
stand-by force, and four Zonal Observation Bureaux.
</P>
<P>
The formal launching of such a mechanism after the summit means
the ECOWAS is gradually shifting from its past role as a "fire
fighter" (peace- keeper) to a more active role of peace-builder.
</P>
<P>
The summit opened at Togo's Congress Palace on Thursday
morning. At its opening ceremony, Gnassingbe Eyadema, Togo's
President and ECOWAS' current Chairman made a speech calling for
the sub-regional body to redouble its efforts to push forward
economic integration and security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Lansana Kouyate, ECOWAS' Executive Secretary,
 also made an important speech on the organization's performance
in the 1998-1999 year.
</P>
<P>
Quite remarkably, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo proposed
for a " two-track policy" within the framework of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Obasanjo noted the huge cultural and economic
diversities the sub-regional body has, and suggested that ECOWAS
should encourage some member states to take the initiative to
start programs first, while others may stay in a "slower track"
and join in later.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo promised that Nigeria will take the lead by
cooperating with its neighbors in programs such as opening
borders, pooling power resources, and launching common currency.
</P>
<P>
Following close door sessions focusing on the reports of the
ministerial meetings and Kouyate's speech, the summit had a
closing session on Friday afternoon, during which a protocol and
a final communique were signed and released by the sub-region's
leaders. Apart from the approval of the establishment of the
mechanism for Conflict Prevention and management, the communique
also made January 1, 2004 as the launching time of the West Africa
single monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
To this end, ECOWAS leaders okayed a set of convergence
criteria, which, at its core, requires ECOWAS members to lower
their inflation rate under a five-percent ceiling and have an
external reserve at least equal to six months of imports, by the
year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The summit also resolved to set up a community court and a
community parliament in the shortest time possible.
</P>
<P>
As Obasanjo said in the summit's opening ceremony, ECOWAS may
not have gotten a pass mark during its past 25 years of journey.
If it is so, the organization's millenium summit did give a clear
signal that it would try to catch up in the coming century.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Starts to Build First Urban Light Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Construction started today on
the first urban light railway in Beijing, a safe, fast and
pollution-free rail expected to help reduce the daily traffic
gnarls in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The 40.5-km-long U-shaped light railway, 30.3 km on the surface,
7.7 km elevated and 2.8 km underground, will ultimately cost about
700 million U.S. dollars. It runs from Xizhimen in the northwest
part of the city to Dongzhimen in the northeast and will be
completed in two phases, with the first phase expected to end by
2001 and the second by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Trains will travel at a speed of 80 km per hour, and allow
residents living in the northern suburbs of Beijing a more
convenient means of travel.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the project will help improve the urban
transportation structure and further relieve the traffic in the
city's northern region.
</P>
<P>
Officials with related departments noted that it will also
boost the development of the Zhongguancun Science Park in
northwest Beijing, known as "China's Silicon Valley."
</P>
<P>
After completion, a transportation network based on light
railway, subway and ring roads will come into being in Beijing,
which has more than 10 million residents.

PYONGYANG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Song Nam, premier of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Saturday
congratulated China on Macao's forthcoming return to China.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua, he said that the return of
Macao, following China's successful resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, will once again prove the correctness
of China's "one country, two systems" policy.

<P>
The DPRK people express warm congratulations to the Chinese
people, he said, adding that "the international community, which
respects independence and territorial integrity, will also welcome
Macao's return to China."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the return of Macao is a historic event for
the Chinese people in their efforts to realize national
reunification.

Hong believed that the Chinese people will surely realize the

<HEADLINE> NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Official Statement Opposing U.S. Support of Taiwan in WHO (2)(recast with correction) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. leaders and administration have repeatedly and openly
stated their adherence to the "One-China" policy, and even after
Lee Teng-hui started to advocate his "Two-States" theory in an
attempt to split the motherland, they again clearly promised not
to support "Taiwan independence", not to support "Two-Chinas" or "
One China, One Taiwan", and not to support Taiwan to enter into
any international organization that only sovereign countries can
join, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government so quickly went back on its words
and, regardless of the universally-recognized international law
and basic norms governing international relations, openly came out
to support Taiwan in "participating" in the WHO that only
sovereign countries can enter, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.S. act "tries to bolster the Taiwan
authorities in their attempt to create 'Two-Chinas' or 'One China,
One Taiwan', and to lay obstacles for China's reunification cause.
"
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is the most essential and most sensitive at
the core of Sino-U.S. relations, he stated, adding that the
governments and leaders of the two countries have a consensus
understanding of this and that it is an issue concerning China's
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, from which the
Chinese people will never retreat.
</P>
<P>
But there are always some people in the United States who hold
tight to the cold war mentality and continue to regard Taiwan as
their "unsinkable aircraft carrier", he said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Official Statement Opposing U.S. Support of Taiwan in WHO (3)(recast with correction) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever Sino-U.S. relations show a fine development trend,
they will come out to create various pretexts and try to interfere
in China's internal affairs, infringe upon China's sovereignty and
disrupt China's peaceful reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. move to support Taiwan's participation in the WHO
serves as the latest example, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official continued that such acts harm not only the
development of Sino-U.S. relations but also the fundamental
interests of the United States. Going against the historical trend
and aimed at splitting China's sovereignty, these moves can not
hold water legally and practically and have of course met with
simultaneous condemnation from the entire Chinese people. They are
doomed to failure," he added.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the U.S. government adhere to the three Sino-U.
S. joint communiques and its relevant promises on the issue of
Taiwan, and proceeding from the overall interest of Sino-U.S.
relations as well as the maintenance of peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, stop its wrong act,
stop doing anything that helps the Taiwan authorities to split the
motherland and do not support in any form Taiwan's participation
in international organizations that only sovereign countries can
join.

<HEADLINE> China's Publicly-Listed Firms Hit 977 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- China's publicly-listed firms
totaled 977 by the end of October, according to the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) which oversees the
securities and futures market in China.
</P>
<P>
By the same time under review, these companies, including 45
listed in Hong Kong, had raised 425.6 billion yuan (about 51
billion U.S. dollars) from the securities market, a CSRC official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of investors with accounts in the Shanghai and
Shenzhen stock exchanges reached 44.11 million, including 190,000
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The government has collected 96 billion yuan (11 billion U.S.
dollars) in stamp taxes since securities market came into
existence in China in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The official said the CSRC would continue to allow more state-
owned enterprises to be publicly-listed and is working to improve
regulations concerning initial public offering (IPO), including
adding more non-CSRC experts to the IPO approval committee.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC is also considering allowing B share and H share
companies to buy back part of their stocks when the time is right,
he said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the development of high-tech enterprises, the CSRC
is planning a high-tech market within the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges and would relax the conditions of IPO for high-
tech firms.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Court to Rule on Namibia, Botswana Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Court of
Justice is expected to make a ruling next week on a disputed tiny
river island on the Chobe river between Namibia and Botswana, a
Botswana minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana Education Minister Ponatshego Kedikilwe told the
Zimbabwe News Agency on Friday in Gaborone that he was hopeful
that the United Nations' highest judicial body would make a ruling
on this controversial issue in next week.
</P>
<P>
Both Namibia and Botswana claim territorial rights to the
island, known in Namibia as Kasikili and Botswana as Sedudu, in a
dispute that has dragged on for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the Chobe river which flows into the Zambezi river
above Victoria Falls, the island measures about 3.5 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The border between Botswana and Namibia was first laid out in
an Anglo- German treaty signed in 1890 when the two nations held
opposite sides of the Chobe as colonies.
</P>
<P>
The original treaty called for the river to be divided along
the main channel, but the changing river levels have complicated
the sovereignty question.
</P>
<P>
The Kasikili dispute is listed as the ninth most contentious
case at the world court awaiting a ruling.

<HEADLINE> November Sees Hefty Rise in Visitor Arrivals in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the official opening of the Singapore Visitors
Center @Suntec City, Singapore Minister of State for Trade &AMP;
Industry and Communications &AMP; Information Technology Lim Swee Say
said the preliminary figures given by STB testify to the growth in
the tourism industry thanks to Asian economies' recovery from the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said this means the accumulative visitor arrivals grew by 12
percent for the first 11 months of the year and the tourism
industry looks set for a rosy year ahead.
</P>
<P>
Lim expressed the hope that this encouraging trend will spur
more companies to come up with innovative ideas and projects to
turn this increase in arrivals into increased revenue for their
business.
</P>
<P>
In this vein, Lim said, the STB invites potential partners to
work with it to set up visitors centers in Singapore with a view
of reinforcing established information dissemination points like
hotel concierges and providing an island-wide integrated visitor
information system -- one that will meet the needs of all
travelers, both new breed and conventional, and ensure that their
stay in Singapore will be so easy to enjoy and hard to forget.
</P>
<P>
Lim also said that the Visitor Center @ Suntec City is the
first of its kind in the region -- a "one-stop" which provides
tourist information as well as a whole range of travel-related
services.
</P>
<P>
More such centers will be set up in the near future in
Singapore, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to STB, tourists can enjoy personalized services at
these centers from specially-trained staff, who will offer
information on Singapore.

<P>
LANZHOU, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of students and some
officials and armed police from Lanzhou City of Gansu Province,
northwest China, attended an activity here today aimed to better
protect the environment of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Participants wrote their names on a banner for soliciting the
signatures of a million people which has been used in publicity
campaigns held in Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. The
signing campaign is jointly organized by the Environment and
Resources Committee of the National People's Congress, the State
Council's Development Research Center and several other government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou, capital of Gansu, is the only city which the Yellow
River runs through. As a result of industrial and agricultural
development and other human activities, the city is now facing a
shortage of water resources and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Activities of the same kind will also be held in Taiyuan,
Yinchuan and Xining cities, and the banner with one million people
's names will be collected by the Museum of Chinese History.

<HEADLINE> HK Develops 3rd Generation Mobile Phone Service (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's mobile phone
service providers are now staging an intensive campaign to develop
the third-generation wireless Internet services, which are
expected to be essential to their revenue increase next year.
</P>
<P>
Four major cellular operators, Cable and Wireless HKT,
Hutchison Telecom, SmarTone and New World Mobility (NWM), have all
launched the mobile Internet services this week, with the arrival
of the first Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) handset in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
WAP is an open global standard for communication between a
mobile handset and the Internet or other computer application.
The Nokia 7110 WAP handset, which became available in Hong Kong
recently, enables users to get advanced, interactive and real-time
mobile services, such as mobile banking or Internet-based news
services.
</P>
<P>
The "World Wide Mobility" (WWM) Internet service, launched by
NWM, provides bilingual information such as news, weather, traffic
and financial information via the WAP handset.
</P>
<P>
"WWM is just our first step to move into the mobile Internet
and e-commerce arena. We will continue to provide more new value-
added services by using the latest technology, bringing Hong Kong'
s mobile communications into a new height of achievement," said
Albert Wong, chief executive of New World Telephone Group.
</P>
<P>
NWM, whose mobile services are provided by New World Telephone
Group, has just marked a milestone of 500,000 mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
It has also signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Yahoo!
Hong Kong to provide the latest and most dynamic global
information to mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo!'s information services are targeted to be available in
first quarter of 2000 while a wide array of WAP services such as
transportation hotline, movie and restaurant guides, WAP e-mail,
mobile banking as well as shopping and ticketing will be launched.
</P>
<P>
Mobile operators have taken up preferences of free monthly fee
and free airtime to promote the Nokia WAP handset which is sold
here at 3,680 HK dollars (472 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, leading telecommunication operator in
Hong Kong, on its part, launched the i.Menu mobile Internet
service by using WAP technology and believes the service will be
welcome in the market.
</P>
<P>
The company pledged to invest one billion HK dollars to upgrade
the communication network and offer more new services to meet the
demands of business and daily life of customers.

<HEADLINE> HK Develops 3rd Generation Mobile Phone Service (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To explore the next generation wireless Internet service,
Hutchison Telecom, the largest cellular operator in Hong Kong,
recently announced a cooperation package with Japan's NTT DoCoMo.
</P>
<P>
As the world's biggest mobile phone company, NTT DoCoMo was the
first network operator to introduce broadband wireless Internet
access into commercial use.
</P>
<P>
The i-mode service, developed by NTT DoCoMo, allows users to
access data and images via a mobile phone at fast speeds. The
service enables the mobile use of such applications as telephone
banking, airline reservations, stock transactions, e-mail and
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison's Managing Director Canning Fok Kin-ning said that
the deal made sense in light of the expected transition from voice-
dominated to data-dominated mobile telephone traffic in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong cellular penetration is already over 50 percent, so
where can it go except toward wireless data and multimedia
services," said Fok.
</P>
<P>
NTT DoCoMo's managing director of global business Kiyoyuki
Tsujimura said it would take about one year for NTT DoCoMo to
bring its Java-based i-mode system to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison Telecom, which operates two mobile networks in Hong
Kong, has about 1.3 million subscribers, 33 percent of the Hong
Kong SAR cellular market. Hutchison predicts that 50 percent of
its subscribers would use the i-mode service, which would fuel the
increase of consumption of subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Joining hands to unveil a new chapter in Hong Kong's mobile
communication industry, NWM has also completed the installation of
the Nokia General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) solution.
</P>
<P>
As a major stepping stone towards the third-generation mobile
communications technology, GPRS boosts data speed to over 100kbits
per second and enables mobile phone users to be permanently
connected to the network.
</P>
<P>
Mike Mulvey, Managing Director of Nokia Networks, Nokia (HK)
Ltd, said: "GPRS is a key building block in the smooth evolution
to our vision of Mobile Information Society where users have
access to information anytime, anywhere."
</P>
<P>
Swedish telecoms group Ericsson announced that it will
establish Asia's first mobile data applications test centers in
Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The centers would enable the trial of General Packet Radio
Service (GPRS) applications, and fuel the move towards third-
generation (3G) wireless multimedia services.
</P>
<P>
With the availability of GPRS application and the WAP handset,
analysts predict that the Internet service via handset will take a
leap in the coming years and the number of those who enjoy mobile
Internet services may even exceed those Internet users with
computer application.

Falun Gong to abide by the laws of Hong Kong in a statement issued
Saturday.

<P>
Tung called attention of the residents of the HKSAR to
observing the laws of the mainland during their visit there.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- With the aim of guaranteeing
strict compliance with the rules laid down by the IOC Code of
Ethics, the IOC Ethics Commission, during a meeting held Friday in
Lausanne, adopted the Implementing Provisions of the Code of
Ethics.
</P>
<P>
This text makes provision in particular for the appointment, by
the Commission, of a delegate who will be known as a "Special
Representative of the IOC Ethics Commission" and will assist the
Commission in its task of preventing and sanctioning breaches of
the IOC Code of Ethics.
</P>
<P>
The special representative will be responsible in particular
for encouraging the Olympic parties, using the appropriate means,
including conferences, seminars, workshops or interviews, to be
scrupulous in their respect of the IOC Code of Ethics. It will
also be responsible for investigating violations of the Code of
Ethics, by conducting inquiries or gathering evidence.
</P>
<P>
The special representative may also assist the Olympic parties,
upon their request, within the framework of ensuring respect of
the IOC Code of Ethics. The special representative will also
report regularly on his activities to the Ethics Commission or to
its chairman.
</P>
<P>
In order to nominate its special representative as quickly as
possible, during the coming weeks the Ethics Commission will
examine the various proposals made to it by its members and by
experts in the field of ethics.
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Commission has continued examining the case of an
IOC member, which had been referred to it by the IOC Executive
Board: it decided, as a provisional measure, to suggest that the
IOC Executive Board ask this member to refrain, in future, from
recommending to the Olympic parties, persons not involved in the
running of their country's NOC or acting outside the
aforementioned functions. The commission is pursuing the study of
this case.
</P>
<P>
The commission has also continued its examination of
allegations regarding events which occurred during the city of
Atlanta's bid to organize the Olympic Games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Commission has set the date for its next meeting for
6th March 2000 in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
The IOC Ethics Commission is an independent, permanent
commission, composed of eight members, five of whom are eminent
personalities from outside the Olympic Movement, and three of whom
are IOC members. The commission is chaired by Judge Keba Mbaye,
and is made up of Messrs Robert Badinter, Howard Baker, Kurt
Furgler, Javier Perez de Cuellar, Kevan Gosper and Chiharu Igaya
and Ms Charmaine Crooks.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges World to Take Notice of Afghan Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday said it
shared the concern expressed by the World Food Program (WFP)
regarding the severe food shortage in Afghanistan and urged the
world community to take notice of the grave situation.
</P>
<P>
"Despite its own dependence on food import, Pakistan will try
to help Afghanistan as much as possible to overcome this crisis,"
a Foreign Office spokesman said here in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said an agreement is under negotiation for regular supply of
wheat to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is imperative that the international community
take notice of this grave situation, which has been exacerbated by
the recent U.N. sanctions, and rush emergency food aid to
Afghanistan on humanitarian considerations."
</P>
<P>
According to the latest estimates, cereal deficit in
Afghanistan in 1999-2000 is estimated to be about 1.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Only a part of this deficit that is 100,000 tons of wheat and
other commodities, will be supplied by WFP this year, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP said Friday in a statement that millions of Afghans
will face food shortage due to increasing wheat prices in the war-
torn country.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Strengthen Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
scheduled to increase the staff of the police force from its
present 135,000 to 200,000 and will try to change the police image
in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Under a new program, 25,000 police would be recruited every
year over the next five years from year 2000, Saturday's Punch
newspaper quoted Police Affairs Minister Maj. Gen. David Jemibewon
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Going hand-in-hand with the recruitment exercise, the minister
told a press briefing Friday in capital Abuja, would be a gradual
weeding-out process of untrainable policemen.
</P>
<P>
He noted that about 10,000 police personnel would be discharged
yearly in five years time and other measures would be taken under
the program to enable the police meet the challenges of rampant
crime in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Jemibewon stressed that emphasis should be put on sophisticated
 equipment for the modern-day police force rather than the numeral
strength.
</P>
<P>
He announced a special "ration cash allowance" including "duty
risk allowance" for the police force, similar to what the
Nigerian army obtained.
</P>
<P>
The minister also disclosed that his ministry was proposing the
change of the designation of "Nigerian Police Force" to "Nigerian
Police Service" to accord with the present democratic
dispensation.
</P>
<P>
The overall objective of the measures, he said, was to create a
well- orchestrated, all-encompassing and national focused police
service.
</P>
<P>
According to him, as soon as the policy measures begin to
materialize, the present "sluggish image" of the police would be
changed.

<HEADLINE> Seven Missing U.S. Marines Presumed Dead After Search Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Seven Marines missing
after their helicopter crashed into the Pacific Ocean Thursday are
now presumed dead, U.S. military rescue officials said late Friday.
</P>
<P>
A rescue operation that went on for more than a day will become
an effort to recover their bodies, military officials said Friday
night. All hope that any of the missing could still be alive was
lost by late Friday, they said.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter left the assault carrier USS Bonhomme Richard
with 18 Marines on board Thursday for a training flight far from
shore. Eleven Marines aboard the CH-46 Sea Knight were rescued
after the craft crashed about 1:16 p.m. local time Thursday, and
three remained hospitalized Friday.
</P>
<P>
Marine, Navy and Coast Guard personnel, some of them equipped
with night vision goggles, infrared sensors and other gear to aid
divers, spent Thursday and Friday searching in an area about 20
miles southwest of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter might go down in 3,600 feet of water, Coast
Guard Lt. Ted Woolridge said, adding the fact that there was no
floating wreckage in the area indicated the helicopter likely sank
deep into the ocean with the Marines on board.

"Our mistake here was that they had provided for safety nets,
but did not implement them," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu was referring to the Ramos administration that signed
an agreement for the country's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 1994. The agreement was ratified by the
senate in January l995.
</P>
<P>
When the senate ratified the agreement, according to Espiritu,
it imposed the condition that the administration should provide
some safety nets to soften the impact of trade liberalization on
the people.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the congressional initiatives to provide safety
nets had never taken off the ground because no funding was made
available by the previous administration.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said safety net measures such as the Anti-Dumping Law
and the Countervailing Duty Act were passed by the congress only
recently although they should have been enacted in l995.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration is now rushing up these safety net
measures through agricultural modernization in the form of more
farm-to-market roads, more irrigation systems and more post-
harvest facilities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Two Political Parties Formed in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Two new political parties
officially announced their existence in Iran on Friday, one day
before the country started to register candidates for the sixth
Majlis (parliament) elections slated on February 18, local daily
Tehran Times reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The political platforms of the two parties, Independence Iran
Party (IIP) and Iran Unity Party (IUP), are not clear so far.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the IIP said the party was formed to
"coordinate efforts to secure suitable economic, social and
cultural conditions for the Iranian people in a way that they will
be able to determine their own fate."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IUP, which is based in the central holy city of
Qom, underlined the importance of the implementation of the
constitution, recognition of national sovereignty, respect of
citizens' rights and defense of human dignity.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Interior Ministry announced a week-long period starting
Saturday for candidates to register for the February parliamentary
polling, which is believed to be key to a new balance of power in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Both the hard-line conservatives, who now dominate the Majlis,
and the reformist moderates have launched their election campaigns
striving to win a majority in the Majlis, whose current 270 seats
will be increased to 290 after the polling.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian political analysts believe that independent
candidates will play an important role in the polling.

<HEADLINE> NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Official Statement Opposing U.S. Support of Taiwan's Participation in WHO (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- An official in charge of China
's National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee issued a
statement here today strongly rejecting U.S. support of Taiwan's
participation in the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton recently signed two
bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate: one
is supportive of Taiwan's participation in the WHO and the other,
the Omnibus Act, contains clauses showing such support, in an
attempt to help Taiwan squeeze into international organizations
where statehood is a prerequisite for joining.
</P>
<P>
He said that the act of the U.S. Congress and Administration "
wantonly violates the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, severely
infringes upon China's sovereignty, brutally interferes in China's
internal affairs, and tramples on the basic norms governing
international relations, and for this we express our utmost
indignation and strong opposition."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan is but a province of China no matter
however Lee Teng-hui tries to blur this. This fact is universally
recognized by the international community including the United
States, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Taiwan, as part of China, is not qualified nor
entitled to participate in any international organization that
only sovereign countries can enter," he said, adding that this is
a most basic principle guiding international relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. congress and government leaders have repeatedly and openly
stated their adherence to the "One-China" policy, and even after
Lee Teng-hui started to advocate his "Two-States" theory, they
again clearly promised not to support "Taiwan independence", not
to support "Two-Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan", and not to
support Taiwan to enter into any international organization that
only sovereign countries can join, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. government so quickly went back on its words
and, regardless of the universally-recognized international law
and basic norms governing international relations, openly came out
to support Taiwan in "participating" in the WHO that only
sovereign countries can enter, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.S. act "tries to bolster the Taiwan
authorities in their attempt to create 'Two-Chinas' or 'One China,
One Taiwan', and to lay obstacles for China's reunification cause.
"
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is the most essential and most sensitive at
the core of Sino-U.S. relations, he stated, adding that the
governments and leaders of the two countries have a consensus
understanding of this and that it's an issue from which the
Chinese people will never retreat.
</P>
<P>
But there are always some people in the United States who hold
tight to the cold war mentality and continue to regard Taiwan as
their "unsinkable aircraft carrier", he said.

<P>
Whenever Sino-U.S. relations show a fine development trend,
they will come out to create various pretexts and try to interfere
in China's internal affairs, infringe upon China's sovereignty and
disrupt China's peaceful reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. move to support Taiwan's participation in the WHO
serves as the latest example, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official continued that such acts harm not only the
development of Sino-U.S. relations but also the fundamental
interests of the United States. Going against the historical trend
and aimed at splitting China's sovereignty, these moves can not
hold water legally and practically and will of course meet with
simultaneous condemnation from the entire Chinese people," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the U.S. government adhere to the three Sino-U.
S. joint communiques and its relevant promises on the issue of
Taiwan, and proceeding from the overall interest of Sino-U.S.
relations as well as the maintenance of peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, stop its wrong act,
stop doing nothings that help the Taiwan authorities to split the
mother,and do not support in any form Taiwan's participation in
international organizations that only sovereign countries can join.

NAIROBI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
introduce HIV/AIDS education in schools from January next year to
help fight against irresponsible sex behaviour.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti made the announcement in a
 statement Friday, saying this is an issue that Kenyans must deal
with squarely.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti said over 860,000 school children would be orphaned by
the epidemic by next year, adding this would disrupt their
education as many would drop out of school due to lack of fees.
</P>
<P>
Over 760,000 Kenyans have died of the disease since the first
AIDS case found in the country in 1984. At present, some 500
people are dying daily from the pandemic.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Established in accordance with
relevant terms of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the
Macao Question on January 15, 1988, the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) is a body through which the governments of
China and Portugal consult on the transfer and transition of Macao
and other relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
Through the JLG, the Chinese and Portuguese sides consult on
the implementation of the Joint Declaration and its annexes,
exchange information, and consult on, issues relating to the
transfer of Macao in 1999, consult on actions that need to be
taken to maintain and develop economic and cultural relations
between the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the rest
of the world, and exchange information, and consult, on other
issues that the two sides have agreed on.
</P>
<P>
Over nearly 12 years since it was established, the JLG has held
37 sessions and 56 rounds of meetings between the chief
representatives of the two sides. It has also held numerous group
meetings and expert meetings.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 years, the governments of China and Portugal
have paid great attention to the work of the JLG. The two sides of
the JLG held discussions and consultations in a friendly and
cooperative atmosphere, resolved many major problems and reached
consensus on many other issues for the smooth transition and
transfer of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Macao's transitional period has seen a basic solution of three
major issues -- localization of the civil service, localization of
laws and the status of Chinese an official language. This is owed
partly to the work of the JLG.
</P>
<P>
The JLG has reached consensus and signed minutes on relevant
talks on Macao's accession to 46 international organizations and
the application of 141 international treaties in Macao at present
and after 1999.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have reached consensus on the construction of the
Macao International Airport and guiding principles for civil
aviation in Macao, examining and approving aviation agreements
that Macao has reached with 34 countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also reached consensus on such issues as
the issue of banknotes by two local commercial banks, the
extension of 26 monopoly contracts over 1999, passport and
traveler identification of the Macao SAR, establishment of the
office of commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China
in the MSAR, and establishment of Portuguese consulate general in
the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The JLG will conclude its work on January 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Refutes Rumors On Fuel Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
refuted rumors of a fuel shortage, saying the country has enough
fuel reserves.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport and Energy Enos Chikowore said in a
statement Saturday that it had been brought to his attention that
there could be panic buying of fuel by some motorists following
the unfounded rumors.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to quash the rumors and assure the nation that we
currently have adequate fuel reserves in the country and that more
fuel is coming into the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged people not to panic as this could create artificial
shortages of fuel, which would have serious repercussions.
</P>
<P>
The minister also encouraged people to save fuel because the
country was facing some serious foreign currency shortages, as it
imports all its fuel requirements.
</P>
<P>
Rumor had been rife in Harare this week that an acute shortage
of fuel was looming, resulting in some motorists panic buying.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Minitype Economy Expects Big Stride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- As one of the world's
outstanding minitype economies, Macao, despite some difficulties,
still enjoys bright prospects for economic development owing to
its return to China on December 20, local business people said.
</P>
<P>
Seng San Enterprises Ltd., Macao's largest textiles exporter,
has recently tripled its workshops, getting ready for further
development.
</P>
<P>
"No. 1 in Macao is far from enough, and we should turn to the
world market. We need to transform our labor-intensive enterprises
into capital and technology-intensive ones in a bid to participate
in international competition," said Seng San's president Lionel
Vai Tac Leong.
</P>
<P>
Macao's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) topped 17,000 U.
S. dollars in 1996, ranking 21st among the 159 countries and
regions in a World Bank survey, placing Macao among the group of
high income economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Its comprehensive strength and economic scale, however, are
still weak and small. And moreover, its carrying capacity for
population is limited, making it difficult to rapidly promote
economy in a short period of time through increasing population.
</P>
<P>
"The key to escaping from current economic difficulties lies in
cultivating a healthy environment and driving force for new
economic growth, in addition to improving public order,
administrative efficiency, and the legal system," said Ieong Wan
Chong, a professor of economics at University of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Macao, as a minitype economy, is easier to adapt to market
fluctuations. So, it should learn to fight as a guerrilla and
timely restructure its economy, because Macao cannot be leading in
a certain sector all the time by relying entirely on its own,
Ieong said.
</P>
<P>
Another way out for Macao, which is short of resources, is to
strengthen regional cooperation, especially with the inland areas,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries, business people said.
</P>
<P>
Macao has wide-ranging economic and trade contacts with the
outside world, and is economically heavily dependent upon the
neighboring countries and regions, which have begun to recover
from the Asian financial crisis, a guarantee for Macao to obtain
new and more development space, Prof. Ieong said.
</P>
<P>
Macao witnessed its prime time for economic growth from the
1970s to the 1990s, reporting double-digit increases. Beginning in
1993, however, Macao's economy gradually slowed down, and even
registered negative increases in the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Urges for Education Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has challenged investors to consider investing in higher
education in Kenya, the state-run Kenya Times newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the United Nations International University in
Nairobi Friday, Moi said out of some 30,000 students who qualify
for university education in the country each year, less than 30
percent get admission to public universities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that another five percent of those get admission in
private universities while the rest seek university education
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Presently, there are about 20,000 students studying abroad
whose expenditure is estimated to be 16 billion shillings (214
million U.S. dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
The president urged private university to take advantage of the
quest for university education in Kenya by expanding their
facilities in order to enroll more students.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that his government is in the process of
revising the University Act of 1985 and the university rule of
1989 with a view of creating a more conducive environment for
private sector involvement in higher education.
</P>
<P>
Moi said the academic programs offered by the country's
institutions of higher learning should be market driven and
called on private universities to diversify their programs to
include basic and applied sciences.

<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that the power failure, which triggered
a blackout throughout Luzon, the northern Philippines, Friday
night was caused by a "technical malfunction."
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio-TV program, Estrada said he received a
report from the Department of Energy and the National Power Corp.
(NPC)on the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to assure the president that the incident is
purely technical in nature and is not in any way due to any
political move to destabilize the government," Estrada quoted
Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui and NPC President Federico Puno as
saying in the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, he said, there was simultaneous power
trip-off at the Sual plant in Pangasinan and the Mauban plant in
Quezon.
</P>
<P>
The blackout, which started around 20:15 (12:15 GMT), spawned a
massive traffic jam in Metro Manila, stranding thousands of
commuters.
</P>
<P>
The power was fully restored in the entire Luzon at dawn
Saturday.

<P>
SEOUL, December 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung Saturday hail Macao's forthcoming return to China, saying
Macao's return will end Western colonial rule in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the issues of Hong Kong and Macao in the form
of "One Country, Two Systems" fully demonstrates the outstanding
ability and wisdom of the Chinese people, said Kim when he met
visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan at his presidential
palace of Blue House Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kim reiterated his government will stick to its one China
policy, which said the People's Republic of China is the sole
legal government of China and Taiwan is an inseparable province of
China.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Taiwan issue could be solved satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
The president also praised China for its assistance to South
Korea and other nations and not depreciating its currency during
the financial crisis sweeping Southeast Asian countries in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
On the South Korean-Chinese ties, Kim spoke highly of the
friendly cooperation between South Korea and China, and said he is
looking forward to more positive exchanges and cooperation with
China in the new Asia-Pacific era of the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Growth Rate Slow to 1.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic growth slowed
to 1.4 percent in the year to September compared with 1.8 percent
in the same period in 1998, according to the Central Bank of
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In its December economic review made public Friday, the bank
said the slowdown in economic growth continues to arise from
several structural factors that discourage investment by
increasing the costs of production and the distribution of goods
and services, which in turn make domestic production less
competitive.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy which had grew by 2.3 percent during the
same period of 1997 has seen its competitiveness hit by
infrastructure problems, particularly roads damaged by El Nino
rains last year, an inefficient public service and general
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
The central bank noted that recent measures taken by the
government, including streamlining the civil service to cut costs
and repairing roads, would help the economy recover.

ABU DHABI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Air officials have
defended the airline's readiness for the new millennium after it
was named as one of two carriers which could be banned from flying
to Britain during the New Year period.
</P>
<P>
"Gulf Air would like to confirm that its aircraft and systems
are completely Y2K compliant," said a spokesman for the
Bahrain-based airline, quoted by the Gulf News daily on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He was refuting a suggestion by a British official on Thursday
that Gulf Air, along with Southern Aviation of Zambia, could be
affected during the millennium change over.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines could be banned from flying to Britain during
the New Year period unless they could confirm that they are fully
Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem, or the "millennium bug," is a programming
error which is expected to cause chaos in computer systems that
will mistake the "00" date change for the year 1900 instead of
2000.
</P>
<P>
"Gulf Air's fleet of 32 aircraft is among the youngest and most
technically advanced fleets in the world," the spokesman argued.
</P>
<P>
The airline, flying to more than 50 destinations, are operated
jointly by Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is ready to host
Israeli-Syrian peace talks after their ceremonial resumption in
Washington next week, officials here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is ready to support Syrian-Israeli negotiations and
provide a venue for the talks if the two sides opt for that, said
a Jordanian official who demanded anonymity.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Israel and
Syria had agreed to resume their peace talks in Washington next
week from the point where they were suspended in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to touch upon thorny issues like the
Golan Heights, a strategic plateau which Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Israel said the negotiations would move to Amman
after their symbolic launch in Washington next week by Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
Al-Sharaa on behalf of Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Amman said they expected the talks to
shift to the Middle East at the end of December or by early next
January, though they are not sure whether the talks would be moved
to Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has welcomed the resumption of
Israeli-Syrian peace talks and pledged to provide all possible
assistance to a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 as the
second Arab country after Egypt to strike peace with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
For years Jordan has been a pivotal player in the Middle East
peace process by trying to bridge the differences between Israel
and its Arab neighbors, including Syria, Lebanon and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> First Macao SAR Stamps to Go on Sale Ahead of Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The first set of stamps to be
issued by the postal authority of Macao to mark the founding of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) are to be sold to
the public a few days ahead of the original scheduled date,
December 20, when Macao returns to China.
</P>
<P>
The move is to cater to the demands of the avid stamp
collectors around the world and reduce the pressure on the postal
offices, according to Lau Wai Meng, an official with the Macao
Posts and Telecommunications Services.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.5 million sets of the stamps will be issued and
each set has six pieces each depicting a major scenic spot in
Macao. The six pieces have a face value of one ptc, 1.5 ptcs, two
ptcs, 2.5 ptcs, three ptcs, and 3.5 ptcs, respectively. The face
value of the six pieces and that of other stamp products such as
the first day cover, a souvenir sheet and postcards amount to 134
patacas.
</P>
<P>
Each stamp or stamp product carries the words "Commemoration of
the Establishment of Macao SAR, PRC".
</P>
<P>
The last 1.5 million sets of stamps, "Macau Retrospectiva (
Retrospect of Macao)", issued by the Macao postal authority in the
pre-handover period will be put on sale on December 19.
</P>
<P>
Both the commemoration stamp and the "farewell" stamp have
received a long list of orders from home and abroad, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a set of newly designed Macao currency,
pataca, to mark the handover are to be issued on December 20.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Botswana Resolve Differences On Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Botswana have
resolved their differences over the newly commissioned
Beitbridge-Bulawayo Railway Line in south Zimbabwe by agreeing to
route international traffic on the shortest route principle.
</P>
<P>
This came after official talks on bilateral issues regarding
railways, trade and agriculture between Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and his Botswana counterpart Festus Mogae Friday in
Gaborone, the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The railway issue was high on the agenda as Botswana had
expressed concern about the Beitbridge-Bulawayo Railway line,
which had taken away traffic from its lines and was depriving it
of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The railway line was now the shortest route for rail traffic
from most South African ports to countries such as Zambia and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Before the construction of the line, most rail traffic from
South African ports was routed to countries in the north via
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the talks said the two
presidents had reaffirmed their commitment to increasing the
volume of trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also underlined the importance and potential of the
tourism industry in the economic growth and development of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also directed the relevant ministers to explore
the establishment of trans-frontier parks between Botswana and
Zimbabwe.

LONDON, December 10 (Xinhua) -- England's Simon Parke entered
the semi-finals of the British Open for the first time in Aberdeen,
Scotland on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Parke, who won U.S. Open squash title last week, beat the
fourth-seeded British national champion Paul Johnson in straight

Parke will play the defending champion Peter Nicol, who won his
quarter-final 15-7, 15-11, 5-17, 15-5 against Anthony Hill of

<HEADLINE> Macao Media in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Macao media organizations are
now in full swing with the return of Macao on Dec. 20 drawing near.
</P>
<P>
The landmark handover ceremony will be the biggest event they
are going to cover in the past 170 years and more since the first
local newspaper was launched.
</P>
<P>
"Many reporters have given up their holidays this year for this
landmark event," executive deputy editor-in-chief of "Macao Daily
News" Lok Po said. "But we feel it our great honor and due
responsibility to cover the return of Macao."
</P>
<P>
Press organizations in Macao are expected to markedly increase
their coverage of the landmark event, focusing on major activities
such as the handover ceremony, a ceremony marking the
establishment of the Macao SAR government, and an evening gala.
</P>
<P>
"Macao Daily News", a newspaper with the biggest circulation in
Macao, plans to more than double the pages on Dec. 20 plus a
special edition in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
Macao Television Station and Macao Radio Station are expected
to live broadcast or rebroadcast the event in Portuguese for 42
consecutive hours.
</P>
<P>
For the present, the local media organizations are focusing on
the anticipatory atmosphere in Macao and preparations for the
return, while dispatching reporters to inland cities such as
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Zhuhai to cover the celebration
activities there.
</P>
<P>
Special columns have been opened in newspapers for the landmark
event, discussing return-related topics. The election of the first
chief executive of Macao SAR, preparatory work for establishing
the Macao SAR government, and the formation of the First
Legislative Council of the region have been the press focuses
since last year.
</P>
<P>
In spite of their advantage as local media, they are also
facing great pressure from the mounting competition from some 3,
500 reporters of more than 300 media organizations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Meticulous preparations have been made for the final sprint of
the media war, according to editors of local newspapers which
include more than 20 Portuguese or Chinese language newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Croatian President Franjo Tudjman Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman has died in hospital where he had undergone treatment for
intestinal disorder since November 1, state television announced
in the small hours Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which broke in as a special newscast at 2 a.m.
(0100 GMT), said that Tudjman, "the founder of the independent
Croatian state, has died" at the age of 77, without specifying the
exact cause or time of his death.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the television after the brief announcement,
Parliament Speaker Vlatko Pavletic, who now acts as president of
the country, called on the Croatians to carry on Tudjman's legacy.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not suppress our sorrow or hold back our tears, but let
us stay upright, as President Tudjman always did, ready to
continue building Croatia to Tudjman's pride," Pavletic said.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman received an emergency intestinal surgery on November 1.
His medical team said he had been treated for an ulcer and swollen
lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
His second term as president was to end in June 2002. Under
the Croatian law, early presidential elections will have to be
held within 60 days.

<HEADLINE> Return Expected to Boost Macao's Real Estate Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- "Return effect" has already been
felt in Macao's construction and real estate industries which
constitute one of Macao's four economic pillars.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to the motherland and China's expected entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) are the expected leading
factors to stimulate Macao's industrial and commercial prosperity,
which will in turn drive the public demand for housing and office
buildings, a basic factor to boost construction and real estate of
the peninsula, sector insiders said.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has large numbers of vacant residential apartments
enough for another 200,000 people, or nearly half Macao's present
population. And a square meter of newly built apartment building
in downtown area only sells at a little more than 5,000 Renminbi
yuan, cheaper than in some major inland cities like Beijing. So,
the real estate sector in Macao is turning for the better,
especially for Chinese enterprises and organizations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China-funded businesses account for 70
percent of Macao's construction and real estate companies. During
the past decade, Chinese enterprises completed more than 200 large
and medium-sized projects in Macao, including the Macao
International Airport, one of the world's few large projects built
on the land reclaimed from the sea at a cost of over five billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, Chief Executive designate of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) to be established on December
20, said that the SAR government will take steps to balance demand
and supply for the real estate sector and activate the large sum
of non-performing capital.
</P>
<P>
He promised to improve related laws and regulations for
attracting outlanders to purchase housing or settle down, as well
as foreign companies to set up logistics or branches in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The prime time of Macao's construction and real estate came in
1987 after the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration,
which set the tune for Macao's development and boosted investors'
confidence. As a result, foreign investment poured into Macao, and
the price of real estate shot up.
</P>
<P>
Macao, a tiny area of 23.5 square kilometers, is home to 450,
000 people, one of the world's most populous cities. And some 40
percent of local residents have their own housing, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, however, Macao's real estate became
overheated. In 1996, the Macao government stopped auctioning off
land which didn't leave much room for development. This, along
with other steps, led to a visible growth in the total number of
housing units sold.
</P>
<P>
As Macao's return to China draws near, people's confidence
grows. Industry insiders believe that Macao's construction and
real estate will experience further expansion.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Iraq Pledge to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and Iraq on Friday
pledged efforts to strengthen all-round cooperation in political
and economic fields, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a parliament-level meeting here, the two sides discussed
ways to step up bilateral cooperation and condemned the U.S.
hegemonism and interference in other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav side, headed by Srdja Bozovic, chairman of the
Chamber of Republic, said that differences in religion, ideology
and political system should not hinder the development of friendly
relations between Yugoslavia and Iraq while the common aspiration
for maintaining independence and freedom should serve as a bridge
for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Yugoslav people and the government are working
hard to rebuild their homeland after successfully defending the
state sovereignty and territorial integrity against the bombing by
the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation said that Iraqi leaders and people have
never given up resisting the hegemonic acts by the United States
although the country has been under economic sanctions since 1990
and the U.S. military attacks since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliamentary delegation, headed by Saadoun Hamadi,
chairman of the National Assembly of Iraq, arrived here Friday
for a four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Most Used Word in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- "Return" has become the most
frequently used word here nine days before this region returns to
China.
</P>
<P>
Return, that is, Macao's return to China, is the central theme
of posters, pictures, decorations and souvenirs that are seen
everywhere in this world-renown gambling enclave, which has been
under Portuguese rule for 155 years.
</P>
<P>
For shops, big and small, in the city, discounts are offered in
the name of "Macao's return" rather than because of the arrival of
Christmas, as was the case in the past.
</P>
<P>
Many shops have put up notices saying that renminbi,the Chinese
currency,is welcome. "The trust for renminbi shows that Macao
people have confidence in the future of post-return Macao," said a
local resident.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for Macao's return are getting into the final-
sprint stage, with workers doing final touches on the venue for
the handover ceremony, which is to straddle the midnight of
December 19. Close to the hanover ceremony venue is the Press and
Broadcast Center, which is expected to serve about 3,500 reporters
from over 300 media organizations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
A media war has already started, as is evidenced in a sharp
increase in the coverage of return-related activities by outside
as well as local media organizations. Macao Daily News, a local
newspaper with the biggest circulation in Macao, is planning to
increase pages and offer special editions in days around the
handover.
</P>
<P>
The thickening return atmosphere can also be felt in "Help
Wanted" notices around the city. For job seekers, the ability to
speak mandarin has become a great plus.
</P>
<P>
More visitors are coming to Macao as the day of Macao's return,
December 20, draws near. "The number of taxi hailers increased by
40 percent in December," said a taxi driver. The local airport
handled 228,000 passengers in November, an increase of 30 percent
over the same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
Presents from China's 31 provinces, centrally-administered
municipalities and autonomous regions have also arrived in Macao,
ready for public exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Speaks Highly of EU Invitation to Membership Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov on Friday welcomed the EU's decision to invite his
country to talks on joining the bloc.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech broadcast to the nation, Stoyanov said
the decision, "a major historic event," would inject more
confidence to the Bulgarians in building a new life and being an
equal member of the European community.
</P>
<P>
However, the president pointed out that there remain many
difficulties for Bulgaria's eventual EU membership. "From now on,
all is up to us, up to our work," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, one day before leaving for the EU summit in
Helsinki, Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said that the EU
invitation makes Bulgaria's long-cherished wish come true, while
at the same time posing a challenge to the country's politics,
legislation and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The EU opened its latest summit in Helsinki on Friday morning
and decided to start talks with six candidate members including
Bulgaria next spring on their membership bid.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria became an associate member of the EU on March 9, 1993,
and now all its political parties agree to a full EU membership of
the country.

<HEADLINE> HK Develops 3rd Generation Mobile Phone Service (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's mobile phone
service providers are now staging an intensive campaign to develop
the third-generation wireless Internet services, which are
expected to be essential to their revenue increase next year.
</P>
<P>
Four major cellular operators, Cable and Wireless HKT,
Hutchison Telecom, SmarTone and New World Mobility (NWM), have all
launched the mobile Internet services this week, with the arrival
of the first Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) handset in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
WAP is an open global standard for communication between a
mobile handset and the Internet or other computer application.
The Nokia 7110 WAP handset, which became available in Hong Kong
recently, enables users to get advanced, interactive and real-time
mobile services, such as mobile banking or Internet-based news
services.
</P>
<P>
The "World Wide Mobility" (WWM) Internet service, launched by
NWM, provides bilingual information such as news, weather, traffic
and financial information via the WAP handset.
</P>
<P>
"WWM is just our first step to move into the mobile Internet
and e-commerce arena. We will continue to provide more new value-
added services by using the latest technology, bringing Hong Kong'
s mobile communications into a new height of achievement," said
Albert Wong, chief executive of New World Telephone Group.
</P>
<P>
NWM, whose mobile services are provided by New World Telephone
Group, has just marked a milestone of 500,000 mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
It has also signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Yahoo!
Hong Kong to provide the latest and most dynamic global
information to mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo!'s information services are targeted to be available in
first quarter of 2000 while a wide array of WAP services such as
transportation hotline, movie and restaurant guides, WAP e-mail,
mobile banking as well as shopping and ticketing will be launched.
</P>
<P>
Mobile operators have taken up preferences of free monthly fee
and free airtime to promote the Nokia WAP handset which is sold
here at 3,680 HK dollars (472 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, leading telecommunication operator in
Hong Kong, on its part, launched the i.Menu mobile Internet
service by using WAP technology and believes the service will be
welcome in the market.
</P>
<P>
The company pledged to invest one billion HK dollars to upgrade
the communication network and offer more new services to meet the
demands of business and daily life of customers.

<HEADLINE> HK Develops 3rd Generation Mobile Phone Service (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To explore the next generation wireless Internet service,
Hutchison Telecom, the largest cellular operator in Hong Kong,
recently announced a cooperation package with Japan's NTT DoCoMo.
</P>
<P>
As the world's biggest mobile phone company, NTT DoCoMo was the
first network operator to introduce broadband wireless Internet
access into commercial use.
</P>
<P>
The i-mode service, developed by NTT DoCoMo, allows users to
access data and images via a mobile phone at fast speeds. The
service enables the mobile use of such applications as telephone
banking, airline reservations, stock transactions, e-mail and
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison's Managing Director Canning Fok Kin-ning said that
the deal made sense in light of the expected transition from voice-
dominated to data-dominated mobile telephone traffic in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong cellular penetration is already over 50 percent, so
where can it go except toward wireless data and multimedia
services," said Fok.
</P>
<P>
NTT DoCoMo's managing director of global business Kiyoyuki
Tsujimura said it would take about one year for NTT DoCoMo to
bring its Java-based i-mode system to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hutchison Telecom, which operates two mobile networks in Hong
Kong, has about 1.3 million subscribers, 33 percent of the Hong
Kong SAR cellular market. Hutchison predicts that 50 percent of
its subscribers would use the i-mode service, which would fuel the
increase of consumption of subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Joining hands to unveil a new chapter in Hong Kong's mobile
communication industry, NWM has also completed the installation of
the Nokia General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) solution.
</P>
<P>
As a major stepping stone towards the third-generation mobile
communications technology, GPRS boosts data speed to over 100kbits
per second and enables mobile phone users to be permanently
connected to the network.
</P>
<P>
Mike Mulvey, Managing Director of Nokia Networks, Nokia (HK)
Ltd, said: "GPRS is a key building block in the smooth evolution
to our vision of Mobile Information Society where users have
access to information anytime, anywhere."
</P>
<P>
Swedish telecoms group Ericsson announced that it will
establish Asia's first mobile data applications test centers in
Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The centers would enable the trial of General Packet Radio
Service (GPRS) applications, and fuel the move towards third-
generation (3G) wireless multimedia services.
</P>
<P>
With the availability of GPRS application and the WAP handset,
analysts predict that the Internet service via handset will take a
leap in the coming years and the number of those who enjoy mobile
Internet services may even exceed those Internet users with
computer application.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party Won Two Seats in By-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Nepali Congress (
NC)party has won two seats so far in the three constituencies
where polls for by-election took place on Thursday, according to
results declared by the Election Commission Late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
NC grabbed the seat from the traditional Communist stronghold
Jhapa District, as the party's candidate, Dr. Gopal Koirala,
secured 28,066 votes against 21,963 votes by the closest rival of
the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist and Leninist (CPN-UML),
followed by Rastriya Prajatantra Party candidate, who won 36,09
votes.
</P>
<P>
In Morang District, NC candidate Amod Prasad Upadhaya won the
victory by polling 26,501 votes while his closest rival of the CPN-
UML polled 12,601 votes.
</P>
<P>
The candidate from the Nepal Sadhbhavana Party polled 6,881
votes followed by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party candidate who
polled 1,216 votes.
</P>
<P>
Both Jhapa and Morang districts are in the far eastern part of
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
In Rautahat District in central Nepal, the third constituency
where by-election was ordered, vote counting is still going on as
the polling had been disrupted Thursday by violence which caused
one dead and some injured.
</P>
<P>
At present, none of these three constituencies has a Member of
Parliament in the 205-seat House of Representatives, because the
seats were vacated by three leaders of political parties who won
simultaneously in two constituencies in the last General Election
in May, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Frees Political Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting demand to
respect human rights, the Indonesian government decided on late
Friday to release 91 political prisoners nationwide including East
Timorese activists who have been serving in jail.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were all detained by the Soeharto regime which
ruled the country for 32 years. Soeharto stepped down in May last
year amid the country's worst political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The release of the political prisoners was signed by President
Abdurrahman Wahid who assumed the presidency at the end of October
this year.
</P>
<P>
Included in the list were also seven activists of the People
Democratic Party (PRD) who were sent to jail in July 1996 by the
Soeharto regime for being charged of masterminding the bloody
riots, the Jakarta Post daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The bloody riots occurred following the forcible takeover of
the Megawati Soekarnoputeri's Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) headquarters by the party's another faction which
was supported by the then government.
</P>
<P>
In the riots, at least five people died, some government
offices were set ablaze and up to now dozens of the PDI-P
activists are still reported missing.
</P>
<P>
"The decision (on releasing the political detainees) is a part
of the goverment efforts to respect human right and uphold
democratic value in the country," the Post quoted Minister of Law
and Legislation Yusril Ihza Mahendra as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Abdurrahman Wahid said on Friday that his
government invited the Indonesians who have been living in exile
for a political reasons to return home.
</P>
<P>
"President Wahid has invited Indonesian (citizen) who have been
living in exile for political reasons to return home if they want,
"the Kompas daily wrote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country's House of Representatives (DPR) earlier had
requested the government to free all political prisoners in the
country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Builder Group Says Urban Sprawl Helps Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Conversion of land to
urban uses has helped fuel the U.S. economic expansion, and the
issue of sprawl goes beyond residential construction, a U.S. trade
group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) issued the
statement in response to Vice President Al Gore's recent
assessment that too much land in the United States is being
gobbled up by suburban development. Only a small percentage of the
total U.S. land has been used by housing, the group said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a new study by the U.S. Agriculture Department, the
NAHB said that nearly 16 million acres (6.4 million hectares) of
forest, cropland and open space were converted to schools,
shopping centers, houses, roads, employment centers and other
urban uses from 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Residential growth accounted for about 1.2 million hectares of
the total land converted to urban uses during the period,
representing about 0.1 percent of the total U.S. land mass of 960
million hectares, the group said.
</P>
<P>
"We built 5.6 million single-family homes and nearly 1.2
million multi-family units during the five-year period," the NAHB
said.
</P>
<P>
The group added that the conversion of the remaining land for
other urban uses was a natural outgrowth of a growing population
and rapidly expanding economy. "The suburbs are growing because
that is where Americans are choosing to live and where most new
jobs are being created," the NAHB said, citing its recent consumer
survey which shows 83 percent of Americans prefer to live in a
traditional single-family home in a suburban setting.
</P>
<P>
According to the group, demographic demand for new housing in
the United States will require the construction of between 1.3 and
1.5 million new units per year during the next 10 years. The
overall U.S. population will increase by 30 million between now
and 2010.
</P>
<P>
During the last eight years, 1992 through 1999, nearly 11.5
million new housing units have been constructed. In a typical
year, new residential construction accounts for about five cents
of every dollar spent in the U.S. economy, the NAHB said. The
combination of a growing economy and an expanding housing market
helped raise the nation's homeownership rate from 64 percent in
1992 to a record 67 percent in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to preserve farmland and open space is through a
local comprehensive planning process that is in sync with the
community's economic growth rate and the anticipated demand for
new housing," the NAHB said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Acts to Promote Housing Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 11 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has introduced a series of measures to slash the
oversupply of housing in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the measures include preferential
tax treatment and the introduction of price ceilings for available
apartments.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary apartments completed before July 30, 1998 are exempted
from operational and contractual taxes if they are sold in the
period from August this year to December 2000 at stipulated
ceiling prices.
</P>
<P>
Stockpiled open-market apartments will be exempted from
miscellaneous administrative charges if they are sold at discounts,
or will be charged lower administrative fees if they are sold as
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province has also decided to use three
years in confiscating all land previously purchased to build real
estate projects but so far still idle.
</P>
<P>
By late 1998, the volume of stockpiled open-market housing in
Guangdong reached 11.72 million sq m, and the oversupply of
housing is especially serious in the six provincial-level cities
of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shantou, Jiangmen, Foshan and Zhuhai,
according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
These measures have proved effective. In Guangzhou, the
provincial capital, 402,000 sq m of second-hand apartments were
sold on the second-hand housing market in the first three months
of the year, up 38.6 percent over the same period last year, at a
volume of 1.76 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou was one of the first Chinese cities to introduce
housing reform. A total of 360,000 urban households in the city
now own their own residences.

<P>
XINING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest
China plans to spend 15.8 billion yuan to return 365,000 hectares
of farmland to forest and grassland starting next year to improve
the ecological environment and achieve sustainable social and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the project in 2009, Qinghai's soil-
eroding land will be reduced by 11,256 square kilometers, and
forest and grassland areas will be increased by 1.09 million
hectares. By then, the amount of silt washed into rivers will drop
by 23.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Both of the country's two longest rivers, the Yangtze and the
Yellow, as well as the Lancangjiang River, originate in Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai now has 334,000 square kilometers of soil-eroding land,
accounting for 46 percent of its total land area. The improvement
of Qinghai's environment is of significance for the stable
economic development of the Yangtze and Yellow river valleys.

<HEADLINE> 5,000-year-old Jade Ware Discovered in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have found
a 5,000-year-old sacrificial pit filled with jade ware on the Muus
Desert bordering north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
and Shaanxi Province in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The rectangular pit contains over 30 pieces of jade ware
including knives, hatchets and shovels. Experts believe that many
may have been sacrificial articles. The jade is crystal-clear and
artistically embellished.
</P>
<P>
The pit was discovered when a natural gas pipeline was being
laid in Shenmu County in northern Shaanxi Province. The 4,000-
square-meter relic site has six pottery kilns, 82 adult tombs and
13 tombs of children.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 pieces of pottery and stone, jade and bone ware
have been unearthed from the site, some dating back to a period
between the late Neolithic age and the Xia Dynasty (about 4,000-5,
000 years ago).
</P>
<P>
This discovery will be valuable for the study of the history of
civilization along the Great Wall, said one archeologist.

MACAO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- While a good many people were
suspicious of smoothly implementing the concept of "one country,
two systems" when Hong Kong, which was ruled by the British for
over 100 years, returned to China more than two years ago,
experience has fully indicated the concept as scientific, feasible
and vital.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the widespread doubts over a smooth handover of
Hong Kong, praises are rife today when Macao is to return to China
on the flexible and practical attitude of the Chinese leaders in
handling problems left over from history, and on China's great
contributions to maintaining regional and world peace.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution to the Hong Kong and Macao issues has
provided the international community a successful example for
solving problems left over from history through peaceful talks,
since it not only protected China's territorial integrity and
sovereignty, but also addressed the interests of all sides
involved.
</P>
<P>
Countries facing similar problems have seen hope from the
examples of Hong Kong and Macao. For instance, Argentine vice-
foreign minister Andres Agustin Cisneros said that successful
implementation of the concept of "one country, two systems" in the
two regions gives his country the hope of solving the problem of
Malvinas island.
</P>
<P>
According to Spain's foreign minister Abel Matutes, "one
country, two systems" sets a precedent for solving the dispute
over the ownership of Gibraltar between Spain and Britain. Russian
media holds that the mode of "one country, two systems" provides
reference for solving the territorial disputes between Russia and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
It has always been the principal stand and advocation of the
generations of Chinese leaders to oppose all unequal treaties and
solve problems left over from history by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The late Chinese leader Chairman Mao Zedong explicitly pointed
out as early as in September 1949 at the first National Conference
of the Chinese People's Political consultative conference that
China always holds that problems like Hong Kong and Macao should
be peacefully solved through negotiations when conditions are ripe.

CANBERRA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Pat Rafter will have a wild
card for the Australian Open tennis championships in January
despite that he missed the deadline for entry, Australia's tennis
authority said in Sydney on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter has not fully recovered from a shoulder operation and
missed the Davis Cup final against France last week.

<P>
In the early 1980s, the late senior Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping proposed the great concept of "one country, two systems"
in the light of solving the Taiwan issue, which was first applied
to solving the Hong Kong and Macao issues. "One country, two
systems" is feasible, and this caused very good international
reaction and set an example for other countries to solve problems
left over from history, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, during his State visit to
Portugal last October, stressed in talks with President Jorge
Sampaio of Portugal that both Chinese and Portuguese leaders
should view problems from a strategic perspective. He said the
Chinese government will strictly follow the principle of "one
country,two systems" after resuming the exercise of sovereignty
over Macao, abide by the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region and will not interfere in affairs which are
subject to the jurisdiction of the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Friendly consultations remain primary for both Chinese and
Portuguese governments in the process of solving the Macao issue,
showing the sincerity of both sides. The two governments started
their first round of talks on June 30,1986, and the Sino-
Portuguese Joint Declaration on Macao was signed in Beijing on
April 13,1987. The Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative
Region was adopted at the First Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress on March 31, 1993, and on May 20, 1999, the
State Council, China's cabinet, appointed Edmund Ho Hau Wah the
first chief executive designate of the future Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
International public figures have pointed out that the British
occupied Hong Kong with gunboats and the Portuguese gradually
occupied Macao under the pretext of leasing a piece of land for
drying soaked cargoes; today, China resumes the exercise of the
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, and this is a great victory
of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people in pursuing peace
and also a victory of the world's just cause.
</P>
<P>
The lasting stability and prosperity of Hong Kong over the past
two years and more and the upcoming return of Macao have already
proved it to be feasible to solve problems among nations left over
from history by peaceful means, which will also bring them a more
promising future, thereby contributing to the regional and world
peace and stability.

<P>
MANILA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A blackout hit the whole of
Luzon, the Northern Philippines, Friday night, due to the tripping
of two power plants operated by independent power producers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine press, the blackout, which started
around 20:15 (12:15 GMT)and lasted for more than four hours, was
caused by problems at the Sual power plant in Pangasinan and the
Mauban plant in Quezon, the Northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The blackout spawned a massive traffic in Metro Manila,
stranding thousands of commuters, the Malaya newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted power authorities as saying that they were
still determining the cause of the power tripping.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippine Daily Inquirer, Energy Secretary Mario
Tiaoqui assured President Joseph Estrada that the blackout was not
the result of either sabotage or a terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
"All this talk about a coup or sabotage are totally unrelated.
And this is definitely not caused by any Y2K problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sun Star newspaper said that troops were deployed in high-
risk areas in Manila during the blackout.
</P>
<P>
The power was fully restored in the entire Luzon around 01:00(
17:00 GMT Friday) Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, U.S. to Start Migration Talks Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban and U.S. governments
will start a new round of talks on migration on Monday amid
tension triggered by wrangles over the fate of a six-year-old
Cuban boy, Cuban Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks next week, the two sides will examine the
compliance with the Migratory Agreements signed in 1994 and
ratified in 1995 by both countries, under which the United States
grants some 20,000 visas to Cubans every year for "an orderly,
legal, and secure" emigration.
</P>
<P>
The boy, along with two other persons, was rescued by U.S.
coast guards after a boat with 14 Cuban emigrants sank. The boy's
mother and stepfather were drowned in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon, chief Cuban negotiator in the migratory talks,
reiterated the demand for the boy's return under the laws of
paternity rights which are in force in both Cuba and the United
States. The boy's father is living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Several demonstrations have been held recently in Havana
demanding the boy's return, whose custody was given by the U.S.
authorities to his relatives residing in Miami, Florida.

<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- An article released today by
Xinhua News Agency opposed the U.S. State Department's "Annual
Report on International Religious Freedom for 1999," saying that
it's just another example of American power politics.
</P>
<P>
The article, written by Liu Nanlai, a researcher from the
Institute of Law Science under the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the report criticizing China's religious
affairs was based solely on hearsay evidence.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department official said on Capitol Hill that
China should be put onto the blacklist of countries of "special
concern," and that sanctions should be imposed against China
according to U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
The United States has pursued power politics in international
affairs for long, and attacked other countries under the pretext
of protecting human rights, said the article.
</P>
<P>
The action of the United States, violating the international
laws and normal international relations, has been strongly opposed
by most of the countries in the world. However, the United States
persists in playing power politics, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Freedom of religion, like ethical matters and other human
rights issues, is a country's internal affair and should be solved
by the country itself according to its laws. Although they are
closely watched by the international society, religious affairs
should not be interfered with by other countries, the article said.

<P>
One special situation exists: Some countries in Europe signed
the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950, which entitled
all the contracting parties to protect religious freedom in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the convention is a regional international law for
Europe and has no sanction powers over all countries in the world.
The common international laws stress the principles of sovereign
equality and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs,
including the issue of religion.
</P>
<P>
Neither the United States nor China is a signatory of the
European Convention on Human Rights, and will not be restricted by
the convention. On the contrary, both of them should follow the
common international laws.
</P>
<P>
The United States has no right to criticize China's religious
affairs, and the act of imposing sanctions against China according
to U.S. domestic law is a violation of international laws, the
article pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the "Annual Report on International Religious Freedom," the
United States attempted to prove that China has violated the
international standards on freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
However, the report has no clear definition of what
international standards on religious freedom are or how China has
violated those standards.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the United States judges China's affairs according to
its own standards and treats the actions disobeying the U.S.
standards as actions against the international standards, the
article said.

<P>
Although the report made no particular explanation of the "
American standard," it was clear from the context that the report
applied its own criteria to judge China, the article said.
</P>
<P>
"The criteria are: Any activity or organization should enjoy
freedom and be permissible, whether it is registered or not, and
whether it is patriotic or treasonous, whether a religion or a
cult, whether a regular religious activity or illegal deeds which
intend to split a nation, disturb public security and endanger
human health."
</P>
<P>
Under such criteria, the report not only accused China of
repressing splittist activities led by the Dalai Lama, but also
described China's attempts to stir patriotic sentiments among the
people of Tibet as a serious issue which violated internationally
recognized principles.
</P>
<P>
Also under the criteria, the Chinese government's battles
against the Falun Gong cult were taken by the report as an example
of China's violation of the international principles, as well as
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
However, the criteria of the United States were not
internationally recognized standards related to religious freedom,
the article argued.
</P>
<P>
"A true international principle should accept that religious
freedom is a key human right, and that no religious freedom is
unlimited," it said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, religious freedom should be limited by laws in order
to guarantee public security, social order, public health, and
fundamental rights and freedom of other people. In other words,
nobody is permitted to break laws, harm a nation's state security
and social order, endanger other people's health and infringe on
others' rights and freedom while enjoying religious freedom, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that the United States, which always
made an issue of religious freedom, cared little about religious
freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
"Its real intention is to restrain China's development through
supporting illegal activities in China to create internal chaos,
thus it can continue to dominate the world," it said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia not to Postpone Automotive Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
that it would implement the automotive market liberalization as
scheduled, a business daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Automotive market liberalization would be implemented on
January 1, 2000," the Bisnis Indonesia quoted Minister of Trade
and Industry Yusuf Kalla as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has demanded members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nation (ASEAN)to delay the implementation of the automotive
liberalization in the region due to the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Malaysia's request to postpone automotive free trade would
only last for one year period, the daily added.
</P>
<P>
"And such a request needs a bilateral agreement. So Malaysia
can't decide (the postponement) by itself. We will still study
such a thing.But we will not delay the agreement which had been
reached in the meeting of AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area) in
automotive sector," Kalla said.
</P>
<P>
Under the AFTA agreement, the automotive liberalization should
be implemented in the region on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Automotive sector would be put into the inclusion list with
maximum import tariff of 20 percent for the ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
Kalla said that Indonesia has decided to put its automotive
industries into AFTA inclusion list on January 1, 2000 albeit
ASEAN would still delay this matter until the AEMM (ASEAN Economic
Ministerial Meeting) set to be held in May 2000 in Yangon, Myanmar,
The daily said.

CARACAS, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's average oil price
for export increased to 23.44 U.S. dollars per barrel in the week

the Ministry of Energy and Mines said on Friday.

<P>
The average oil price for export so far this year has reached

Analysts attributed the price rise to the declining world oil
inventories.

Stockpiles already depleted by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' (OPEC) supply curbs are being drawn down more

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
formally declared its common strategy on Ukraine late Friday,
saying the strategic partnership with the former Soviet republic

<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 89.91 at 11,224.70,
expanding its gain of 66.67 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 8.93 at 1,417.04 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 26.06 at 3,620.23, outstripping the record
closing high of 3,594.17 points set Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported that its
Producer Price Index grew at 0.2 percent in November, following a
0.1 percent decline in October. The moderate increase was on
target with analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
The tame inflation news buoyed investors' confidence in the
stock market because they believed the Federal Reserve will leave
interest rates alone in the near future. The Federal Reserve has
raised rates three times this year in efforts to ward off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The strong economic growth without the sign of inflation will
encourage investors to stay in the market at least until the end
of the year, analysts said. The Dow index was up 21 percent so far
this year vs. 65 percent for the Nasdaq index and 15 percent for
the S&AMP;P 500 index.

The NYSE rose 3.44 at 639.49 and the American Stock Exchange

against an eight-month driving ban, his lawyer said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Beckham was banned after he was found guilty of speeding by a
court on Thursday. He was also fined 800 pounds and ordered to pay
190 pounds in costs, according to the Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
An earlier request to return the license was refused, but a
judge overruled that decision after an appeal from Beckham's
lawyer, Nicholas Freeman.
</P>
<P>
Freeman has also lodged an appeal against the driving ban at
Stockport Magistrates Court. The case is expected to resume next
week.
</P>
<P>
Beckham told the court he was being pursued by a paparazzi
photographer when he was recorded driving 76 mph in a 50-mile zone
on July 24.
</P>
<P>
The midfielder, 24, said the photographer chased him in a white
car for about 10 miles and he feared an accident could happen
during the pursuit.
</P>
<P>
He said the white car pulled alongside him on three occasions,
causing him to swerve his silver Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
Beckham said he telephoned the police after the incident and
told them he thought he might have been speeding.

</P>
<P>
Brazil will launch a series of incentive measures to promote
sale in foreign market next year, Tapias said.
</P>
<P>
Brazil should possess products with best brands, with quality,
modernity and friendly with environment, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> EU Sets Timetable For Institutional Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinky, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
leaders Friday agreed to reform the 15-nation bloc's institutions
by the end of 2002 in bid to streamline its decision-making
procedures so as to adapt to expansion pace in the next century.
</P>
<P>
At their summit meeting here in Helsinky, the leaders reached
common ground on a limited agenda for a year-long
intergovernmental conference (IGC) in order to improve the current
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The EU heads of state and government also agreed to review the
reforms midway through next year, leaving some room for more
radical changes.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the EU members divided over the institutional reform
issue. Many of them want to stick to three areas which they failed
to complete at the last revision of the EU's founding treaty in
Amsterdam in 1997. While the Benelux countries, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg, had pursue broader and deeper reforms.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Romano Prodi had called for a
more radical changes since he took office in September. He has
appointed three European "wise men" for mapping out reform plan.
</P>
<P>
The assigned team, which includes former Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene, Britain's Lord Simon and former German President
Richard von Weizsaecker, put forward in October an ambitious
proposal, urging a streamlined European Commission and a written
treaty divided into a core constitution that could only be changed
by unanimity, and operational provisions that could be amended by
qualified majority vote.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders compromised on those areas to bring the reform
to the basic need in the course of EU enlargement for more members.
</P>
<P>
All the leaders realized that the EU institutions, originally
designed for six founding members, have already suffered
painstaking handling of businesses for 15 members and must be
shaped up to prevent decision-making process from being paralyzed
when embracing more European countries early in the next century.

<HEADLINE> A Quarter of the Third World in Extreme Poverty: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.2 billion people, almost
one fourth of the developing world, live in a situation of extreme
poverty, with a daily income of less than one dollar.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here Friday by the World Bank director for
the Middle East and the North of Africa, Mustafa Nabli, during the
presentation of the last yearly report of this credit institution,
about the outlook of the Third World countries in the medium and
long term.
</P>
<P>
Nabli explained that the possibilities of reducing poverty in
the next 10 years are very few. For example, in the case of the
Sub-Sahara African countries, where 45 percent of the population
lives with less than one dollar a day. He said that "it is very
improbable" that the situation will improve in that zone in the
first decade of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
World Bank estimates show that extreme poverty will not reduce
from 42 percent in Sub-Sahara African countries in the next 10
years, and it even could surpass 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the south of Asia, with India at the top, the
possibility of reducing poverty would be higher if the countries
of the area made the necessary structural reforms to stimulate the
economic growth and to redistribute wealth in a more fair way.
</P>
<P>
Nabli considers that two factors could contribute to improve
the situation of the poorest countries in the next years: the
increase of the financial flows toward the Third World and the
reduction of the volatility of the raw materials prices.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the developing countries will recover next year,
but the medium rhythm will be minor by around five percent until
the year 2008, than before the world crisis, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank foresees a 2.7 percent growth for this year in
those nations, 4.2 percent for the next, and 4.5 percent for 2001,
above what had been estimated six months ago.

<HEADLINE> New Argentine President Calls for Overcoming Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 10 (Xinhua) -- Fernando de la Rua, the
new Argentine President, said Friday that his government will face
courageously the crisis faced by the country .
</P>
<P>
De la Rua substituted Friday for Carlos Menem, who concluded
his second consecutive mandate as president.
</P>
<P>
The new president declared himself in favor of a shared effort
to bring the country out of the crisis, and demanded the approval
of a realistic budget with precise figures.
</P>
<P>
An additional effort is required until the recovery of the
economy and the success of the inexorable fight against tax
evasion and corruption will show its results, he said.
</P>
<P>
He deplored the existence of an enormous fiscal deficit and of
a budget without the approval of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, one of the richest countries in Latin America is
facing economic difficulties due to the devaluation of the real (
currency of Brazil in January.
</P>
<P>
Argentina will breach the 5.1 billion-dollar fiscal deficit
target set with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for this
year, and next year's deficit could soar to 10 billion dollars
without tough measures, said Argentine new Minister of Economy
Jose Luis Machinea later October.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua, the winner of the October 24 elections, will serve
the fourth presidential period since the restoration of democracy
in 1983, after Raul Alfonsin and Carlos Menem.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Government Calls on Citizens to Vote Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government called
Friday on the citizens to fulfill their civic duty and vote in a
peaceful and orderly fashion in the presidential elections of
December 12.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Metropolitan Military Region and province of
San Antonio, General Sergio Candia, said that starting Friday at
00:00 hours, 1,085 members of the armed and order forces were
deployed in the voting points.
</P>
<P>
This security personnel will be present in every one of the
voting places of the Metropolital Region and the San Antonio
Province when the elections are just two days away.
</P>
<P>
Candia called on the citizens to take part in the presidential
elections with all tranquillity before the presence of the
security personnel.
</P>
<P>
The electoral propaganda ended Friday at 00:00 hours in the
communication media, through the radio, printed press, television,
handbills posters, graffiti, and printed papers pasted to the
walls.
</P>
<P>
Voters will choose a new president on Sunday between Chile's
top two presidential runners: the center-left Concertation
coalition candidate Ricardo Lagos and his right-wing rival, the
Alliance for Chile's candidate Joaquin Lavin.
</P>
<P>
Lagos is narrowly ahead of Lavin in most polls, but both are
short of the 50 percent support needed to win the vote, making the
likely outcome a second run-off between them on January 16.
</P>
<P>
The new president will take over from President Eduardo Frei,
who steps down in March after his six-year term.
