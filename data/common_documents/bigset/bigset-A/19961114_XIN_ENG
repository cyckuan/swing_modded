<HEADLINE> Follow-on Troops to Safeguard Bosnia Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A 20,000- to 30,000-strong
force as follow-on troops to the current multinational
implementation force (IFOR) would be "a powerful one" to safeguard
peace in Bosnia after IFOR's mandate expires on 20 December, an
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, head of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, made the
remarks after meeting with the North Atlantic Council this morning
at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem is in mastering the will on the part of the
international community to continue its commitment," said Frowick,
an American diplomat overseeing the elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
As for the postponed municipal elections in Bosnia, Frowick
said that the date had not been fixed but his recommendation was
somewhere in April to June, adding "late in June would be best."
</P>
<P>
With regard to the future tasks of the OSCE mission in Bosnia,
he said they would be determined depending on diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
"If we preserve the responsibility to supervise the elections,
we will go forward with more or less the same strength we
commanded during the past year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once we get passed on the municipal elections," he said, "the
OSCE's misson in Bosnia will rest on two pillars, one of which is
supporting efforts to help build democracy, human rights
monitoring and reporting, the other is the issue of regional
stabilization."

<HEADLINE> Smith Wins Again in Asia Pacific Etchells Yachting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- American world number two
Jud Smith wrapped up another first Wednesday, this time in Race
Three, of the OOCL Fifth Asia Pacific Etchells Yachting
Championships here.
</P>
<P>
He won the first two races on Tuesday in the on-going
Championship.
</P>
<P>
Current world champion Adam Gosling from Britain took the
second place in Wednesday's race.
</P>
<P>
It was another clear victory for Smith who led all the way
around the 12-mile-windward-leeward course. The Northeast by
East, 12-22 knot winds and large swells with chop obviously suited
Smith sailing in USA63. Gosling sailing in GBR117 kept his second
position throughout the course.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Mark Thornburrow in HKG46 and Peter Ahern in HKG9
finished third and fourth respectively. The two boats fought hard
for the third position.
</P>
<P>
"Today was the windiest day, roughest day for sure," said
Smith. "We need two more good races. We want to win, but also
want to make sure we are the fastest.
</P>
<P>
"We're learning things about the boat every day," he said. His
boat is new, having only been raced the second time.
</P>
<P>
"We were sailing well, taking the shifts and going the right
way," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his second place finish compared to his
less-than-perfect finishes yesterday, Gosling said: "We got the
hand-break off today. We're trying different things and did the
right thing today.
</P>
<P>
"We've also been using the same sails all year so they are a
bit tired. The more sailing you do with then the more the
handicap," he said.
</P>
<P>
Things are not looking good for the 1990 Asia Pacific champion
Warwick Downes of Hong Kong who last night lost his protest
against Mark Thornburrow, also from Hong Kong, and subsequently
was disqualified from Race Two. Downers and his team are asking
for a re-opening of the protest hearing from the international
jury.
</P>
<P>
The second leg of the OOCL World Series, the OOCL Fifth Asia
Pacific Championship has 17 boats - 10 from Hong Kong, three from
Australia, three from the United States and one from Britain -
competing for a chance to win the OOCL World Series Cup. The
skipper with the highest accumulated points over the four regatta
series will win the OOCl Cup.
</P>
<P>
All the participating boats are to have one day off on
Thursday, with competition to resume on Friday for Races Four and
Five. The championship closes with the sixth and final race on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Calls For Faster Reform Pace in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Wu Bangguo, vice premier and
member of Political Bureau of Central Committee of Communist Party
of China, has urged Guangdong Province to quicken the pace of its
reform, and should open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a nine-day visit to the province
which ended today.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the province, where the outstanding performance in
the country's reform drive proved "the superiority of socialist
system," should acquire experience in the reform of state-owned
enterprises in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's state-owned enterprises still boast many
matchless advantages in their production scale and economic force,
though the development rate has lowered in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A number of conglomerates have formed in the state-owned
sector, with efficiency greatly improved. Also, the central
government has issued a package of new policies for state-owned
enterprises, in hope that those debt-ridden enterprises will
become profitable as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the management of state-owned enterprises
should receive more attention, and their overgrowing operational
costs should be brought under control as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> HK Tourist Arrivals on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's tourist arrivals
reached 944,000 in September this year, a growth of 15.1 percent
compared with the same month last year, according to the latest
statistics released today by the Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA).
</P>
<P>
The release said the cumulative figures for the
January-September period showed an increase of 16.1 percent to
reach a total of 8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
It said that over the nine-month period, tourist arrivals
registered rises from most major market regions, except the
Americas and Taiwan, which saw declines of 0.4 percent and 4.3
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA attributes much of the growth to the strong appeal of
Hong Kong, highly successful tactical promotions conducted in such
markets as Malaysia and Singapore and competitive travel packages
offered by tour operators.
</P>
<P>
The association is forecasting for 1996 a year-end increase of
12-15 percent over last year to a new record total of some 11.8
million visitors.

<HEADLINE> Network Marketing Successful in Cyprus, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Network marketing, a means of
sale which does away with commission agents, has made a success on
the Cypriot markets, local newspaper Financial Mirror reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Nik Argyrou, a local advocate of the marketing method, was
quoted as saying that the method was introduced three years ago in
the Cypriot market in view of the increasingly intensifying global
competition.
</P>
<P>
Argyrou said the network marketing has made his own business a
success in selling U.S. made products like cosmetics, skin-care
and jewelery, adding he is to expand business in eastern Europe
and the CIS states.
</P>
<P>
Network marketing is the way of selling products and services
from manufacturers direct to the consumers and cutting all the
layers of commission agents in-between.
</P>
<P>
Employing the method, a company introduces its products, much
like a franchise, to a small nucleus of individuals or customers
who then introduce the products to others. The products are sold
at wholesale price.

<HEADLINE> American Official Holds Talks on Cyprus in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. state department's
southern European representative Carey Cavanaugh today described
his talks in Athens as "fruitful and useful" and said Washington
shared the same targets as Greece with respect to securing peace,
stability and prosperity for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh, who has unofficially become Washington's coordinator
for the Cyprus problem following the resignation of James
Williams, arrived here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After talks today with Greek Foreign Undersecretary Christos
Rozakis he told reporters that his meetings on Tuesday and today
in Athens and those he will be having tomorrow in Nicosia
"underline the emphasis which the United States attaches to
efforts for a settlement of the Cyprus problem".
</P>
<P>
U.S. state department spokesman Glyn Davis said Tuesday that
Cavanaugh's visit to Athens, Ankara and Cyprus was "a diplomatic
mission on a working level and does not constitute the start of a
U.S. initiative on the Cyprus problem".
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters here today when such a U.S. initiative would
begin, Cavanaugh replied that "this depends on the course of the
talks".
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, the U.S. is placing particular
emphasis on the implementation of previous proposals put forward
by Washington's permanent representative at the United Nations,
Madeleine Albright, aimed at reducing tension and commencing
military dialogue on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh is expected to leave for Nicosia, Cyprus later today.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Official Calls for New Fund to Eradicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A top official from the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) called here today for the
establishment of a new fund to help eradicate poverty in the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Saad Alfarargi, director of UNDP's Regional Bureau for the
Arab States, said at the ongoing Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) economic conference that the new fund, if set up, would
help governments in the region design and carry out policies aimed
at tackling poverty, mainly by generating new income-earning
opportunities for the poor.
</P>
<P>
A large share of the fund would be used to make small loans
available to the poor to help them start up or expand private
business, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arab states, international organizations and
major donor nations to help set up the fund, to which, he
announced, the UNDP would contribute 5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fund would supplement a 2.5 million dollars contribution
made by the UNDP at last year's MENA economic summit in Amman to
help governments pursue economic and social reforms and
stimulate economic cooperation among Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is so much human potential...in the Arab region, but
some of it is locked out by poverty, and some of it is locked
out by unequal access to life's opportunity," the official
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"All of the region's potential would be better used if new
opportunities were opened for education, social and political
participation...," he added.
</P>
<P>
Alfarargi proposed establishing a "four-way partnership"
between Arab governments, the business community, aid-donor
nations, and the United Nations, to pool their resources to meet
this goal.
</P>
<P>
The money would finance a study to find ways for the region
to upgrade its education systems and expand its capacity for
research and development to enable it to cope with economic
growth in the world influenced by information technology.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP is the world's largest provider of grants to developing
countries to help them eradicate poverty, generate jobs and
sustainable livelihoods for the poor, protect and regenerate the
environment, advance women's role in society and development,
and improve governance.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to predict how the UNDP's call would be
received.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Rate Falls to 7.2% in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Britain fell
unexpectedly by 40,800 last month to 2,030,000, the lowest figures
for 5.5 years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The fall is much higher than the forecast of 25,000 and helps
bring the overall rate of unemployment down from 7.4 percent in
September to 7.2 percent, the lowest level since February 1991.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that October's jobless fall might have been
exaggerated by 10,000-15,000 as the government replaced
traditional unemployment benefit with the job-seekers allowance in
October and job centers were struggling at the time with a backlog
of claims for the new job-seekers' allowance.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Eric Forth welcomed the figures, saying
that "the underlying fall is very much in line with the last few
months and we're still talking about a fall of about 15-20,000 per
month".
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the unexpectedly sharp drop had increased
the chances of a further hike in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Britain's central bank the Bank of England raised its base
rates by a quarter-point to six percent on October 30.

<HEADLINE> Poverty, Third World's Worst Enemy: Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is becoming the
greatest enemy of the developing world due to rapid urbanization,
a Zimbabwean senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sithembiso Nyoni, Deputy Minister of Public Construction and
National Housing, said at the end of the three-day regional
conference on urban poverty alleviation that poverty resulted in
rising disease outbreaks, malnutrition, crime and
desertification.
</P>
<P>
She said female-headed households had twice the rate of
poverty compared to those headed by men.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said lack of adequate housing for the
urban poor was of great concern not only to developing countries,
but to industrialized ones.
</P>
<P>
"In the least developed countries, more than half of the
housing is informal and 40 percent is made of temporary
materials. This needs immediate attention from all governments of
the world," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, 30 percent of urban households do not have access
to clean water and electricity while many cities do not have any
treatment to waste water at all," she said, noting that poverty
could not be reduced without adopting strategies that involved
all the citizens, including the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Our countries are endowed with abundant natural resources
which need to be fully utilized for the good of all people and
this can be achieved by developing our human resources," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six government officials from Uganda, Ethiopia, Malawi,
Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe attended the meeting which was
jointly organized by the Harare-based sub-Saharan Municipal
Development Program and the University of Zimbabwe School of
Social Work.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Turkey Reach Natural Gas Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Turkey signed here
today a memorandum of understanding for exports of Egypt's
liquefied natural gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Minister of Petroleum Hamdy el-Banbi and Turkey's
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Recai Kutan jointly
announced the signing of the document on the sidelines of
the third Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference
(MENA Three), which entered its second day today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Egypt will begin the first delivery of
the natural gas to Turkey from its rapidly expanding gas
resources in the Nile Delta in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Capital investments in the project are expected to be in
the range of 2 billion to 4 billion U.S. dollars, depending
on the ultimate size and phasing of the project, according
to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Parties involved to fulfill the agreement are the Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation and Turkey's Botas Petroleum
Pipeline Corporation and Amoco Egypt Oil Company, a subsidiary
of Amoco Corporation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Botas will be the principal purchaser of the liquefied
natural gas under long term contract in quantities up to the
equivalent of 10 billion cubic meters per year.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most significant commercial initiatives
which Egypt has undertaken in recent years," Banbi said. "It
is indicative of our desire to export natural gas to
regional markets and Turkey's desire to secure new sources of
energy to promote economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Egypt currently consumes approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet
of gas per day. By the year 2006, this consumption is
projected to nearly double 2.4 billion cubic feet of gas per
day.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Up Sharply in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The wholesale prices in the
U.S. rose by 0.4 percent in October boosted by rising energy and
food costs, the sharpest increase in seven months, U.S. Labor
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the advance in its Producer Price
Index (PPI), which measures inflationary pressures before they
reach the consumer, was the steepest since a 0.5 percent gain in
last March.
</P>
<P>
The rise of U.S. PPI resulted from high increase of energy and
food prices in the month. Gasoline costs were up by 5.5 percent,
the biggest increase since a 7.2 percent jump last March. Heating
oil rose by 3.8 percent. Natural gas prices were unchanged and
electricity was down 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The food index, which rose 0.2 percent in September, was pushed
higher in October by a 4.4 percent advance in pork prices, which
had dropped 7.5 percent the previous month. The cost of fish rose
by 5.9 percent and beef 1.4 percent. Vegetable costs rose by 7
percent and fruit prices by 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, excluding the volatile energy and food components,
wholesale prices in the country actually fell by 0.3 percent, the
biggest decline since a 0.4 percent drop in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the cost of raw materials was down by
0.6 percent and prices for intermediate goods were unchanged from
September. Automobile prices dropped 1.6 percent after increasing
1.2 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten months of this year, U.S. wholesale prices were
rising at an annual rate of just 2.4 percent, compared with 2.3
percent for all of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report was announced when the U.S. Federal Reserve's
policy-maker, the Federal Open Market Committee, was studying data
today to determine whether higher rates were needed to slow the
economy and thus keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports have suggested the U.S. economy was slowing down
on its own without the increase of short-term interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Reporters Participate Rat-killing Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Rats in Beijing's suburbs
nibble their way through 10 tons of grain every year - enough to
feed hundreds of families.
</P>
<P>
Now the hairy rodents have been given their marching orders by
health officials in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The results of a rat-killing campaign in Beijing were witnessed
by dozens of foreign journalists today.
</P>
<P>
To mark Beijing's rat-killing day, the Beijing Patriotic Health
Campaign Committee, sponsored the campaign and invited foreign
reporters see the results.
</P>
<P>
The journalists showed great interest when they saw people
using the medicine to kill rats in Beijing's Dongcheng Area. They
said they were glad to take part in the campaign, which would help
create a good surrounding for local people.
</P>
<P>
Sites, which are most suited for the poison, include food
processing firms, outdoor markets, storehouses, underground
pipelines and poultry farms, said Zhang Xizeng, vice-director of
Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists said more baby rats will be born this year, compared
with the past nine years and now is the best time to kill rats.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Probe Into Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today proposed a three-year investigation into mad cow disease
with a budget of 50.7 million ECU (about 65 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The plan, based on a report of an EC-sponsored research group,
proposes a comprehensive study of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs), including the transmission and cure of
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan which is subject to the final decision of
Council of Ministers and European Parliament, more than two thirds
of the fund, 35 million ECU, will come from additional financing
for the European Union's Fourth Framework Program on Research and
Development.
</P>
<P>
European beef industry has suffered immensely from the mad cow
crisis sparked in late March, when Britain announced that the
brain-wasting cattle disease was the "most likely" source of a
similar fatal brain ailment in humans.

<HEADLINE> Black Box Found in Indian Midair Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The black box of the Saudi
jumbo jet, one of the two planes involved in a midair collision
which killed all the 351 people aboard on Tuesday evening, was
recovered on the crash site in India's Haryana Pradesh today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, the black box for
another ill-fated plane, a Kazakh airliner, is yet to be recovered
although the flight data for the aircraft has been found.
</P>
<P>
Indian Civil Aviation Secretary Yogesh Chandra said here today
that pilots of the two planes did not flash any signs of an
impeding disaster to the air traffic control of the international
airport in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no possibility of the pilots anticipating a
collision since they confirmed instructions from the air traffic
control for their aircraft to be separated by a vertical distance
of 1,000 feet (about 300 meters).
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary evidence of the wreckage suggested that the
aircraft were not involved in a head-on collision. Probably their
wings touched each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said tapes recorded in the air traffic control showed that
both pilots were aware of the altitude they had to fly and also of
each other's approach when the accident took place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official spokesman said today that as many as 291
bodies had been recovered from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that there were no survivors after three seriously
injured passengers died later.

ATHENS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Athens Stock Exchange (ASE)

the bourse which has been rocked by scandal and closed since
Friday.

Greek National Economy Ministry Yiannos Papantoniou announced

Under the proposal, the Delta Securities default of 2.6 billion
drachmas will be made up from the joint-surety fund and the

decision, disputed transactions must be cleared by all brokerage
firms by Thursday while those firms which do not fulfill their

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Raises Mortgage Rate by 0.25% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nationwide Building
Society, Britain's third largest mortgage lender, Tuesday
surprised the housing market by announcing a quarter-point
increase in its mortgage rate.
</P>
<P>
The society will increase its mortgage rate from 6.49 percent
to 6.74 percent, the first such move in nearly two years. The new
rate, which will come into force on December 1, will still
undercut the prevailing rate of 6.99 percent offered by the
majority of other lenders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said that it would raise its savings rates by up
to 0.3 of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, with one million borrowers and six million savers,
is the second lender after the much smaller Birmingham Midshires
to react to the 0.25 percent increase in Bank of England's base
rates announced on October 30.
</P>
<P>
The increase will put seven pounds (11.5 US dollars) on the 319
pounds (523.2 US dollars) monthly cost of a 50,000 pounds (82,000
US dollars) repayment mortgage.
</P>
<P>
Other lenders, such as the Halifax and Abbey National, all
claimed that they did not intend to follow the Nationwide's rate
increase immediately.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that the move, which put strain on the
resurgent feel-good factor and sparked fears that borrowing costs
were now entering an upward swing, was gloomy news for the
government in the run-up to the general election.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Announces Major Arms Procurement Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece will spend two trillion
drachmas (about 8.7 billion U.S. dollars) on defense up to the
year 2,000 and a further two trillion by 2007, Prime Minister
Costas Simitis announced today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made immediately after a meeting of the
government council for foreign policy and defense (KYSEA).
</P>
<P>
Simitis said the Greek armed forces would purchase an Awacs
early-warning aircraft, 60 new warplanes, training aircraft,
transport helicopters and aircraft and would modernize its f-4
Phantom jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, new tanks will be purchased while those already in
service with the army are to be modernized.
</P>
<P>
The four-trillion drachma armaments program will also involve
the purchase of modern munitions and the acquisition of new anti-
aircraft systems and warships, including submarines and nine
surface vessels.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that the defense program had taken into
consideration the needs of the armed forces without overlooking
the limits of the country's economic endurance.
</P>
<P>
On land, he continued, the objective of the program is to
create flexible, rapid intervention forces with strong firepower.
</P>
<P>
The aim at sea was to create a naval force capable of securing
control in the Greeks seas, repulsing any invasion from the sea
and maintaining a naval presence in the broader region of the
eastern Mediterranean, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
As far as the air was concerned, he added, the aim was to
create a force capable of securing the air defense of the country,
maintaining the necessary air superiority and providing air
support for army and navy units.
</P>
<P>
Simitis underlined that Greece's defense strategy is one of
deterrence, adding that "we do not claim anything but we shall
not give anything up."
</P>
<P>
He said the country's armed forces had to be bolstered in order
to face "the threats around us", and that emphasis would be
placed on upgrading the military qualitatively in order to
counterbalance the "opponent's" numerical strength.

<HEADLINE> Rise of Oil Cost Lifts UK Industry's Output Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (xinhua) -- A surge in the cost of oil in
Britain helped to push factory prices higher in October, although
underlying output prices remained relatively subdued, according to
data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Input prices, or the prices manufacturers paid for raw
materials and fuel, rose 0.5 percent compared with September,
although the annual rate fell 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase during the month was entirely due to rising crude
oil prices, which were 45 percent higher than a year earlier, said
the ONS.
</P>
<P>
This also helped take prices charged at the factory gate up by
0.2 percent during the month, taking the annual rate to 2.3
percent from 2.2 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
However, the core measure of factory gate price inflation,
which excludes food, drink, tobacco and petroleum, remained flat,
at 0.9 percent, its lowest level for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the oil price was mainly to blame for last month's
increases reassured some analysts who believed that inflationary
pressures were otherwise very weak and ther was little immediate
threat of inflation feeding through to the shops.

Oman and Morocco to underscore its commitment to promoting the
Middle East peace through commerce.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that the U.S.
agreed to provide funds for Oman, Jordan, Morocco and the
Palestinian Authority to boost regional development.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor witnessed the signing
of three agreements on telecommunications, water treatment and

and North Africa (MENA Three) economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Kantor announced that the U.S. and Oman signed an agreement on
infrastructure involving 200 million dollars, which is expected to
create 3,000 jobs in construction in Oman. The U.S. also signed
with Morocco an agreement of cooperation on finance, insurance and
energy which totals 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement stipulates that the U.S. provides 45
million dollars to a new investment fund which will finance
projects in Jordan, Oman, the Palestinian self-rule areas. The
fund will begin to be provided at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will also provide 1.7 million dollars to finance
water projects in the West bank.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a special fund of 250 million dollars will
also be set up to provide investment in the Middle East
region.
</P>
<P>
"These business agreements underscore the tremendous amount of
commercial activity in the Middle East region and typify the
commitment of the U.S. government and U.S. businesses to be
active partners in the economic resurgence of the area,"
Kantor said,
</P>
<P>
"We realize the importance of the Middle East to U.S.
trade, as well as the importance of strong commercial ties
to assist in preserving the peace process here," he added.
</P>
<P>

Talking about the MENA conference, Kantor hoped it would be
fruitful in facilitating more inflow of foreign investment to the
Middle East. "Trade and investment are an essential foundation to
the peace process and upon which a more prosperous, stable and
peaceful Middle East can be built," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher told

<HEADLINE> 6 African States to Contribute to Multinational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- At least six African
States have promised to contribute troops to the proposed U.N.
multinational force, Secretary General of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim announced today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at OAU secretariat here, Salim
listed the six countries as South Africa, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Congo, Cameroun and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
Salim said consultations have been underway with a number of
other African countries in a bid to persuade them to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed that the report that Africans are hesitant and
not ready to contribute troops to the peacekeeping force to be
deployed in eastern Zaire as unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
There is a real commitment on the part of Africans to
participate in force contribution on condition that the
logistics, finance and resource required for the deployment are
met, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief said Eritrean President Issayas Afeworki has
expressed his government commitment to contributing a brigade of
troops.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the funding, Salim said the issue is a continental
commitment and therefore, the fund should be channelled through
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed conviction that the U.N. Security Council would
decide in favor of Africa's position when it meets in the coming
few days.

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Draft Negotiating Mandate for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
today approved a draft negotiating mandate for the European
Union's(EU) accession to the European Organization for the Safety
of Air Navigation known as EUROCONTROL.
</P>
<P>
This approach by the Commission is the logical follow-up to the
White Paper on Air Traffic Management:"Freeing Europe's Airspace",
adopted in March.
</P>
<P>
The draft accession mandate presupposed changes to EUROCONTROL
enabling it to implement decisions more quickly.
</P>
<P>
The EC is proposing that EUROCONTROL should be reformed such as
to separate its regulatory and operational functions.
</P>
<P>
It was of the opinion that the organization should be made
responsible for the regulation of various security aspects, the
formulation of Air Traffic Management policy, procedures and
norms, as well as the regulation of civilian air space.
</P>
<P>
The EC also raised the possibility of a EUROCONTROL fund to
finance projects of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Moreover the Commission proposed that EUROCONTROL be
reconstituted to give it the muscle to implement decisions.
</P>
<P>
The draft mandate proposed that as well as individual EU Member
States, the Community should also accede to EUROCONTROL so that
the Community competence in the field of civil aviation is
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
EUROCONTROL was set up in 1960 to provide air traffic control
in the airspace of its member states, it now comprises 22 members,
including all the EU Member States save Spain and Finland.
</P>
<P>
It takes most of its decisions, particularly in the regulatory
field, by consensus on the basis of cooperation. There is no
mechanism for guaranteeing that any particular decision is
implemented by EUROCONTROL members.

<HEADLINE> Prudential Co. Launches One Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Prudential Corporation of U.K.
has set a One billion U.S dollars target for its new Invest Direct
Asia (PIDA) Fund with China at the top of its "target list".
</P>
<P>
The intent of this new Fund is to make direct investments in
the emerging markets of Asia. The source of funds will be from
Prudential's own businesses in the United Kingdom and Asia,
according to a press release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Prudential has over 130 billion U.S. dollars funds under
management worldwide. It currently has a 13 billion U.S. dollars
portfolio invested in the Asia-pacific region.
</P>
<P>
This new Fund will provide development capital for
infrastructure projects and for growing companies. The Prudential
Invest Direct Asia Fund will start off, at the beginning of 1997,
with an initial funding of 150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This new PIDA Fund is seen as meeting a number of Prudential's
key corporate objectives. Firstly, the new Fund serves to
underscore the Corporation's long-term commitment to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Fund is a natural extension of the Corporation's
investment strategy in Europe and in the United Kingdom where
Prudential is a leading player in the direct investment and
development capital market.
</P>
<P>
An official from Prudential said before launch of the new fund
that how fast the fund reaches the target would depend on how fast
the corporation can locate suitable investment projects.
</P>
<P>
What proportion of the one billion U.S dollars China receives
would depend on the number of Chinese projects available and the
attractiveness of the rate of return, the official added.

KUWAIT CITY, November 13 (Xinhua)-- The six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) decided today to triple the number of
the Peninsula Shield troops stationed in northern Saudi Arabia
from the present 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the end of a two-day GCC defense
ministers' conference in Saudi Arabian capital city of Riyadh. GCC
groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar
and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed to set up military representation

to establish an early warning system aimed at covering their
countries, Kuwait News Agency reported from Riyadh where the GCC
headquarters is based.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the meeting underlined the importance
of stability in the GCC states based on common interests and
non-interference in internal affairs of other member states.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also called on Iraq to implement U.N. Security
Council resolutions, particularly the one related to the release
of Kuwaiti prisons of wars, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session Tuesday, Omani Defense Minister Badr Bin

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Committed to Develop Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Minister for Energy
and Minerals, William Shija, said today the Tanzanian government
is committed to develop the mining sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister said this in Arusha, Northern Tanzania, while
opening a three-day mineral sector development strategy workshop.
</P>
<P>
He said the artisanal and small-scale mining sub-sector is
currently contributing more than 74 percent of the mining sector's
share to the economy and hence calling for every reason to promote it.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, the mineral exports of the country rose from
15.8 million U.S. Dollars in 1989 to 53.2 million U.S. Dollars in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The labor involved in the sub-sector rose from 100,000 people
in 1989 to 550,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shija said, however, that the artisanal and small-scale miners
are working under very poor condition, using crude tools and
rudimentary technology with no defined and organised marketing
structure.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on the attendants of the workshop to
formulate strong but practical strategies to promote the sector
and harmonise its activities with those of other stake holders.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that in the process of promoting the sector
the government would not engage directly in commerical mining.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which was sponsored by the World Bank, is
expected to deliberate seriously on the draft paper on mineral
policies in Tanzania. enditem

LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the west african
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, today called on the
international community to help in the repair of grounded
equipment for peacekeeping operations in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Most of the equipment brought into Liberia by various
continents involved in the peacekeeping mission are grounded due
to lack of spares, said ECOMOG Commander Victor Malu in a meeting
with Bruin Brewer, the European Commission Representative in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to Major-General Malu, such support would also
enable ECOMOG to maintain its ships and helicopers to enhance its
effectiveness during the disarmament phase of the Abuja Peace
Plan which was signed by Liberia's warring factions last August.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament and demobilization of the factions and
repatriation of combatants, the displaced and refugees are
scheduled to be carried out from November 22 this year to the end
of Januray next year.
</P>
<P>
The three-month demobilization program would start on schedule
despite the cynicism of some of the non-governmental
organizations involved in the distribution of relief materials in
Liberia, Malu said. enditem

ADDIS ABABA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children Fund (UNICEF) has launched a greeting cards sales
campaign here to promote and support programs that enhance the
survival, protection and development of Ethiopia's children.
</P>
<P>
Launching the campaign Tuesday, UNICEF representative in
Ethiopia Jan Van Manew said UNICEF has seen child survival
revolution that has helped save and improve the lives of
literally millions of children over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
This has been attained through working with governments,
international agencies and non-governmental organizations, as
well as with private companies, Manew said.
</P>
<P>
He said because the UNICEF is funded entirely by voluntary
contributions, the financial support of private individuals is
critically important.
</P>
<P>
Manew disclosed that over 700 million U.S. Dollars have been
raised since the sale of UNICEF greeting cards and products which
started in 1949.
</P>
<P>
These funds have helped immunize tens of million of children
against killer childhood diseases and helped provide life-saving
oral rehydration therapy to countless others, he noted.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Environmental Program (UNEP) has called for a new strategy of
"increasing food production in a sustainable fashion" for both
poverty alleviation and environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
A news release available here today said that as the ongoing
World Food Summit in Rome, Italy, adopts policies and a plan of
action, environmental and natural resource consideration must
occupy a central place in the proposed measures.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that chronic undernutrition faced by more
than 800 million people in developing countries and rapid
population growth required speedy increases in food production.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that pushing against resources limits
to increase food production could damage the environment in many
ways.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted UNEP Executive Director Elizabeth

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Closer to Seal Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has postponed his scheduled departure for the
United States tonight, giving indication that Israelis and the
Palestinians are closer to conclude an agreement on the
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had been scheduled to leave here for Seattle tonight
to address the annual assembly of North American Jewish
Federations.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Television report this evening,
Netanyahu made the decision following a meeting with Palestinian
chief negotiator Mahmoud Abbas in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been holding
discussions throughout the day on Israeli troops' redeployment in
the West Bank town of Hebron, in a last-ditch effort to work out
an agreement over Hebron by tonight.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said that Netanyahu was ready to meet a key
Palestinian demand and issue a written pledge to honor all
agreements between the two sides, including further withdrawals
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli side is reportedly demanding
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat to also issue
a written letter, reassuring his commitment to change the
Palestinian Covenant which calls for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Top Israeli and the Palestinian negotiators are due to resume
their talks tonight at U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk's residence
in northeast of Tel Aviv, following their overnight meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak is to head the
Israeli negotiating team to the talks, and the Palestinian side
will be led by Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said Tuesday that an agreement is very
close and would be almost certain to be reached this week.
</P>
<P>
Levy even hinted that a signing ceremony would be held at the
Erez checkpoint, between Israel and the Gaza Strip, with
Netanyahu and Arafat and U.S. Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross
to participate.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, Israeli army was originally
supposed to complete its redeployment in the Hebron area by
March 28, pulling back from approximately 80 percent of the
town.
</P>
<P>
However, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres delayed
the redeployment, following a series of suicide bombing attacks
in Israel last February and March.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the previous Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the May
29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
But Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Netanyahu in the
elections, said afterward that he would leave the decision of
the redeployment to the new government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, with some
450 Jewish settlers now living in the center of Hebron, while
more than 120,000 Palestinian residents inhabiting most of the
other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Israel and the PA started a new round of
continuous talks on the redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Israel insisted on changes in the security
arrangements stipulated in the Oslo accords, in light of the
violent confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in September.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes triggered by Israel's opening of the
Hasmonean Tunnel in Jerusalem's Old City, more than 70 people
were killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontations,
U.S. President Bill Clinton called for an emergency summit in
Washington to resuscitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israelis and the
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock talks, in an attempt
to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
However, after four weeks of continuous talks, with the
participation of Ross and other U.S. officials, the Israelis and
the Palestinians failed to complete a deal on the Hebron
redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks With Venezuelan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng and Venezuelan President Rafael Calder shared views in their
talks here today that there exists great potential for
strengthening economic and trade cooperation between their two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Calder extended his welcome to Chinese
entrepreneurs to invest in Venezuela, which he said boasts an
advantage in petroleum production.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese market is a huge market and there exists
great potential for increasing Venezuelan-Chinese cooperation in
the field of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Li Peng said Sino-Venezuelan cooperation in the
field of petroleum is of long-term, major significance to the
development of economic and trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said his current visit to Venezuela is aimed partly at
seeking new ways of cooperation with the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that economic and trade cooperation
between the two countries will gain greater development through
joint efforts in strengthening their cooperation in the field of
energy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also said the current level of bilateral
economic and trade cooperation does not suit the economic strength
of the two countries and their good political relations, despite
the development of trade ties in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government takes an enthusiastic attitude
toward the development of bilateral economic, trade and
technological cooperation. Enterprises in China are
interested in cooperation with their counterparts in Venezuela in
the fields of mining industry, agriculture, forestry, animal
husbandry and fishery, he added.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Blames Both Bosnian Sides for Gajevi Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nato-led Implementation
Force (IFOR) on Wednesday blamed both Muslims and Serbs for a
violent clash in northeastern Bosnia, which killed one and wounded
two.
</P>
<P>
the incident happened on Tuesday morning at the village of
Gajevi, which was a former war-damaged Muslim village and sits on
the the Serb republic side of the Zone of Separation (ZOS), an
IFOR-patrolled inter-entity boundary area of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
According to IFOR spokesman Major Brett Boudreau, a fighting
with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades broke out
when Serb police started to "sweep" the village of Muslim displaced
persons who arrived the day before from the Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
Citing IFOR eyewitness reports, Boudreau said that the first
round of shots were fired from the Muslim side and in the fighting,
one Muslim was killed and two Serb policemen wounded.
</P>
<P>
IFOR troops, Russian and American, moved into the village to
separate the two fighting groups after the incident and later
confiscated automatic weapons from both sides.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction of Serb police was tragic and unacceptable. By
bringing long-bear weapons to the ZOS, they violated the rule,"
Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
But the IFOR spokesman criticized the Muslim side in even
harsher words.
</P>
<P>
"The initial move by the Bosnians (Muslims) were also
provocative...their move was not orderly, a large number of people
armed, proceeded without the approval" from an international
commission on the refugee returns and "IFOR strongly condemns this
unauthorized incursion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some men of military age with automatic weapons and the chief of
staff of a Muslim army brigade were spotted among the hundreds of
the Muslims in the Gajevi area, Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
Colum Murphy, spokesman for the Office of High Representative
which is charge of implementing the Dayton agreement said that
because the Muslim side violated the procedures of returning
refugee, the process of approving applications for return to ZOS
has been suspended.
</P>
<P>
However, these Muslims who had returned to Gajevi without
approval apparently acted out of concerns at the continued
destruction of their former villages in ZOS, a UN humanitarian
official said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, because Muslims were allowed to return to ZOS, there
were numerous reports of leveling abandoned houses of Muslims
with explosives and mines, which was suspected of being done by
Serbs to prevent the return of refugees.

<HEADLINE> US to Participate in Zaire Relief Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
send about 5,000 troops to Central Africa to take part in an
international relief operation in eastern Zaire, the White House
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Press secretary Mike McCurry said the American troops will be
under U.S. command, although the operation will be run by a
Canadian.
</P>
<P>
He said National Security Adviser Tomy Lake met with a
high-ranking Canadian delegation Tuesday and the parties agreed on
a series of conditions for the U.S. participation in the
humanitarian intervention. These conditions include:
</P>
<P>
-- The mission will last about four months. But then the U.S.
will examine whether more time or troops are needed to keep the
situation from exploding again;
</P>
<P>
-- The international force will have "very robust rules of
engagement;"
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. mission will not include disarming militants or
forcing entry in Zaire; and
</P>
<P>
-- The cost of the mission will be borne by participating
states.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry said U.S. troops will provide
security at the Goma airport and along a three-mile corridor
from the airport into Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The force would be anchored by infantry troops, who would also
have assault helicopters assigned to the units, Perry said.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Deal Very Near: Israeli Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister Dan
Meridor said today that an agreement on Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron is "very near."
</P>
<P>
Meridor told a news conference on the sidelines of the
ongoing third Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
conference that he thought the gap between the two sides was not
big.
</P>
<P>
He added that he held talks with U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross
and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Wednesday to discuss ways
to push forward the peace process, including the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
"I do think that we are very close, very near to an
agreement. I think the gap is not wide, a decision has to be
made. And I very much want it to be made quickly," Meridor said.
</P>
<P>
He repeated Israel's allegation that a deal had in fact
already been made and was only waiting for the greenlight from the
Palestinian Authority (PA) to sign it. He said good will was
needed now rather than holding new talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports expected that Israel and the PA could sign the
Hebron agreement Wednesday night. But the talks broke off at about
2 a.m. Thursday and are to resume later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have completed the Hebron redeployment by the
end of March, but has frozen the plan since late February after
a series of terrorist attacks killed 58 people inside the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
The new Likud government which took power in June has adopted
hardline policies and demanded security changes in carrying out
the signed agreement on the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
After the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed in late September in
which 70 people were killed, the two sides resumed talks under the
mediation of the U.S., on carrying out the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
So far the signing of a deal has been postponed several times
due to the sticking point of Israel's demand to chase Palestinian
suspects in the Palestinian-controlled areas after its troop
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Meridor added that after the Hebron redeployment, Israel would
carry out further redeployment stipulated in the Oslo accords and
conduct further negotiations with the PA on "most difficult and
sensitive issues" on the final settlement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks, which cover the most sensitive issues
of the final status of Jerusalem, the Palestinian self-rule areas
and release of Palestinian prisoners, began in last May but have
been frozen indefinitely. Under the Oslo accords, the talks should
be wrapped up by May 1999 at the end of interim period of
self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Meridor predicted the difficult task ahead for the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
"In general basis, there are maybe gaps and differences of
opinion between us and the Palestinians on lots of issues,
especially regarding security on one hand and the final status on
another," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister claimed Israel would proceed forward
the peace process and would explore ways of easing the
Palestinian economic difficulties resulting in Israel's
protracted closure of the Palestinian areas.

<HEADLINE> NATO Welcomes Spain's Decision to Move Closer to It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Secretary General Javier Solana today welcomed
the vote by the Spanish parliament endorsing the government's
decision to move closer to a reformed NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government earlier decided to participate fully in
the renovated alliance and to take the necessary steps for Spain's
full participation in the new allied military structure.
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly gratifying that this decision was endorsed
by such a large majority," Solana said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He called the parliament's decision "a timely one," noting that
the alliance and its structures had already been greatly changed
to take account of the dramatic developments in European security
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in the process of making further far-reaching
adaptations to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief expressed his belief that "Spain's participation
in the new structure will enable her to play her full part in
reshaping the alliance to meet the challenge of tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Spain, which joined the alliance in 1982, had refused to be
part of NATO's integrated military command.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who promised to do as much
during his election campaign earlier this year, has long believed
that the country's participation in the alliance should be
developed to the maximum limit.

<HEADLINE> Li Tieying Meets Euro Vice President and Japanese Politician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- One of the European Union's
top commissioners said in Beijing today that the EU accepts
China's presentation for joining the World Trade Organisation.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom's Sir Leon Brittan, who is Vice President of
the European Commission, expressed the support during a meeting
with Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying.
</P>
<P>
Li and Sir Leon exchanged wide-ranging views on economic
cooperation, as well as China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission for
Restructuring Economy, told Sir Leon, who was in Beijing to attend
China Summit '96, that China is a developing country which lags
behind the advanced countries in economic development.
</P>
<P>
He told the former British cabinet minister that in China there
is still a population of 65 million living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Li added that China has made great headway in both economic
development and in the restructuring of its economic system since
it launched the reform and opening-up drive 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The state councillor said that China's restructuring of its
economic system has proceeded from the country's actual
conditions, which has at the same time drawn from the good
experiences of the international market economy.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Li added, China's market operation mechanism, as
well as the laws and codes it has adopted, are basically in
keeping with those of the international community, but things need
to be improved in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon said that the European Union agrees with the
presentation by China on joining the World Trade Organization,
adding that he appreciates the achievements China has made in the
economic development, saying that the EU is ready to offer help if
needed.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and the EU have conducted cooperation over a
series of important projects, adding that there is huge potential
for continuing such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese State Councillor also met Toshiki Kaifu, former
Japanese Prime Minister, today. They exchanged views on the
current developments in Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
They held unanimously that China and Japan should be friendly
from generation to generation, which conforms to the fundamental
interests of both Chinese and Japanese people, as well as to the
interests of the people all over the world.

<HEADLINE> Banks Punished for Unauthorized Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Two banks were punished today
in China for illegally extending loans to securities companies for
stock subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the two banks, the Hefei branch of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and the Jinan
branch of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation
(CITIC) were either removed or administratively warned for
unauthorized lending activities.
</P>
<P>
The borrowers will also receive a harsh rap from China's
securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission
(CSRC), for purchasing newly-issued stocks with funds under the
accounts of the stock subscribers.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC's Hefei branch was accused of extending nearly 12
billion yuan in loans to 15 securities companies from the frozen
accounts of stock subscribers of a newly-listed winery in
September. More than 35 billion yuan of stocks were then reported
to be subscribed for the winery, instead of the actual 24.3
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement of funds was also found in the Jinan branch of
the CITIC, which lent 4.8 billion yuan from the frozen accounts of
the stock subscribers of a diesel machinery company, to six
securities companies to subscribe for more of the stock,
increasing the value of the stocks subscribed from the 14.583
billion yuan to a false 19.383 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The misuse of frozen funds should be combated firmly, because
it severely harms the interests of the stock investors, and may
cause disorder in the issuance of new stocks," said a CSRC
official.
</P>
<P>
The president of any bank with such irregularity will be
removed, and administratively punished, according to a
newly-passed resolution of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
An editorial to be carried in tomorrow's People's Daily says
the punishments against the two bank branches demonstrate the
determination of the state to further strengthen the supervision
and management of the banking and securities markets, and
safeguard normal economic order and the interests of investors.

BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China is to stage two concerts
in mid-December to usher in 1997, the Ministry of Culture has
announced.
</P>
<P>
The concerts will be given by Chinese musicians who have won
prizes in international competitions, and who are considered a
showcase to display China's achievements in reviving serious arts,
such as symphonies and opera.
</P>
<P>
The performers include Liao Changyong, who won top prize in a
music competition in France this year, and Li Xiaoliang, the only
Chinese musician to reach the final round of the Munich music
competition and win a prize in the past 45 years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese artists have won 23 prizes in international
competitions, demonstrating that China's economy is getting
stronger, and culture is becoming more prosperous, according to
some reports.
</P>
<P>
Regular exchanges with foreign artistic circles is not only
helping Chinese culture to be seen overseas, but also allows the
Chinese to learn from foreign arts, officials at the culture
ministry maintained.
</P>
<P>
Box-office receipts from the concerts will be donated to aid
girls of school age who have dropped out of campuses because of
poverty, the official said.

HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A new research report
released today by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC)
said the next wave of foreign direct investment in China is
expected to take place in the inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
The report said this is a result of China's efforts to narrow

Given the rich natural resources and increased investment
incentives in these regions, Hong Kong companies which target the
Chinese mainland's domestic market may consider going further into
 the hinterland, it said.

<P>
In 1995, foreign direct investment in central provinces grew by
 27.2 percent, much higher than the national average growth rate

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Praises Deal With IMF on Standby Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's caretaker
government today announced the "successful conclusion" of an
agreement on standby loans with the mission of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) here.
</P>
<P>
"The fund mission would recommend to the Board larger resources
under the Standby Arrangement than the one previously agreed,"
Shahid Javed Burki, advisor to the prime minister on finance and
economic affairs, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government and the IMF reached an agreement in
October last year with IMF agreeing to provide a
600-million-U.S.-dollar standby loan.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF withheld the second and third tranches of the
loan early this year on the ground that Pakistan's economic
performance was not satisfactory and Pakistani authorities were
doctoring economic figures.
</P>
<P>
"The draft agreement that had already been reached on measures
announced on October 22 was confirmed and the funds would be
released soon after the Board's approval," said Burki.
</P>
<P>
After two rounds of talks with the IMF, Pakistan announced a
40-billion-rupee (1 billion U.S. dollars) economic reform package
on October 22 to meet the IMF conditions for the release of the
withheld loan of 160 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Burki held a number of meetings with IMF Chief Paul Chabrier
who arrived in Islamabad on Wednesday to take over leadership of
the fund mission in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Burki said the discussion with the IMF mission was "extremely
successful" and the agreement was satisfactorily concluded as the
mission was very pleased with the reform measures taken by the
Pakistani government.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Leader Hails China's Localization Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- German-based auto giant
Volkswagen is to help put China's car export market on the road to
success by introducing new models in the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
And high ranking Volkswagen official Dr. Martin Posth predicted
today that China would soon be building and exporting world-class
cars.
</P>
<P>
Dr Posth, Chairman and President of Volkswagen Asia-Pacific
Limited, pledged his full support to China's policy of speeding up
localization in its car manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at Volkswagen Supplier Quality
Symposium '96, held today in the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Only localization can help reduce production costs as well as
car prices in the local market," said Dr. Posth, who is also a
member of management board of Germany-based Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Posth, Santana cars made by Shanghai
Volkswagen are over 90 percent localized, while Jetta and
Audi200V6 cars manufactured by First Automotive Works (FAW) in
Changchun, capital of northeastern Jilin Province, compose of over
75 percent and over 40 percent local parts, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Such high localization rates for the cars have been achieved on
the basis of tough quality control, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He denied there is any connection between the localization
policy and quality problems related to Chinese-made Santana and
Jetta models.
</P>
<P>
"Because the two cars are of an older type, designed 10 years
ago," he explained, " and problems were found in the original
designs that has nothing to do with local suppliers in China."
</P>
<P>
Santana and Jetta cars manufactured outside China have also had
similar problems, he stressed, adding that the company has been
trying hard to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
"I believe China will be able to produce and export world-class
cars," he said," and to achieve that goals, we will introduce some
new types of cars into China in near future."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of quality control, saying that
without good quality, there will be no export market for China's
automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Posth, the output of Santana, Jetta and Audi
cars is expected to top 240,000 in China by the end of this year,
up 20 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Volkswagen alone is expected to turn out some 200,000
Santanas this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil's automotive has failed to achieve localization in the
past 25 years, but China has achieved it in a mere 10 years," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Volkswagen will start any new cooperative projects
with China, Dr. Posth said, "It just depends on the development of
China's automotive market."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, Director of Automotive Department of Ministry of
Machinery, told Xinhua exclusively before the news briefing that
the Chinese government has attached importance to Volkswagen's
efforts to improve production and quality in China.
</P>
<P>
"Volkswagen are now taking the lion's share in the country's
automotive industry, so what they do is important," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Shanghai Volkswagen seems to be in a more comfortable
state than FAW Volkswagen, Zhang said, "It is not that Shanghai
Volkswagen is doing better than FAW Volkswagen. They were set
up in different times, and have met different opportunities."
</P>
<P>
He referred to preferential policies granted by the state to
Shanghai Volkswagen when it started 10 years, such as refunding of
20,000 yuan from the sale of each Santana to the manufacturer as
an official support, while FAW did not got such an incentive.
</P>
<P>
FAW, which was set up two years ago, is still young and needs
time to catch up, he said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to make any comment on the current sluggish
automotive market in the country, saying it should be tackled by
car manufacturers themselves.

<HEADLINE> China Summit '96 Closes With Fruitful Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The two-day China Summit '96
ended today, after reaching wide-ranging consensus on the economic
issues of common concern between different countries.
</P>
<P>
Entensive discussions and exchanges have been conducted at the
Beijing summit around the theme, "China marching toward the 21st
century, and the common prosperity of the world economy".
</P>
<P>
The participants shared the view that with globalization of
economic development, interdependence between different countries
is deepening. To achieve common development in the 21st century,
countries all over the world should join hands to set up a new
world economic order-- that was the call from the summit.
</P>
<P>
A view shared by all representatives at the summit was that
"sustainable development" is a common goal and task confronting
every country.
</P>
<P>
All the governments feel sternly the importance of giving
strategic consideration to the issues of population, environment,
education, scientific and technological progress.
</P>
<P>
They held that disparities existing in economic development
between different countries and regions are unfair, and constitute
a major factor affecting world stability.
</P>
<P>
It is a common responsibility of countries to alleviate poverty
in underdeveloped countries. China is committed to alleviating
poverty and achieving balanced regional economic development
within its own territories, which itself will contribute much to
the stability and common prosperity of the world.
</P>
<P>
The summit participants held identical views that a strong and
prosperous China will never constitute a threat to any country and
region, but instead will grow into a driving force to help boost
the process of peace, progress and prosperity in the world. China
and the international community are interdependent, neither of
which can dispense with the other. It is unfair to exclude China
from the World Trade Organization, and the situation should be
changed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The summit reached unanimity that the long-term stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong constitutes an important part of common
prosperity of the world. China's resumption of the exercise of its
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 is a matter attracting
worldwide attention. It is totally correct for China to adopt the
policy of "one country, two systems".

<HEADLINE> Senaka's 100th One-Man Paint Exhibition opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 14 (Xinhua)-- The 100th one-man paint and
sculpture exhibition of Senaka Senanayke, an internationally known
Sri Lankan painter and sculptor, was opened by Lakshman Jayakody,
Minister of Cultural and Religious Affairs, here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike was also present at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition consists of 300 paintings covering different
stages of his artistic career and are in pastel colors, water
colors, grease and oil paintings.
</P>
<P>
His canvases are filled with animals, butterflies and birds
drawn and painted in bright colors showing them in motion. There
are paintings depicting paddy fields, landscapes, girls and men at
work displaying a panorama of human activity.
</P>
<P>
Senaka is well-known at home and abroad as one who brought much
fame for his artistic works.
</P>
<P>
He exhibited his paintings for the first time in 1959 when he
was seven years old. Since then his paintings have been
continually exhibited on invitation from recognized art
institutions. He has held 99 one-man exhibitions in over 20
countries and regions including China.
</P>
<P>
Places in which his works are admired and exhibited include the
United Nations Building in New York; the White house; National
Geographic Society Buildings in Washington; the International Post
Office in Berne; the Berlin State Museum; the Lidice Museum; the
Norfolk Museum and in several art institutions and private
collection abroad.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, his paintings adorn the new Parliament buildings,
the President's House and major public buildings and five-star
hotels.
</P>
<P>
Having graduated from Yale University of America in 1972, he
returned to Sri Lanka to continue painting. His creative impulses
owe their origin to Buddhist legend and tradition and the beauty
of the flora and fauna of his motherland.
</P>
<P>
Senaka was awarded an Oscar as one of the ten outstanding young
people of the world by the Jaycee International in 1983 for his
contribution to the advancement of art in his country and the
world.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Raids Muslim Brigade Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led Implementation Force
(IFOR) Thursday raided the headquarters of a Muslim army brigade
in northeastern Bosnia for its involvement in a bloody clash
between Muslim refugees and Serb police.
</P>
<P>
IFOR troops searched the headquarters in Celic of the 254th
brigade of the Bosnian-Herzegovina Army for four hours this
morning and confiscated about 10 tons of ammunition and hundreds
of AK-47 automatic rifles, said Major Brett Boudreau, a spokesman
for IFOR.
</P>
<P>
Celic was to the west of Gajevi, a village on the Serb side of
the Zone of Separation (ZOS), where Muslim refugees and Serb
police clashed on Tuesday, killing one Muslim and wounding several
others.
</P>
<P>
Boudreau blamed the brigade commanders for provoking the Gajevi
incident by providing automatic weapons and military communication
equipment to Muslim refugees. The brigade's chief of staff was
seen instigating refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
IFOR had also searched a Serb police station in Koraj to
confiscate weapons used illegally in the Gajevi clash, Boudreau
said. Details on the search was still not available.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent further incidents, IFOR has decided to
create a temporary weapons exclusion zone covering 35 square
kilometers around Celic, which will take effect on Saturday,
Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, the headquarters of the 254th brigade would be
closed and have to look for new housing place outside of the zone,
the IFOR spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister Dan
Meridor said today that an agreement on Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron is "very near."
</P>
<P>
Meridor told a news conference on the sidelines of the third
Middles East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference that he
thought the gap between the two sides was not big.
</P>
<P>
He added that he held talks with U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross
and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Wednesday to discuss
the peace process, including the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
He repeated Israel's allegation that a deal had in fact been
made and was only waiting for the green light from the Palestinian
Authority (PA) to sign it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Israel and the PA could sign the
Hebron agreement Wednesday night because Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu canceled his scheduled visit to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
However, no announcement has been made so far. Meridor
declined to reveal if such a deal could be announced today
before the MENA conference concluded.

<P>
BANGKON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The voter turnout in Bangkok
at Sunday's general election may fall short of expectations
because of flooding, according to Bangkok officials.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high tide of the sea, the water level in the
Chao Phraya River, which runs through Bangkok, will gradually rise
from today and hit its peak tomorrow and Saturday before gradually
receding on the election day.
</P>
<P>
The situation could be as bad as late last month when most
riverside districts in the capital were knee-deep in water,
according to Mana Nopphan, the city's director of sewerage and
drainage.
</P>
<P>
The peak will be about 2.1 meters above mean sea level, falling
to 1.97 meters on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, slum dwellers in the capital are not eligible to
vote, as they do not have house registration documents.
</P>
<P>
About 250 protesters representing a total of 1,000 families in
six slum communities in the capital gathered at city hall
Wednesday, demanding household registration papers.

MOGADISHU, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The sister of Osman Hassan
Ali Atto, one of Somalia's main faction leaders, was kidnaped
today in south Mogadishu by unknown gunmen while clan fighting
was still going on in the war-torn city.
</P>
<P>
Atto's spokesman hinted that the abduction of Ms. Halima
Hassan Ali, 53, was a "political-motivated action" conducted by
militiamen loyal to Atto's rival, Hussein Mohamed Aidid. However,
he failed to produce evidence, saying investigation is still
going on to find out about the abductors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said eight armed men driving two cars chased a
car which Ms. Halima was traveling on this morning and kidnaped
Ms. Halima with force.
</P>
<P>
So far, the whereabouts of Ms. Halima was not yet known. But
according to her relatives, she was trying to cross the green
line to North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that the close relatives of the

<HEADLINE> China Prepares to Draft New Rules on Vehicle Emission Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China has begun research on
its strategy for controlling motor vehicle emission, aided by a
2.55 million US dollars loan from the World Bank, an official of
the State Bureau for Environmental Protection said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new research program, jointly launched by the State Science
and Technology Commission and the State Bureau for Environmental
Protection, will provide scientific and technological support to

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Greek Cypriots Shows Restraint in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriots have
shown restraint in protest against Turkish occupation on the eve
of the 13th anniversary of the founding of the breakaway state
"the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared independence in
November 15, 1983, which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot students have traditionally staged their
demonstrations on November 15 near the Ledra Palace for the last
12 years.
</P>
<P>
However, they have been urged to stage this year's
demonstration away from the U.N. buffer zone for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
A police statement said that the student representatives have
agreed to stage their peace demonstrations, scheduled for Friday,
at the capital's central Eleftheria square and not at the Ledra
Palace checkpoint as originally planned, to avoid the
possibility of incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Ledra Palace checkpoint is the only place through which
tourists can cross over from the government-controlled southern
areas to the Turkish-controlled northern areas.
</P>
<P>
There has been tension recently at the Ledra Palace
checkpoint following a group of Greek Cypriots staged sit-in
protests, dissuading foreign tourists from visiting the north
and spending money there.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Turkish Cypriot side closed the Ledra Palace
checkpoint for 24 hours in retaliation for the Greek Cypriots'
protest, barring the enclaved Greek Cypriots from returning to
their homes in the north. Then the checkpoint was reopened after
the U.N. intervention.
</P>
<P>
But when MP Marios Matsakis, who heads the protesting group,
announced the protest campaign would be carried out on a daily
basis as of Monday, the Turkish Cypriot side decided to cancel
all bi-communal activities at the Ledra Palace.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to dissuade tourists from crossing has been
going on every weekend for the past month, but was stepped up
Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government and the
U.N. have expressed disagreement over the protest at the Ledra
Palace checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Cyprus police intervened for the first time
asking the protesters to move back 50 meters from the actual
checkpoint to allow those tourists who wished to cross to do so.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Glafcos Xenos said Wednesday that the main
reason for police to do so was that they received information
that Turkish snipers could open fire on any students protesting
at the Ledra Palace checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ministry of Education has decided to close the
schools adjacent to the Green Line in a bid to avoid any
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides, in a scheduled TV broadcast
today, is expected to appeal for restraint at Friday's
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, about 150 black-clad students from University
of Cyprus held a peaceful candle-lit march to the Ledra Palace
checkpoint to honor the memories of two Greek Cypriots killed
in the buffer zone during August protests.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, four unarmed Greek Cypriots have been
killed and a Turkish soldier was mysteriously murdered in the
buffer zone, thus increasing tension along the 180-kilometer-long
demarcation line dividing Cyprus since Turkish invasion in 1974.

<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Fire deaths and injuries in
China, and financial losses caused by fires, have all dropped so
far this year compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A senior official at the Ministry of Public Security revealed
today that during the January-October period, over 28,000 fires
were reported across the country, resulting in 1,400 deaths and
2,4000 injuries, as well as 700 million yuan of direct economic
loss.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the decline to efforts made by
governments and fire control departments at all levels since the
beginning of the year. Better fire fighting facilities, and
strengthened fire fighting training also played an important role.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman also pointed out that as the November-April
period is usually when higher numbers of fires occur, fire
fighting control departments at all levels should pay great
attention, and take effective measures to prevent serious
conflagrations.

<HEADLINE> Fossils indicate birds did not come from dinosaurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Fossils bought from a Chinese
peasant farmer for less than four dollars has exploded the long
held belief that modern birds evolved from the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have examined new fossils, unearthed in
northeastern China, and say they indicate that the ancestor of
modern birds did not come from dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hou Lianhai, a research professor at the Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, today published his
findings in a research paper, co-authored with Chinese and
American colleagues. The report appears in Science, the
international scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
Scientists named the newly-discovered Jurassic fossil bird,
which is dated 140 million years old and found at a site in
Beipiao, Liaoning Province, as Liaoningornis.
</P>
<P>
"The Jurassic bird looks like today's kingfisher which is a
small bird inhabiting the Yangtze River valley," said Professor
Hou who bought the fossils from a local farmer for just 30 yuan
(3.5 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The bird shares advanced characteristics with flying birds,
such as having big and long claws and well-developed wings," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The fossils from Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous birds seem
to counter the theory that dinosaurs gave rise to birds,"
Professor Hou noted. "The fossils may indicate a long avian
history in Jurassic and older beds," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This challenges one of the most obvious riddles facing the
theory of the dinosaurian origin of birds," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The dinosaurs thought to be most bird-like are primary Late
Cretaceous in age, 76 million years younger than the oldest bird
fossil found so far," the Science magazine commented, "the new
fossils from China appear to indicate that an early separation of
the avian line gave rise to modern birds." enditem.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani President Pledges to Improve Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari said today that the caretaker government shall follow a
clear-cut economic policy to rectify the country's economic
situation in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government's size needs to be reduced, all unnecessary
expenditure in the public and private sectors cut down and the
banking sector streamlined to improve the country's economic
management, Leghari told Paul Chabrier, director of the Middle
Eastern Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who
called on him at the Presidential House here.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the need to reform and overhaul the taxation
structure and system to ensure better revenue and tax collection.
</P>
<P>
He said the interim government shall be restructuring financial
institutions to improve their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
About the agricultural tax, the president expressed the belief
that wherever income is generated, tax must be paid.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the IMF and other international financial
institutions for their assistance and support for Pakistan's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Chabrier told the president that the visiting IMF team had very
useful and satisfactory discussions with the new economic team of
the interim government.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to quickly put the country's financial
institutions in order to restore the confidence of business,
investors and international institutions.
</P>
<P>
He assured the president of all possible assistance and support
of the IMF.
</P>

<P>
The IMF is expected soon to release the withheld 160 million
U.S. dollars standby loans to Pakistan due in March and June this

<HEADLINE> Expert: MENA Regional Economic Community Will </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Creating a Middle East and
North Africa economic community will benefit all the people in
the region, according to a leading American academic here today.
</P>
<P>
Jerry M. Rosenberg, Director at the Center for Middle East
and North Africa Business Studies, said that the 20 or more
nations of the region share common cultures, needs and
expectations that are far greater than their differences.
</P>
<P>
Any failure of regional integration will bring back the
problem it was originally planned to be resolved, he said in
reference to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the stalled Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an executive summary of his research released at the third
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference (MENA Three),
the expert presented a blueprint for the region in terms of
common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic community should be established on the
basis of mutual respect and trust, which is achievable through
economic cooperation, the glue of interdependence.
</P>
<P>
The MENA Three has witnessed statements by political leaders,
business talks, thematic sessions, industry workshops,
match-making negotiations and academic activities as well.
</P>
<P>
According to the thesis of Rosenberg, institutional structure
and governance in the region can commence with a
Jordanian-Israeli-Palestinian trade agreement, to be followed by
a Middle East free trade agreement to include Syria, Lebanon and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"With any combination of nations, the Middle East Community
(MEC) can be born," he said. "The final level, independent or
concurrent with MEC, would be the Middle East and North Africa
Free Trade Agreement, with potential membership from all
regional nations."
</P>
<P>
Although Rosenberg, who is also department chairman and
professor at the State University of Jew Jersey, painted a
blueprint for economic cooperation and integration in the MENA
region, political differences still constitute a hindrance.
</P>
<P>
At the plenary session earlier today, the Palestinian
delegation called for lifting the closure Israel has imposed on
the Palestinian territories, saying it is a collective
punishment that has had a devastating effect upon the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor, at another session
today, said that Israel imposed the closure due to "security
reasons."
</P>
<P>
Attending the MENA Three are more than 3,500 people,
including government officials, business leaders, international
financers and academics from some 90 countries and regions
across the world. The conference is to be concluded later
today.

<P>
HARARE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe believes southern Africa is still threatened with
political instability.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Zimbabweans based in Rome on Wednesday night,
President Mugabe cited two possible flash points, Angola and
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, Mugabe said former rebel UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
continued to disappoint regional efforts to bring him to a
face-to-face talk with President Eduardo dos Santos to iron out
their differfences.
</P>
<P>
"We invited him recently to Luanda but he did not come. He
said he was given short notice and that he did not know what
business was to be discussed," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
On Zambia, Mugabe said the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) leaders were not happy with President Frederick
Chiluba's decision to ban some opposition leaders, particularly
former president Kenneth Kaunda, from contesting the presidential
elections in the country scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president said he and other regional leaders intended to meet
Chiluba this week had it not been for the world food summit.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Not Optimistic About Imminent Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat said in Gaza today that he is not
optimistic about the prospect of an imminent agreement on
Hebron, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters that he is sorry for not achieving
progress during Wednesday's meeting between Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and PLO Secretary General Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader explained that no progress was made
because Israel was insisting on points the Palestinians could not
accept.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reiterated the Palestinian position that no change on
signed agreements is accepted, and called for their careful and
honest implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said that neither the PA nor the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) has the right to change anything related to
the signed agreements since they had received endorsement by the
88-member legislative Palestinian Council and the Palestinian
National Council.
</P>
<P>
He added that even the Israeli government has no right to
change agreements approved by the Israeli parliament Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour briefed the
Palestinian Council, now in session in Ramallah, on the latest
developments concerning the Hebron talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the negotiation had made no progress due to
Israel's insistence on its positions regarding issues of "hot
pursuit," arming of Palestinian police and reopening of
Al-Shouhadah Street.
</P>
<P>
The PC Political Committee praised the firm position of
Palestinian negotiators and recommended that the lawmakers
provide support for the negotiators by sponsoring popular
conferences in various cities under the slogan "Netanyahu
doesn't want peace."
</P>
<P>
The committee also suggested that envoys be sent to various
Arab and other foreign countries to brief their parliamentarians
on the Palestinian stand.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are scheduled to meet
again this evening in further efforts to remove the remaining
obstacles blocking a final agreement on Hebron.

<HEADLINE> China Allows Solely Foreign-Funded Power Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (xinhua) -- Foreign investors are to be
allowed to build solely foreign-funded power stations in China
with approval of the Chinese government, a high-ranking Chinese
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Shi Dazhen, Minister of Electric Power, said at China Summit
1996 that China's electricity market is huge, and China will
welcome foreign investors to join in its electricity industry
construction.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, China aims to make up a shortage of funding
and equipment and introduce advanced technology, by using foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
One fifth of the funds used in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000) in the sector will come from overseas, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past 15 years, China used 12.2
billion US dollars in foreign funding in its electricity
development, accounting for ten percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China will adopt various measures in the use of
foreign funds, such as using loans, issuing shares or bonds, and
cooperating with foreign investors in the building of power
stations and other upgrading projects.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that foreigners should choose the projects which
conform with the country's policy and have been listed in the
schemes of its electricity development.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his confidence on economic returns for
foreign investors, saying that so long as foreign investors
observe China's laws and regulations, and take a long-sighted
view, they are sure to make money in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the installed capacity of China's
power stations had reached 217 million kilowatts and its annually
generated electricity was 100 million kwh. The figures are
expected to reach 290 million kw and 140 million kwh respectively
by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Non-Oil Sector to Grow by 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has predicted an
annual five percent growth for Nigeria's non-oil sector in the
coming years if the current reforms are sustained.
</P>
<P>
In its report titled "Nigeria: Prospects for Development", the
bank said the manufacturing sector could double its share of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The report, expected to be released in the next few weeks,
praised the Nigeria's government policy of tight fiscal
discipline, the creation of a market-determined exchange rate and
the abolishing of interest rate ceiling.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that a consistent GDP surplus at around two to
three percent might be achieved through selective reduction in
expenditure, unification of exchange rate, greater public
accountability and transparency.
</P>
<P>
Other measures proposed by the World Bank include the
privatization of major state-run enterprises and a more effective
fertilizer distribution system to enhance agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's economy is highly dependent on the oil sector which
accounts for about 45 percent of its GDP value and 90 percent of
its exports.

<HEADLINE> Countries Around Caspian Sea Fail to Agree on Its Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The five countries around the
Caspian sea are far from an agreement on its status due to their
differences on the issue, Kazakh Vice Foreign Minister Viacheslav
Gizzatov said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gizzatov made the remarks at a news briefing after Tuesday's
meeting of the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, Russia,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Iran in Ashkhabad, capital of
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the countries failed to reach an agreement on the issue
despite some progress, and they should make compromise so as to
find a solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after the meeting admitted that it is
an urgent task for the countries to make more efforts and agree on
the status of the Caspian sea on the basis of consultation.
</P>
<P>
On the Caspian status, Russia holds that the sea should be
divided into two parts, with areas within 45 nautical miles of
each country to be controlled by each and the rest be jointly
developed by the five.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan insists that the Caspian including its surface and
underwater resources be divided into five parts.
</P>
<P>
However, Kazakhstan holds that the sea bed and the continental
shelf be divided into five parts while its surface be jointly used
by the five countries.
</P>
<P>
So far, the five countries have agreed to set up a special
group to further discuss this issue. The group, with vice foreign
ministers of the five as its members, will conduct its first
session next month here.
</P>
<P>
The five foreign ministers also plan to meet again in Moscow,
but the meeting time will be decided by the special group.
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the number of
countries around the Caspian sea increased from two to five with
each holding different positions on its status.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Ex-Presidents Faces Death, Life Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean prosecution today
insisted on its demand of death and life sentence to former
presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo at the Seoul High Court,
which is expected to bring in a verdict next month.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made at a hearing-concluding trial of Chun and
Roh, who appealed to the High Court after being sentenced to death
and 22-1/2 years imprisonment on charges of mutiny, treason and
bribery by the Seoul District Court in late August.
</P>
<P>
The district court also fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and
his successor Roh, 355 million dollars, for accumulating mammoth
slush fund from corporate pay-offs while in office.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stem from Chun and Roh's
masterminding the coup in December, 1979 which brought Chun to
power the next year, and the bloody suppression of a civil
uprising in Kwangju in southern South Korea in May, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh were the highest-ranking officials to appeal in
court in South Korean history and had been at the core of a
judicial controversy over a nation-wide campaign against
corruption since President Kim Young-sam took office in early
1993.

<HEADLINE> US, Cyprus Officials Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides today met with U.S. officials to discuss the efforts
toward a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Carey Cavanaugh, Director of the
U.S. State Department Office for Southern European Affairs,
described the discussion he had with President Clerides as
"useful," saying that "we looked at both efforts that can be
made to work on a comprehensive settlement and also improved
efforts that can be made in the near future to decrease
tension on the ground."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official expressed concern about the developments in
the past few months on the island and about "what may happen
in the upcoming few days".
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots will stage protest demonstrations Friday on
the occasion of 13th anniversary of the unilateral declaration of
"independence" of northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to see that in fact steps seem to have
been taken by all sides to help eliminate the prospects of
tension," the U.S. official noted.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh, who heads a team of U.S. high-ranking officials
that arrived here Wednesday night for talks on Cyprus, today
also held talks with Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh said during the talks they raised specific ideas
about the future security of the island, overall settlement
and concrete measures that can be done.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Michaelides said today's discussion concentrated
on two aspects, "the need to reduce tension and the substance
of the Cyprus problem. The whole thing is moving and I
expect that it will be accelerated as we move along."
</P>
<P>
Later in the day the American officials will cross into
the Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia for talks with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh said on his arrival Wednesday night that the
primary purpose of their visit here is to reinforce the
commitment of the U.S. administration to working on pursuing a
comprehensive Cyprus settlement.
</P>

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- India has decided to
purchase Sukhoi-30 long-range combat aircraft from Russia, an
Indian Defense Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The deal was approved by the Indian cabinet at a meeting
chaired by Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda on Wednesday night, he

</P>
<P>
The purchase was first taken up in April this year by the
previous Congress Party government led by Prime Minister P. V.
Narasimha Rao.
</P>

However, in view of the announcement of general elections Rao
left the final decision on the Sukhoi deal to the new government.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Gowda government to go ahead with the
purchase of the Sukhoi-30 multi-role warplanes comes on the heels

</P>
<P>
Some 300 ministers, experts and businessmen from 18 APEC member
economies as well as international organizations attended the

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
With reference to the main topic of the conference, "Creativity

<HEADLINE> Senior PNA Official Calls for End to Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) today called for an end
to the Israeli closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas to
facilitate the flow of people and goods.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation of the PNA, made the call while addressing the
participants of the third Middle East and North Africa
Economic Conference (MENA Three), which opened here Tuesday and
will end this evening.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Israeli closure, which was
imposed in March following a series of suicide bombing attacks
in Israel, has cost the Palestinians hundreds of millions of
dollars in income.
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinian workers are denied entry to Israel to find
jobs, making the daily life of the Palestinian people very
hard. The PNA has time and again appealed to the U.S., the
chief broker of the Middle East peace process, to pressure
Israel in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath said that the PNA had to earmark its already-tight
budget to subsidize the people due to the crippling closure.
</P>
<P>
"The closure has not only physical pressure, but also
psychological pressure upon our people," Sha'ath said.
</P>
<P>
He made a passionate call to the Israelis to "give free
access to the Palestinian people inside their territory, to
give Palestinian people free trade opportunities."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his optimism over the future of the
Palestinian endeavor to build an independent state, although it
is "contingent upon the pace of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have repeatedly called on the Israel to lift
the closure, but to no avail, especially after hardline Likud
Party leader Binyamin Netanyahu took power in June.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath also urged the donor countries to deliver their
promised aid to the PNA, which is now in enormous economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We have the commitment of 3 billion U.S. dollars, but so far
only about 1 billion dollars have been actually delivered," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from calling for the delivery of the long-awaited
economic aid, Sha'ath also asked the industrialized countries to
be actively involved in invigorating the Palestinian economic
through investment.
</P>
<P>
He said the PNA is trying to beef up the public sector
while encouraging the development of private sector so as to
bolster the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the donor countries scheduled for
November 20, the PNA will put forward its program to attract
investment and trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MENA Three has drawn more than 3,500 participants from
some 90 countries and regions across the world, including
delegations from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan,
Italy, Canada and China.

MACAO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to make a series of laws
from next year on to step up protection of intellectual property
rights (IPR), the local "Va Kio" newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The main targets of the protection include trade marks and patents
of industrial inventions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Certain laws and regulations will be made for the protection of

in the future when the customs is established.
</P>
<P>
As for a first step, the authority will enhance protection of trade
marks. Regulations concerning the independent registration of trade
marks in Macao will be made. Currently, the Portuguese law on
trade mark registration prevails in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Macao Economic Department say that the
protection of IPR will be extended to industrial inventions and
other property rights in the future.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the World Trade organization, Macao must abide by
the WTO's rules on the protection of intellectual property rights,"
the report quoted an official as saying. "Macao needs to translate
those rules into localized laws."

Wu admitted that China, as a developing country with opening up
and reforms for just more than ten years, has limited experience
in foreign trade compared with developed countries.
</P>
<P>
She said that China will pay close attention to the reform of
its import management system, and will open it wider to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
This will provide more opportunities and greater convenience
for foreign commodities and technology to enter China's market,
while protecting the country's fledgling industries, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
China will further lower its tariffs and decrease its
non-tariff measures following the tariff reduction on 4,000 types
of imported commodities, and cancellation of the control measures
on 176 kinds of imported commodities in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The opening up of the service trade will be accelerated on a
trial basis, she said.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the country will improve its legislature's
practices in order to help protect the interests of foreign
investors in China.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to crack down on illegal activities
uncovered in foreign trade, especially in the area of intellectual
property rights protection, and increase the level of protection
for intellectual property.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Experts Discuss Transfer of HK Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Experts on the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) met here today to discuss the transfer
of Hong Kong's files.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the meeting, Wang Weiyang, Chinese
representative on the JLG, said he was very glad that the two
sides sat together to discuss the transfer of Hong Kong's files,
for the matter is an important part of the transfer of the
political power.
</P>
<P>
He said that the transfer of Hong Kong's files is also an
important issue concerning China's resuming the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and the effective administration of the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
after 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side held that all of the Hong Kong's files should
be transferred to the Chinese government in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for Hong Kong's local files, the British government should
transfer them first to the Chinese government, and then the
Chinese government will authorize the HKSAR government to receive
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
In April 1990, the Chinese and British senior representatives
reached consensus on the transfer of files, laying down
stipulations in principle.
</P>
<P>
One year ago, the Chinese side suggested that the two sides
form an expert group to discuss the question.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will continue Friday.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 14 (Xinhua)-- Intelligence reports received
by security forces indicate that the liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) is planning massive attacks on civilian targets to
commemorate their "Heroes Week" which falls on November 20 to 27.
</P>
<P>
Consequent to the reports, security had been stepped up in
Colombo, where more road blocks and checking points manned by
security forces and police have been set up, police sources said
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that security forces also appealed to the
public to be on full alert.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE fighting for a separate state commemorates the Heroes
Week annually and it is believed that this year's commemoration is
meant also to coincide with the birthday of The LTTE leader
Velupillai Prabhakaran which falls on November 26.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE launched attacks on military installations, civilian
targets and state ventures during the Heroes Week in the past,
said the sources, adding that past experience and fresh
intelligence reports indicate that this year too, such places
would be targeted.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Colombo, the Eastern province has reportedly been
kept on high alert in view of the fact that some large scale LTTE
movements were noticed by the security forces during the past few
days.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Thatcher Optimistic About Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, former
British Prime Minister, said here today that she is "optimistic
about Hong Kong's future."
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the on-going China Summit 1996, she said that
"the fact is that the success of the transition is now in China's
hands, and in China's hands alone. Britain will do its duty so
long as the Union Jack flies over Hong Kong and interest in what
happens will last far beyond that."
</P>
<P>
"But," she added, "the future is China's to determine in
conjunction with the people of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
She said that she is "confident that China will get it right"
and she intends to be in Hong Kong to "experience" and to
"witness" next year's transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
She spoke highly of China's economic achievements, saying that
a great deal has already been done by Mr. Deng Xiaoping and his
successors to reform China's economy, and increase the role of the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
"It is plain that there have been many improvements in freedom
of speech, of information, of movement, of choice of occupation,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"We see elections at village level which are genuinely
contested, ... with a choice of candidates and much greater
information to enable people to exercise that choice," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that a rule of law has been introduced, which
enhanced civil, corporate and property rights. Meanwhile, the
criminal law is being revised and the rights of defendants
strengthened, she added.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thatcher said the only rational policy for the West to
pursue with China is that it is in western interest that China
should be open, stable, prosperous and a full partner in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"China has legitimate interests just as the rest of us do, and
is entitled to be treated with respect and consistency, in
accordance with its status, " she added.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the consistency has too often been lacking in
recent years, as the United States in particular has given China a
bewildering mixture of signals rather than a clear and consistent
statement of its intentions.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan to Coop in Preserving Silk Road Relics: Kaifu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu said here today that Japan and China share many
common interests regarding the preservation of cultural remains,
and should increase exchange and cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Zhang Wenbin, director of China's State
Bureau of Cultural Relics, Kaifu said he is greatly interested in
the inspection, study and protection of the cultural remains along
the ancient "Silk Road" in northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said that someday he hopes to travel to Niya in the
Taklamakan Desert, to see an ancient city state called "Jingjue"
which is buried under the sand.
</P>
<P>
Two thousand years ago, there were nearly 3,000 residents of
Jingjue, which was then a major hub for traders from various
countries who were travelling along the famous Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
However, Jingjue abruptly disappeared, leaving a mystery that
still puzzles historians and educators. Since 1988, Chinese and
Japanese scholars have made six expeditions to the remote and
seemingly inaccessible site, where they have made important
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said the study of Niya is not only of academic
significance, but also of enormous social value. Last August,
Kaifu flew to Urumqi, capital of the Xingjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, where he saw a number of mummies that had been unearthed
from nearby Niya.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mummies, formerly members of an aristocratic
family, and their clothing were well preserved, and that some
characters on the silk fabric of their garments were clearly
discernible.
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said he will preside over an international seminar next
spring at the University of Buddhism in Japan, which will focus on
the expedition, study and preservation of Niya.
</P>
<P>
Kaifu became interested in history and ancient remains at an
early age. He served two terms as education minister, and explored
several projects involving cultural preservation before assuming
the position of prime minister, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin said China and Japan have had successful
cooperation in the field of preserving Chinese ancient cultural
remains, adding that the two countries "still have many research
topics for broader cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation will have a significant bearing on the
friendship between our peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
He invited Kaifu to journey to Niya at his convenience, and
Kaifu gladly accepted.

<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of National
Defense Chi Haotian said here today that he is confident about the
development of Sino-US friendly cooperative relations, and called
for an end to the "Cold War" ideology.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Cold War is over, words such as "containment" and
"isolation" should be changed to "equal consultation" and
"friendly cooperation," Chi said during a meeting with a US Senate
delegation led by senate minority leader Thomas Daschle.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice chairman of the Central Military Commission,
said Chinese and US army officials agree that friendship and
cooperation between the two countries is not only in their best
interests, but is also conducive to peace and stability in the
Asian-Pacific region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, considering Sino-US ties from a strategic
perspective, hopes the two sides will establish a long-term,
healthy and steady relationship and carry this constructive
relationship into the next century.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister was glad to see some recent improvements
in relations between the two countries and their armies, and
called on the two countries to make contributions to the world
peace through their joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chi also answered questions raised by

</P>
<P>
Daschle agreed that in the future, consultation and cooperation
should be the foundation of state-to-state relations.
</P>

The US visitors said they hope the areas for army exchanges and
cooperation will be expanded. Meanwhile, they are also awaiting
the upcoming visit by the Chinese Defense Minister to their

<HEADLINE> Black Boxes for Crashed Airliners Found in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The disaster which killed all 351 people on board took place
over India's Haryana Pradesh. The crash site is only a little
more than 70 kilometers west of New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
So far about 300 bodies of the 351 victims were retrieved from
the tangled and burnt debris scattered in farm fields over several
kilometers, but only 75 bodies had been identified as of late
night on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian aviation officials who have inspected the
wreckage site of the two international airliners are still baffled
over the nature of such a mid-air mishap.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that such a mishap occurred despite the
Boeing 747 was flying at a height of 14,000 feet and the
descending Kazakhstan airliner was at a height of 15,000 feet,
giving a gap of 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
This showed that either the Saudi Arabian aircraft must have
increased its height by 1,000 feet or the Kazakh aircraft lowered
its altitude, they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials also felt that there could have been some
language barrier between the air traffic control in the
international airport in New Delhi and the Kazakh crew.
</P>
<P>
They said the black boxes of the Saudi jumbo and the Kazakh
airliner and the flight data recorder recovered from the aircraft
could throw more light on the mishap.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Asks APEC to Address Energy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Federico Macaranas, whose
country is to host the 1996 AAPEC senior officials' meeting later
this month, stressed that "Energy is an issue that the APEC must
address squarely."
</P>
<P>
APEC energy ministers have noted that from 1996 to 2010,
electricity demand in the APEC region would increase by 50 to 80
percent. They said the region needs some 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars
in capital investment to meet this demand.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration after they met in Sydney, Australia, last
September, the ministers agreed on an extensive list of
non-binding energy policy principles to boost cooperation among
the APEC member economies in this field.
</P>
<P>
The list includes, among other things, the promotion of capital
flows into energy infrastructure and the development of skills
relevant to the use of improved technology.

<HEADLINE> New Power Plant To be Set up in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Independent Power
Tanzania Ltd. (IPTL) has started its work on setting up a new
power plant on the outskirts of the city of Dar es Salaam, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
James Rugemalira, the local promoter of the project told
reporters on Wednesday that the power plant, after its
construction is completed, will generate 100 MW of electricity to
the national grid, the largest independent power plant in Africa
so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new power plant, which is to be located at Tegeta along
the Kunduchi Beach area, will supply electricty to the state-run
power company, the Tanzania Electric Supply Corporation (TANESCO)
for distribution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Licence to develop the project at Tegeta had already been
obtained from the Tanzanian Ministry of Lands and Urban
Development. It was initially scheduled to start a year ago but
was delayed as residents demanded prior payment of compensation
before the IPTL, a Tanzanian-Malaysian joint power venture, took
it over.
</P>
<P>
The IPTL is going to finalise financial arrangements for the
project, expected to cost 150 million U.S.Dolars when it is
competed and slated for completion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The problem of power shortage in Tanzania will be
substantially reduced after the commissioning of the project,
Rugemalira said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Envisions 6 Percent Growth in MENA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank envisioned
today a 6 percent growth for the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) region in next 15 years, citing the impressive economic
progress being made.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a plenary session on investment opportunities in
the MENA region on the last day of the third MENA economic
conference, World Bank Vice-President Kemal Dervis painted a
rosy picture for the economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
He based his prediction on the economic progress made by MENA
countries in the past years, where the growth rate has risen from
less than 3 percent in the 1991-1993 period to 4 percent in the
1994-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the amount of foreign investment attracted to the
region was beginning to increase. Countries which have conducted
reforms such as Morocco and Tunisia attracted more than 800
million U.S. dollars of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
After the dismal years of economic growth in the 1980s and
early 1990s, "a brightening picture is emerging just in time,"
Dervis said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the determined efforts and progress made by MENA
countries to maintain macroeconomic stability and far-reaching
economic reforms, saying these had set the "stage for a rapid
acceleration of growth."
</P>
<P>
"These programs in turn reflect a new consensus in the region
on the need for economic opening to the outside world, for freer
trade, for closer association with Europe, and for rapid
expansions of the private sector as the engine of growth," Dervis
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that while the 6 percent growth target
was feasible, it was also a challenging task. He urged MENA
countries to do a better job than other developing countries,
whose average growth was estimated at 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dervis emphasized the important role of investment in
boosting the regional development. To realize the 6 percent
target, he said MENA countries needed an average of 320 billion
dollars in annual investment during the 1996-2010 period,
compared to 140 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the way of attracting the extra investment, Dervis
suggested MENA countries do following jobs: providing attractive
returns on invested assets; mitigating investors' risks; creating
an investor-friendly national administrative and regulatory
framework; and increasing domestic savings by reducing budgetary
deficits.
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the importance of upgrading the
infrastructure in MENA countries which should top the list of
investment priorities to foster an internationally competitive
private sector that can move toward rapid integration with the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Dervis promised that the World Bank, in collaboration
with other financing institutions, would strive to reduce the
investment risks in the MENA region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day MENA economic conference opened here Tuesday,
gathering 3,500 government officials and business leaders from
across the world. Participants explored ways of boosting MENA
regional economic cooperation and development by integrating into
the world economy after decades of ravages of war and conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Kurds Meeting to be Held in Ankara as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The second meeting between
rival Iraqi Kurds is expected to be held in Ankara Friday as
scheduled, a Turkish diplomat told Xinhua here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel said Wednesday
that the meeting might be postponed because Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) was not ready for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau, who
recently chaired the first meeting here with the participation of
the representatives from the U.S., Britain, Turkey, the Turkoman
Front, the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), will
arrive in Ankara today to attend the second meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish diplomat said that the contexts of the final
statement on the implementation of the cease-fire between the
KDP and PUK issued at the first Ankara meeting on October 31,
would be discussed at the second meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting, the rival Iraqi groups agreed on the
consolidation of the cease-fire, the sharing of border revenues
and the establishment of a temporary local administration.
</P>
<P>
Later, the KDP declared that it only considered itself bound
by the clauses dealing with the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting erupted between the Iraqi Kurds factions once
again when the KDP drove the PUK out of the Kurdish enclave with
Iraqi military support at the end of August. Last month, the PUK
launched counterattacks and regained the bulk of the territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Sichuan Province's
Chongqing City, at the juncture of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers,
is working on turning itself into a modern port for the Three
Gorges Dam Area.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is the largest port and most important industrial and
commercial center on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It
has access to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces and is rich
in natural resources, with phosphorus ore, and nonferrous and rare
metals accounting for 60 percent of the country's total reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Guoguang, director of the Chongqing Port
Administration, three older port areas are being rebuilt, to give
them a bigger role in future regional development. And, by 1998,
two new berths, one for containers and one for sundry goods, will
be built at the Jiulongpo Port Area to handle container transport.
</P>
<P>
The city will also expand the storage capacity and improve
mechanization at the Lanjiatuo Port Area.
</P>
<P>
To adapt to international container developments, the city will
build the new Cuntan Port Area, which will have four new 1,000-dwt
berths.
</P>
<P>
A new special berth for automobiles at Fo'eryan will also go
into operation by the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, and is
expected to handle 162,000 cars and 300,000 tons of sundry goods a
year.
</P>
<P>
To adapt to a changing situation after the Three Gorges Dam is
finished and to save on construction costs, the Changshou Port
Area, a deep-water port 70 km east of Chongqing, will be
rebuilt. Work has already started and is expected to be finished
in the year 2003 before the Three Gorges Dam Project is completed.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing boasts 15 mechanized berths, which now handle five
million tons of cargo and more than six million passengers each
year.

</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, general manager of the China Petrochemical

<P>
The official estimated that China will be able to process over

ethylene this year.
</P>
<P>
But this output still will not satisfy the needs of the world's

<HEADLINE> Researcher Predicts: More Women to Enter Decision-Making Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese women will enter
decision-making bodies at various levels, including the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), the top policy-making body in China, before the year 2020,
predicted a female researcher for the Party School of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese women will surely make breakthroughs in political
participation during the process of stable promotion," said Zhang
Xiaoling, associate professor with the Research Institute of the
Party School.
</P>
<P>
She added that with strong support from the Party and the
government, a large group of young, capable women have become
grassroots and mid-level leaders.
</P>
<P>
They have adapted to the reforms of both the political and
personnel systems. And because they now have experience in
participating in political affairs, they will become the principle
group of women participating in politics in the next century, said
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
She said that senior leader Deng Xiaoping emphasized as early
as 1956 that as women are one of the largest sources of Party
leaders, the Party must train and promote them for such positions.
</P>
<P>
There were some 150,000 female cadres in China in the early
1950s, meaning that only 8.5 out of every 100 cadres were
women. The number of women cadres sharply increased to about 12
million in 1990s, accounting for one third of the total.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that to attach importance to women's participation
in politics is not only a requirement for the liberation of women,
but is also necessary for perfecting and developing democracy.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zhang noted, the number of women who are involved in
the high-level and ground-level decision-making bodies, is still
not enough. It is sure to affect more women's participation in top
decision-making process, she said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang suggested that strategic trans-century measures be made
to train more women leaders.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to improve psychological and theoretical
leadership skills, Zhang suggested. For women who are in their
20s, training should be focused on helping develop their
self-confidence, cultural and psychological qualities.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also stressed the importance of a healthy home
environment for raising girls, which would help to eliminate the
influence of sexual inequality which exists both at home and in
the classroom.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today reiterated its stand to peacefully
reunite the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our stand on peaceful reunification has remained unchanged and
we will try our best, as we did in the past, to make it," said an
article carried by the official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, today.
</P>
<P>
The article was published after the two-week-long South
Korea-U.S. joint military exercises, code-named "Foal Eagle,"
ended on November 12 and when the "Keen Sword '97" war game
between Japan and the United states was going on.
</P>
<P>
The article said the fact that the U.S. aircraft carrier,
Independence, took part in both large-scale military exercises
showed they belonged to the same system of military operation.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises have not only aggravated the tension in
the Korean Peninsula but also seriously threatened peace in
northeast Asia as well as the world at large, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Some 34,000 U.S. military personnel and tens of thousands of
South Korean soldiers took part in the joint military exercises
code-named "Foal Eagle."

PARIS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- French journalists today staged
their second strike within one month to protest a 30 percent cut
by the government of tax allowances for them.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Fail to Close Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The late night
negotiations between Israel and Palestine Wednesday lasted
until the early hours of this morning, but again failed to work
out an agreement on the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Although an agreement earlier appeared to be imminent,
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that "a wide gap"
remained when he left U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk's residence
near Tel Aviv, where the talks were held throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the two sides will resume
negotiations later today in an effort to hammer out a deal
which would lead to the long-waited Israel army's redeployment
in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
canceled his planned visit to the U.S. to address the Council of
Jewish Federations' assembly in Seattle just hours before he
was due to depart.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said that the premier was
not going to the U.S. because the negotiations on Hebron had
reached a sensitive stage and his presence here is required.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the decision following a meeting with
Palestinian top negotiators Mahmoud Abbas and Yasser Abed-Rabbo
in his Jerusalem office at the request of the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Several times on Wednesday, Netanyahu met with Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Foreign Minister David Levy as
negotiators huddled over the text of the proposed agreement.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official said that if today's talks
succeed, the signing of the agreement could take place Friday.
It would coincide with the anniversary of the Palestinian
declaration of independence eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the main stumbling blocks
continued to be the right of "hot pursuit of terrorists" into the
Palestinian self-rule areas required by Israel, and the weaponry
to be used by Palestinian policemen in Hebron after the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Some of the outstanding issues were left to be dealt with in
an exchange of letters between Netanyahu and Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli letter is expected to include a reaffirmation of
Israel's commitment to continue the next two stages of the
Oslo peace accords, a free access right for the Palestinians,
lifting the closure and an airport in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian letter to Israel will include a
commitment to renounce terror and to uproot the Hamas
infrastructure, and a specific time when the Palestinian
covenant would be changed.
</P>
<P>
There are some 450 Jewish settlers now living in the center
of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 150,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts of
the city.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Hezbollah Group Denies Existence of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Hezbollah (Party of
God), a pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalist group, has denied a
report that it had set up a factory of weapons in the Bekaa
Valley in east Lebanon, the local daily An-Nahar said today.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily quoted a source in Hezbollah as denying
a recent report of the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that there was
a weapons plant belonging to the party in Brittal in the Bekaa,
some 100 kilometers east of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The source stressed that "the report was totally devoid of
correctness."
</P>
<P>
In a statement published in the newspaper, the Mazloum
family, which the AFP report alleged owned the workship which
had been transformed by Hezbollah into the weapons plant,
described the report as "utterly groundless."
</P>
<P>
"We categorically deny what was ascribed to the family and to
the town and the report was totally wrong and utterly groundless
and was aimed at harming our repute and the history of our
veteran town," the Mazloum family said in the name of Brittal's
residents.
</P>
<P>
In the report which was published by media in Beirut
Wednesday, the French news agency quoted Western diplomatic
sources in Nicosia as saying that Hezbollah set up a light
weapons plant in Brittal "under Iranian supervision" two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
It said that the plant is located about 15 kilometers east of
Baalbek, a main stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the plant used to be a workshop
belonging to a Lebanese from the Mazloum family, but had been
abandoned years ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition to assembling Kalashnikov assault rifles and
rocket-propelled grenades, the plant also develops the
performance of Katyusha rocket, which has frequently been used
against villages in north Israel, the report said.

<HEADLINE> China's Small Enterprises to Strengthen Ties With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China has established a group
to supervise cooperation between small and medium-sized
enterprises in China and Germany in a bid to boost their economic
and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on the role of the Chamber of Commerce in
the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, which opened
here on Tuesday, Wei Dong, an official from the State Economic and
Trade Commission, said the Chinese government will gather
information on these firms this year, in hopes of better
publicizing their development to the world.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the importance of strengthening China's small
and medium-sized enterprises with foreign partners, he said these
enterprises have become a major component of China's economy and a
major force in promoting China's marketing economy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1994, about 10 million businesses had registered
in the country; 99 percent were small and medium-sized, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In order to accelerate their development, he said, the Chinese
government will take measures to boost their reform.
</P>
<P>
Various methods, such as reorganization, combination,
annexation, establishing stock companies, tenancy, and
establishing contracts, can be adopted for the reform, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Departments concerned are now working to strengthen legislation
for small and medium-sized enterprises, while accelerating the
reform of the social insurance system, and establishing funds for
the development of these enterprises, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that his commission will try to serve these
enterprises better, cooperate more closely with the international
organizations, and offer training courses for the management
personnel of these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Three-day workshop is jointly hosted by the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) and two German
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Participants from China, Germany and some international
organizations, delivered speeches and discussed how to improve and
enhance the service function of the chambers of commerce, expand
their service areas, and increase their service quality, in a bid
to boost the development of the small and medium enterprises all
over the world.

CHANGCHUN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese stone collector
has discovered a stone bearing markings that are similar to a map
of China and look like a rooster in shape.
</P>
<P>
The stone was discovered by Sun Tingkai, a 60-year-old employee
of the People's Broadcasting Station of Changbei City in Jilin
Province, who has a collection of 20-some stones that have unusual
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The stone is six cm long, four cm wide, and eight cm high, and
has a smooth unscarred surface. In its center, there appears to be
a white rooster on a yellow background. The animal's head, body,
tail and legs look like a map of China. The size and position of
the Liaodong Peninsula in Liaoning Province, and the islands of
Taiwan and Hainan are true to scale.

BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's Court
released the verdicts of the Beijing Municipal People's Court
today in six major bribery cases in which a former assistant
general manager of the Shougang Capital Iron and Steel General
Corporation was found to be involved.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Beifang, 43, was sentenced by the Beijing Municipal
People's Court to death, but with two years' suspension. He was
also deprived of political rights for life and his personal
property was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who was vice-chairman and general manager of the

accepting 9.28 million Hong Kong dollars in bribe money, from June
1993 to April 1994. He was also accused of offering 1.2 million HK
dollars in bribe money to Li Min, Chen Jian, and He Shiping to
help his wife and daughter relocate in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The court found him guilty of having committed serious crimes
for both cases of which he stood accused.

During the process of investigation by the procuratorate in the
bribery case, he confessed to his involvement in acts of bribery
that the judicial department was unaware of, and returned a
certain amount of the bribery money.

Li Min, who had been an official at the deputy-departmental
level in the Beijing Municipal Government, was sentenced to life
imprisonment, with political rights suspended for the rest of his
life and all personal property confiscated.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of accepting money on two different occasions
from Zhou, totalling 800,000 Hong Kong dollars, between June 1993
and May 1994, and of using his official position to help Zhou's
wife and daughter move to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of accepting 84,000 Renminbi yuan in cash
and gifts from companies connected with his department, and was
found to have committed very serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
He was given a lighter sentence, however, because of a full
confession, and because he provided important information that
helped the investigations, and returned the bribe money and gifts
that he had accepted.
</P>
<P>
He Shiping, a former manager of the Beijing Village and
Township Communications Development Corporation, was sentenced to
16 years in prison, with political rights deprived for three
years, and part of his personal property confiscated.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of working in collaboration with Li Min and Chen
Jian betweem June and September 1993 to help Zhou's wife and
daughter move to Hong Kong, and of accepting 200,000 Hong Kong
dollars in bribe money from Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of taking 94,000 yuan in bribe money in the
course of his work, and of embezzling 2,000 US dollars while
buying automobiles for his company.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the fact that he confessed to criminal activity in the
course of the investigation, of which the procuratorate was
previously unaware, and returned most of the bribe money, the
court decided to give him a more lenient sentence.

<HEADLINE> S.African Rand Will Stabilize, Says Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has expressed his sympathy with businessmen over
the recent depreciation of the Rand, but said he was confident
the currency will stabilize.
</P>
<P>
Addressing businessmen in Durban on Wednesday night, Mandela
conceded that the Rand's depreciation was of great concern, but
said the matter is in the capable hands of Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel and Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals.
</P>
<P>
The Rand has lost more than 25 percent of its values since
mid-February this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela assured the business community that the
contentious issue of exorbitant salaries paid to consutants
advising the government is receiving attention at highest level.
</P>
<P>
The President urged South African businessmen to learn from
their international counterparts in an attempt to promote the
country as one of the reasons for tardy international investment.
</P>
<P>
Recent international business delegations visiting South
Africa had apparently criticised local businessmen for not
marketing the country internationally as a viable investment
destination.

<P>
Chen Jian, 39, the former deputy-director of the General Office
of the Beijing Municipal Communist Party Committee, was accused of
using his position in helping Li Min and He Shiping between June
and September 1993 move Zhou's wife and daughter to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chen was accused of accepting 200,000 HK dollars in bribe money
from Zhou, and 30,000 US dollars, in a separate incident, for
helping a company obtain loans.
</P>
<P>
The evidence indicated that Chen had committed serious crimes,
but he was given a lighter sentence of 15 years in prison for
confessing his crimes and volunteering information about the
others' crimes. He was also deprived of political rights for three
years, and part of his personal property was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Luping, who was former assistant to the director of the
Beijing Municipal Finance Bureau, director of the bureau's Budget
Department, and director of the bureau's third branch bureau, was
accused of accepting 50,000 yuan in bribe money from a company on
two occasions to help them obtain loans, between September and
December 1994, under the instructions of former Beijing Vice-Mayor
Wang Baosen.
</P>
<P>
Because Zhang confessed his guilt and returned the funds he had
accepted, he was sentenced to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Qu Aiqun, 46, the wife of Li Min, was accused of having
depositing illegal funds in her bank account and conspiring with
her husband, from the latter half of 1993 to April 1994, to ask
others to keep money and to falsify the source, even though she
was aware of her husband's having accepted bribe money from Zhou
Beifang. She was also accused of using part of that money to
purchase a house.
</P>
<P>
But, because all the illegal money was recovered, and Qu's
crime was considered not so grave, she was not given a sentence.
</P>
<P>
All of the rulings of the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's
Court in the case of Zhou Beifang, Chen Jian, and He Shiping were
appealed, but they were rejected by the Beijing Higher People's
Court, which upheld the original sentences.

<HEADLINE> Monk's Blessing Sought in Thai Election Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Although money is crucial for
a candidate to "buy" his way to Parliament, blessing from a
respected monk is also needed to boost the success chance of the
candidate.
</P>
<P>
During the last three weeks of campaigning, nearly all key
figures of major political parties which are contesting the
general election scheduled for Sunday have sought blessings from
Luang Phor Khoon, abbot of a temple in the northeastern city of
Nakhon Ratchasima.
</P>
<P>
Luang Phor Khoon, in his 70s, has become popular among
politicians for his election blessings. They believe the abbot's
good wishes helped former candidates win past elections.
</P>
<P>
Most interest comes from candidates of the New Aspiration,
Chart Pattana (national development) and Chart Thai (Thai nation)
parties in the 19 northeastern provinces, where the contest is
very keen.
</P>
<P>
Candidates had Luang Phor Khoon's blessings recorded and had
pictures taken with him for use in their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Amulets with his image are proving a big hit as gifts with
candidates and canvassers across Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Politicians have bought as many as 50,000 amulets for 10 to 20
baht each (40-80 US cents), to be offered to locals as a
vote-winner.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism is the professed faith of 95 percent of the Thai
population.
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok and southern Thailand where there are large Muslim
communities, candidates and canvassers have also poured into
mosques to solicit support from Muslim voters.

To mark the historical moment, the province will hold welcoming
ceremonies on July 1 for the first group of Hongkong tourists in
Guangzhou, the provincial capital, Shenzhen, right next to
Hongkong, Zhuhai, which neighbors Macao, and in major tourist
cities on New Year's Day for overseas tourists.

<HEADLINE> RMB Current-Account Convertibility Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese currency's
current-account convertibility will not destabilize its exchange
rate and instead will have a wide-ranging positive impact on the
country's economy and trade, according to officials and financial
experts here.
</P>
<P>
China has effectively made its renminbi yuan convertible under
the current account, four years ahead of the original self-imposed
deadline of the year 2000, Chen Yaoxian, deputy governor of the
central bank, said today at the ongoing China Summit' 1996.
</P>
<P>
Making the yuan convertible under the current account is an
"important" and "realistic" step toward integrating China's
economy with the economy of the world as a whole, Pieter
Bottelier, chief of the World Bank's resident mission in China,
told Xinhua in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The move will help in China's negotiations for accession to the
World Trade Organization as a full member, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's current account includes trade, labor and tourism as
well as normal short-term banking and credit facilities.
</P>
<P>
Bottelier said that the local currency's current-account
convertibility implies the removal of great restrictions in trade
and services, and will therefore promote economic and trade
exchanges between China and other countries and help improve
China's investment environment.
</P>
<P>
"Objectively, it will help the all-round development of the
Chinese economy," Bottelier said.
</P>
<P>
Tao Liming, deputy director of the International Finance
Research Institute of the Bank of China,the country's major
foreign exchange bank, said that the yuan's current-account
convertibility is a reflection and a result of the smooth
operation of the new foreign exchange system introduced in January
1994.
</P>
<P>
Making the yuan convertible under the current account will
significantly boost China's foreign trade and services and sharpen
the competitive edge of Chinese enterprises on the world market,
Tao said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the move will promote the development of
China's fledging foreign exchange market and provide a fresh
opportunity for the development of the capital market.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the State Administration of Exchange
Control said that the yuan's current-account convertibility will
quicken China's pace of integrating its foreign exchange
management system with standard international practices, and
increase economic and trade contacts between China and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
It will also boost public confidence in yuan and the Chinese
economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts contacted by Xinhua agreed that the
yuan's convertibility under the current account will not adversely
affect the foreign exchange market or the currency's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"The chances of wild fluctuations in the currency's exchange
rate are very remote," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
Bottelier explained that China's strong foreign exchange
reserves, at 95.4 billion US dollars by the end of September,
support yuan's stability.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange rate will remain stable," Bottelier stated.
</P>
<P>
While approving of the yuan's current-account convertibility,
the officials and experts also highlighted the need for China to
continue to keep a watchful eye on the capital account, which
includes direct investment, international loans and security
trading.
</P>
<P>
This will prevent the possibility of a financial crisis caused
by a capital flight or an influx of hot money, they explained.
</P>
<P>
"It's important for China to maintain the capacity to monitor
and control capital flow to and from the country, " Bottelier
said.

BUDAPEST, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will continue to give
support to international peace-keeping efforts in Bosnia beyond
December, the Hungarian Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Szentivanyi Gabor, a spokesman for the ministry, said that if
requested by the United Nations and approved by the parliament,
Hungary is willing to continue its participation in peace-keeping
operation in Bosnia by providing logistic and engineering support
after December.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the current multinational implementation force
(IFOR) in Bosnia expires in December.
</P>
<P>
But Gabor said now the problem is that NATO has yet to decide
in whatever form it will remain in Bosnia after December.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK People's Democratic Rights Guaranteed Under Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Selection Committee for
the first government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) is to hold its first meeting here Friday to choose
candidates for the Chief Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented election process marks the exercise of
democratic rights by Hong Kong people in implementing the
principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always set great store by Hong Kong
people's democratic rights in handling Hong Kong affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the Chinese government formulated the
guideline of "One country, Two systems" for Hong Kong's future
development.
</P>
<P>
In the following years, the Chinese government made further
commitment in a series of documents including the Sino-British
Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and the Basic Law
of the HKSAR by putting forward the principles of "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and "Catering to the Hong Kong people
and relying on them" so as to ensure a high degree of autonomy for
the future HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Under the guideline and principles, the Chinese government has
worked to provide more opportunities and channels for Hong Kong
people to perform their democratic rights and participate in the
policy-making process of Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two Hong Kong people spent four years and eight months
in the Basic Law Drafting Committee and 180 Hong Kong people sat
in the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee, which
contributed greatly to formulation of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch appointed 186 Hong Kong
Affairs Advisors and 670 Hong Kong District Affairs Advisors and
their views and suggestions were solicited on achieving a smooth
transition in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people accounted for 52.6 percent of the Preliminary
Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR which was set
up in July 1993, and the percentage grew to 62 in the Preparatory
Committee (PC) formed in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the PC was set up, its Selection Committee Panel held 16
meetings in Hong Kong in April to hear opinions and suggestions
from more than 1,000 people from 362 organizations on the methods
for the formation of the Selection Committee whose duty is to
elect the Chief Executive and the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the 400-member Selection Committee was
elected from among 5,789 applicants.
</P>
<P>
Within two months, they will choose candidates for the Chief
Executive and the Provisional Legislative Council as well as the
Chief Executive and members of the council based on the majority
opinions of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Nicky Chan Nai-keong, chairman of Former Senior Civil Servants
Association, said that over the past 150 years, Britain has
appointed 28 governors to Hong Kong, but it never sought advice
from the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the process of the formation of the Selection
Committee embodies fairness, justice, openness and democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the members of the Selection Committee were
broadly represented and they will fulfill their historical mission
for electing the first government of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
It is now generally recognized in Hong Kong that the
establishment of the Selection Committee marks a milestone in the
process of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the beginning
of genuine democracy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
More and more people are convinced that the principle of "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" will be implemented and people's
democratic rights will be guaranteed under the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Choi Kyu-hah Refuses to Testify in Appeal Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President
Choi Kyu-hah refused to testify in the appeal trial when he was
forcibly taken to the Seoul High Court Thursday morning as a
witness of the 1979 military coup and the 1980 military crackdown
on the Kwangju civil uprising.
</P>
<P>
Choi, 77, stood mute in the courtroom and refused to answer a
prosecutor's question about the two incidents involving two former
South Korean presidents, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, who were
arrested at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Serving as prime minister in 1979, Choi became caretaker
president after then President Park Chung-hee's assassination and
was in office when the two incidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
But he announced his resignation without any clear reason in
August 1980.
</P>
<P>
Choi explained for his testimony refusal that a former
president's account or testimony in court of what he did while in
office may cause problems for an incumbent president in his
handling of state affairs, and his court testimony would not be in
the national interest because it would become a burden to future
presidents in their duties.
</P>
<P>
Before Choi entered the courtroom, the panel of judges asked
the two former presidents -- Chun and Roh -- to leave the room for
a while at the request of Choi.
</P>
<P>
Choi said through his lawyer that it is not desirable for the
three former presidents to stand together in a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The appeal trial of the two former presidents -- Chun and Roh
-- started at the Seoul High Court on October 7 over guilty
verdicts handed down against them for mutiny and treason charges.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, the Seoul District Court sentenced Chun to death
and Roh to 22 years and six months in prison respectively on
charges of mutiny, treason and bribery. It also fined Chun 282
million U.S. dollars and Roh 355 million dollars, representing the
bribes they allegedly accumulated while in office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sentences ranging from four to 10 years in prison
were given to 13 former South Korean officers who helped the two
ex-presidents in their quest for power.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, as well as their cronies, appealed their cases to
the Seoul High Court on August 30 as they refused to accept the
verdicts made by the Seoul District Court.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stemmed from the roles played by
Chun and Roh as well as their cronies in the military coup on
December 12, 1979 and the suppression of the civil uprising in
Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province, on May
18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by his friend, Roh, who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The panel of judges is scheduled to conclude hearing on the
appeal trial of Chun and Roh and 13 co-defendants on Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A verdict session on the mutiny and treason cases involving
Chun and Roh and others is expected to be held in the Seoul High
Court in mid-December, with Chun and Roh's slush fund cases
combined.

<P>

archer, tie and dye clothing materials, curios among other
products on display are fascinating visitors, women in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Such is the scene of an exhibition of ''Bringing Beijing to
Zambia'' under the auspices of the Lusaka Province Small Business
Association to mark the one-year anniversary of the international
conference on Women that was held in Beijing, China, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The one-week mini product exhibition is organized by women
entrepreneurs to display their various products in order to show
in practical terms their implementation of the resolutions to
improve the quality of life of women.
</P>
<P>
''We want to show that empowring women is empowering the
nation. Women are doing what they can in the real sense of it,''
said Dorothy Chanda, Director of the Munwashumbo Plancare and
Nursing Agency and Research Initiative. Her products include tie
and dye materials.
</P>
<P>
She added, ''We are really bringing Beijing to Zambia because
the whole essence of the conference in Beijing was trying to
promote women entrepreneurs. We are demonstrating the empowering
of women not only politically but also economically and
socially.''
</P>
<P>
Juliet Chilengi is the Managing Director of the Nkwashi
Enterprises whose products include cooking oil, vegetable archer,
tomato ketchup, coffee and groundnuts.
</P>
<P>
She still manufactures from her home in Marshlands and sells
her products door to door.
</P>
<P>
She, however, eyeing penetrating the international market,
said, ''Our aim is to grow big and export because our products
are as good as those from South Africa or elsewhere''.
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Banda, Chairperson of the Lusaka Province Small
Business Association, is of the view: The exhibition is not only
to show the ability to empower women economically but also
exhibit the unity among women.
</P>
<P>
As to the association's Treasurer Joy Mwambazi, she spoke out
the women's innermost thoughts and feelings: Women don't want any
special treatment but equal opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province Introduces Civil Servant System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has made great progress in introducing a civil servant
system since 1993, according to a provincial government official.
</P>
<P>
Wang Junlian, deputy director the Provincial Department of
Personnel, said that a new personnel system has been instituted in
the province, and that in early 1993, the province began using
examinations to select officials.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the province also spearheaded research by
setting up an organization six years ago to get experts and
scholars to study the civil service system, and that the province
has approved 14 regulations as a result, giving a push to the
system.
</P>
<P>
Local tax bureaus have selected 1,270 civil servants from
25,000 applicants by using the examination system.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the province's civil service system has
provided broader access to some key posts for a large number of
outstanding officials, helping build up a more efficient team of
civil servants in the province.

<HEADLINE> RMB Already Convertible Under Current Account: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China has effectively made its
currency convertible under the current account, a senior central
bank official told the China Summit' 1996 here today.
</P>
<P>
"A breakthrough has been achieved in the reform of China's
foreign exchange system, as we have already made the Renminbi yuan
convertible under the current account," said Chen Yaoxian, deputy
governor of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
China's current account includes trade, labor and tourism as
well as normal short-term banking and credit facilities.
</P>
<P>
China has unified the yuan's official exchange rate and its
rate at the swap market, and allowed foreign-funded enterprises to
buy and sell hard currency, Chen told the forum.
</P>
<P>
He said that the yuan has been stable and China's foreign
exchange reserves have increased steadily to 95.4 billion US
dollars at the end of September, 28 billion US dollars more than
at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the financial situation in China was stable
in the first three quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
Cash in circulation (M0) is expected to rise by 15 percent this
year, and the year-round supply of narrow money (M1), the
combination of cash and demand deposits of enterprises, and broad
money (M2), which includes all sorts of deposits, is expected to
grow by 17 and 25 percent, respectively, the deputy governor
said. He noted that all of the indices are very close to this
year's targets.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth of the money supply is still at a high
level and the potential for inflationary pressure still exists,
Chen noted, warning that the financial order has not been
fundamentally improved and financial risks must not be neglected.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the central bank will follow a relatively tight
monetary policy throughout the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000) and continue to advance financial reforms, in order to
promote a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national
economy.

PHNOM PENH, November 14 (Xinhua)-- Six government soldiers were
killed and seven others were injured in two separate ambushes by
the Khmer Rouge last week in northwestern Cambodia, a local daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language Cambodia Daily quoted Undersecretary of
State Sieng Lapresse as saying that Khmer Rouge ambushed patrols
of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) in two places in Siem
Reap province's Chong Kal district, some 70 kilometers northwest
of the Angkor temple.
</P>
<P>
The incidents are the first clashes reported since a split in
the Khmer Rouge leadership became public in August, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Information Ministry said that the first casualty came in a
15-minute exchange of gunfire and several days later the guerrillas
launched another ambush which killed five soldiers and wounded
seven others.
</P>
<P>
But Lapresse said "the deaths and injuries were caused by
land mine explosions as the soldiers fled and stepped on them,"
adding that "these were hit-and-run attacks by the rebels' mobile
units."
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention if there was any casualty on the Khmer

NANJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
collected 4.08 billion yuan (about 490 million US dollars) in
taxes from foreign-funded companies in the first ten months of
this year, a 33 percent increase over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official says that the fast-growing tax revenues
are largely due to an increase in the number of foreign-funded
enterprises and more extensive use of computerized tax computation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Jiangsu has 18,000 foreign-funded
enterprises, the second largest number for all of China. That
figure is also up, by 3,400, from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, 630 foreign-funded enterprises were
reimbursed by more than 400 million yuan in tax rebates in the
first nine months.

<HEADLINE> Six Soldiers Killed in Clashes in Northern Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 14 (Xinhua)-- Six soldiers of the
government troops were killed and seven others were injured in two
separate ambushes by the Khmer Rouge last week in northwestern
Cambodia, a local daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language Cambodia Daily quoted Undersecretary of
State Sieng Lapresse as saying that Khmer Rouge ambushed patrols
of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) in two places in Siem
Reap province's Chong Kal district, some 70 kilometers northwest
of the Angkor temple.
</P>
<P>
The incidents are the first clashes reported since a split in
the Khmer Rouge leadership became public in August, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Information Ministry said that the first casualty came in a
15-minute exchange of gunfire and several days later the guerrillas
launched another ambush which killed five soldiers and wounded
seven others.
</P>
<P>
But Lapresse said "the deaths and injuries were caused by
land mine explosions as the soldiers fled and stepped on them,"
adding that "these were hit-and-run attacks by the rebels' mobile
units."
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention if there was any casualty on the Khmer
Rouge side.

<HEADLINE> Increase in Air Links to Western Chinese Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Golmud City in the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has seen the pace of life pick up a bit,
since its air routes reopened in March.
</P>
<P>
The airlines use a small military airport to link the city with
Xining, capital of Qinghai Province, and Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi
Province. In the past seven months, it has handled over 6,000
Chinese and overseas passengers.
</P>
<P>
Golmud is 2,800 meters above sea level in the rich Qaidam
Basin, and is the largest city in China in terms of area, covering
126,000-sq.km. It is economically and geographically important,
with an abundance of oil, natural gas, lead, and gold. It is also
a passageway to Tibet, Xinjiang, and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
The city had an air link in the past with the cities of Xining,
Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Lhasa, but was closed in 1985 for various
reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Restoring the air routes reflects the central government's
policy of accelerating economic development of the western
regions," said An Fushan, head of Golmud's civil aviation, and new
routes are expected to link the city with Beijing, Guangzhou, and
Lhasa in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Toshiki Kaifu, former prime
minister of Japan, said here today that continuing harmonious
Sino-Japanese relations is of far-reaching significance in the
post-cold war era.
</P>
<P>
He asked the governments of both Japan and China to make
efforts toward establishing good relations.
</P>
<P>
He told the China Summit in a prepared speech: "both Japan and
China are important countries in Asia, and developing stable and
friendly cooperative relations is an extremely important
prerequisite for the maintenance of peace and stability in
the Asia-Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
He said that he has always opposed isolating China, and that
supporting China's policy of the reform and opening to the outside
world is very important.
</P>
<P>
"I think, Japan should continue to provide for China the kind
of cooperation China needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to maintain peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region, it is important to realize the diversity of
the region, as each country is different from the other in
culture, history, and stages of development.
</P>
<P>
"One should not always measure others with a fixed value or
standard," he said, adding that each should pay due respect to the
other's stand and situation.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, multi-lateral dialogues have begun in
political and economic and other spheres in the Asia-Pacific
region," he said, adding, "It is a welcoming trend."

<HEADLINE> Brittan Urges Early Resumption of China's WTO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The prime target for
Sino-European cooperation must be the early conclusion of the
long-overdue negotiations for Chinese resumption of membership of
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Leon Brittan, Vice President
of the European Commission, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Europe has always made clear its willingness to do so," the
vice president told the ongoing "China Summit 1996."
</P>
<P>
A great deal of intense effort at the technical level is
needed, together with strong coordination in Beijing, in Europe
and elsewhere, between the different government agencies and
special interest groups whose involvement is crucial to a
comprehensive deal, Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
"Delay would be in the interests neither of the WTO nor of
China," he said, explaining that WTO needs China as a member, as
soon as the negotiations can reasonably be completed.
</P>
<P>
Brittan repeated Europe's desire to develop a practical and
mutual beneficial relationship with China, saying that Europe
maintains and seeks for the future an even-handed relationship
with China -- a long-term relationship based on equality.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work with China in its extraordinarily rapid
and sustained move towards economic and social development,"
Brittan noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that Europe is now satisfied that China's
strengthening of intellectual property rights is compatible with
the even-handedness that should inform their bilateral
relationship.

<HEADLINE> 1,332 Zambians Arrested for Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,332 Zambians have
been arrested since January this year for drug trafficking with
illicit drugs worth 17,000 million Kwacha (13.6 million U.S.Dollars)
seized both at home and abroad, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mukutulu Sinyani, spokesman and senior Assistant Commissioner of
Zambia's Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC), was quoted as saying on
Wednesday that 23 Zambians were arrested in South Africa, Ecuador,
Zimbabwe and Botswana last month. About 1,030 suspected drug
traffickers were arrested last year.
</P>
<P>
Most Zambians caught with illicit drugs abroad crossed
borders into neighboring countries before boarding aircraft to
destinations in Europe and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
DEC is concerned with the number of Zambians being arrested for
drug trafficking world-wide because they are tarnishing the image of
Zambia abroad, Sinyani said.
</P>
<P>
Sinyani warned, ''We shall however, not relent in our efforts to
stamp out drug trafficking. I should warn those involved in
trafficking drugs that it does not pay and one day the law will catch
up with them.''
</P>
<P>
DEC will train Zambia Revenue Authority and police
officers on ways of detecting drug traffickers to ensure outlets are
sealed, Sinyani added.

<HEADLINE> Policeman Shot After White Officer Cleared From Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. police officer was
shot in the leg today in St. Peterburg, Florida, hours after a
grand jury ruled not to indict another officer who shot dead a
black motorist last month.
</P>
<P>
At least two dozen squad cars screeched out of police
headquarters at the first report of the shooting. The streets were
immediately blocked off, and moments later dozens of gunshots were
heard, Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The police officer was shot in front of a house where members
of a black group, the National People's Democratic Uhuru Movement,
met. The group has called for the executions of the police
officers involved in last month's shooting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The group handed out fliers after the grand jury ruling and one
of them reads "KILLER COP GOES FREE."
</P>
<P>
The flier says, "We will not be shot down in the streets like
dogs. Neither will we be pushed into jails for defending our
community."
</P>
<P>
Despite appeals for calm from police and local officials,
clumps of black youths began crowding onto the streets, throwing
rocks and bottles at passing cars.
</P>
<P>
After the October 24 shooting, hundreds of black people went to
the street, hurling firebombs, rocks and bottles, and setting 29
fires. Several police officers and firefighters were injured.
</P>
<P>
The Pinellas County grand jury's decision means officer Jim
Knight, who shot to death the black man Tyron Lewis, won't face
criminal charges. However, he was suspended for 60 days with pay
by Police Chief Darrel Stephens, who said Knight failed to take
"reasonable means to avoid the danger."
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Lewis failed to respond several times when
Knight ordered him out of a car which Knight and his partner had
stopped for speeding, the report said.
</P>
<P>
When Knight moved to the front of the car to peer inside, Lewis
moved the vehicle toward him, bumping him twice "in an apparent
effort to intimidate or challenge the officer," the grand jury
said.
</P>
<P>
The panel said Knight's partner, Sandra Minor, broke a car
window to gain entry and the car moved forward and hit Knight
again. He ordered the driver to stop or he'd shoot.
</P>
<P>
The car then turned sharply to the left, hitting Knight a
fourth time and dropping him onto the car's hood. Knight fired
three times, hitting Lewis twice in the right arm and once in the
chest. Lewis was found dead when he was taken to a hospital.

<HEADLINE> Many Indonesian Children Lack Nutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Nutritionists are reminding
Indonesian parents to be aware of their children's food
consumption as recent studies show that out of ten children under
five years old, four suffer from nutritional deficiency.
</P>
<P>
"About 40 percent of Indonesian children under five currently
suffer from nutritional deficiency, especially the children of
destitute families in rural areas," Prof. Soekirman, an expert on
human resources development of the National Development Planning
Board, was quoted as saying here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that deficiency in nutrition has been the highest cause
for the country's high infant mortality rate and infectious
diseases, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality rate in Indonesia is still considered high
compared to other ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
member countries. "For every 1,000 births, 57 died," Soekirman
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that malnutrition is caused by among others unequal
distribution of food to the region. "So, children mostly consume
only about 2,100 calories per day."
</P>
<P>
What is more regrettable, however, is that not only children
under five suffer from malnutrition in the country but also school
age children.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted on 600,000 elementary students all over
Indonesia indicated that stunted physical growth is mainly caused
by lack of nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Another study showed that school age children only consume
about 70 percent of their energy needs every day. Such a condition
is worsened by anemia and intestinal worms.
</P>
<P>
A data from the Education and Culture Ministry also pointed out
that some 1.2 million elementary and secondary school students
have been forced to drop out from school because of malnutrition.

<HEADLINE> Transport Service Recovers on Romanian Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Volumes of goods transported
on the Romanian Danube-Black Sea Canal in the first 10 months
soared to 8.04 million tons, 15.5 percent more than the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The transport services on the canal have been recovering since
the U.N. Security Council lifted an overall trade embargo on
Yugoslavia, Romania's southwestern neighbor, in early October.
</P>
<P>
The Danube-Black Sea Canal, 64.2 kilometers long and 70 to 90
meters wide, was officially open to traffic in May 1984. But the
transport services went downhill since 1990, especially following
the sanctions against Yugoslavia imposed in May 1992.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Introduces New Plan on Liquidity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has
introduced a new plan for liquidity management, under which
interest rates may be lowered toward the end of the year,
according to Rerngchai Marakanond, governor of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The new plan, known as "Open Market Operations," would make it
easier for banks and finance firms to manage their liquidity by
reducing the fluctuation of interbank and inter-finance interest
rates and by making it easier to reduce long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Under the relaxed monetary policy, the central bank would still
inject money into the market when liquidity appeared tight,
Rerngchai said.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank will not let interest rates increase.
Normally, when the interbank rate goes up for two or three days we
will act to pull it down," Rerngchai said.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the central bank would act as an active
dealer by calling its direct dealers to sell or buy bonds
according to a repurchase agreement. If liquidity was tight, the
central bank would sell bonds and if there was excess liquidity it
would buy.
</P>
<P>
He added that lower local interest rates would also help to
narrow the gap between local and offshore rates, slowing the
inflow of capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan
Videnov and visiting Chinese Vice-premier Li Lanqing said today
that their governments will promote the economic cooperation
between the two nations' entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Bulgaria is interested in Li's proposal
on promoting direct cooperation between the two nation's
entrepreneurs in joint production and development of third country
markets.
</P>
<P>
Videnov also stressed that Bulgaria pursues one-China policy
and Beijing is the sole legitimate government representing China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have no political differences and problems,
Videnov said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he appreciates China's diplomatic
policy of equality and mutual benefits, regarding other countries
as equals no matter whether they are big or small, and acting
independently and with the initiative in its own hands.
</P>
<P>
Videnov, who visited China in May this year, said the frequent
exchange of high-level visits between the two countries exhibited
their common aspiration for expansion of bilateral ties.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Asks Developed Nations to Do More for Biodiversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China today appealed to
developed countries to honor their commitments to protecting
biological diversity under a world environmental accord signed at
the Rio summit in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Xie Zhenhua, director of the China State
Bureau of Environmental Protection and chief of the Chinese
delegation to an international ministerial conference on
biodiversity, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Xie emphasized the efforts and achievements of developing
countries, including China, in the field of biodiversity
protection after the agreement was signed at the World Congress on
Development and Environmental Protection in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that developed countries have not done
enough to help enable poor nations to comply with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Council of the World Environment Fund, the financial
mechanism for the implementation of the agreement, has done what
it can but doesn't have enough money to help developing countries
comply with the projects contained in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister urged developed countries to show more
sincerity and make greater efforts to honor their commitments.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the main obstacles to complying with the
agreement, such as financing and technological transfers, would be
removed at a special meeting called by the United Nations in June
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has always given priority to
compliance and has made great progress in environmental protection
since the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government views compliance with the Rio agreement
as a long-term task, he added, and as a result, a working group
made up of 20 departments of the State Council has been set up to
draft a program on China's biodiversity protection.
</P>
<P>
China has also upgraded its computer system and database on
biodiversity, expanded wildlife natural reserves and intensified
protection for endangered species.

<HEADLINE> Onshore Oil Industry Make-over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a major
restructuring of its onshore oil industry to accelerate the
transition to a market economy, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
A crucial part of the restructuring will be to make the
industry more efficient and flexible.
</P>
<P>
The onshore oil industry, created under a centrally planned
system, has been for decades under one management operating within
one budget.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring, to be conducted by the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC), will separate oil exploration and
production from technical services and logistics, hospitals and
schools and all other non-oil businesses.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines will follow rules governing a market economy and
international practices.
</P>
<P>
The offshore oil sector, represented by the China National
Offshore Oil Corp, was started in 1982, under reform policies. It
always has operated in accordance with international conventions.

<HEADLINE> Thai Share Market Index Up Ahead of Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 14 (Xinhua) -- With only three days left
before the general election, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)
index gained 25.83 points, or a hefty 2.71 percent, on Wednesday,
exceeding bourse analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
The index closed at 979.51 points on a trading turnover of
6,024 million baht (241 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Stock market analysts believed that the index gain was due to
investors' optimism that the Democrat Party might win the most
seats in Sunday's election to become the core for the new
government.
</P>
<P>
During the last few days several opinion polls have indicated
that the Democrat Party would do better in the election than the
New Aspiration Party.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party has boasted a strong team of specialists for
salvaging the country's sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The bullish trend on Tuesday and Wednesday followed a sharp
drop on Monday, when the SET index plummeted 20.32 points, or 2.1
percent, to close at 747.28 points, amidst uncertainties of the
election results.
</P>
<P>
Share market analysts expected on Monday that before the
election the bourse would drift between 930 and 970 points.
</P>
<P>
They had ruled out the possibility of a big rise, because
investors would prefer to wait for the election results rather
than taking the pre-election risks.

<HEADLINE> Moscow, Chechnya to Sign Accord: Rybkin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia and its breakaway
province of Chechnya would sign a political accord within two or
three days, clarifying that they are part of a single legal
entity, Russian Security Council chief Ivan Rybkin said today.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin, returning from his first Chechen trip, said the accord,
now in its final phase, would spell out relations between Russia
and Chechnya in the period up to the elections scheduled for
January 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The accord would be signed by Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskahdov in "two
or three days," Rybkin said in an interview with Echo of Moscow
radio.
</P>
<P>
He said experts of both sides worked on the document through
out the day in Narzan, Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
According to Rybkin, the political accord is only one of a
string of deals to be struck in the settlement process, with
military, social and border issues lingering.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin denied a report that Moscow would pump one trillion
roubles (about 180 million U.S. dollars) into Chechnya by the end
of the year, saying the region would only start getting cash after
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked who might run for Chechen president in the elections,
Rybkin cited Maskahdov and Doku Zavgayev, head of the
Moscow-backed Chechen government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister
Georgi Pirinsky resigned here today, citing a general lack of
confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the ruling Socialist Party did not enjoy
the minimum confidence needed to govern.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov accepted Pirinsky's resignation and
named Deputy Foreign Minister Irina Bokova as acting foreign
minister. Videnov said he would appoint a successor to Pirinsky by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Pirinsky, born in the United States, became foreign minister in
early 1995. In September this year, he was barred by the
Constitutional Court from running for the presidency because of
his birthplace.
</P>
<P>
After the failure of the Socialists in a presidential election
run-off early this month, a group of party members, led by
Pirinsky, urged for a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
But Videnov won the party's confidence vote by a narrow margin
on Tuesday. A total of 87 members of the party's supreme council
voted to support the prime minister, 69 voted against and two
abstained.
</P>
<P>
Three council members, including vice chairman Yanaki Stoilov,
resigned after the vote.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Predicted to Grow at 7.6 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy is
expected to improve next year, growing at 7.6 percent, Mari E.
Pangestu, an economist at the Center of Strategic and
International Studies said.
</P>
<P>
Mari projected that next year's growth will be between this
year's, which is estimated at 7.5 percent, and last year's growth,
which was 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar Wednesday, Mari said, "The growth will
remain high next year because the country's external environment
is improving and the investment boom starts to bear fruit."
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment commitments have increased dramatically
during the last four years, from merely 8 billion US dollars in
1992, to 23.7 billion dollars in 1994 and 39.9 billion dollars in
1995. As for this year, the government has targeted the approval
of 27 billion dollars worth foreign investment projects.
</P>
<P>
She predicted that most of the growth would come from the
construction sector, and the financial services, trade, hotel and
restaurant industries.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector is expected to grow by 11.5 percent
next year, up from 11 percent this year; the financial services by
10.5 percent, up from 10 percent; and trade, hotels and
restaurants by 7.5 percent, up from 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, agricultural growth is expected to slow to 2.9
percent next year, down from 3.0 percent this year; the
manufacturing sector is expected to decline to 10.8 percent from
11 percent; electricity, gas and clean water should drop to 13.5
percent from 14.5 percent; the mining sector is predicted to
remain flat at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mari forecast that next year's growth would be very much
propelled by investment, both domestic and foreign, rather than by
consumption.

<HEADLINE> East China "International Vegetable Basket" Helping Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- In rural parts of central
and east China, many farmers are getting to know the name
Lianyungang Ruyi, a company that is buying, processing and
exporting them.
</P>
<P>
The company is referred to by farmers as the "International
Vegetable Basket," because it has contracts with 150,000 farmers
from 40 cities and counties in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui,
Gansu, and Fujian provinces.
</P>
<P>
The company first provides farmers with imported vegetable
seeds, cultivation techniques, and other services free of charge,
and then purchases the vegetables after the harvest.
</P>
<P>
Director Shi Shoujiang said that his company started the
business when he saw a market survey showing that China had vast
potential in special vegetables, fruits, flowers, and plants, and
that there was great interest on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The company has introduced 80 improved strains of vegetables
from Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. It
processes, freezes and ships vegetables purchased from farmers to
those countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ruyi vegetable production bases have grown to 10,000
ha. from 200 ha. in 1992, and the company has helped more than
150,000 rural households improve their lives, by allowing them to
make 30,000 to 45,000 yuan per ha., or even 150,000 yuan, per year
by growing vegetables for export.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, the vegetable-growers sell their products to
the firm at contract prices, but can sell the produce as they
wish, when market prices go up.
</P>
<P>
The company exports 30,000 tons of vegetables, worth 14 million
US dollars, annually, compared with two million US dollars worth
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Shi says that by the year 2000, his company plans to export
100,000 tons of vegetables, worth one billion yuan, earning 100
million US dollars in foreign exchange and 100 million yuan in
pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
During that period, export-base acreage will reach 33,000
ha. and 500,000 farmer households will be living much better
lives.

the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said in carrying out the survey the basic aim was to

<HEADLINE> Hunan Expands Winter Planting to Make Up for Flood Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan
Province, a major grain producer in the country, is expanding
winter planting to make up for heavy crop losses caused by massive
summer floods.
</P>
<P>
By early October, Hunan had sowed grain, oil and vegetable
seeds on one million hectares, more than in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers are expected to plant nearly three million
hectares of winter crops, 200,000 ha more than last year.
</P>
<P>
But this summer's floods resulted in a drastic drop in the
province's grain output.
</P>
<P>
Yueyang City, severely hit by the floods, allocated 12,000
tons of potato seeds, 640 tons of wheat seeds and 2,000 tons of
broad bean seeds to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The city government hopes that a good winter planting season
will help farmers to ease an expected grain shortage next spring.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in Hunan have also increased their
appropriations in winter crops. Yiyang City, another area severely
affected by flooding, has managed to pool 10 million yuan in loans
to encourage winter planting.

MANILA, November 14 (Xinhua)-- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Wednesday warned foreigners against joining protest actions during
the week-long Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings,
saying the government is ready to use the full force of the law
against them.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president said at a press conference in San
Carlos city that the government's policy of "maximum tolerance" in
dealing with Filipino anti-APEC groups did not apply to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Even local APEC critics may find it hard to fully ventilate
their sentiments during the APEC meetings, he said, adding that
the Philippine National Police have vowed to strictly enforce the
"no permit, no rally" rule.
</P>
<P>
"As far as foreigners are concerned, we must ensure that they
do not interfere or get involved in internal Philippine affairs,
especially political matters," the Philippine president said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos flew to the city to lead in the observance of the 100th
birth anniversary of the late Don Eugenio Perez, the last Speaker
of the Philippine Commonwealth and the first Speaker of the
Republic.

HAVANA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina said today that the vote in the United Nations General
Assembly, which called on the U.S. to scrap its blockade policy

to improvement in their bilateral relations.

Cuba will continue to resist as long as necessary.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mexican
President Ernesto Zedillo today reaffirmed his wish that his
country will become a member of the Southern Common Market
(Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Zedillo, who is in Argentina for a four-day visit, made the
remarks at a joint press conference with President Carlos Menem at
the end of their working meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican president who has signed a series of bilateral
cooperation agreements with Menem reiterated that Mexico is most
interested in developing new relations with Argentina and other
Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mexico is in favor of free trade throughout the
continent and that it is bolstering trade liberalization with
different countries and regions in the world, such as the European
Union, Asia, the Pacific and Central America.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "My Latin American conscience would not be at
peace if I did not make a serious effort, as president of Mexico,
to procure integration with Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay)."
</P>
<P>
President Menem also expressed the will of the Argentine
government to make headway in regional integration and anticipated
the formalization of consultations to bring Mexico closer to an
agreement with the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Menem said that progress will be made in the formalization of a
"four plus one" agreement with Mexico within the sphere of the
Mercosur and said he was confident that closer ties of that
country to the trade bloc will take root more rapidly over the
next few months.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. computer chip giant
Intel is to set up a 500 million U.S.-dollar microchip plant in
Costa Rica, the country's President Jose Maria Figueres announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The deal will "change things forever" in Costa Rica, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The plant, Intel's fourth overseas production base following
Malaysia, the Philippines and China, will generate 3,000 jobs when
it becomes fully operational in 1998, Intel officials say.
</P>
<P>
The venture will generate some 4 billion-dollars a year in
exports which will double the value of Costa Rica's current
exports.
</P>
<P>
The president said political stability, education and health
standards and the success of its macroeconomic policy in the
country were a major factor in Intel's investment decision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company has an 80 percent share of the world microchip
market in microchip, with sales expected to reach 17 billion
dollars this year, Figueres said.
</P>
<P>
For Costa Rica, whose economy is in recession, Intel's
announcement is an achievement of the greatest importance for the
Costa Rican administration, private sector sources said.
</P>
<P>
Companies hope that Intel's investment in the country will pave
the way for investments by other world-class high-tech companies.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Improves Technology for Rubbish-handling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is improving its
rubbish-handling technology and facilities to clean the Chinese
capital faster and keep it tidier.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Beijing Sanitation Administration (BSA) said
that 30 billion square meters of the city's streets, about 70
percent of the roadways, will be swept by machine-cleaners during
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved by the municipal government, can ease the
degree of manual labor now required and improve the safety
conditions of the workers cleaning the streets, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that, at present, 44 percent of Beijing's
streets are machine-swept, an increase of 13 percent since 1990,
the BSA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the city's streets are swept by workers whose daily
quota is 6,000 square meters of pavement. A mechanical
street-cleaner can sweep 210,000 square meters per day, equivalent
to the quotas of 35 workers.
</P>
<P>
Removal of Beijing's rubbish will also be made more efficient
ecologically, the officials said, by opening more waste-handling
plants.
</P>
<P>
The city discarded 4.74 million tons of rubbish last year,
13,000 tons a day. By the end of 2000, when Beijing will discard
5.4 million tons annually, BSA plans call for 60 percent of the
garbage to be converted to environmentally-sound uses.
</P>
<P>
The BSA will open large waste-handling plant in the northern
county of Changping by the end of this year to help its clean-up
drive.
</P>
<P>
The new plant will handle 300 tons of garbage a day. Covering
an area of 2.84 hectares, the plant incorporates the latest
waste-conversion technology and meets international design
standards.
</P>
<P>
The new disposal facility, together with four other disposal
projects under construction in Beijing, is expected to handle
2,100 tons of waste per day.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's first large waste-handling facility was built in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), Beijing
will complete the five garbage disposal projects located in
Fengtai and Chaoyang districts and Tongxian and Daxing counties.
</P>
<P>
They are being built with a German government investment of 39
million Deutsche marks (25.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government also loaned Beijing to help construct a
landfill at Haidian district's Liulitun area, which can treat
1,500 tons of garbage a day. The landfill will be completed by the
end of the century.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Intensify War against Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has
vowed to increase its efforts to control diabetes, China's third
deadliest chronic illness, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Health Minister Yin Dakui stressed Wednesday at a national
symposium to mark the World Diabetes Day that the ministry is
duty-bound to mobilize people from all walks of life to take part
in the fight against diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Only cancer and heart disease kill more Chinese, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The World Diabetes Day was started by the World Health
Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in
1991. The theme for this year is "Insulin for life."
</P>
<P>
A Canadian physician Frederick Banting was the first to obtain
a preparation of the hormone insulin in 1921. Since then, this
substance has saved the lives of many diabetics.
</P>
<P>
According to the IDF, there are more than 100 million diabetics
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In China alone there are an estimated 20 million patients, with
750,000 new cases each year.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than one percent of Chinese adults had diabetes in 1975,
but the figure has tripled over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
There are still many undiagnosed diabetics in the country,
about 60 percent of whom do not have their blood glucose levels
under control.
</P>
<P>
Health experts at the symposium said the risk of heart and
brain diseases in diabetic patients is three times higher than in
non-diabetics, and that the risk of developing lower limb
gangrene, kidney failure and blindness were respectively 5.17 and
25 times higher.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2.4 million US dollars is spent nationwide each
year to treat such patients, said Qian Rongli of the No. 1 Hospital
attached to Beijing Medical University.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Intel Corporation of the
United States yesterday announced it would invest 99 million
U.S. dollars in setting up a flash-memory chip manufacturing plant
in Shanghai, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, its subsidiary, the Intel (China)
Technology Limited (ICTL), will break ground today for the
U.S. company's first production site in China, which will be
located in Shanghai's Pudong Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone.
</P>
<P>
The plant will assemble the chips used in mobile phones,
digital cameras as well as in computers. Flash memory is so-named
because it retains information when turned off and can be
reprogrammed with new information.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Gerry Parker, executive vice-president and
general manager of Technology and Manufacturing for Intel Corp,
as saying that the Shanghai-based project is a critical part of
the Intel's long-term strategy to meet international demand for
flash memory chips.
</P>
<P>
The projected plant is expected to begin operation in
mid-1998. It will employ 500 people during the startup stage.
Intel expects to hire 90 percent of the plant's staff locally.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this project, Intel has branch offices in
Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to open offices in Xi'an, Chengdu, Shenyang
and Wuhan by early 1997.

<HEADLINE> Spain Beats Slovakia in World Cup Soccer Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Midfielders Raul Gonzalez and
Luis Enrique Martinez ignited Spain to a 4-1 victory over Slovakia
in a World Cup qualifying match in Teberife on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The result left Spain third in European group six with two
wins and a draw. They are two points behind Slovakia and five
behind Yugoslavia, who have won all their four games.
</P>
<P>
Julen Guerrero failed to finish off a well-worked move by the
Spaniards with just six minutes on the clock, while both Tibor
Jankula and Jaroslav Timko squandered chances after sloppiness in
the Spanish defence.
</P>
<P>
Spain took the lead through Barcelona striker Juan Pizzi who
tapped home at the end of a move by Guerrero and Luis Enrique.
</P>
<P>
But Slovakia levelled the score thanks to a well-struck
free-kick by midfielder Dusan Tittel.
</P>
<P>
Spain took the lead again immediately after the break when
Guillermo Amor finished off a fine move and Luis Enrique made it
3-1 with a curling shot 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
In the 61st minute, Slovak goalkeeper Alexander Vencel made a
serious error when he let a long-range shot from Fernando Hierro
through his legs.

BEIJING, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A car that runs without fuel
has travelled for over 2,400 kilometers in China, reaching speeds
of up to 80 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle's unique engine is powered entirely by sunshine -
and paves the way for the ultimate 'green' mode of transport for
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China's first solar-energy car has already made its road
debut, "China Environmental News" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sunshine car was designed and made by a research
group headed by scientist Yang Tingzhu, a member of the
International Solar Energy Society.
</P>
<P>
The car, fitted with solar panels instead of fuel tanks, can
convert solar energy into electrical energy, which is then used to
power the car.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the car is easy to handle and causes no
pollution. It is estimated that a solar-energy car can save 5,000
liters of petroleum a year.

LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- British sport is set to receive
a financial boost of 40 million pounds (about 65 million
U.S. dollars) after its dismal performance at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Rowers Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent won Britain's only

</P>
<P>
Some argued that British athletes did not receive enough
financial support.
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday The Sports Council will unveil World Class
Performance programme which will involve direct funding for
potential medallists, enabling them to train without having to
worry about paying bills.
</P>
<P>
It will provide more full-time coaches, identify young talent
and enable Britain to host major championships.
</P>
<P>
The cash comes from the National Lottery sports fund, which
previously was allowed to be used only for 'bricks and mortar'
projects like leisure centers and swimming pools.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Come Down in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Most of the money lenders
in New Zealand have cut their mortgage interest rates in the past
month in response to the drop on the wholesale money market.
</P>
<P>
All but three of the country's 28 lenders have slashed their
variable mortgage rates and more cuts could be on the way, says a
survey conducted by the Real Estate Institute.
</P>
<P>
At present, variable mortgages stay at around 9 percent,
compared with over 10 percent one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The main reason behind the drop is the falling wholesale 90-day
 bill rates, which the banks use to set their mortgages by plus
one to two percent margin. Fierce competition among the banks also
contributes to the lower mortgages.
</P>
<P>
However, Institute president Colin Brown was quoted by the New
Zealand Press Association today as saying that to date, house
sales volumes have not increased on account of the cuts.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Stress Most Likely Cause of Gulf War Ailments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. presidential panel
said today that the Gulf War ailments reported by veterans of the
war were most likely caused by stress.
</P>
<P>
The panel heard testimony from the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) that an intensive probe has ruled out all but one incident
as a likely cause of exposure during and after the 1991 U.S.-Iraqi
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"One of the major findings of the committee is that stress or
the physiological effects of stress is likely to be a major
factor," said Dr. John Baldeschwieler, one of the 12 members of
the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans'
Illnesses.
</P>
<P>
However, the panel said that the Pentagon and other government
agencies should continue examining the possibility that soldiers
were exposed to chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Gulf War veterans have reported a variety of
unexplained illnesses such memory loss, fatigue, diarrhea and
insomnia. Some blame the ailments, known collectively as Gulf War
syndrome, on exposure to Iraqi chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Veterans have complained that "stress" is merely a government
code word for the notion that they are faking their illnesses, or
that the problem is in their heads, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of a comprehensive review of the intelligence
that we have, we continue to conclude that Iraq did not use
chemical or biological weapons during the Gulf War," CIA
Executive Director Nora Slatkin told a presidential commission
examining the issue.
</P>
<P>
The CIA findings show that only a small fraction of the 700,000
soldiers who served in the Gulf could have been exposed to
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Slatkin said that air strikes on two chemical weapons
facilities in northern Iraq released some chemical agents into the
atmosphere, but no U.S. or allied troops were exposed as they were
far from the sites.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of a weapons storage bunker in southern Iraq in
March 1991 also released deadly sarin into the atmosphere. But the
CIA said the gas cloud blew away by wind from U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
But the CIA continues to investigate a second destruction of an
open pit at Kamisiyah in which chemical weapons were blown up.
</P>
<P>
"The pit event is of particular concern because of the greater
possibility of the risk of exposure of U.S. troops," Slatkin said.
"In the case of the pit area, a larger amount of agent was
released into the atmosphere and evaporation was slower."
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 U.S. troops served in the Gulf. The Pentagon said
20,800 soldiers within 31 miles of the pit could have suffered
acute affects of gas exposure.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Leader Meets IFOR Commander on Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President
Biljana Plavsic held talks today with commanders of the NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) over the conflict with Muslim
refugees in northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held in the Serb capital of Pale between Plavsic
and IFOR Commander William Crouch and IFOR ground troops Commander
Gen. Michael Walker, focused on a recent incursion by armed
Muslims into the Serb region of Koraj, on Majevica hills, in
northern Bosnia, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by international police force
commissary Peter Fitzgerald and assistant High Representative for
Bosnia Michael Steiner.
</P>
<P>
Around 600 Muslim refugees crossed the inter-ethnic border
Monday on their way into the Serb village of Gajevi near Koraj.
Two Bosnian Serb policemen were wounded and two Muslims were
killed during gunfire shooting that erupted between Serbs and
Muslims Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Serb Majevica radio in nearby Lopari village said today
that Muslim civilians were assembling on the other side of the
border near Koraj, causing fears among the local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international mediators in Bosnia said today that
the refugee repatriation program had been suspended along the
four-km inter-ethnic border line separating Bosnia's former
warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Colum Murphy, spokesman for the international community's High
Representative Carl Bildt, said the repatriation program had been
suspended due to serious violations of the repatriation accord by
the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Brett Boudrea also said the Muslims had provoked
the incident and there was firm evidence to show the involvement
of the Muslim army in the incident, according to the Tanjug
report.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Canada, Chile to Sign Free Trade Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada and Chile are on the
brink of signing a bilateral free trade agreement as the two
countries prepare for the arrival of Chilean President Eduardo
Frei this weekend on a delayed visit here.
</P>
<P>
Announcing Frei's November 17-19 visit today, Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien said the visit is "an excellent
opportunity" to "continue work towards achieving a free trade
accord."
</P>
<P>
"Ottawa is aiming to have the deal ready to be signed" by
Chretien and Frei this weekend, the Financial Post newspaper said
today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a deal in place when Frei arrives," Charles
Larabie, a spokesman for Canada's International Trade Department
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Frei's visit was originally scheduled for September,
but was postponed after trade negotiations broke down over the
Chilean capital regulations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Chilean rule, foreign investors must deposit 30
percent of the capital they bring into the country with Chile's
central bank. The cash must remain there for one year and no
interest is paid, said local media reports.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the snags, the two countries accelerated the
negotiations over the past two months, which resulted in Ottawa
agreeing to drop its opposition to Chile's capital regulations.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral free trade accord, which is designed to be
compatible with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
immediately sweeps away tariffs on two-thirds of the trade between
the two countries. The remaining duties will be reduced over 18
years.
</P>
<P>
The Canada-Chile trade is not very impressive. Last year, the
two-way trade totaled 485 million U.S. dollars. The main items of
Canadian exports are grains, machinery, minerals and paper, while
Chile sends to Canada fruits and nuts, copper, wine and fish and
seafood.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Chile is seen as a market that's rifle with potential,
especially by Canadian mining, energy and pulp and paper firms,
the Globe and Mail newspaper said recently.
</P>
<P>
Canada now ranks as one of the largest foreign investors in
Chile, with investments of more than 3.65 billion dollars either
in place or pending.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here say that forging a bilateral free trade
pact is not an end by itself. The two countries are clearly hoping
to finally bring Chile into the NAFTA, which now groups Canada,
Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Talks aimed at including Chile as the fourth partner in the
NAFTA fell apart some 18 months ago after the U.S. Congress
declined to give the Clinton administration the authority to
negotiate new trade deals.
</P>
<P>
In this circumstance, Canada and Chile opted to pursue a
bilateral accord with each other -- an agreement that's seen by
both countries as an interim measure, the analysts say.

NEW YORK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Deaths from cancer in the
United States are dropping steadily for the first time in at least
60 years, which has led experts to declare true progress in the
war on cancer.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was made by researchers working at the
University of Alabama, Birmingham, who uncovered a five-year
trend.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Government validated the Alabamans' finding today,
saying the overall cancer mortality dropped 3 percent between 1990
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The decline in mortality was greater for men, who showed a 4.3
percent drop, than for women, at 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that though the drop is not so big,
it was the first sustained drop since national record-keeping
began in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The news comes on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the war on
cancer. And many doctors anticipate cancer will overtake heart
disease to become the top killer by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> (Rpt With Details) US to Participate in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
willing to participate, "in a limited fashion," in an
international relief operation in eastern Zaire following
consulting with world leaders over the deteriorating situation
there, the White House announced today.
</P>
<P>
Press secretary Mike McCurry said about 5,000 U.S. troops would
be involved in the entire humanitarian mission, while roughly
1,000 would be inside in Zaire. the American troops will be under
U.S. command, although the operation will be run by a Canadian.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said President Bill Clinton talked this morning with
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien through telephone and this
was "a culmination of several days of work that have involved
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and others."
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, a delegation of senior Canadian officials met
with a U.S. delegation headed by Lake. The meeting resulted in a
general agreement on the mission definition and command and
control arrangements, and the duration of the mission.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was followed by the telephone conversation
between Chretien and Clinton, which "led the president to decide
that the United States is willing, in principle, to participate
in a limited fashion in this humanitarian mission, as long as
certain conditions are stipulated to," McCurry said at a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The conditions include:
</P>
<P>
-- The mission will last about four months. But then the U.S.
will examine whether more time or troops are needed to keep the
situation from exploding again;
</P>
<P>
-- The international force will have "very robust rules of
engagement;"
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. mission will not include disarming militants or
forcing entry in Zaire; and
</P>
<P>
-- The cost of the mission will be borne by participating
states.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry said U.S. troops would provide
security at the Goma airport and along a three-mile corridor from
the airport into Kigali. And the force would be anchored by
infantry troops, who would also have assault helicopters assigned
to the units.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials have been attempting to work out some form
of assistance in providing relief aid while avoiding a repetition
of the Somalian intervention in which 18 U.S. soldiers were killed
in a Mogadishu fire fight in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Urges Equal Financial Aid to Bosnian Entities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The equal distribution of
international financial aid to the two entities in Bosnia is the
basic condition for the possible repatriation of refugees to
Republika Srpska, a Serbian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Serbian commissariat for refugees Aleksandar
Radovanovic told the local press that at the demand of Serbian
Commissioner for Refugees Bratislava Morina, a meeting had been
scheduled for November 19 with U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Yugoslav delegation will inform Ogata about
the realistic possibilities for the repatriation of refugees from
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to Bosnia, primarily to
Republika Srpska, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 600,000 refugees from Bosnia and Croatia
seeking asylum in Yugoslavia, which is comprised of Serbia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no large-scale repatriation, such as the UNHCR
planned, without large funds, and it is clear that these funds do
not exist. This is why we will demand the distribution of
international financial aid for the two entities -- the
Muslim-Croat federation and Republika Srpska -- in the ratio of
51:49," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Radovanovic said this will enable Serb refugees in Yugoslavia
to return to Bosnia, which is currently the only possible form of
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the entire region, especially Yugoslavia, to remain
the humanitarian priority of U.N. agencies, although there are
indications that a certain number of humanitarian organizations
from the U.N. system, as well as the humanitarian bureau of the
European Union, could withdraw in 1997, giving up their role to
various non-government organizations and associations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal of the leading humanitarian agencies has
already been felt by the 650,000 refugees in Yugoslavia through
the significant reduction of the entire humanitarian aid in this
year," he said.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Move Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks finished
higher today, setting a sixth straight record for the Dow Jones
industrial average, at the news that the Federal Reserve kept
short-term interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rallied more than 20 points in the moments after the
Fed made its announcement, which was in line with investors'
prediction.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose 8.20 points to 6,274.24 at the closing.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 428.18 million, as
against 471.73 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.58 points to
731.14, and the NYSE's composite index rose 0.73 to 386.91.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.18 to 1,258.71 and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 2.67 to 584.31.
</P>
<P>
The Fed surprised many observers in September when it left its
key short-term interest rates steady, rather than raise them as an
economic brake to prevent inflation from accelerating.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported today that wholesale prices rose
0.4 percent in October, mainly due to spikes in food and energy
costs. Excluding food and energy, the Producer Price Index was
down 0.3 percent, the biggest drop since a 0.4 percent decline in
October 1994.

<HEADLINE> Irish Government Survives Vote of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (xinhua) -- The Irish government won a vote
of confidence in Dublin this evening over a legal blunder which
briefly released some top security prisoners, according to reports
from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing coalition government, which has a five-seat
majority in the House of Representatives, won the vote 79-70 after
two days' heated debate with opposition parties calling on Justice
Minister Nora Owen to resign.
</P>
<P>
This is the first vote of confidence in the coalition
government, led by Prime Minister John Bruton, since it came to
power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The vote was called after 16 top-security prisoners, including
an important Irish Republican Army suspect, were released from
custody last week because of a major mix-up over the legality of a
Special Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
Judge Dominic Lynch, who did not know that he had been removed
from his duties, was charged that he had no judicial powers and
the court was unconstitutional, leading to a brief release of the
prisoners, who were immediately re-arrested.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of three loans
totaling 84.8 million U.S. dollars for Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
The resources also include financing on concessional terms to
back the peace process and national conciliation.
</P>
<P>
Two loans totaling 50 million dollars equivalent are designed
to help rebuild physical, human and social capital in areas that
were damaged by civil war during the previous two decades. The two
loans represent the first IDB financing of a trust fund of the
Community Development for Peace Program.
</P>
<P>
Previous IDB loans to support the peace process include 42.3
million dollars approved in July for small-scale social investment
projects in low-income communities and 150 million dollars
approved in 1995 to build, rehabilitate and maintain roads in
areas cut off by guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
A third loan of 34.8 million dollars will help improve
sanitation and environmental management in the Guatemala City
metropolitan area. The total cost of the program is some 43.6
million dollars. Local counterpart will fund the remaining 8.8
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Frankfurt Hits New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with Frankfurt closing at a new record high,
and London and Paris both finishing in the negative grounds.
</P>
<P>
New worries over higher interest rates aroused by today's
surprisingly steep drop in the official jobless data and strong
unit wage costs as well as a soft Wall Street opening held back
British shares on the London market, which ended 7.4 points lower
at 3,926.9.
</P>
<P>
Traders were also very cautious before the rate-setting U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
French shares in Paris also closed in the minus column, with
the CAC-40 share index down 11.94 points at 2,217.19.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the government's sale of a big tranche of
shares in Elf had added to consolidation pressures.
</P>
<P>
However, in Frankfurt stocks extended Tuesday's rally and
closed at a new peak of 2,773.43, 39.13 points higher on the
DAX-30 index and breaching the previous record set last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers pointed in part to the strengthening dollar, which was
regarded as helping exports.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 leading British shares ended 7.4 points down
at 3,926.9. The Paris CAC-40 share index finished 11.94 points
lower at 2,217.19. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index closed up 39.13
at 2,773.42.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Cease in Northern Bosnian Village Gajevi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The situation was calm today
in northern Bosnia around the village of Gajevi in Republika
Srpska on the border with the Muslim-Croat Federation, the Brcko
police station said.
</P>
<P>
Around 600 armed Muslims who crossed the inter-entity border
Monday into Gajevi were forced to retreat after fighting broke out
and the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) intervened.
</P>
<P>
A Serb policeman was wounded and another Serb civilian injured
in the exchange of gunfire with Muslims Tuesday, the Tanjug news
agency quoted police sources as saying. But there were no other
incursions of armed Muslims or shooting incidents today.
</P>
<P>
During the shooting incident, two Muslim men were killed and
several others wounded as returning Muslim refugees were driven
from the disputed village by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Gajevi is located in an area called Zone of Separation, a band
of former front-line territory stretching more than 1,000 km
across Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Serb Radio Majevica in the nearby town of Lopari, however,
reported today that Muslim civilians were again rallying on the
other side of the border near the town of Koraja, according to
Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
The radio also said Serb civilians in border towns on Mt.
Majevica were disturbed, fearing similar incidents.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Awarded Liberator Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier was awarded a
Liberator Medal, the supreme honorary medal in Venezuela, by
Venezuelan President Rafael Calder here today for the important
role and outstanding performance in the leadership of China.
</P>
<P>
"Li Peng is a noted leader of China which plays an important
role in international affairs," President Calder said at the
awarding ceremony prior to the banquet given by him in honor of
the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
China is now opening to the outside world, which is of
important significance to the world, he said. The awarding of the
medal to Li Peng is to indicate the respect of the Venezuelan
government and people for the government and people of China,
Calder said.
</P>
<P>
With the wisdom of the Chinese people imbued with thousands of
years of civilization, China will be built even better and will
make greater contribution to mankind in terms of economic,
cultural, and scientific and technological development, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan government attaches great importance to Premier
Li's ongoing trip which will undoubtedly help enhance the friendly
relationship between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the awarding of the medal to him not only is
a great honor of himself but also indicates the feeling of the
Venezuelan people towards the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
His talks with the president this morning are fruitful, Li Peng
said, adding that he believes his visit here will play a positive
role in pushing ahead the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China gives much heed to its relations with Venezuela and the
signing of the four agreements this morning could well serve as
one of the evidences, Li Peng said.

<HEADLINE> US Improves Market-Opening Offer in WTO Telecom Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- As a joint initiative along
with the European Union to resuscitate the multilateral
telecommunications negotiations, the United States announced
today an improved offer to liberalize its telecom markets.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move came after the tabling of an improved
market-opening offer by the EU a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang announced today
in Geneva that the U.S. had removed the restriction limiting market
access to submarine cable landing licenses.
</P>
<P>
"As a result," he said, "if the negotiations succeed, the U.S.
will provide national treatment to WTO (World Trade Organization)
members with regard to access to licenses to land submarine cables
in accordance with its laws and regulations."
</P>
<P>
This is the third time the U.S. has improved its offer in the
WTO telecom negotiations. Previous improvements included market
access and national treatment in the local telecom services market
and adoption of a set of agreed regulatory principles to govern
the telecom sector.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also revised its offer so that it is technology
neutral, would the services be provided through cable or
satellite, and includes all market segments of basic telecom
services.
</P>
<P>
The telecom talks, being held under the auspices of the WTO for
over two years, had been due to end in April. They were extended
to another deadline of February 15 next year to reach a global
deal after the U.S. refused to open its market because of what it
considered to be inadequate offers from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Lang said, "There is not much time left to conclude these
negotiations and significant progress must be made by the
Singapore Ministerial Conference (of the WTO) if we are to succeed
in February." The first WTO ministerial meeting is due to be held
on December 9-13.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed the improvements in the EU offer, saying, "The
revised U.S. and European offers provide a solid basis for the
U.S. and the EU to obtain more and better offers from other WTO
members at Singapore."

<HEADLINE> Perry Orders All-Military Examination of Sexual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry has ordered the Navy and Air Force to investigate
their training programs for any signs of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Perry gave the command following reports of rape, sexual
harassment and other improper relationships at Army bases between
female trainees and their male instructors or commanders.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said today that Perry and
Deputy Defense Secretary John White have asked Navy Secretary John
Dalton and Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall to review their
training procedures.
</P>
<P>
They also asked all three service secretaries, including Army
Secretary Togo West, to report on how their units "communicated
the resolve not to tolerate sexual harassment or unprofessional
relationships at any level of command."
</P>
<P>
Last week, four drill instructors and a captain at the Army's
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland were charged with raping,
sexually harassing or having improper contact with 19 young women
recruits. The five officers were suspended along with 15 other
instructors.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an Army drill sergeant at Fort Leonard Wood in
Missouri pleaded guilty to having consensual sex with three female
trainees and attempting to have sex with a fourth recruit.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the alarming degree of sexual misconduct in the
bases, U.S. military leaders decided to carry out a thorough
investigation into the Army bases.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Shalikashvili
announced Tuesday that the Army was casting a wide net to
determine how serious a sexual misconduct problem it has.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly have to assume that it could be happening
somewhere else," Shalikashvili said on CBS's "This Morning." "And
that's why the Army is casting its net very wide all across the
Army, and certainly all training centers, to get the bottom of
this."
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Maryland incidents, a toll-free Army hot
line was set up last Thursday to field complaints of sexual
misconduct throughout the service. Within four days, nearly 2,000
complaint calls were received, of which 145 have been deemed
serious enough by criminal investigators to warrant further
inquiry, according to a Washington Post report.
</P>
<P>
In a survey sent to 90,000 female soldiers, sailors and fliers
by the Pentagon last year, nearly one in 10 Army women reported
being sexually assaulted, and six in 10 said they had experienced
some form of what they considered sexual harassment, The New York
Times said today, quoting the Defense Advisory Committee on Women
in the Services.
</P>
<P>
An Army spokesman said Tuesday that inspections would be made
at all of the Army's 17 training centers, which train about 60,000
recruits a year.

<HEADLINE> US Westinghouse to Split Into Two Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Pittsburgh-based
Westinghouse Electric Corp. is splitting into two separate
broadcast and industrial companies, the company announced today.
</P>
<P>
The move came one day following the Justice Department gave
the green light Tuesday to Westinghouse's merger with Infinity
Broadcasting which could merge into the country's largest radio
group. The approval was offered on the condition that they sell
off one station in Philadelphia and another in Boston.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse, the nation's No. 8 largest electronic and
electrical equipment company, bought CBS in a 5.4 billion dollar
deal last year and is buying Infinity Broadcasting by 3.9 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
By spinning off industrial sections and focusing on
broadcasting, Westinghouse hopes it will be able to increase
profits faster than if it held onto its industrial half, which
includes nuclear power generators and refrigerator manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse's industrial and media businesses are roughly
equal in size, with an annual sale of about 5 billion dollars, but
the media side accounts for most of the stock's value.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Westinghouse has grown into a media company
with 16 TV stations reaching one-third of the nation and 77 radio
stations in 13 markets. The newly-formed broadcasting company will
consist of CBS Inc., the largest television and radio broadcaster;
Group W Satellite Communications Co., a leading cable television
marketer and distributor; and Infinity Broadcasting, when that
acquisition is completed.
</P>
<P>
The media company will be called Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
while the industrial company is to take the name Westinghouse
Electric Co., but will be commonly referred to as WELCO.
</P>
<P>
The 4.6 billion dollar industrial business is to maintain its
headquarters in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
As part of the breakup, Westinghouse is getting rid of its
Security Systems businesses and restructuring its Pittsburgh
corporate headquarters and other industrial businesses to slash
overhead and operating costs. About 1,100 jobs, or about 5 percent
of WELCO's workforce, will be eliminated for the reconstruction of
the company.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Contribute Troops to Zaire Relief Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government
announced here today that Britain is ready to contribute troops to
a multinational relief operation in Zaire, according to a Downing
Street statement.
</P>
<P>
Senior British government ministers held a meeting earlier
today to discuss the worsening situation in Zaire and expressed
Britain's willingness to take part in the international relief
action.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers agreed the UK should be ready to contribute
constructively to the international response, including to a
multinational force, providing a satisfactory plan can be worked
out," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that the British government is
"discussing urgently with other potential contributors the scale
and nature of the response."
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major told reporters this evening
that "we will contribute, we will definitely send troops," because
of the heavy death toll among the hundreds of thousands of
refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, Major noted that there were still many details to be
worked out, including the number of troops to be sent, the scope
of the mission and the "exit strategy."
</P>
<P>
A BBC television report quoted a government source as saying
that one part of the international response would be to increase
food supplies to accessible concentration of refugees around Goma
and Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
British troops may also help in the long-term aims to get aid
to less accessible parts of the region and help refugees return
home, the report said.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Decides to Keep Interest Rates Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) decided today to leave the short-term interest rates
unchanged at a time when the U.S. economy is moderating and
inflation is not a threat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed's policy-maker, the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC), ended its meeting today without any explanation for its
decision. It merely said its meeting had ended and there would be
no further announcement, signaling that rates were left stable.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts had predicted the FOMC would leave short-term
rates unchanged since the the U.S. economy appeared to be slowing
and prices remained restrained in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey by the U.S. Fed on its 12 reserve districts
also showed that the economic expanding was moderate and reports
on the rising of price pressure were limited.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product slowed to just 2.2 percent in the
third quarter of this year following a big increase of 4.7
percent annual rate in the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The FOMC has not changed rates since last January when it cut
the federal fund rate, the rate banks charge each other for
overnight loans, by a quarter-point to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although many analysts said the U.S. Fed is also likely to hold
rates unchanged at its final policy-making meeting of 1996 on
December 17, some also predicted that the Fed eventually will have
to raise interest rates slightly as a guarantee against inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) Monday also urged the U.S. Fed to take out "some
insurance." The Paris-based organization said an error in caution
would not jeopardize the economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
But President Bill Clinton's chief economist, Joseph Stiglitz,
disagreed with the recommendation. He said that OECD economists
failed to fully explore changes in the U.S. economy that allow the
U.S. to enjoy lower unemployment without inflation.
</P>
<P>
The FOMC is composed of the seven Fed governors in Washington
and the presidents of five of the Fed's 12 regional banks.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Calls for Solidarity in Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri today called for solidarity in his new government which
includes several cabinet members opposing his policy.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks in a ceremony of assuming the post of
minister of posts and telecommunication, which he assigned himself
in the Lebanese government formed last week. The government was
the third headed by Hariri since he came to power in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said the country was impossible to make progress if the
Council of Ministers is not solidary.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old prime minister had said that he wanted to form
a government free from internal opposition and disputes, but he
apparently failed to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
There are at least four ministers in the new government who
are widely believed Hariri's potential opponents.
</P>
<P>
Walid Jumblatt, a former ally of the prime minister, made a
180-degree turn before Hariri's third government was formed and
launched a scathing campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
"I'll carry my opposition into the government until parliament
regains its role as watchdog on government's political and
financial performance," Jumblatt said.
