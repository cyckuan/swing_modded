<HEADLINE> Vietnam Attaches Importance to Friendship with Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Communist
Party of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu said Friday Vietnam attaches
importance to friendship and multi-faceted cooperation with the
Congo and other traditional friends in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Phieu made the remarks when he met here with Denis Sassou-
Nguesso, president of the Republic of the Congo, who is on a two-
day official visit to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Party leader said that the Party, Government and
people of Vietnam will never forget the support granted to them by
the Congolese people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
also met the Congolese president, saying Vietnam attaches
importance to traditional ties with African nations, including the
Congo, and is ready to embark on cooperation for mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Khai said he hoped that the current visit by the Congolese
leader will contribute to the enhancement of bilateral economic,
cultural, scientific and technological cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Khai said both Vietnam and the Congo are developing countries
and members of the non-aligned movement, therefore they should
unite to boost national construction and protect the common
interests of poor nations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two countries should define necessary
projects to boost bilateral cooperation, particularly in
agricultural production, animal husbandry, food production and
industrial crop plantation based on the freshly signed framework
Agreement on Economic, Cultural, Scientific and Technical
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sassou hoped that bilateral economic and trade ties between the
two countries would be boosted after his visit and that Vietnam
would soon send its experts in education and health care to the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Sassou later told a press conference here that he was satisfied
with the results of his visit to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Sassou arrived here Thursday at the invitation of Vietnamese
State President Tran Duc Luong. He ends his visit to Vietnam on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Breathalyzer Tests for Fans to Be Contact in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Spanish police plan to use
Breathalyzer test for fans to subject any seemingly drunken or
violent fans before next week's European Champions quarterfinal
battle between Real Madrid and Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 police will be on duty in and around Madrid's
Santiago Bernabeu for the "high-risk" quarterfinal first leg
Tuesday, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the breathalyzer tests were on the cards but
precise details on the security plans would be decided on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sports papers say police intend halting any fan entering the
stadium who tests above a blood-alcohol limit of 0.8 degrees,
slightly above Spain's legal drink driving limit of 0.5.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,700 tickets have been allotted for fans of Manchester
United, the defending champion, for the game but police fear many
more fans will arrive in the Spanish capital without tickets as
some 90,000 spectators are expected to come.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon May Ask Syria Troops to South after Israeli Exit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has indicated that it could
ask Syria troops to garrison south Lebanon in the event of a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ghazi Zuetir on Friday rejected the idea of
inviting a multinational force to keep peace after Israel's
evacuation from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said in a speech that Lebanon would "ask the Syrian army to
deploy with Lebanese forces in region they take over", informed
resources reported.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker in the neighboring country,
stations some 350,000 troops in Lebanon. Its peace talks with
Israel broke off in January over Syrian's insistence on a full
Israeli return of the Golan Heights, a demand rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled 15-kilometer-deep security zone
in 1985 in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern border from cross-border guerrilla attacks. But lebanese
guerrillas have turned the zone into a nightmare, in which hundreds
of Israeli soldiers have been killed in a war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
Early last month Israeli cabinet endorsed Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's plan to pull out troops from south Lebanon by July,
apparently pessimistic over a withdrawal within the framework of a
peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have repeatedly reiterated the simultaneity of
their two peace tracks with Israel. Israel's unilateral pullback
would deprive Syria of a major bargaining chip in negotiation to
take back its Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Syria, together with Iran, supports Lebanese resistance
guerrillas in their fighting to end the 22-year Israeli occupation
in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Debts Blamed for Hindering African Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary general of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) has blamed the heavy debts on the African
countries for hindering the economic development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim told reporters Saturday before a meeting by
African foreign ministers that most of the efforts made by African
countries in economic reforms are undermined by the issue of debts.
</P>
<P>
The African foreign ministers met to coordinate their stances on
the subjects due to be discussed during the upcoming two-day
Africa-Europe summit, scheduled to open in the Egyptian capital
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first-ever summit under the aegis of the OAU and the
European Union (EU) is to deal with the economic, political and
social issues in Africa and bilateral cooperation in these fields.
</P>
<P>
The (OAU) has been advocating cut or writing off of African
debts because even if most African countries wish to repay their
debts, they unfortunately do not have the ability, Salim said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief called for a dialog with European countries, which
are major creditor nations, in a bid to lead the Europeans to
better understanding of this issue.
</P>
<P>
Africa can make "meaningful economic and social progress, if the
issue of debt is addressed," he said, noting that Africa has become
an active partner in the global system.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the conditions imposed by the European states,
including democratization and human rights, in return for economic
assistance, Salim said the African states have made tremendous
efforts in political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Africa has faith in human rights and democratization as these
are regarded as logical extension of the African struggle for
freedom, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that the European partners are able to assist
Africa at this point of transition as reforms made on the political
and economic arena can not bear fruit without such assistance," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Armed Forces, U.S. Marines Launch Joint Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Marines of the United States'
15th Fleet Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) began on Saturday a
joint and combined training, dubbed "Eager Mace 2000", with Kuwaiti
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The MEU marines conducted an amphibious landing at a site in
Northern Kuwait earlier in the day, the official Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti-U.S. joint exercise, which will last until April 25,
includes amphibious, ground, air and naval training.
</P>
<P>
MEU forces will join with Kuwaiti naval forces in a mock assault
on a uninhabited island to "demonstrate their combined sea and land
warfare operational capability."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the U.S. signed a 10-year defense cooperation
agreement shortly after a U.S.-led multinational force freed Kuwait
of Iraqi occupation in February 1991.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, U.S. and Kuwaiti troops conducted joint war
games almost every year since 1991, which aimed to strengthen
military relations, improve readiness and interoperability between
the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant David Romley of the U.S. Marines said that Eager Mace
is a regular training, in which there are 2,100 marines on board
three ships and about 1,400 of them will get trained on shore.
</P>
<P>
William Monroe, Charge D'affaires at the U.S. Embassy here, said
the marines were trained in desert palms in the U.S. state of
California, but it was not like in the desert of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Monroe said a joint training is a good opportunity for the
marines to see the capabilities of both sides.
</P>
<P>
For his part, MEU Commander Colonel Richard Zilmer, the U.S.
marines spent nearly a year getting ready to come to the Gulf and
train with the Kuwaiti forces.
</P>
<P>
He said the training as a team began in August last year, adding
the marines were deployed from southern California in January and
are scheduled to return in late July.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Discuss Interim Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators discussed here Saturday the interim issues, but no
agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Chief Negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Saeb Erekat met for several hours here in the afternoon
and discussed the opening of the north safe passage route linking
Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of Ramallah, the release of more
Palestinian prisoners and Israel's further troop redeployment in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed last September in
Egypt, Israel has opened the south safe passage linking Gaza and
the West Bank city of Hebron, released over 380 Palestinian
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
It also carried out three phases of troop redeployments in the
West Bank with the latest on March 21, transferring 18.1 percent
more of he West Bank to the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
So far, 60 percent of the Palestinian population and around 40
percent of the West Bank have been under the Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian side believes under the Oslo Peace Accord signed in
1993 Israel has to transfer all West Bank territories except Jewish
settlements and military areas to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long talks at the Bolling Air Base near
Washington which ended Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
failed to reach an agreement on the scope of the land transfer.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will meet again at Bolling Air Base Thursday to
further discuss the third and final redeployment and final issues
including the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, borders and
Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Africa-Europe Summit Springboard for Partnership: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Saturday that the Africa-Europe summit, due to kick off
here on Monday, marks a springboard for partnership, not just an
end.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the African foreign ministers' preparatory meeting
for the two-day summit, Moussa said that Africa is looking forward
to "a constructive and stable partnership" with Europe, especially
when Africa is passing through transitional phase, in which
economic, social and political reforms are underway.
</P>
<P>
"The summit is for the benefit of Africa as well as Europe," he
said, adding that the African foreign ministers want at present to
lay down strong foundations for this partnership.
</P>
<P>
The summit, sponsored by the Organization of African Unity and
the European Union, is to discuss economic, political and social
development issues and bilateral cooperation in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the African foreign ministers' preparatory
meeting said the gathering was aimed at crystallizing a unified
African position regarding issues tabled on the agenda of the
Africa-Europe summit.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the African ministers have come to agreement on most
issues, adding that the remaining minor problems could soon be
thrashed out.
</P>
<P>
"We would certainly crystallize a unified and wise African
position regarding discussions with the European side," added
Moussa.
</P>
<P>
While the Europeans see the conference as a mainly political
event, seeking to put African conflict prevention, good governance,
democracy and human rights issues in the limelight, African
countries are equally determined to include in the summit agenda
the critical and key questions of economic and social development
and aid.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Museum to Be Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Museum, which has been
closed since the 1991 Gulf War, is to be reopened here this month,
Hana Abdul-Ghafour, director of the museum, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-decorated Iraqi Museum, the largest in the country,
has a vast collection of original cultural and historical relics
that record Mesopotamia's history of more than 9,000 years.
</P>
<P>
It has also on display a variety of cultural and archaeological
articles unearthed in recent years, said the director.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, its reopening itself is a clear
message to the whole world that the Iraqi people are determined to
keep up their ancient civilization, and to live in peace "despite
the continuous aggressions by the U.S. and Britain."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under the crippling U.N. sanctions imposed after
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which triggered the devastating
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its Western allies set up no-fly zones in Iraq in
the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, allegedly to protect the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
persecution.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the museum will also serve as a gift for
President Saddam Hussein's birthday, which falls on April 28, said
the director.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Turkish Ruling Coalition Faces Threat of Reshuffle By Xing Guoxin Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The mass defections in Turkish Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit's own coalition may led to a government
shakeup.
</P>
<P>
The division was ostensible when Ecevit-promoted constitutional
amendment met strong resistance, much from his own coalition, in
the parliament Wednesday in the first vote on the bill, which aims
to give President Suleyman Demirel a second term in office, but cut
from the current seven years to five years.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, composed of Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP),
Mesut Yilmaz-led Motherland Party (ANAP) and Deputy Prime Minister
Devlet Bahceli's Nationalist Action Party (MHP), controls 352 votes
in the 550-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the bill garnered only 303 "yes" votes Wednesday, much lower
than the expected 400, due to the mavericks of the Motherland Party
(ANAP).
</P>
<P>
According to Turkey's Constitution, a bill must be voted on
twice before legislated. In the second vote slated for April 5, the
proposal can be signed by the president into law if getting 367
votes. If it gets 330 votes, or three-fifths, it must be referred
to a national referendum before becoming law.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Wednesday vote, speculations that a move has
started for a new "minus-ANAP coalition government" run high.
</P>
<P>
Pending his official visit to India on Thursday, Ecevit said
that he was considering all options including resignation in case
of another setback in the second vote.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were believed by political analysts as an indication
that the premier has started calculating the pros and cons of
pushing ANAP out of his coalition and taking in the opposition True
Path Party (DYP) of Tansu Ciller, who gave supports for the bill.
According to the current presidential election procedures,
parliament will have to elect a new president before May 16 when
Demirel's term in office expires.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit wants Demirel kept in office because he fears inter-party
rivalry over a successor could undermine his left-right coalition
and compromise IMF-backed economic reforms designed to rid Turkey
of the scourge of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has been criticizing the economy management of the
country for some time, blaming the economic decline to bad
administration by ANAP ministers, mainly in charge of economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's gross national product (GNP) shrank by a record 6.4
percent in 1999 as compared to a 3.8 percent growth in the previous
year, the State Institute of Statistics showed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday meeting between Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister
Husamettin Ozkan, the right-hand-man of Ecevit, further boosted the
speculation that Ecevit was planning to invite the DYP to join the
government, local press has reported.
</P>
<P>
Ciller flatly dismissed the allegation Friday, saying her DYP's
support for the constitutional amendment proposal was "
unconditional."
</P>
<P>
She stressed that she did not intend to join the coalition when
she offered the unconditional support the coalition's
constitutional amendment package, nor has she received such an
offer by Ecevit or Ozkan, adding that her meeting with Ozkan was on
current "routine" issues.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's statement was viewed in political circles as an offer
by the DYP leader to support the government from the outside if
Ecevit tries to "get rid of ANAP" and continue his government as a
minority coalition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Yilmaz said that he would not touch on issues
concerning the coalition government or the constitutional amendment
package until Ecevit returns from India on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ANAP leaders on Friday also ruled out a government
crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that the number of ANAP deputies deciding to
support the constitutional amendment package in the second ballot
is on rise for remaining in the coalition. The coalition leaders
are expected to meet on Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said it is still an uphill task for Ecevit to
secure a three-fifths majority in the second vote despite the
reduced resistance from the ANAP.
</P>
<P>
Analysts affirmed that the government would still need the
support of the main opposition Islamist Virtue Party (FP) for the
eventual approval of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
Technically, Ecevit may buy some more time by postponing the
second vote for another few weeks, but the deadline for the start
of presidential elections process on April 16 limited the room in
which the Turkish premier can maneuver.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Ship Rescued After Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish cargo ship "Huseyin Avci",
which carried minerals and collided with the Lebanese-flagged cargo
ship "Poylak" early Saturday, was saved from sinking, the Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As the investigation into the accident was under way, the
Turkish ship was tugged to Ahirkapi shore in Marmara Sea and
anchored there for repair.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese-flagged ship without damage still stayed in the
Black Sea entrance, waiting for conclusion of legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese-flagged ship, which was sailing with an empty hull
from Greece to Ukraine, ran into the Turkish ship when passing the
Bosphorus Strait for the Black Sea because of heavy fog.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ship leaned over to one side after water flew in
from the first hold hit by the Lebanese ship, but it was saved from
sinking after the water was discharged by the crew in a short time.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Lebanese ship was changing its route to
the east direction when it collided with the Turkish-flagged ship.
</P>
<P>
According to passage rules, which regulate ships passing through
the Bosphorus Strait, the Lebanese-flagged ship should go to north
through the five miles (eight kilometers) security route.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. in Talks on Rerouting of Toxic Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada is in talks with the U.S.
military on the rerouting of a Vancouver-bound shipload of toxic
waste from U.S. facilities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Canada's National Post newspaper Saturday quoted Environment
Minister David Anderson as saying that Canadian officials "are
currently discussing alternatives with the United States
Department of Defense" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Canada hopes that the two sides will agree to have a change in
the proposal put forward "to ship this waste to Canada" on April 7,
as previously scheduled, indicated the minister who was reporting
to the House of Commons Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the rerouting of toxic waste came amid strong
opposition from Greenpeace activists in Canada, who fear that
their southern neighbor is making their country a dumping ground
of waste.
</P>
<P>
The government of Ontario had earlier rejected a U.S. company's
attempt to send the waste to a disposal facility on Kirkland Lake
in the province.
</P>
<P>
A 1999 U.S. Department of Defense report made public Thursday
already suggested that Canada was a reluctant dumping ground for
PCBs, developed 70 years ago and now linked to cancer.
</P>
<P>
The report referred to "current shipments" of PCBs from
overseas military bases that are in jeopardy because of Canada's
skittishness about accepting toxic waste that the U.S. won't admit
across its own borders.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian environment minister, however, did not rule out
the possibility that the country may eventually accept the
shipment under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Canada might be unable to reject it if the PCB level in the
shipment is within acceptable federal limits, that is, a shipment
below 50 parts per million, the minister was quoted as suggesting.
</P>
<P>
While Canada and most other countries accept the international
shipment of materials with PCBs below 50 parts per million, the U.
S. government prohibits the importation of the chemical at any
detectable level, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Michelle Kwan Wins Women's Title at World Figure Skating Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICE, France, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-American Michelle
Kwan found back her form and won her third world champion in a
thrilling free skating of the women's event at the World Figure
Skating Championships here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, a freshman at the University of California in Los Angeles,
jumped to the first from the third place after the short program,
beating European champion Irina Slutskaya and reigning world
champion Maria Butyrskaya, both from Russia, to the second and
third respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Kwan, gold medalist in 1996 and 1998 who now
tries to combine training, competing and university classes, does
not look much like the complete package she once was and she has
been struggling with triple loop. However, the beautiful girl --
the greatest artist on ice -- told the world that she was back
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with a clean triple loop in the free skating,
Michelle Kwan had seven triple jumps including a triple lutz/
double toe loop and triple/triple toe loop combination.
</P>
<P>
Skating to the Red Violin by John Corigliano, the jumps, the
flying spin and the unusual Charlotte spiral won her a thunderous
applause from the packed crowds and four 5.8s for technical merit,
and four 5.9s for presentation.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most satisfying victory for me. I have been
confident and I am ready to do it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kwan did a new program in free skating, which combines
difficulty and art to a perfection. Her coach Frank Carroll said,
"The program is very difficult, many had suggested us to give up.
As if you don't do it perfect, it will leave impression that
something is wrong. Michelle had a really fabulous skating this
evening."
</P>
<P>
Skating first in the top group, Kwan had to wait another 30
minutes for the final rankings. "It was really a long 30 minutes,
as I know my marks are low. I was trying to keep my mind out of
the competition and kept telling myself: be happy, be happy," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Butyrskaya, who became the first Russian
skater to win the women's world title last year, had a
disappointing performance mixed with several mistakes in free
skating. The overnight leader in short program, skating to Swan
Lake, almost fell in a triple toe loop and triple sachow. She got
only two 5.7s for technical merit and one 5.9 for presentation.
</P>
<P>
Skating after Kwan and Butyrskaya, Slutskaya had an outstanding
skating set to Carmen by George Bizet and Ridion Shedrin, but one
less triple jump and a minor error in triple/triple combination
decided the difference between her and the winner. Only two from
nine judges gave her the first place in the rankings.

<HEADLINE> Decision to Free Rwanda Genocide Suspect Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Appeals Chamber of the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in The Hague
Friday reversed its decision to release a Rwanda genocide suspect,
sources from Arusha, northern Tanzania, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Arusha-based ICTR confirmed that
Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, former Rwanda's director of Political
Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will now face the
charges of genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Tom Kennedy, head of Press and Public Affairs Unit, said with a
30-page judgement, Barayagwiza will remain the ICTR detention
facilities in Arusha pending his trial.
</P>
<P>
On November 3 last year, the ICTR Appeal Court ordered
Barayagwiza's immediate release on the grounds that his rights had
been repeatedly violated during his initial detention in Cameroon
and after his transfer to the U.N. prison in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
That decision caused the Rwandan government to suspend its
cooperation with the ICTR till February when the ICTR prosecutor
applied for a review of the decision on the ground that there were
new facts on the case.
</P>
<P>
Friday's decision to reverse the judgement was reached
unanimously by the five Appeals Court judges.
</P>
<P>
They said that Barayagwiza should be tried by the ICTR, but
that the violation of his rights would be taken into account at
the time of his judgement by the Trial Chamber.
</P>
<P>
"In the revised judgement, the appeals chamber dismissed the
appellant's claim to be released," said Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
The judges said that if the Court found Barayagwiza innocent,
he would be entitled to financial compensation for the violations;
if guilty, his eventual sentence is to be reduced to take account
of the infringement of his rights.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza, 50, was arrested in March 27, 1996 in Cameroon and
held for 19 months without being informed of the charges against
him, while the ICTR sets that provisional detention is not
supposed to exceed 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Barayagwiza, a founder member of the late Radio Television des
Mille Collines which incited Hutus to kill Tutsis, played an
important role as the foreign policy advisor to the Rwandan
interim government which presided over the 1994 genocide in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The judges found new evidence that Barayagwiza had been aware
of the general nature of the allegations against him at the time
of hearings in the courts of Cameroon, where he was detained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Martin Ngoga, Rwanda's representative to the ICTR,
on Friday hailed the ICTR Appeal Chamber's decision, saying it was
a victory for genocide victims.
</P>
<P>
Ngoga told a news conference in a prepared statement on behalf
of his government that the decision "restores justice and revives
the hope of genocide survivors who had lost hope and trust in this
Tribunal."
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government warned that the reversion judgement was
a "lesson to the Prosecution which must work hard not to cause
such unfortunate scenarios ever in future."
</P>
<P>
The ICTR has so far issued 28 indictments against 45
individuals, and 38 indicted individuals are in custody including
several former senior cabinet ministers in the interim government
of Rwanda of 1994, former military commanders, political leaders,
journalists and senior businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The five detainees who have already been convicted by the Trial
Chambers of the Tribunal are still held in Arusha. Three of them
 were sentenced to imprisonment for life and the other two, 25
years and 15 years of imprisonment respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Military's training and
equipment are far from being of the standard required for a
continental power, Nigerian Chief of Army Staff, Major General
Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) quoted the officer as
saying on Saturday that about 80 percent of military equipment of
the Nigerian Airforce are already grounded, leaving only three
Alfa Jets, and a cargo plane capable of flying.
</P>
<P>
It cited findings prepared by an external auditor on the state
of the Nigerian military as revealing that 75 percent of Nigerian
military equipment are in deplorable condition, while several
broken down armored tanks and heavy machine guns are rusting away
in the barracks.
</P>
<P>
Majority of the jets which were used in the West African
Peacekeeping Force or ECOMOG in Liberia and Sierra Leone never
came back or are currently grounded, the report said.
</P>
<P>
And the 11,000 person strong navy of the Africa's most populous
country now has no more than ten sea vessels.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Nigerian military has seemed to justify a
call by the Nigerian Minister of Defence, Lt.-Gen. Theophilus
Danjuma made last year to reduce the Nigerian military figure from
80,000 to 50,000, said the report.

<HEADLINE> 240 Former S. Leone Rebels Surrender to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations says Saturday
that some 240 rebel fighters in Sierra Leone had handed themselves
and their weapons in on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from the West African country's capital
Freetown quoted the UN spokesman Fred Eckhard as describing it the
largest disarmament operation in the country so far.
</P>
<P>
He said in Freetown that those who turned in their weapons were
members of the Revolutionary Council, a faction of the former
rebels, who had fought the successive government for nine years.
</P>
<P>
Another 95 fighters without weapons also surrendered to the UN
peace- keeping force, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Lome peace accord signed last July ended the little west
African country's civil war, which had turned half of its
population into refugees.
</P>
<P>
But the disarmament, designated by the accord, has been tardy
due to deeply rooted misbelief between the rebels and government.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah said less than
half of the estimated 45,000 rebels had disarmed since the peace
accord was signed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Praises China's "One Country, Two System" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye Saturday reaffirmed Tanzanian consistent stand
for One-China principle, praising China's "one country, two
systems" policy "unique, practical and successful."
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, who just returned home from a six-day visit to China,
said that Tanzania held that such a policy had reunited Hong Kong,
Macao and would definitely reunite Taiwan as well.
</P>
<P>
He said his first visit to China has successfully deepened the
long-term friendly relations between Tanzania and China which were
started by the leaders of the old generations in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation in the fields of politics, economy as well as
culture were also strengthened," he told a news conference at the
Dar es Salaam International Airport.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out it is a miracle that China has managed to feed
its population of over 1.2 billion people by practicing a
successful development strategy which was worth of learning by
other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye stressed that Tanzania should study the Chinese
management, science and technology and their diligence rather than
demanding economic grants only.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian prime minister welcomed more Chinese investment
in Tanzania especially in the agriculture sector in a bid to
supply the people with enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The working visit which started on March 21 took Sumaye and his
 agriculture minister Willion Kusila as well as other senior
officials to Beijing, Tianjin, Henan Province and the Shenzhen
Special Economic Zone before leaving for Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Honda Cuts In British Car Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese car giant Honda has
announced it is to cut production at its British plant in Swindon
by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The plant will shrink because of the strength of sterling, weak
sales across Europe and retooling in preparation for new models,
the firm said.
</P>
<P>
Production schedules for the Accord and Civic models will be
scaled back, but none of the 3,100 workers at the site will lose
their jobs, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The news comes amid anger over job losses at Rover and tough
times for the manufacturing industry. Thousands of people marched
through Birmingham Saturday to protest against BMW's sell-off of
Rover.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to suppliers, Honda warned that production targets
for the Accord would be cut by 54 percent from 80,000 car to 37,
000 a year.
</P>
<P>
The Civic, due to be replaced next year, will be scaled back by
42 percent from 65,000 to 38,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
Honda's Paul Ormond told BBC's Today Program, "It is a very
very short term measure for us .... We are going to keep all our

LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Twenty pubs a month are closing
down in Britain, according to research by the Campaign for Real
Ale (Camra).
</P>
<P>
Camra fears many are closing because landlords try to make a
profit from selling their properties as private homes.
</P>

Mike Benner, Camra's head of campaigns, said, "We suspected the
situation was gloomy, but we had no idea it was this bad."
</P>
<P>
"What's most depressing is that the situation is almost
certainly much worse than even Camra dare admit," Benner added.

The survey suggests other pubs, particularly in rural areas,
are shutting because they fail to market themselves efficiently.

MOSCOW -- Direct rule by the Russian president in the republic
of Chechnya is still under discussion, Russian President-Elect
Vladimir Putin said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of direct presidential rule in Chechnya will
be considered only after consultations with the State Duma (lower
house of parliament) and the Federal Council (upper house of
parliament), Putin told a news conference after attending a
Russian Nuclear Power Ministry board meeting in the city of
Snezhinsky, in the region of Chelyabinsk.
</P>
<P>
This issue is being discussed in reply to proposals made by
Chechens themselves, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with those who believe that the issue of direct
presidential rule is not adjusted in our legislation," he said,
adding that the Russian Constitution gives no right to the
president to impose direct presidential rule.
</P>
<P>
The government, "Together with the Russian Security Council,
will hold consultations with the State Duma and the Federal
Council. After the possible consequences of this decision are
made clear, it can either be taken or not," said Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin's aide, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said on Thursday that no
final decision on direct presidential rule in Chechnya has been
taken. (Russia-Putin-Chechnya)

TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Saturday
announced that his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the New
Komeito party are ending their coalition with the Liberal Party (
LP), the smallest member of Japan's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi made the announcement after a meeting with LP leader
Ichiro Ozawa and New Komeito head Takenori Kanzaki Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The leaders "confirmed it would be difficult to maintain trust
among the three parties," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's announcement puts an end to the LDP's 15-month
alliance with the conservative LP, which was joined by the New
Komeito last October.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Obuchi made the announcement, Ozawa, who had
been widely expected to declare his party's withdrawal from the
coalition at Saturday's meeting, told a separate press conference
that he has yet to decide on whether to leave the ruling coalition.

BAGHDAD -- Iraq on Saturday gave a cautious welcome to the U.N.
decision to double the funds that Iraq can use to import oil spare
parts in a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid said
that the move by the U.N. represented a step forward in the right
direction as well as a backdown for the U.S., the Iraqi News
Agency(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Friday unanimously adopted the
resolution to allow Iraq to draw 600 million U.S. dollars from its
oil revenues in six months to import spare parts and equipment for
its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
For the decision to work, Rashid added, it must be accompanied
by a steady release by the U.N. Sanctions Committee of spare parts
that Baghdad wants to import.
</P>
<P>
Rashid confirmed that from this week on, Iraq's oil production
will increased by 150,000 barrels per day (bpd), and will steadily
raise the output to 3.5 million barrels per day by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, who produces 1.9 million barrels of oil a day at present,
said it will gradually increase its oil output and export, even
before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided
to raise production to balance oil demand and supply on world
markets. (Iraq-UN-Spare Parts)

<HEADLINE> Iraq Cautiously Welcomes U.N. Move on Oil Spare Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday gave a cautious
welcome to the U.N. decision to double the funds that Iraq can use
to import oil spare parts in a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid said
that the move by the U.N. represented a step forward in the right
direction as well as a backdown for the U.S., the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Friday unanimously adopted the
resolution to allow Iraq to draw 600 million U.S. dollars from its
oil revenues in six months to import spare parts and equipment for
its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
For the decision to work, Rashid added, it must be accompanied
by a steady release by the U.N. Sanctions Committee of spare parts
that Baghdad wants to import.
</P>
<P>
Rashid confirmed that from this week on, Iraq's oil production
will increased by 150,000 barrels per day (bpd), and will steadily
raise the output to 3.5 million barrels per day by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, who produces 1.9 million barrels of oil a day at present,
said it will gradually increase its oil output and export, even
before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to
raise production to balance oil demand and supply on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British delegates at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the implementation of the
U.N. oil-for-food program by intentionally blocking the contracts
Iraq signed with foreign countries to buy oil spare parts.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics, as of January 31, 2000, Iraq's
contracts worth 1.5 billion dollars have been put on hold, and the
U.S. alone has shelved contracts worth more than 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export a
limited amount of oil and use the revenue to import humanitarian
goods for its people who have been under sweeping sanctions ever
since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Announces End of Tripartite Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
on Saturday announced that his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and
the New Komeito party are ending their coalition with the Liberal
Party (LP), the smallest member of Japan's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi made the announcement after a meeting with LP leader
Ichiro Ozawa and New Komeito head Takenori Kanzaki Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The leaders "confirmed it would be difficult to maintain trust
among the three parties," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's announcement puts an end to the LDP's 15-month
alliance with the conservative LP, which was joined by the New
Komeito last October.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Obuchi made the announcement, Ozawa, who had
been widely expected to declare his party's withdrawal from the
coalition at Saturday's meeting, told a separate press conference
that he has yet to decide on whether to leave the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
"I will make a decision after holding talks with party members
in a meeting on Monday," Ozawa said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said at the meeting he rejected Ozawa's demands to
implement all policy agreements on security, social security and
other issues reached among the three parties before the three
joined forces last October.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi said his party would maintain its alliance with the New
Komeito party.
</P>
<P>
The LP's departure still leaves the LDP and New Komeito with a
majority in both houses of Japan's Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The LP's departure is also expected to split the party as
former Japanese Home Affairs Minister Takeshi Noda and eight other
LP members of the House of Representatives (lower house) plan to
form a new party so as to stay in the coalition once Ozawa
announces the LP's withdrawal from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The LP has 39 seats in the lower house. The party's 11 members
in the House of Councilors (upper house) are likely to stay with
Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa suggested that his party leave the coalition on Wednesday
after talks on electoral cooperation arrangements between the LDP
and LP collapsed last week.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, German FMs Meet Ahead of Africa-Europe Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa met here Saturday with his
German counterpart Joschka Fischer on bilateral
and African-European relations, the latest
developments in the Middle East peace process and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived in the Egyptian capital earlier
in the day with a high-level delegation to
participate in the foreign ministerial meeting
opened here Saturday ahead of the Africa-Europe
summit slated for April 3-4.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the meeting, Fischer
hailed the "excellent" relations between Egypt and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said that the coming Africa-Europe summit
would offer an opportunity to discuss the problems
Africa is faced with, emphasizing cooperation
between the two continents on "equal grounds and
on the basis of partnership" to seek solutions to
these problems.
</P>
<P>
Referring to African countries' appeal that EU,
the largest single donor of aid to Africa, provide
more aid and write off Africa's huge debts,
Fischer said that solutions do not come just by
providing further financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
It is important also to establish inter-African
cooperation, especially with regional groupings,
the top German diplomat noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the coming summit
would be a success.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats, ambassadors and senior officials of
participating countries held here Saturday morning
a preparatory meeting to deal with issues tabled
on the summit agenda, besides a draft final
declaration and a plan of action guiding future
concrete steps to enhance bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 53 African countries and 15 EU
member states are expected to attend the first-
ever summit to discuss economic, political and
social development issues in Africa and bilateral
cooperation in these fields.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the Middle East peace process,
Fischer said Europe could play a bigger role in
the process at political and economic levels.
</P>
<P>
He said the Middle East could have a good
opportunity of cooperation with Europe within the
framework of the Barcelona-process which involves
the 15-EU members and 12 Mediterranean rim
countries.
</P>
<P>
The 27 states in 1995 signed in Spain the
Barcelona Declaration, aimed at creating a free
trade and common security zone throughout the
Mediterranean by 2010. The principles of the
process include commitments to human rights,
democracy, regional stability and free trade.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Inam-ul-Haq Saturday said that the Karakoran Highway could be
utilized for Chinese exports to third countries through the
Karachi and Gawadar ports of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He was talking to Ma Yue, head of a 14-member Chinese trade
delegation which is going to attend the first meeting of the
Pakistan-China Joint Business Council in Karachi on April 3.
</P>
<P>
"China had shifted its economic development focus from eastern
to western provinces. This would usher in an era of increased
economic activities between the two countries through the Pak-
China Friendship Highway," an official statement here quoted Inam
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary expressed his confidence that greater
interaction between the private sectors of Pakistan and China will
further enhance and diversify economic and commercial cooperation
between them.
</P>
<P>
Karakoran highway was built in the world's most mountainous
area in 1960s to connect neighboring Pakistan and western China.

<HEADLINE> India, Turkey Agree To Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- India and Turkey agreed Saturday
to strengthen economic cooperation and to fight against
international terrorism, according to a joint statement issued
here at the end of a three-day visit by Turkish Prime Minister
Bullent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Relations between New Delhi and Ankara had acquired a new
thrust and equilibrium and there was a need to give high priority
to enhancing economic cooperation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries stressed that suppression of acts of
international terrorism, regardless of its origin and motivation,
was an essential element for the maintenance of international
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Turkey backed India's initiative on a Comprehensive Convention
on International Terrorism with both sides terming it as an "
important step" in strengthening international legislative
framework for combating international terrorism, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference immediately after the signing
ceremony of the statement, the Turkish leader expressed his
unhappiness over the "interruption" of democracy in Pakistan, a
long time ally of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit asked Pakistani Chief Executive Pervez Musharraf to
restore democracy in the country, saying he had personally
expressed his view to Musharraf and recommended that he should
announce the date of return of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit confirmed reports that Islamabad had approached him with
a proposal for resumption of talks with New Delhi shortly before
his departure to the South Asian country on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, India maintained that Islamabad had to stop what it
called "cross-border terrorism" and abandon "its vicious
propaganda" against India so as to create a conducive atmosphere
for having "meaningful" talks.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit held wide-ranging discussions with Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee on regional, international and issues of
mutual concern, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told Ecevit that the two countries shared the
principles of democracy and secularism which had created a
conducive atmosphere for further consolidating bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the two countries signed three agreements including
one on cooperation in agriculture, a memorandum of understanding (
MOU) for establishing a mechanism for political consultation
between foreign ministries of the two countries and another MOU on
cultural exchange.

<HEADLINE> Big Gas Deposit Discovered off West Coast in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Forest Oil, the oil and gas
company based in Denver, United States, has discovered a gas
deposit off the west coast in South Africa, comparable in size to
the Namibian Kudu gas field.
</P>
<P>
The South African Petroleum Agency said on Saturday that the
new find contains a minimum of 2.5 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of
gas and a further 15 TCF of gas was thought to be contained in
separate deposits nearby.
</P>
<P>
The new find could provide gas to Cape Town by pipeline at a
lower cost than gas from the Namibian Kudu field.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first significant discovery off the South
African coast," the agency said, adding that the discovery is
comparable with the published reserves of the Kudu discovery.
</P>
<P>
According to Namibian government officials, Kudu has an
estimated reserves of about 20 TCF of gas.
</P>
<P>
The South African Petroleum Agency, which regulates all oil and
gas exploration activities for the government, has granted the
Forest and its partner, Anschutz, a licence to explore northwards
up the west coast until the Namibian border.
</P>
<P>
The Forest is now investigating the gas market and various
options to develop the new field. These include the building of a
gas-fired power station and a gas-to-liquids plant which will put
into production in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Oil sector analysts said the new find was likely to hamper the
development of Kudu, which would not be viable unless it was able
to sell gas to South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China
plans to inject 30 million yuan in the coming three years to
further develop the local specialty -- mature vinegar -- into a
flourishing undertaking.
</P>
<P>
The increased financial support is expected to help the vinegar
industry generate 320 million yuan in total sales income by the
year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The money will mainly go to the technical upgrading efforts in
the vinegar industry in the province, which aims to develop a
series of vinegar-related products including two health-improving
drinks.
</P>
<P>
The two drinks alone are expected to bring 20 million yuan in
profit to the province annually.

<P>
Vinegar has a huge market potential in China since the Chinese
people consume about two million tons of vinegar annually and the
product is also a popular flavoring overseas. As a world-renowned
spice in Shanxi, vinegar has been listed as a competitive pillar
product in the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China started a national
tuberculosis (TB) epidemiological survey today which will provide
information for drafting a TB control plan for the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fourth TB survey in China.
</P>
<P>
TB claims 250,000 lives each year in China, and is a serious
public health problem hindering the country's social and economic
development, according to a senior Chinese health official.
</P>
<P>
A total of six million TB patients make China the second
largest TB country in the world, after India, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Specialists have warned that without effective measures about
200 million to 300 million Chinese might be infected by TB
bacillus in the next decade, and one-tenth of them could become TB
patients.
</P>
<P>
With World Bank loans totaling 58 million U.S. dollars, China
launched the world's largest TB control project in 13 provinces in
1992. It initiated another TB control project in 15 provinces in
1994.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 1.2 million contagious TB patients have been
treated, and about 90 percent of them cured. The TB survey will
take two months.

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Today is Beijing's Tree-Planting
Day, and Chinese top leaders joined the local residents in a "
greenifying" campaign today to combat sand and dust storms which
have hit the city four times in less than two weeks this spring.
</P>
<P>
Since the first Tree-Planting Day in 1979, China has launched a
series of events to mark this special occasion each year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the forestry administration show that a total
of 5.5 billion people have planted 32 billion trees in the past 21
years.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the Fourth Session of the Fifth National People's
Congress approved a decision encouraging everyone aged 11 years
or elder to plant 3-5 trees every year.
</P>
<P>
Since then, China's nationwide tree planting drive has become
part of the most successful efforts of mankind to improve the
ecological environment.
</P>

China now has 37 million hectares of planted forests, and the
forested areas have increased by nearly 2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Holds U.S. Responsible for Oil Prices Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused the United States
of pressing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to increase oil production, which led to a slump of the oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
In a statement covered by the Iraqi News Agency (INA) on
Saturday, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid said that the U.
S. exerted clear pressure on some OPEC members to produce more oil.
</P>
<P>
Rashid pointed out that some OPEC members have started to
increase oil production by 1.25 million barrels a day even before
the March 27 OPEC oil ministerial meeting in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting which Rashid attended, nine members of OPEC
decided to increase oil output by 6.3 percent, or 1.45 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, along with Iran, opposed increasing output by OPEC members
at the meeting. Iraq has been calling on the OPEC to resist the U.
S. pressure for pumping more oil.
</P>
<P>
OPEC reached an agreement in March last year to slash their
output by 1.7 million barrels per day from April 1, 1999, while
non-OPEC oil producers cut their daily production by 400,000
barrels. The move has drastically boosted the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. oil prices tripled to a March 8 peak of 34.37 U.S.
dollars per barrel, the highest since November 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., a leading oil-consuming country, has been lobbying
OPEC to raise output to lower the surging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Since OPEC announced to increase output, oil prices in the
international market have dropped to around 25 dollars a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Rejects CHR Report on its Human Rights Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has rejected a report on
its human rights situation submitted Thursday by the special
rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to the current
56th session of the Commission, saying that the report attempts to
trivialize the positive, accentuate the negative and portray the
image of the country in an entirely negative light.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar totally rejects the unfounded allegations contained in
the report since they are biased, partial and politically
motivated, the Myanmar Foreign Ministry said in a press release
issued here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the report did not mention any
positive developments which have taken place in the country in the
intervening period since the latest report of the rapporteur.
</P>
<P>
"There is hardly any doubt that the report has been prepared
with the sole intent to maliciously slander a member state to
satisfy the demands of those who wish to exert undue pressure on
Myanmar," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar will be steadfast in following its chosen path and will
continue to promote and protect human rights in its endeavors to
build a society where all the people of Myanmar can enjoy the
fruits of economic development and social progress in an
environment of peace and stability, it added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU Discuss Bilateral Free Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
and a delegation from the European Union (EU) met in Pretoria on
Saturday to set a time frame for initiatives relating to the
bilateral free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, the European Commission's
Director- General for development Philip Lowe said: "This is our
first opportunity to take stock of where we were and identify
issues which needed to be cleared up."
</P>
<P>
Lowe said time frame has been allocated for initiatives which
are already in progress.
</P>
<P>
"We also decided to make improvements where it was necessary,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lowe noted that South Africa's development program was one of
the most successful in the world.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the South African Trade and Industry
Department Alistair Ruiters said he was happy at the progress
which had been made with the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the agreement will flow speedily and begin to impact
on our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and the EU last October signed the Trade,
Development and Cooperation Agreement in Pretoria, which should
have come into effect on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, last December Italy and Greece threatened not to
ratify the trade pact unless South Africa abandoned using the
"Grappa" (a brand name used by Italian spirit producers) and
"Ouzo" (a brand name used by Greek spirit producers).
</P>
<P>
In February, South Africa accepted the EU's compromise deal
that South Africa should phase out using "Grappa" and "Ouzo" in
five years, paving the way for the EU to unanimously ratify the
bilateral trade agreement.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Ownership Structure Criticised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's food reserves have
fallen to their lowest level since its independence in 1980
because the land ownership structure in the country remains
unchanged, a United Nations report has said.
</P>
<P>
The report released here Friday by the United Nations
Development Program said land has remained in the hands of a few
white commercial farmers who have over the years diversified to
cash crops such as flowers at the expense of food.
</P>
<P>
The production of the country's staple, maize has declined from
2.6 million tons in 1996 to an estimated 1.5 million tons last
year, threatening the country's food security.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's strategic grain reserves have, as a result, declined
from an average of 26 percent of total production in the 1980s to
20 percent in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The report said the government's failure to redress the land
issue was a direct result of the failure to negotiate favorable
clauses on land redistribution at Lancaster House, the failure to
nationalize land immediately after the end of the 10-year
moratorium due to International Monetary Fund and World Bank
pressure and loss of enthusiasm for land reform by politicians and
the bureaucratic elite.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank exerted
pressure on the Zimbabwean government, which had just launched
economic reforms, not to redistribute land, claiming this would
hinder investment.
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared by the United Nations Development
Program in conjunction with the University of Zimbabwe and the
Poverty Alleviation Forum.
</P>
<P>
It said the relaxation of the government controls on the
agricultural sector was largely to blame for food insecurity in
the country.

<HEADLINE> APEC Forum Agrees to Establish Hedge Fund Monitoring Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Forum ended its two-day meeting here Saturday
with an agreement to establish a hedge-fund monitoring mechanism,
a joint social-safety net, and a foreign-exchange crisis forecast
system.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first in APEC's 10-year history between
government officials and well-known financiers and scholars, was
proposed by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung at last
September's APEC summit in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
APEC, whose 21 member economies account for 56 percent of the
world's gross domestic product and 49 percent of world trade,
agreed on the forum's vital role in global trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reached a consensus that the regional organization
should approach trade issues and pay more attention to the
equality issue and the gap between economies at different
development levels.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 delegates attended the meeting with the theme of "
Shared Prosperity and Harmony in an era of knowledge-based and
digital economy."

<HEADLINE> Direct Presidential Rule in Chechnya Still Undecided: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Direct rule by the Russian
president in the republic of Chechnya is still under discussion,
Russian President-Elect Vladimir Putin said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of direct presidential rule in Chechnya will
be considered only after consultations with the State Duma (lower
house of parliament) and the Federal Council (upper house of
parliament), Putin told a news conference after attending a
Russian Nuclear Power Ministry board meeting in the city of
Snezhinsky, in the region of Chelyabinsk.
</P>
<P>
This issue is being discussed in reply to proposals made by
Chechens themselves, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with those who believe that the issue of direct
presidential rule is not adjusted in our legislation," he said,
adding that the Russian Constitution gives no right to the
president to impose direct presidential rule.
</P>
<P>
The government, "Together with the Russian Security Council,
will hold consultations with the State Duma and the Federal
Council. After the possible consequences of this decision are
made clear, it can either be taken or not," said Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin's aide, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said on Thursday that no
final decision on direct presidential rule in Chechnya has been
taken.
</P>
<P>
"It has not been decided when or what form of control over the
Chechen republic will be chosen. "One reason is that under Russian
law such a measure is possible only in the case of a state of
emergency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky did not exclude the use of "a better juridical
form" of management in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Council and the State Duma are considering various
juridical mechanisms of administration for Chechnya, he said, and
they may be legalized by a federal bill or the federal law on the
state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Russian newspaper Kommersant
before the March 26 presidential election, Putin proposed a two-
year direct presidential rule in Chechnya after the anti-terrorist
war ends in the republic.

<HEADLINE> China Keeps Close Eye on International Patented Technologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China is keeping a close eye on
international patent applications and grants for advanced
technologies, a senior intellectual property official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The state plans to optimize scientific and financial resources
through a well-prepared patent mechanism," Wang Jingchuan, vice-
commissioner of the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO),
said at an Exhibition showcasing China's latest patented
technologies.
</P>
<P>
"The patent system plays an important role in stimulating the
Chinese people's creativity," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that about 90 percent of advanced
technologies in the world are protected by authorized patents, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China has made one major revision of the Patent Law since the
Law was implemented in 1985. China is considering revising the law
again to meet international covenants.
</P>
<P>
Up until January 2000, China has received one million patent
applications.
</P>
<P>
The five-day Exhibition shows the achievements made by China
after its adoption of the intellectual property system.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang said, the patent administration of the government
greatly lags behind those in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
After joining the World Intellectual Property Organization (
WIPO) in 1980, China has signed a series of international
covenants and conventions.

<HEADLINE> Those Who Seriously Pollute Marine Environment Will Be Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Activities polluting marine
environment and damaging marine eco-system will be seriously
punished in China according to the revised law of marine
environmental protection, which went into effect today.
</P>
<P>
The new law is far more draconian in dealing with offenders who
pollute the environment, said Du Bilan, a member of the National
People's Congress' Environmental and Resource Protection Committee
(ERPC).
</P>
<P>
Those found releasing serious pollution into the sea that
exceeds State levels will be fined. "This is a major breakthrough
of the revised law," said Du.
</P>
<P>
Xu Sheng, an official of the marine environmental protection
department under the State Oceanic Administration, said that under
the previous law, offenders were only given small fines. However,
the new law makes it clear that it is illegal to release pollution
exceeding State levels and serious fines will be imposed, said Xu.
</P>
<P>
Marine administrative departments will demand compensation from
offenders. The money will be used to rehabilitate the damaged
marine environment.
</P>
<P>
The new law also includes specific forms of punishment such as
confiscating illegal income, demolishing illegal buildings and
stopping production to curb marine environmental pollution and the
deterioration of the marine eco-system.

<HEADLINE> Specific Rules Related to China's Marine Environmental Protection Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The revised law of marine
environmental protection was implemented today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuguang, director of the State Oceanic Administration,
urged marine administrative departments to improve specific
regulations for a scientific marine environmental protection law
system in China.
</P>
<P>
If specific regulations related to the new law cannot be
implemented soon, then enforcing the new laws will be delayed,
said Du Bilan, a member of the National People's Congress'
Environmental and Resource Protection Committee (ERPC).
</P>
<P>
The specific regulations will include guidelines for pollution
control in key sea areas, China's marine environmental protection
plan, quality national control standards and administrative
regulations on oceanic engineering and coastal engineering.
</P>
<P>
China started a legal system on marine environmental protection
in the early 1970s. Since then, regulations on the control and
prevention of pollution of sea areas from coastal engineering,
ships, offshore petroleum exploration, dumping of waste, and land
pollution have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The new marine environmental protection law will produce a
sustainable marine culture for China's future.

Ukraine's Berdyansk Harbor, made transit passage from the Bosphorus
Strait, linking the Marmara Sea to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
It collided with the Turkish-flagged "Huseyin Avci" ship while
it was changing its route to the east direction in heavy fog.
</P>
<P>
According to the passage rules, which regulate ships passing
through the Bosphorus Straits, the Lebanese-flagged ship should go
to north.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Laughs Off Reports About "Shadow Cabinet" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
laughed off Saturday rumors about a "shadow cabinet" formed by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters in Tagbilaran City, where he is
paying a visit, Estrada said reports about any shadow group would
remain just that -- a shadow, or figments of one's imagination.
</P>
<P>
"I think that it will just remain a shadow forever," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was reacting to reports that a "shadow cabinet" is
being formed by the opposition with Vice President Gloria
Macapagal Arroyo as its "chairman."
</P>
<P>
As for his cabinet members, Estrada said that he continues to
monitor their performance to determine if they are up to par with
his administration's high standards.
</P>
<P>
"Once a cabinet member does not perform, he will be replaced,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that these officials submit their courtesy
resignations every year and their performance reports every month
for him to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
Recently, rumors about possible cabinet reshuffles and even
military coups have been circulating in the Philippine capital of
Manila. A local newspaper report said Friday that right-wing
soldiers planned to stage a coup this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The rumor has prompted the military and police to tighten
security around their camps in Metro Manila, impose an on-base
curfew and cancel the leaves of servicemen.
</P>
<P>
But Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado dismissed the report as
coffee-shop talk.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Telecom Liberalization Triggers Price War, Operator Augmentation in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's telecommunication
liberalization taking effect Saturday has sparked intense locked-
horn competition in the industry, featuring a wave of operator
augmentation and a war of prices.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the flood gates have ushered in a throng of
competitors to the central stage to challenge Singapore
Telecommunication Corporation (SingTel), the biggest government-
linked company and an incumbent monopoly of telecommunication in
the city state.
</P>
<P>
StarHub, the new phone company and Singapore's second fixed-
telephone operator which launched its fixed and mobile network
last night, have posed as the main rival of the SingTel in various
areas of the telecommunication industry.
</P>
<P>
KEPPEL Telecommunication &AMP; Transportation formed a joint
venture with Australia's Telstra Corporation Thursday aiming to
become the number two biggest telecom player in Singapore in the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, other five new facility-based licenses and 24 new
service-based individual licenses have been given to successful
applicants in this telecommunication big bang which is expected to
usher in a bumper crop of at least 66 new operators and to attract
3 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars) in
investments as well as to create 2,500 new jobs in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
As from April 1, 2000, Singapore has 20 Internet access service
providers and 20 operators selling overseas calls.
</P>
<P>
StarHub has commenced its international telephone calls (IDD)
services and has been locked in head-on fight with SingTel, aiming
to undercut SingTel's market share and expecting to tantalize as
many as 100,000 users into becoming its subscribers within its
first week of operation and capture a 9-10 percent share of the
market or about 200,000 subscribers by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
StarHub told a press conference Friday afternoon that it has
priced its international calls at rates 5-8 percent lower than
those of SingTel and for mobiles it introduced free incoming call
and per-second billing all day which is expected to result in
potential saving of up to 40 percent for customers.
</P>
<P>
Barely six hours after StarHub announced its rate, SingTel told
media that it was lowing IDD prices by as much as 59 percent next
month.
</P>
<P>
In cellular phone aspect, Starhub which has engaged in a stiff
fight with two existing operators -- SingTel Mobile and M1.
SingTel Mobile, attacked StarHub Mobile-phone packages last night
with an announcement that it will slash charges by as much as 20
percent for the whole month of April.
</P>
<P>
StarHub and SingTel have failed to reach a commercial agreement
on the inter-operator fixed and mobile number portability and
their dispute was so tense that the Infocomm Development Authority
of Singapore had to intervene and determine charges which will
apply on interim bases.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to fire, founders of the most famous technology
company, the Creative Technology, have again joined forces to pump
200 million Singapore dollars (about 120 million U.S. dollars)
into Internet telephony business.
</P>
<P>
Telecom liberalization has changed the landscape of Singapore's
telecommunication industry with fierce competition surging on and
the new scenario has testified to the theory that success will
require strategic shifts in response to the rapid changing
business and technology environment.
</P>
<P>
Just as Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said at the
official launch of StarHub Friday night, the convergence of global
telecommunications and Internet technologies has thrown up new
business models and new global players over the last five years
and the full liberalization of the telecommunication sector will
have a significant impact on the industry, but more importantly on
the global competitive position of the Singapore economy.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Raise Phone Lines to 1.6 million in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Saturday said that her government had taken up a plan to
raise the telephone lines to 1.6 million from the existing 610,000
in the country by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a 14,000-line central digital telephone exchange
under Greater Dhaka Telephone Project here, the prime minister
said the telephone lines would first be raised to 800,000 by 2000
in view of the growing demands for telephones.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina said a new dynamism had been created in
development across the world with the free flow of information and
unprecedented development in technology.
</P>
<P>
"We have to attain advancement, keeping pace with the trend of
development, flow and technology of information," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said her government fixed the target of providing four
telephones for every 100 persons against the existing one for
every 100 persons, underlining the need for availing the
opportunities created by information highway by using computers
and telecommunication tools together.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President Clinton's visit to Bangladesh on March 20,
two American companies signed memorandums of understanding with
the country to install 300,000 modern digital telephones in Dhaka
and to set up submarine cable connection between Bangladesh and
Singapore, which will greatly avail the country's efforts to keep
up with the pace of information technology development.

<HEADLINE> World Bank's Assessment of Flood Damage in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Replacing the losses caused by the
recent floods in southern and central Mozambique will cost between
270 million and 430 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This assessment depending on the standards used for
reconstruction was made by the World Bank in a newly released
report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that losses of crops and livestock and damage
to agricultural infrastructure and equipment amount to 66 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Damage to the road network is cost at 47 million U.S. dollars,
and to the railways, particularly to the Limpopo line from Maputo
to Zimbabwe, at seven million U.S. dollars. Repairing damaged
electricity transmission lines will cost 14 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank quoted the estimation by the Mozambican Ministry
of Health as saying that the damage to health units amounts to 16
million U.S. dollars. Another four million U.S. dollars will be
required for essential drugs, equipment, furniture and other
supplies.
</P>
<P>
The school network also suffered heavily, and the direct costs
of the flooding to the education system are estimated at 29
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is much more difficult to estimate the damage to private
property. Most of the dwellings swept away were peasant huts, on
which it is difficult to put a precise value.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank opts for a figure of 29 million U.S. dollars for
the damage to housing and other private property.
</P>
<P>
As for losses to private businesses, including fisheries,
industry, trade and tourism, these are put at about 50 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the World Bank admits that this figure is not necessarily
accurate, because the private sector consists of numerous actors
who are not required to make public disclosures of their financial
positions.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Heavily Hit by Deadly Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Associating with HIV/AIDS,
Tuberculosis (TB) has attacked half of Tanzanians above age 15 for
once or more times during their lifetime, Tanzanian Minister of
Health has warned.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Aaron Chiduo, quoted by local media on Saturday, said that
the number of people contracting TB has been increasing over the
past few years though the deadly disease was once almost
eradicated in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to mark the World TB Day on Friday, Chiduo said
that Tanzania was among 22 countries with a very high number of TB
patients in the world.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that in 1998, more than 51,000 people were reported
to have contracted TB in Tanzania, an increase of four percent
from 44,477 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The number of TB patients might be worse this year because the
disease seems to be increasing each day," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chiduo said that the disease has tremendous adverse effects on
the country's economy because most of its victims are between age
of 15 and 54, the most productive group.
</P>
<P>
The minister's warning comes after the World Health
Organization (WHO) recently cautioned developing countries about
the fast-spreading drug- resistant new strains of TB, urging rich
countries to assist poor nations to set up control programs for
the disease.
</P>
<P>
The WHO figures show that TB claims the lives of many women
compared to maternal deaths and that many HIV/AIDS victims die of
TB than any other infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
The WHO announced early this week that cases of outbreaks of TB
 resistant to "isoniazid and rifampicin," the two most powerful
drugs, have been reported in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared jointly with the International Union Against
TB and Lung Disease says that the wealthy countries of Europe are
to suffer the consequences when the strain flourishes in poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The only safeguard for wealthy countries is to help countries
with poor functioning TB control programs to fix the problem
immediately..." it says.
</P>
<P>
Chiduo said that despite the fact that the disease was
communicable, even a person suffering from HIV/AIDS could be cured
of the disease which most frequently affects the lungs.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Tanzania's policy on offering free treatment to
TB patients in both government and private hospitals.

<HEADLINE> New IMF Chief to Strengthen Asia's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Horst Koehler, new managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said on
Saturday that he will strengthen the role of Asia's developing
countries in the world body.
</P>
<P>
Koehler told the German newspaper, "Welt am Sonntag," that
Asia, with its rapidly developing economy and enormously
increasing share of world production, will be a very important
region.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also strengthen controls of the use of IMF
credits to supervise more closely the banking sectors in volatile
economies in order to protect international markets from strong
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Private investors should be encouraged to play a bigger role in
granting credits, he said, adding that "stability and growth, and
the fight against poverty, are possible only if private investors
take a leading role."
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Horst Koehler, a German, was the president of
the European Reconstruction and Development Bank in London before
he was appointed IMF managing director. The United States was
opposed to the candidacy of German Deputy Finance Minister Caio
Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
Koehler is expected to put through reforms in the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Tung Praises Basic Law's Role in Maintaining HK's Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa on Saturday spoke
highly of the role of the Basic Law in maintaining Hong Kong's
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law is the constitutional framework which
institutionalizes the unprecedented concept of "one country, two
systems" and the high degree of autonomy, Tung said at a symposium
in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of
the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems" meets the needs of
Hong Kong, Tung said, noting that it "guarantees Hong Kong's long
term prosperity and stability" and "accords with the interests of
the country and lays a firm foundation for the early reunification
of the country."
</P>
<P>
Over the two and a half years after Hong Kong's return to China,
Hong Kong people's lifestyle and social system has remained
unchanged, the well established executive, legislative and
judicial systems continued to function effectively, and the Hong
Kong society continued with its smooth and steady development,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has been committed to the faithful
implementation of the principles of "one country, two systems," "
Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive stressed that the Basic Law, which
constitutes the legal foundation of the "one country, two systems"
concept, is not only the constitutional law of the HKSAR, but also
a national law.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates the systems and policies of the HKSAR,
including the social and economic systems, the protection of
fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents, the executive,
legislative and judicial systems, and the relevant policies.
</P>
<P>
"No law enacted by the legislature of the HKSAR shall
contravene the Basic Law," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that it is in Hong Kong people's interests, and will
be conducive to the development of the HKSAR, for every Hong Kong
resident to gain a better appreciation of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Expressing confidence in the successful implementation of the "
one country, two systems" concept, Tung hopes its successful
implementation in Hong Kong will contribute to the reunification
of the country.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Set Up New Office in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
is planning to set up a new office in Bangkok, aimed to use
Thailand as its base to strengthen cooperation with countries in
the region, Craig Steffensen, ADB Resident Adviser, said here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai News Agency (TNA) quoted Steffensen as saying that the
proposed plan is expected to be endorsed at an ADB meeting on
April 19, and that the new office is expected to be opened by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The new Bangkok office would also help enhance cooperation and
coordination between the Manila-based ADB and countries in the
Mekong Sub-region, particularly in regional development projects,
as it could better access to data and information on political,
economic and social development in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai proposed in 1997 and 1998
that ADB open a regional office in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is now Thailand's third largest source of development
assistance, after Japan and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Steffensen said that the ADB has planned to eventually open
offices in all countries in the Mekong Sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Biggest Commercial Bank Sold to South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has sold its
biggest commercial bank, the National Bank of Commerce (1997)
Limited, to the Amalgamated Banks of South Africa Group (ABSA),
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After spending nine months on groundwork, ABSA officially
acquired 700, 000 shares, equivalent to 70 per cent of the bank's
value, leaving 300,000 shares or 30 per cent to the Tanzanian
government.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony here Friday to mark the transfer of shares to
ABSA, the group's Executive Director Jean Brown handed over a
symbolic 15 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 18.8 million U.S.
dollars) cheque to Tanzanian Minister of Finance Daniel Yona.
</P>
<P>
Share certificates were also given to the stakeholders, the
Tanzanian government and the ABSA.
</P>
<P>
Yona said that efficient management of the country's largest
commercial bank is all the government hopes for after setting it
on the road to full privatization.
</P>
<P>
"We, in the government, had failed to operate the bank
profitably but with advice from our friends, donors and the World
Bank, we decided to privatize it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yona challenged the ABSA management to transform the NBC (1997)
and its 35 branches around the country, including one in Zanzibar,
from a loss- making into a commercially viable finance
institution.
</P>
<P>
Assuring ABSA of no government interference in running the
bank, he said that as a shareholder, the government looked forward
to earning dividend from the bank if it was run efficiently by the
South Africans.
</P>
<P>
The minister also inaugurated the bank's first
post-privatization board of directors under the chairmanship of
the former Bank of Tanzania Governor Charles Nyirabu.
</P>
<P>
ABSA is said to have demanded that the government include
exemption of tax on all capital goods and review of the country's
land laws to allow foreigners to own title deeds before acquiring
the 70 per cent stake in the NBC (1997).
</P>
<P>
ABSA's other African interests include 36.3 percent
shareholding in the Bank of Windhoek of Namibia and a 26 percent
shareholding in the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Brown promised "a vast improvement in the efficiency of NBC
through the introduction of ABSA's operational, credit and risk
policies and procedures. "
</P>
<P>
He dismissed allegations that the group had given the
government conditions which threatened Tanzania's sovereignty as
untrue.
</P>
<P>
"We did not give any conditions as said by some people. The
only thing that we did is to ask for benefits which every investor
is entitled to," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the executive director, all that ABSA had asked
was provided for in the country's laws as incentives which include
tax exemption on capital goods.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1997 Investment Act, foreign investors are entitled
to tax exemption on all capital goods imported into the country
and are given a five-year tax holiday during the first year of
operations.
</P>
<P>
Brown said among other things, ABSA plans to invest heavily in
infrastructure development, including installation of a computer
network that would link all its branches in the country.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process for the NBC (1997) started in
November 1998 after the government split the National Bank of
Commerce into three entities in 1996, the National Micro-finance
Bank, the NBC (1997) and the NBC Holdings Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Initial attempt to privatize the NBC (1997) aborted after four
bidders, Stanbic Bank (T) Ltd, Tanzania Chamber of Commerce,
Industry and Agriculture, First Adili Bankcorp/Tanzania Consortium
and Barclays Bank Plc of UK were disqualified.

on the Catalunya Rally after eighth stage in Lloret De Mar, Spain,
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
McRae, who led fellow Briton Richard Burns by 3.3 seconds after

of the day as the Subaru driver struggled with an electronics
problem, before the series leader fought back on the next run.

Subaru team mechanics reprogrammed Burns's transmisson after
the 29-year-old complained that his gears were shifting slowly and
he performed better on the next stage.
</P>

to remain in third overall, as he moved 18.8 seconds off the lead.
</P>
<P>

eighth stage as he set about closing the gap on the leaders. The
Mitsubishi driver finished the stage 23.5 seconds adrift of McRae.
</P>
<P>
The drivers now face a repeat of two of the morning stages and
the 17.57-kilometer 'Coll Roig' run as they tackle the tougher

CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
met visiting European Union (EU) Commissioner for External
Relations Christopher Patten on Saturday to confer with him on the
preparations of the upcoming African-EU summit in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Pattern took up the issues tabled on the agenda of
the summit along with a host of regional and international issues
of mutual interest, the Egyptian-EU relations and ways to foster
them, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, which will open on Monday, is scheduled to
discuss economic, political and social development in Africa and
cooperation between Africa and the EU in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Pattern arrived here on Friday to take part in the summit,
during which he is to make a speech to expound EU's policy on
intensifying cooperation with the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Later on, Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

goods. Egypt's exports to the EU accounted for 38.7 percent of its
total and imports for 37.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber of Commerce Urges China PNTR Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
has voiced strong support for granting China Permanent Normal
Trade Relations (PNTR) which it believes will benefit American
businesses and workers.
</P>
<P>
China will enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) once they
have signed agreements with other WTO members, regardless of
whether U.S. congress passes PNTR or not, said Dale Grogan,
president of Leapfrog Smart Products, Inc., a software development
firm, on behalf of the U.S. chamber.
</P>
<P>
Grogan, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee
on Thursday, said that a vote on PNTR will only determine whether
U.S. companies benefit from improved access to China's market
under the trade agreement that was negotiated last year.
</P>
<P>
"We have a simple choice to make. We can either embrace and
profit from China as a trading partner, or stick our heads in the
sand and hope they go away," Grogan said.
</P>
<P>
"I am responsible for the livelihood of 50 employees and their
families; the choice is simple for me. We need PNTR and WTO for
China," He added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business
federation representing more than three million businesses and
organizations of every size, sector and region, also stressed in a
news release the importance of opening up markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
"Over 95 percent of the world's population lives outside of the
United States, and isolationism could kill businesses that rely on
foreign markets, as well as suppliers to those firms," the news
release said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, in a speech at
a meeting of Chicago Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday,
put the trade debate over China in a broader perspective. The
Americans, who now live in a new economy, should see "old trade
politics give way to new trade politics" by granting China PNTR,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Next year, the second largest market in the world for personal
computers will be China. The Internet is growing faster in China
than anywhere in Asia," and "China will account for nearly 40
percent of the future growth of U.S. agricultural exports," Daley
said.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to soothe the unionists who are opposing
China PNTR for fear of possible job erosion, Daley said that he
hasn't seen the opposition coming out with job loss studies as
they did with NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, in the last two years union jobs are up by almost
400,000. China offers unions what they need to maintain the
momentum: a growing market, with low tariffs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a recent poll showed that Americans favor the
PNTR by 48 to 36 percent. "I wish we had a bigger majority, but a
12 point spread isn't bad, and we're gaining ground."
</P>
<P>
Daley called for attention to the urgency of the PNTR issue.
</P>
<P>
"Time is key. The longer we wait, the harder it is. A vote in
April is better than May. May is better than June. After that you
run into (party) conventions, and campaigns for the November
elections. After that, we would be back to old politics," he said.

<HEADLINE> Players Sentenced for Match-fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Four former soccer players and a
bookie have been convicted of gambling and sentenced to up to a
year in jail in Vietnam's first match-fixing trial, according to
local reports on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The case was uncovered in late 1997 when Truong Van Duong,
captain of Ho Chi Minh City's Customs team, turned himself in. He
claimed bookie Tran Phi Son threatened him after a fixed match did
not go as expected.
</P>
<P>
Duong told the court during the one-day trial Friday in Ho Chi
Minh City that coaches from six of the 12 teams participating in
the 1997 national championship collaborated to guarantee victories
in home matches and defeats in away games, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Duong, two teammates and a player on the Police team in the
northern port city of Haiphong allegedly rigged 12 matches.
</P>
<P>
Son and Duong each were sentenced to one year. Teammate Tran
Minh Trung was sentenced to 10 months, and two other players were
given 10-month suspended sentences each, reports added.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Says Vesicular Disease Harmless to Humans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Saturday denied press
reports that last Monday's foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in its
Paju, Kyonggi Province, poses a threat to humans.
</P>
<P>
No reports of any harmful effects to humans arising from foot-
and-mouth disease have been recorded in any country in the world,
the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The textbook on veterinary science and public health which was
cited in the reports claiming vesicular disease dangerous to
humans is based on old data, and veterinary laboratories in the
United States, Japan and Germany have since proved that foot-and-
mouth disease is not a threat to humans, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, domestic veterinary science experts said the disease
does no harm to human body, added the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Taiwan have suspended import of livestock and meat
while the United States and Australia stopped import of dairy
products from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has declared Paju as quasi-disaster area on Friday,
after a disease which causes blisters on the mouth and feet of
livestock killed nearly 200 head of cattle and pigs in Paju last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
All livestock within a 20-kilometer radius of Paju have been
quarantined but the nature of the disease has not been determined.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Sees Low Inflation Rate in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Sri Lanka remained
low in March this year,the official Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate in Sri Lanka has been on a declining
trend since the fourth quarter of 1989.
</P>
<P>
This is an outcome of several favorable factors including
increased food production, prudent monetary management, market
development and lowered import tariffs. The declining trend of
inflation has facilitated investment and production activities,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo District Consumers' Price Index of the Central Bank
increased marginally by 0.3 percent in March, reflecting an
average annual inflation rate of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The point-to-point change in the index in March 2000 registered
a marginal increase of 0.6 percent over a year ago. Decline in the
prices of all varieties of rice helped moderate inflation to a
great extent. Prices of some vegetables, coconuts and fish also
dropped in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reports said price increases were observed for
some other vegetables, beef and eggs. The effect of the upward
revision of fuel prices was reflected in March.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo Consumers' Price Index published by the Sri Lankan
Department of Census and Statistics rose by 0.8 percent to 2,456.5
in March this year. The annual average inflation rate in March as
measured by this index remained at the previous month's level of 4.
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The point-to-point change in the index was 4.5 percent compared
with 1.9 percent in February this year, the reports added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Samet Island, a popular tourist
destination, was declared Thailand's first rabies-free zone, the
Government Public Relations Department said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Health Minister Kamron NaLamphun was quoted by a
press release of the department as saying there had been no report
of rabies cases on the island for more than five years, as a
result of strict controls on dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
Samet Island is located in Thailand's eastern province of
Rayong and about 500,000 people visit the island every year.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry and the Livestock Department have
been working together on a rabies control program for many years,
Kamron disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, people who keep dogs and cats as pets have
to treat them almost like a member of the family. A pet needs a
birth certificate and it has to be vaccinated against rabies every
year, Kamron said.
</P>
<P>
The Livestock Department also keeps records on all dogs on the
island, to make sure that all of them are vaccinated, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry plans to make other tourist spots
rabies-free zones in the future.

<HEADLINE> Only Two Events Main Targets: Indonesian Badminton Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) tried on Saturday to reduce the pressure on the
national team its their flop at the All England championships
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The association said it has from the outset had only two events
-- either Thomas or Uber and the Olympics -- as their main targets
for the 2000 calendar.
</P>
<P>
"The other events in 2000 are supposed to be stepping stone (
events)," PBSI Chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo was quoted by national
newspapers Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia came home empty handed from this year's All England
Open in Birmingham, England in March.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made prior to the Japanese Open tournament
from April 5 to 9, which the Indonesians will take part in.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo said that despite setting two events as the main target,
Indonesia has suffered a general setback in its participation in
the international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"We have evaluated the failure, the causes of which appear to
be not only the technical (aspect), but also in the non-technical
and physical (areas)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo blamed discord among athletes, coaches and officials.
</P>
<P>
"Adding to the woes has been the lack of (camaraderie) among
the players, coaches and officials. In relation to that, there has
also been a lot of soul-searching for the sake of recovery. We
have been campaigning for transparency ever since I took over the
chairmanship of PBSI. But, the snags don't seem to have been
cleared yet," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, team manager Christian Hadinata said that, despite
their not being the primary target, the tournaments must not be
overlooked, given the fact that they dictate the players' rankings
which can influence their bid at the upcoming Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Thomas Cup, the Uber Cup and the Olympics are
supposed to be the real challenge for Indonesia, other tournaments
still have an effect," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Hands Over East Timorese Refugees to UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has handed over
responsibility for some 140,000 East Timorese refugees in the
western half of the Timor island to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
According to East Nusa Tenggara (West Timor) Governor Piet
Tallo,starting April 1, the UNHCR will be fully responsible for
the care of these refugees sheltered in East Nusa Tenggara while
the Indonesian government will no longer allocate any funds for
the purpose.
</P>
<P>
"Services to the refugees will all be the responsibility of the
UNHCR and the East Nusa Tenggara government will resume
concentrating on development of the province," Tallo was quoted by
national newspapers Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tallo gave notice to senior UNHCR officer Craig Sanders in
Kupang,capital of East Nusa Tenggara, on Friday to take charge of
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government will only assist the UNHCR in the
administration and facilitation of certain procedures," Vice
Governor Johanes Pake Pani told The Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
The mass exodus of East Timorese to East Nusa Tenggara occurred
due to the violence that followed the overwhelming vote for
independence from Indonesia during a U.N.-sponsored ballot in East
Timor on August 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
While more than 100,000 East Timorese have been repatriated in
recent months, hundreds of thousands of others remain in refugee
camps in the western half of the Timor island because they have no
home or job to return to.
</P>
<P>
The refugees had been given until March 31 to either return to
the newly independent East Timor or accept Indonesia's offer of
citizenship and be resettled elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva said
Jakarta had agreed to give East Timorese refugees in West Timor
another three months to decide whether to return home or to stay
in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Hails EU-L.America Free Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 31 (Xinhua) -- In his Friday talks with the
visiting European Parliamentarians, Mexican Foreign Minister
Rosario Green thanked the Europe Union for its support in reaching
the EU-Latin America free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Green said that the agreement, signed on March 20 in Lisbon,
makes it possible for her country to expand international
political dialogue, diversify its trade exchanges and achieve an
equilibrated development.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is advancing in a correct direction because it wishes to
develop itself through a bigger participation in the globalization
process, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Jose Antonio Seguro, chairman of the European
Parliament delegation for Central America and Mexico, said that
the EU has given high priority to its relations with Mexico and to
strengthening friendship and cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, due to take effect on July 1, assures that
Mexican exports to the EU will be duty-free by 2003.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, by 2003 more than half of EU industrial
exports to Mexico will be duty-free, and the remaining tariffs, to
be reduced from as high as 35 percent to a maximum of 5 percent,
will totally be removed by 2007.
</P>
<P>
As the first between the EU and a Latin American country, the
agreement will give EU companies more access to major Latin
American market and reduce Mexico's dependence on the United
States, analysts said.

<P>
BRASILIA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Brazilian Central
Bank Herminio Fraga on Friday predicted a 4 percent growth in the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) this year, and also the
next 15 years.
</P>

Fraga attributed the growth to steady economic development and
dropping inflation and interest rate.
</P>
<P>
He made this very optimistic speech in Recife, the
northeastern city of Brazil, where he was scheduled to discuss
national economic policies with businessmen and parliamentarians
of the region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's First Oil Spill Emergency Programs Take Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first emergency program
to prevent oil spill accidents in China's oceans goes into effect
today.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the Ministry of Communications and
the State Environmental Protection Administration of China, in
addition to this program there are also regional emergency
programs for the northern China sea, the East China Sea, the South
China Sea and the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Under these programs, oil spills must be reported to related
government departments as well as clean-up operations and oil-
spill compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
Song Jiahui, director of the Maritime Safety Administration of
China (MSAC) under the Ministry of Communications, said the
programs are designed to protect China's marine environment and
resources and reduce the losses and damage caused by oil-spills.
</P>
<P>
Under the programs, MSAC is in charge of coordinating national
efforts to handle large oil-spill accidents. Provincial branches
of MSAC are responsible for smaller oil-spill accidents.
</P>
<P>
Hong Shanxiang, vice-minister of Communications said Friday
that China faces growing risks of serious oil-spills as the number
of oil ships and tankers increases.
</P>
<P>
During the past 26 years, China reported 53 major oil-spills.
Each of these oil spills lost at least 50 tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, over 3,000 tons of oil was spilled into Qingdao Port
in East China's Shandong Province, polluting 230 km of coastal
line and causing serious damage to seaside resorts and 1,000 ha of
aquatic farming areas.

<HEADLINE> Feature: OPEC Deal: Good News For Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A decision by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) this week to increase daily
oil output is good news for Asia, which has been under heavy
pressure of high oil price over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC deal is almost certain to help check the rise in oil
prices, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"That is good news. The oil prices will likely decrease with
OPEC's decision because they have control of the industry,"
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday while appealing
to transport workers in Manila to call off a planned strike
against high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers agreed in Vienna Wednesday to boost oil
production by 1.45 million barrels a day, or to the March 1999
level.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said in Vienna Wednesday that
he hoped the rise would push crude prices down to 20-25 U.S.
dollars a barrel compared with the recent peak of above 30 dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the new production quotas may not be
enough to curb oil prices that have tripled over the past 12
months,and in some countries oil prices may continue to rise
before coming down by fall.
</P>
<P>
Oil company executives in Asia also said pump prices would go
down only if the price of crude oil drops to 21 or 22 dollars per
barrel in the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
Although a possible rollback in oil prices would take some time,
the OPEC deal could help Asian governments ease the impact of
rising prices on consumers, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Asian governments have been under heavy
pressures of rising oil prices, with more demonstrations, strikes
and even violence at home, as oil price hikes have resulted in
higher production costs and affected the daily life of consumers.
</P>
<P>
From transport workers in the Philippines to fishermen in
Thailand,they have all felt the pain of rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Philippine transport workers staged nationwide
strikes, paralyzing 60-90 percent of public transport in some
cities, including Manila.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, on March 2, rebels fired rifles and lobbed a grenade
at the Philippine government's Department of Energy and attacked
two oil depots to express their anger at the rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, fishermen had once threatened to strike if the
government does not waive a tax on imported oil and increase
subsidies for domestic oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Under the heavy pressures, Asian governments had to take a
series of measures, from bigger fuel subsidies to fishermen in
Thailand to lower import duties on oil products in South Korea.
Philippine President Estrada has appealed repeatedly to the three
oil firms in his country not to raise prices too far.
</P>
<P>
But the oil companies argued that they have little choice but
to raise prices, given the shortage of crude oil on the world
market and the weakening of the Philippine currency.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the world was consuming 1.4 million barrels
more of oil a day than its was producing, sending oil prices
soaring from 25 dollars a barrel to 34 dollars early last month.
</P>
<P>
Lower oil prices would also be good news for Asia's trade
balance,as many countries in the region depend on oil imports. As
far as trade deficit is concerned, the impact of high oil prices
is already seen in some electronics-producing nations, such as
Singapore and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
As the cost of oil imports rose and prices for computer chips
tumbled since last November, South Korea recorded in January its
first trade deficit since October 1997. In Singapore, the
government reported a 137.9 million dollar deficit in the same
month, compared with a 323 million dollar trade surplus a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to Morgan Stanley economists, if oil prices average
29 dollars a barrel this year, annual growth in East Asia,
excluding Japan, could drop by 0.6 percentage points, costing the
region between 15 billion and 20 billion dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Besides, analysts said, the OPEC deal would ease inflation
pressure on Asian countries. With growing domestic demand and
rising oil prices, many Asian countries could see higher inflation
rates this year. To combat rising prices, Asian governments would
have to tighten monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the government cut taxes on refined oil
products in early March by 5 to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Tax cuts are fine if your economy is strong and government
revenues are growing," said Geoffrey Barker, regional economist at
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
But as many Asian governments are running budget deficits and
mounting public debt, tax cuts are at best short-term cosmetic
measures to disguise inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Now, as it could at least help stabilize oil prices, the OPEC
deal would help both consumers and governments in Asia reduce the
pain of high oil prices in the near future.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Direct
Investment in Colombia had dropped sharply from 2.9 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998 to 867 million dollars in 1999, authorities said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Dario Uribe, administrative director of the Bank of the
Republic said that the tragic shrink in foreign investment was a
result of the "violence's negative impact" on foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the drop in foreign investment, together with a
similar cut in the government's investment, has hampered the
efforts to reactivate national economy.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian economy had suffered a decrease of five percent
in 1999, one of the biggest drops in its history.

GENEVA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- UEFA abandoned a requirement that
teams should submit a preliminary 35-man roster for the European
Championship finals by May 10.
</P>

in Belgium and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
UEFA's Executive Committee approved abolishing the preliminary
list "with a view to simplifying procedures prior to Euro 2000 and,
at the same time, making life a little bit easier for the sixteen
coaches," the European governing body said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for final rosters was eased from midnight May 31
because many national teams will play warm-up matches that evening,

<HEADLINE> China's New Marine Environmental Protection Law Takes Effect Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's newly-revised Marine
Environmental Protection Law goes into effect today.
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the law were passed by China's top legislature
in December last year and are designed to protect the marine
environment and promote sustainable exploration of the marine
resources in the three-million square kilometers of sea areas
under China's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jirong, deputy director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA), said Friday that the newly-
revised laws will be more effective in protecting the marine
environment since it provides a new legal basis for implementing
relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
China's marine environment has faced serious problems arising
from polluted coastal areas, and the marine eco-system has been
seriously affected, she said.
</P>
<P>
The new law stipulates that government departments take
necessary measures to protect marine lives. A new chapter on the
protection for endangered marine species and marine ecology has
been added as well.
</P>
<P>
China has 18,000 km of coastline with more than three million
sq km of sea areas under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Serious pollution in recent years has led to many problems in
the marine environment. There were some 193 red tides along China'
s coastal areas from 1990 to 1998, costing millions of U.S.
dollars in economic losses annually.
</P>
<P>
In another development, China's first program against oil
pollution in its sea also goes into effect today.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect its rapidly-depleted marine fish resources,
China announced last Friday to continue its ban on fishing in
summer this year in the East China and the South China seas.

WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Sixth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten
of Brazil beat injured Andre Agassi for a 6-1, 6-4 victory in the
semifinals at the 5.72 million U.S. dollars Ericsson Open tennis
tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Agassi, who held a 4-2 record against Kuerten in
their previous six encounters, took a medical time-out after the

Kuerten made the most of the moment, never offering Agassi a

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Washington Talks at Initial Stage: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Friday night described the Palestinian-Israeli talks held in
Washington on final-status issues as being "at their initial
stage."
</P>
<P>
The two teams were still in the phase of exchanging views and
have not entered into substantive discussions over concerned
issues, Arafat said in a weekly session of the Palestinian
leadership in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) and ministers of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the session, the Palestinian
leadership stressed that Israel should carry out a last-stage troop
redeployment before the two sides reach a deal on permanent peace,
in accordance with all the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
It also underlined that Israel's implementation of redeployment
in the interim period should be separated from the final-status
issues being discussed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian team headed by Yasser Abed Rabbo and Israeli
delegation led by Oded Eran ended their week-long talks Tuesday in
Bolling Air Force Base in southeastern Washington without making
visible progress, but the two sides agreed to resume talks on April
6.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership hoped the second stage of Washington
talks will enable Israel to deliver its obligations "faithfully and
completely." The Israeli negotiators should be adequately
authorized so that the last-stage Israeli pullout can be
implemented according to timetable, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said the Oslo agreement, which kicked off the
peace process, requires Israel to withdraw troops from all occupied
Palestinian territories including Gaza and the West Bank, except
Jerusalem and Israeli settlements and military positions whose fate
would be decided in the final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has so far surrendered most of Gaza and about 40 percent
of the West Bank to full or partial Palestinian rule, but asked to
incorporate the third redeployment with the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership reiterated that peace talks on
Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks are complementary, and that
the Israeli media claim that the three tracks are competing with
each other is totally baseless.
</P>
<P>
Such "baseless" propaganda was only part of Israel's tactics in
the negotiations, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
All the three tracks rest squarely on international law, U.N.
resolutions, and the land-for-peace principle, it emphasized.

<HEADLINE> French Skaters Win Figure Skating Ice Dancing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICE, France, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Figure Skating
Championships skated into a climax here Friday night with French
Marina Anissina/Gwendal Peizerat winning the thrilling dancing
finale.
</P>
<P>
It is the first gold of the category for Franch after brother
and sister ice dancers Isabelle/Paul Duchesnay won the event at
the 1991 world championships in Munich.
</P>
<P>
They also become the second pair from the hosting country to
win the ice dancing title in the championships history. At the
1962 world championships in Prague, Czech skaters Eva Romanova/
Pavel Roman claimed the title.
</P>
<P>
Italian dancers Barbara Fusar-Poli/Maurizio Margaglio, leaders
after compulsary and orginal dances, also had a brilliant
performance on the ice, but it was only enough to earn them the
silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Margarita Drobiazko/Povilas Vanagas, third place finishers in
Vienna, had the bronze medal, the first one for Lithuania at the
world championships.
</P>
<P>
With injury withdrawl of reigning champions Anjelika Krylova/
Oleg Ovsiannikov of Russia, the French pair have been the
strongest contenders for the crown.
</P>
<P>
Skating first in the last group of six in free dance, the
European champions this year displayed the same Carmina Burana
program as in Vienna, which was packed with innovative choregraphy,
lightening fast twizzles and dance spins, a reverse lift (where
Anissina lifted Peizerat) performed with their charateristic
dramatic intensity.
</P>
<P>
The full-house crowd gave them a standing ovation and the
winners received four the higest possible marks of 6.0s for
presentation.
</P>
<P>
The French pair have been waiting for long for the gold medal.
At the lst world championships in Helsinki, they lost to Krylova/
Ovsiannikov by split marks.
</P>
<P>
"It has been extremly difficult to concentrate and to go out
there. The audience was great, but there was also a lot of
pressure, but we skated a good free dance," said Anissina.
</P>
<P>
Peizerat added: "It is the first time that I give such a strong
dedication to the program in competition."
</P>
<P>
Fusar-Poli and Margaglio's portrayal of two warriors in their
Duel routine won a rapturous reception from the crowd. It was a
powerful performance showing speed across the ice, fast turns,
deep edges and innovative lifts. It awarded them four 5.9s for
presentation.
</P>
<P>
The Italian pair are quite enjoyful for the silver medal. Fusar-
Poli said: "we are skating after four 6.0s, and we are skating in
France, it gave us much pressure. But anyhow, we are quite happy
with the result."
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget, we are the first after Latin dance (orginal
dance)," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanians romantic program, set to Spente Le Stelle by
Emma Shapplin, began with a flowing spin combination and contained
many unusual lifts and steps.
</P>
<P>
The first medal for the Lithuanians brought them more than
happiness. "I don't know what to say. I am so happy, it's
unbelievable. We are not used to winning medals after all. But
today, we felt it was going to happen. We had an excellent
practice, and we skated very well. We put everything we had into
this free dance," said Drobiazko. "We just felt great, and
everything fell into place."
</P>
<P>
For Russian skaters, it was a sad night. 1999 European bronze
medalists Irina Lobacheva/Ilia Averbukh only managed to finish
fourth in the category after the free dance.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1968 that Russian skaters don't win
a medal of any hue in ice dancing at the world championships.

<HEADLINE> Bach Runs for IOC Vice-president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I have decided to run for the position," Bach told Geramn
Press Agency DPA Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are four IOC vice-presidents now with the Canadian Dick
Pound will resign. The vote by the IOC will take place at the IOC
Session in Sydney a few days before the 2000 Summer Olympic Games
opening on September 15th.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Chiharu Igaya will also run for the position. In 1996
in Atlanta Bach had defeated Igaya at the vote for the member of
the executive committee of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
46-year-old Bach was the fencing champion at Montreal Olympiad
in 1976. He had got guide and support from the incumbent IOC-
President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
In 1981 at the IOC Session in Baden-Baden of Germany, only 27-
year-old Bach was elected into the new established athlete
committee. Ten years later in 1991, Bach had replaced the position
of Willi Daume as the member of the IOC Committee and 1996 he rose
into the executive board of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Bach led a society for economic law. Under his leadership the
society became into two important IOC-committees, the juristic
committee and the committee for marketing which was in charge of
seeking for new financial sponsors.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 Bach was named as Chairman of the Appellate Court of
the International Sport-Court (CAS). He was also the chairman of
the Evaluation Committee of the bidding cities for the Winter
Olympiad 2002 and the Summer Olympiad 2004.
</P>
<P>
If Bach is elected to the vice-president of the IOC he will be
the third German IOC vice-president after Willi Daume (1972-1976)
and Berthold Beitz(1984-1988).

</P>
<P>
Shareh made clear to the diplomats the "obstacles put by Israel
in the course of peace talks on the Syrian track," and Syria's firm
stand in this regard, according to Syrian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke off in January over Israel's
rejection of Syrian demand that the Jewish state return in full the
Golan Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Shareh reiterated Syria's insistence on the implementation of
international legitimacy including U.N. Security Council
Resolutions 242, 338 and 425, and the land-for-peace principle
conceived in Madrid Middle East Conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria constantly "adheres to its legitimate rights"
while it continues the efforts towards a just and honorable peace
which guarantees the return of occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting Friday with European ambassadors to Syria,
Shareh said President Assad rejected at the Geneva summit an
Israeli demand to have full sovereignty over Jordan river and
Galilee Sea waters.
</P>
<P>
Assad said the Israeli demand is a contravention of
international resolutions as well as late Israeli Premier "
(Yitzhak) Rabin's Legacy."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Journalists Sentenced for Libeling Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Saturday handed
down jail sentences on three journalists for libeling the country's
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The south Cairo criminal court sentenced Magdi Ahmed Hussein,
editor-in-chief of the Al Shaab newspaper, fiery mouthpiece of the
opposition Labor Party, and reporter Salah Bedeiwi to two years in
prison, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced Essam Hanafi, a cartoonist of the
paper, to one-year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Each of the three journalists and Adel Hussein, writer of the
newspaper, were fined 20,000 Egyptian pounds (about 5,800 U.S.
dollars) in the libel case filed against them by Youssef Wali, also
minister of agriculture and land reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The court convicted them of libeling Wali in a series of
articles and cartoons in Al Shaab, that accused him of "treason"
and "working as an agent" for Israel. The court said the charges
were groundless.
</P>
<P>
The Islamist bi-weekly called Wali "a traitor" and blamed him
for destroying Egypt's economy by signing several agricultural
agreements with Israel on supply of seed, fertilizers and
technology to arrest desertification.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the journalists were given the same sentences for
libeling the senior official. The Court of Cassation, Egypt's
highest court, freed the three jailed men and rescinded their fines
in December after accepting their appeal on the grounds that they
were "not given a chance to defend themselves" in their trial.
</P>
<P>
In the retrial, the court granted the journalists' request to
hear the testimony of Wali, who did not appear in court in the
original trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Libyan State Secretary for African
Affairs Abdu Salam al-Tureiki said his country is keen on making
the Africa-Europe summit in Cairo a "Success."
</P>
<P>
Al-Tureiki made the remarks on the sidelines of the preparatory

adding that "we will make efforts for the sake of Africa and
African people."
</P>

He said that "there are not disagreement between Libya and any

with the European countries because most of our imports and exports
are with Europe."
</P>
<P>
The Libyan official expressed hope of continued cooperation and
dialog with Europe, stressing the importance of such meetings.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of a face-to-face meeting between Libyan
leader Muammar Gaddafi and European leaders, al-Tureiky said "there
is no problem in this concern," adding that Gaddafi is to meet with
some European leaders on the sidelines of the Africa-Europe summit.

It will be the first DPRK foreign minister to visit Germany

<HEADLINE> UK Autoworkers Rally Against Rover's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 80,000 people marched through
the central English city of Birmingham Saturday to protest against
the planned demise of British carmaker Rover.
</P>
<P>
Protesters, at one of the biggest demonstrations since the
Labor government came to power, derided the decision by German
carmaker BMW to sell its Rover unit.
</P>
<P>
The sale could affect 50,000 jobs in the Birmingham area, once
a thriving bastion of manufacturing but now facing rising
unemployment, crime and social problems as jobs dry up, Reuters
reported.
</P>
<P>
Some of Britain's biggest unions, led by the Transport and
General Workers Union (T&AMP;G), representing the bulk of the 9,000
workers at Rover's nearby Longbridge plant, headed the march.
</P>
<P>
Men, women and children blew whistles and waved placards
pledging "it is not all over for Rover" and saying BMW stood for "
Betrayed Midlands Workers."
</P>
<P>
Britain's ailing auto industry was dealt another blow Saturday
when Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd announced it would cut production
by 13 percent at its only UK plant because of the strength of the
pound. Honda said no jobs would be lost.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed support for the
demonstration, telling members of parliament, "I know how
desperately serious the situation is and I fully understand and
share the deep concerns that the march demonstrates."

<HEADLINE> Cuba Asks U.S. To Honor Promise on Elian's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez
Roque said Saturday in Madrid that the U.S. government "must exert
its authority and fulfill its promise of returning immediately
Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez to his father."
</P>
<P>
Perez Roque said during a stop in this city on his way to
Havana that the Cuban government "does not use this issue with
political or electoral purposes as those of U.S. Vice President
Albert Gore, who detached himself from the Bill Clinton
administration and supported the bills of law in Congress to grant
permanent residence to Elian Goanzalez and all his Cuban family.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban minister said, "This legal labyrinth is exasperating
when the U.S. government recognized the right to the custody of
the father." He was referring to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) decision to acknowledge the
paternity right of the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"We defend the right to the custody, the fulfilling of the U.S.
law, and the respect to international law so this case will not
set a precedent with children of other countries," said the Cuban
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban minister said about the trip to the United States
foreseen for Elian's father, together with several companions that
he is confident that he will receive adequate assistance to assume
the custody of the boy until the conflict is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the U.S. relations with Cuba at this moment, Perez
Roque criticized the maintenance of the economic blockade "despite
the rejection of most of the international community."
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to maintain normal relations on the basis of
the respect of each country for the internal affairs of the other,
and Cuba has the firm determination to be an independent people,"
said the Cuban minister.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Stars Dollarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorians are starting Saturday to
intensify their relations with the U.S. dollar, with the
implementation of the national economy dollarization
</P>
<P>
The substitution from Saturday of the monetary scheme and the
economic model will become evident in the daily life of the
Ecuadoran population in operative and technical changes that will
be made in the coming weeks in three main sectors: banking, trade
and taxes.
</P>
<P>
The price of fuels was already dollarized Saturday. Super
gasoline was sold for 0.61 dollars per gallon, extra gasoline at 0.
40 dollars, and diesel at 0.22 dollars. These prices will be
increased with the margins of profit of private marketing
companies, which amounts to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sucres and dollars will start circulating simultaneously
Saturday in the Ecuadoran market, where counterfeit dollar bills
have also appeared.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran Central Bank continues exchanging sucres for
dollars for the citizens. The deadline to exchange them was set at
180 days counted from last week, in which sucres will be gradually
taken out of circulation and will be replaced by fraction coins
with new characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In this way, sucre bills and metallic coins circulating now
will be legal tender until September 13 of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran government announced on January 9 the
dollarization of the national economy as a new economic and
monetary model to stop the galloping inflation, and also to stop
the economic crisis that caused in 1999 the closing of more than 4.
000 small and medium-sized enterprises, whose workers went to the
unemployed ranks.
</P>
<P>
The government and the National Congress approved the Law of
Economic Transformation, also known as The Trolleybus Law, that
permits implementation of the new economic and monetary model of
Ecuador.

LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble said Saturday that he was prepared to take a "calculated
risk" to save Northern Ireland's stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he would be prepared to re-enter government with
Sinn Fein without prior decommissioning of paramilitary weapons if
he was certain it would work, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said, "We are anxious to see that all of the Agreement
is implemented. We are anxious to see that devolution and
decommissioning occur. Doing nothing is the way of making sure
that you don't have decommissioning."
</P>
<P>
He added, "If there is anything that looks to me as though
there is an assurance that it will work, then I'll bring it to the
(ruling UUP) council and the council will decide."
</P>
<P>
The former first minister in the short-lived power sharing
executive admitted he was stumped by the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to see the way out of this without a
significant shift in the position of the republican movement. If
they retain the position they adopted in February, then it's very
difficult to see how this matter can be resolved," he said.
</P>

His comments followed separate meetings he and Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams held with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern designed
to inject new life into the process.

ROME, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of Italians subscribing to
Internet providers is growing at an exceptional rate and this year
should leap by 122 percent, from 4.5 million in 1999 to 10 million,
a research said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Data from Internet providers has shown that a similar trend is

The typical Internet user was found to Net surf at least three
times a week and that there was no special place where people
preferred to connect, with 30.8 percent doing so from the work
place and 15.3 percent from schools or universities.

<HEADLINE> Chile, Bolivia End Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chile and Bolivia have surmounted
their differences they had since the implementation of safeguards
(customs tariffs overcharges) applied by Chile to Bolivian
products with price bands (sugar, oils, and wheat) by means of
bilateral conversations in Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia protested before the Chilean government for the measure,
alleging that it affected its main export product to Chile, oils,
which are more than 42 percent of the total amount imported from
that country, which last year reached 22.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of the two neighboring countries agreed at
Friday's meeting that Chile will lift the safeguards for the
quotas of oils included in the agreement. This considers 22,000
tons of crude oil, and a quota of 10 million dollars worth of
refined oils.
</P>
<P>
One of the two main problems that these two nations maintain
was resolved in this manner. The other problem is the measure
taken by the Chilean customs related to the import of mixed oils.
When these products were included in the quotas, the prices bands,
which have tariffs above 31.5 percent, were affected.
</P>
<P>
The two governments agreed to abide by the decision to be
dictated no later than April 10 by an arbitration commission,
formed by arbiters from Bolivia, Chile, and the Latin American
Integration Association (ALADI), who are analyzing the case.
</P>
<P>
The delegations of the two countries also agreed to meet in an

<HEADLINE> Simitis Promises to Create More New Jobs in Coming Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Saturday pledged that if his ruling Panhellenci Socialist
Movement (PASOK) won the April 9 parliamentary elections, a total
of 300,000 new jobs would be created over the next four years with
particular emphasis on youth, women and the long-term unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Simitis made the promise while addressing an election rally in
Agrinio, western Greece.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the new government to wipe out the
increasing unemployment as part of its efforts to improve the
Greek people's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Greece's jobless rate now
stands at just over 10 percent, but local press reports said that
it is more than 11 percent, and most victims are youth and women.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Simitis has reportedly created a total
of 200,000 jobs over the past four years, and in the coming four
years, a further 300,000 posts providing salaried apprenticeship
will also be offered.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Greece has enjoyed the highest growth rate of
more than 3 percent among European countries, and it is believed
that more and more new jobs will be created with the further
strengthening of the Greek economy's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
With the elections drawing near, unemployment has become one
of the top topics between the ruling PASOK and the main opposition
New Democracy (ND).
</P>
<P>
On April 9, the Greek voters will cast their ballots at 18.959
polling stations throughout the country, and the ruling PASOK is
expected to win the general elections although it will be a close
contest for the country's two largest political parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan government
rejected Belize's proposal to subject the territorial difference
conflict to the mediation of the United Nations, the Guatemalan
Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Vice Foreign Minister Rafael Salazar called the
Belize proposal "a maneuver to win time since that is one of the
elements the neighbor country has to boost its pretenses,"
according to reports received here.
</P>
<P>
"If the dispute is already within the Organization of American
States (OAS) jurisdiction, it would not proceed to take it to the
United Nations, because that would mean to start a new process in
which we do not know whether the matter will deserve the attention
and if there will be a site for it in the agenda," said Salazar.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan diplomat explained that some days ago Belize
suggested that U.N. General Secretary Kofi Annan should create a
commission of jurists who would analyze the problem and mediate in
the dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government maintains the position of recovering
more than 12,000 square kilometers of Belize's territory that was
part of Guatemala, which is flatly rejected by Belize.
</P>
<P>
The more than one century old territorial dispute has generated
a series of diplomatic scrapes between military governments,

<HEADLINE> Andean Community, Argentina Ends Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Andean Community of Nations (ACN)
General Secretary Sebastian Alegrett said Saturday here that the
talks for an Agreement of Tariff Preferences between the ACN and
Argentina have practically concluded.
</P>
<P>
The end of the talks occurred during the meeting held in Buenos
Aires on March 27-30.
</P>
<P>
Alegrett said that a consensus was found at the Buenos Aires
meeting about the text of the normative part of the Preferences
Accord and during the negotiations for the total universe of
products of interest of the ACN, with the exception of the small
group of products of interest for Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
He also said that to guarantee the trade currents and until the
new agreement is implemented, Argentina and the ACN countries
agreed to postpone for 60 days the Bilateral Agreements in force
within the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI).
</P>
<P>
Argentina is the second Southern Common Market (Mercosur)
country with which the Andean Community reaches an agreement of
tariff preferences, and this is an important step toward the
creation of the free trade zone between the two subregional groups.
</P>
<P>
Alegrett revealed that Paraguay and Uruguay, two of the
Mercosur members, have stated their interest to negotiate a
preferences accord in a similar way as the one followed by their
partners Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The Framework Agreement for the creation of a free trade zone
between the Andean Nations Community signed in April of 1998
foresees the development of talks in two stages: an Agreement of
Fixed Preferences will be negotiated in the first stage, and a
Free Trade Agreement in the second.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community of Nations is formed by Peru, Venezuela,
Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia.

<HEADLINE> Separations, Divorce on Rise in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Separations and divorces are on the
rise in Italy, according to a study released Saturday from the
national statistics bureau Istat.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that women preferred to separate while men
opted for divorce when their marriages went wrong and that
marriages were more likely to go in the rocks when the couples are
between the ages of 38 and 44.
</P>
<P>
Looking at data from 1998, Istat found that separations rose 4.
1 percent over the previous year while divorces inched up 0.5
percent, which translated into 4.3 separations and 2.3 divorces
for every one thousand married couples.
</P>
<P>
Marriages were most at risk in the north, above all in the
northwestern region of Valle d'Aosta where there were 7.9
separations and 5.9 divorces per one thousand married couples.
</P>
<P>
Marriages remained more secure in the south where in the region
of Basilicata there were only 1.8 separations and 0.8 divorces per
one thousand couples, while in Calabria there were 1.9 separations
and 1 divorces.
