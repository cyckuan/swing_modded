JOHNSON: PRESSURE `PART OF IT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As if Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
didn't have enough to worry about after his hospitalization last
week for an irregular heartbeat and something less than a sterling
vote of confidence at the break from team managing partner Bob
Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Then came an article this weekend that proclaimed the Dodgers
were set to pursue Giants manager Dusty Baker unless the team makes
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is in his 14th season as a major-league manager, with
his fourth different club, and said he's been through too much to
concern himself over speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to worry too much about stuff like that,'' Johnson
said. ``I can't let it distract me from what I'm trying to
accomplish. I've got three world championship rings and want
another one real bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me worrying about things that are out of my control is wasted
energy. I really don't want to talk about conjecture or
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said pressure to perform was part of his job
description.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's one of the things that's reality - if you have a
high payroll, you'd best win,'' he said. ``I mean, you'd best win.
And it's on me. It's part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A healthy dilemma: Here's a new one for the Dodgers - too many
healthy players.
</P>
<P>
   Unless someone suddenly comes up lame, the Dodgers are about to
experience a roster crunch as outfielder Devon White, catcher Todd
Hundley and reliever Gregg Olson come off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said White (torn rotator cuff) will work out with the
team before tonight's game against the Giants and could be
activated today, but more likely Monday or Tuesday in Colorado.
Hundley (fractured thumb) is also eligible to come off the DL
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who appeared in only two games before going on the DL on
April 11 with a forearm strain, believes he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference of opinion whether he's ready,'' general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``If we really felt he was 100 percent,
we'd bring him back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson said the Dodgers would still face a roster problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roster is out of balance,'' he said. ``We have three
outfielders hurt. We can't be adding an extra pitcher at this
point. He's been out for quite awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is, I'm not going to bump somebody on the roster
who's been doing a heck of a job, regardless of your potential.
We're at seven pitchers. I need to go to another outfielder, and
with Grud's (shortstop Mark Grudzielanek) status, I'd like another
infielder to play the middle. It's basically numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Grudzielanek, still weak since being out last
week with a viral infection, was rested Saturday. ``Grud's really
weak and needed a day off,'' Johnson said. ``He could barely make
it (Friday).'' ... Gary Sheffield had his 12-game hitting streak
snapped. ... After today's homestand finale, the Dodgers play 23 of
their next 26 games on the road.

WEBB LOOKS FOR HISTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBERTYVILLE, Ill. _ Karrie Webb, like Tiger Woods, has a chance
to make history with a victory today in a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, can complete a career grand slam of golf's major
championships by prevailing at the British Open. Webb, 25, would
qualify for induction into the LPGA Hall of Fame with a victory
today in the U.S. Women's Open at the Merit Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my ultimate career goal,'' Webb said of being inducted
into the Hall. ``If I win, I'll have achieved that already. It's
very overwhelming. It's something I don't take for granted. I don't
want to get ahead of myself, but that would make a victory extra
special.'' STUMBLE AT THE SHORTCUT
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mallon took bogey yesterday by playing the 14th hole from
the 13th fairway, the first time during the tournament she's posted
a bogey while using her alternate route on the hole. Because of a
back-left pin placement, Mallon said her circuitous routeremained
``the best play for me'' and did not second-guess her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Not even after playing partner Betsy King, who suffered a
strained back during her round, posted a birdie at the same hole
while shooting an 82. The irony was not lost on Mallon, who stands
four strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, Betsy proved me wrong and birdied the hole the
conventional way with a bad back,'' Mallon said, laughing. DRIVER
HURTS KUEHNE
</P>
<P>
   An erratic driver hurt Dallas resident Kelli Kuehne during
yesterday's third round. Kuehne found only 7 of 14 fairways during
a round of 73. She dropped to 2-over par for the tournament, nine
strokes behind leader Karrie Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne's rooting section will be minus one high-profile figure
for today's final round. Husband Jay Humphrey (6-foot-7, 300
pounds), an offensive tackle for the Minnesota Vikings, departed
after yesterday's round because today is the first day of the
Vikings' training camp. COUNTING ON CARRYOVER
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials hope to parlay huge anticipated viewership
for today's final round of the British Open, where Tiger Woods
seeks to complete a career grand slam, into strong ratings for the
U.S. Women's Open as well.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the British Open is carried by ABC, while the
Women's Open is on NBC. Mary Capouch, chairman of the USGA's
women's committee, said the anticipated 2 p.m. conclusion to the
British Open should carry viewers into the television window for
the Women's Open (2-5 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ``In some people's eyes, it works in our favor, because habitual
television viewing is a popular thing to do,'' Capouch said. ``You
get in the habit of watching the British Open, and then move right
into the Women's Open after that. Our television partners felt that
was to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. In an ESPN poll conducted Friday night,
viewers were asked to name one of seven sporting events scheduled
for today that they would be most likely to watch. The British Open
was first, at 46.4 percent. The Women's Open was last, at 1.1
percent _ just behind the Davis Cup (1.2). ATTENDANCE SHORTFALL
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials said they are counting on significant
walk-up sales today to boost attendance figures past 100,000 for
the week. Ed Oldfield, Merit Club president, said officials
initially projected a total attendance of 125,000 for the event,
which would have set a tournament record.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, pre-tournament sales were slow, and unseasonably cool
temperatures and overcast conditions have limited walk-up sales
during the event. With yesterday's crowd of 22,010, the total
attendance for the week has been 76,159, including 18,330 for
practice rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance figures for pre-cut tournament rounds included 15,548
(Thursday) and 20,271 (Friday). The 1998 Women's Open in Kohler,
Wis., drew 123,000 spectators, the largest crowd in tournament
history and one of three times in the event's 55-year history that
the event has topped 100,000. nn

POOR PRACTICE LEAVES CAMPO DISPLEASED

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Coach Dave Campo wasn't pleased with the
Cowboys' offense yesterday, saying that he was unable to rule out
rigor mortis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that it was the eighth practice,''
Campo said. ``This is where rigor mortis starts to set in on some
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was discussed the previous night during a team
meeting when Campo told the players that this needs to be ``a
mentally tough football team'' that can fight through the sore
muscles and tired legs, the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys responded to that, and some guys didn't,'' said
Campo, who saw his defensive players step it up after letting the
offensive players dominate the first four days of camp. ``Actually,
the defense should catch up. One thing I know about defensive
players is that they have an awful lot of pride in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion yesterday morning, the offense had 12 players in
the huddle. Another time, there were 10 men on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frustrates you,'' said Campo, who is emphasizing mental
sharpness to go along with the new, up-tempo offense. ``We have to
be sharp every time we walk out there. I know our players will
respond.'' PENALTY WATCH
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys led the NFL in penalties (136) and penalty yardage
(1,196) last season. Campo had been pleased with the improvement
until yesterday morning when the offensive line had two
illegal-procedure calls and an offside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier, we had two practices in which we didn't have a
penalty,'' Dave Campo said. ``My feeling is that that's an
on-going, day-to-day battle because it comes down to focus. And if
you're not focused, that's when you get penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo's solution: Build on mental toughness, not just physical
toughness. DEION GOT HELP TOO?
</P>
<P>
   Much has made about how the loss of Deion Sanders affects the
Cowboys' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   There has even been talk that the cornerbacks will get a lot of
coverage help from the safeties.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo confirms that the safety will cheat over a lot to
provide help in 2000. He also said they cheated on both sides in
1999, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that with Deion,'' Campo said. ``There was some give
and take there. Because of his injuries, we had to do some things
to help him. You'd be surprised how many times.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   -- Dave Campo singled out a few players for the strides they
have made during the first week of practice, including guards
Kelvin Garmon and Al Jackson, running backs Michael Wiley and
Michael Black and receiver Wane McGarity.
</P>
<P>
   -- Receiver Jeff Ogden, who has yet to practice, had a setback
of sorts Friday. While rehabilitating a sprained right foot, Ogden
sprained his left ankle. He could be sidelined for another week.
</P>
<P>
   -- Campo said the Cowboys had four penalties in Saturday
morning's practice after going two practices with none.
</P>
<P>
   -- Defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman sat out yesterday
afternoon's practice because of sore knees. nn

ROOF REFUSES TO CLOSE
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For $517 million, this wasn't supposed to happen. But
it did. The Rangers and the Mariners had to endure a 54-minute rain
delay after the third inning at Safeco Field yesterday when the
retractable roof malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Mariners, the problem was ``a computer
communication failure between the touch screen used to activate the
roof-moving mechanism and the program that controls the roof
function.''
</P>
<P>
   An engineer was called in from the company that designed the
roof, the communication errors were found, and the system was
rebooted. The roof finally started moving after a 30-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first rain delay in Seattle since Sept. 12, 1969,
when the Seattle Pilots and the California Angels were delayed in
the second game of a doubleheader. Rain delays were common that
year in Seattle, and the Pilots left before the next season to
become the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners came into existence in 1977 and played in the
Kingdome, but that wasn't totally immune from the effects of
nature. A Mariners game against the Cleveland Indians on May 2,
1996, was stopped in the seventh inning by an earthquake that
registered 5.4 on the Richter scale. It was called 10 minutes after
the earthquake and resumed the next day with the Indians winning,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome is also where four tiles, weighing 15 pounds each,
fell from the roof July 19, 1994. The Mariners had to play their
final 20 games on the road before the remainder of the season was
scuttled by the players' strike. PERISHO, DAVIS ON HOLD
</P>
<P>
   Matt Perisho is scheduled to pitch Wednesday against the Anaheim
Angels, but Doug Davis might start if Perisho is needed in long
relief before then.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho threw 44 pitches in the Rangers' 12-3 loss to the
Seattle Mariners Friday night, and Davis threw 97 in relief. Davis
is the Rangers' long reliever. But if manager Johnny Oates needs a
long reliever before Wednesday, Perisho would fill the role. That
would leave Davis to start Wednesday against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect Perisho to make that start, but their workload
between now and then will dictate that,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers eventually want to give Davis a shot as a starter,
but that spot still belongs to Perisho.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pecking order,'' Oates said. ``Matt deserves first
shot. He's been in the big leagues more and been around longer. He
gets first shot. Davis has to wait, just like Perisho had to wait
for Mark Clark.'' GREER GETS DAY OFF
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer, battling an 0-for-14 slump, got the day off
yesterday. Greer is hitting .320 in his past 29 games to raise his
average from .200 to .269, but a 4-for-29 skid had brought him down
from a season-high .290.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a rest mentally as much physically,'' Greer said.
``I haven't been swinging the bat good, and Johnny's good about
realizing you might need a break mentally. My recent at-bats
haven't been as productive as I'd like for them to be.'' PALMEIRO
GETS 1,300TH RBI
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro's sacrifice fly in the first inning gave him his
1,300th run batted in of his career. He is the 70th major-leaguer
to reach that level. That was the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was Palmeiro was 0-for-3 yesterday and is now
2-for-29 on the road trip. He has one extra base hit and three RBI
in his past 10 games. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   -- The Mariners have all but ruled out activating shortstop Alex
Rodriguez off the disabled list for today's game. Instead, they'll
wait for either tomorrow or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rangers pitchers have allowed 10 or more runs in 17 games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Rangers have lost four consecutive games to the Mariners,
by a combined score of 42-15. nn

DEVERS FACES BIGGEST HURDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Imagine Marion Jones winning back-to-back Olympic
titles in the long jump and getting shut out of the medals in the
100-meters. It sounds implausible until you consider the career of
sprinter Gail Devers.
</P>
<P>
   The former UCLA standout is a hurdler, first and foremost, and
yet the 100-meter footrace is where she has made her mark at the
Olympics. Devers won consecutive sprint titles in Barcelona in 1992
and in Atlanta in 1996. Meantime, the best finish she has posted in
three trips to the Olympics in the hurdles is a fourth - .01-second
out of third - in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That void in an otherwise sparkling resume is largely what
drives Devers to continue in the sport at the relatively advanced
age of 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says I'm a hurdler and not a sprinter,'' said Devers,
who won her preliminary heat Saturday. ``The irony is I have
(Olympic) medals in the sprint and not the hurdles. That's one of
the reasons I'm still competing; to get a medal in the hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   She moved a step closer to that goal Saturday when she survived
the heats of the 100-meter hurdles at the U.S. Olympic Track and
Field Trials. The semifinals and finals will be run today as part
of the final afternoon of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Devers finished fifth in the 100 meters last week, so if she
earns a berth to Sydney she won't have to worry about her focus
being diffused.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my chance to look like a hurdler instead of a sprinter
going over the hurdles,'' Devers said with a devilish grin.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be an Olympic year if Devers wasn't battling some
kind of adversity. She overcame Graves disease in the three years
leading up to the 1992 Summer Games. This year Devers missed seven
weeks of training because of left hamstring and right Achilles'
tendon injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it appeared to affect her much. Less than two weeks
after shedding the boot she was wearing to stabilize her left foot,
Devers ran a 2000 world-best in the 100 hurdles of 12.47.
</P>
<P>
   With a time like that, why should she contemplate retirement?
Devers knows there are people who want to lump her in with Johnny
Gray and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, athletes of her era who failed in
their bids to stave off the younger generation here. But she's not
ready to concede a thing to age or her critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the window is closing,'' Devers said. ``I don't think
it's closed yet. I don't think anyone can push you out of the
sport. You leave when you want to. Right now Gail Devers is still
having fun on the track. If I don't have the energy to train, if
I'd rather be home playing with my dogs, that's when it's time to
retire.''

REALITY SETTING IN FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Rangers' longest road trip of the season comes to
an end today, but certain realities have already set in hard.
</P>
<P>
   Those are that a third consecutive division title just isn't
going to happen, a wild-card playoff spot is going to be extremely
difficult to win and it could be a long two months to the end if
the Rangers' young pitchers don't get better soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers can't handle much more of what has been happening
this weekend. The day after Matt Perisho got knocked out in the
first inning, Ryan Glynn got pummelled for nine runs in five
innings and the Rangers ended up getting trounced by the Seattle
Mariners, 13-5, yesterday at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to pitch to have a chance to win,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``We want to let these guys have a chance to pitch, but
they've got to get somebody out so the whole ballclub doesn't get
demoralized.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be close to happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to start pitching better,'' second baseman Luis
Alicea said. ``These guys have good arms. They're throwing 95-96
mph, but they can't be afraid to throw strikes. It's becoming
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Rangers' eighth in their past 11 games and left
them 111/2 games behind the Mariners in the American League West
and 61/2 behind the Oakland Athletics in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Oates implored his team after the game not to give up on the
season, but a 3-7 road trip has hardly been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face reality; it's tough,'' Oates said. ``But we've still got
a lot of baseball left to play, and we need to win as many games as
we can. Don't worry about the standings, we just need to get this
ship headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``One 11-game road trip isn't going to tell how good you are or
how bad you are. If we're going to do that, I'm going to judge this
ballclub on May \Rwhen they went 18-10.\S We're certainly not as
good as we played in May, and we're not as bad as our last seven
games \R1-6\S. We're somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers really are is a team in transition from a
veteran ballclub to one going more with youth, and they continue to
find that's a painful process.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, in his second start since coming off the disabled list,
was given a 2-0 lead in the first inning, and he gave it back right
away. Mike Cameron's two-out double in the first scored one run,
and Edgar Martinez tied it with a home run in the third.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse after the two teams sat through a 54-minute rain
delay that took place because it took the Mariners 30 minutes to
get their retractable roof closed.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, Glynn was hammered for three runs in the
fourth on two-out doubles by Joe Oliver and Mark McLemore and Stan
Javier's two-run homer. Oliver added a grand slam off Glynn in the
fifth inning. All seven runs came after Glynn retired the first two
hitters in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it boils down to is not executing my pitches,'' Glynn
said. ``Since I've come off the disabled list, I haven't executed
my pitches or spotted the ball well. I can't afford to make the
mistakes I've been making. Before when I missed, I missed off the
plate. Now I'm missing back over the middle of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss left Glynn 1-1 with a 5.14 earned-run average. Combined
with Doug Davis, Matt Perisho and Francisco Cordero, the four young
pitchers who the Rangers are taking a hard look at for the future,
are a combined 7-7 with a 6.10 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're using so many inexperienced pitchers, we're
going to take our bumps and bruises,'' Oates said. ``But the good
part of it is that between now and the end of September, we'll have
a whole lot better idea of where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   That's still two long months away. nn

UNDERWOOD IS PUTTING HIS LIFE TOGETHER WITH THE COWBOYS' HELP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ A puffy scar is visible at the base of Dimitrius
Underwood's throat.
</P>
<P>
   It is the result of a puncture wound the Cowboys' 23-year-old
defensive end inflicted when he stabbed himself in the neck with a
steak knife during a suicide attempt Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   It serves as a jagged reminder of where he has been, and where
he never wants to go again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it every day; I really do,'' Underwood said
during a break in two-a-day practices at Midwestern State
University, where the Cowboys train. ``It was a dramatic point in
my life, so it's impossible for me not to think about it. I just
try not to let it affect me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he is able to reflect is saying something because
he nearly died.
</P>
<P>
   ``How close? I don't know. Close enough,'' Underwood said. ``Too
close for comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   He is on medication for what has been diagnosed as ``acute
bipolar disorder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings' 1999 first-round draft choice has not
played in a regular-season game since his junior year (1997) at
Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Spellman has made the Cowboys a model organization for
the rehabilitation and after-care of a player with emotional
problems. Bipolar disorder, if left untreated, can lead to mood
swings, erratic behavior and/or bouts of manic depression, as
Spellman can attest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dimitrius is light years ahead of where I was when I
came into \RCowboys\S camp \Rlast July\S,'' Spellman said. ``He was
smart enough and brave enough to come back and face the drama in
the off-season. I commend him for that. He's soaring like an eagle,
baby, and I think he'll continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed the talented Underwood on March 10 _ marking
his third NFL stop in seven months _ for close to the NFL minimum,
after he had asked the Miami Dolphins for his release in December.
The Dolphins wanted him to play in NFL Europe, but Underwood
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a family here. They show so much love, so
much more love than either of the other teams,'' said Underwood.
His strongest words for the Vikings and Dolphins: ``I just want to
make them say, `Damn, we should've kept him.' That's what I'm going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings signed Underwood to a five-year, $5.03-million
contract Aug. 1, including a $1.725-million signing bonus. Dressed
in battle fatigues, he reported to Vikings training camp a day
later and appeared in one poorly executed practice. That afternoon,
he went AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood later explained that he was quitting football because
he didn't have it in his heart to play any more, and that he wanted
to become a preacher instead. He eventually returned all but
$50,000 of his signing bonus, and the Vikings waived him Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins claimed him off waivers three days later. Underwood
appeared in the Dolphins' preseason finale against Green Bay,
dislocated his left shoulder and was inactive for the first two
regular-season games. Week 3 was the Dolphins' bye week.
</P>
<P>
   On what normally would have been a game day _ Sunday, Sept. 26 _
Underwood was found by Lansing, Mich., police on the streets,
suffering from a self-inflicted knife wound to the throat,
``bleeding and yelling for help,'' according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, he was arrested in connection with non-payment of
child support after visiting Chasity Dyer, the mother of his
then-16-month-old twins.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys first-year defensive-tackles coach Andre Patterson, who
has been much more than an assistant coach to Underwood with both
the Vikings and Cowboys, remembers the sickening feeling inside his
stomach when he learned of Underwood's suicide attempt on
television that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt my heart,'' said Patterson, whose 8-year-old son,
Andre, Jr., has a special bond with Underwood. ``Dimitrius is great
with kids. This is not a violent person. This is a kind,
good-hearted human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood's mother, Eileen, moved to Dallas with her son. They
arrived there on Jerry Jones' private jet, which still impresses
Underwood, and now it is Jones' player-development program,
directed by Calvin Hill, that helps Underwood in his day-to-day
transition back into productive life and pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look in the mirror, and I don't see the same person
anymore,'' Underwood said. ``I see a consistent and positive
person. They say what don't kill you makes you stronger. So here I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, who measures his self-worth by getting back up after
falling down, is now counting down the days to July 30, when the
Cowboys play the Pittsburgh Steelers at Texas Stadium. He sat out
yesterday's practices with a foot sprain, but has been impressive
at left defensive end since early in the Cowboys' off-season
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Vikings, I kept saying this is bigger than football
and that we need to look into it more,'' Patterson said. ``The sad
thing is what happened a couple of months later proved me right.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood nearly destroyed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the scary part,'' Underwood said. ``I was a little
confused and upside-down, but I'm walking the straight-and-narrow
now. Time heals everything. Time will heal some of the wounds and
scars that are left in my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think about what happened so that it doesn't happen
again. I count my blessings and say my prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are right beside him.

CRABTREE WONDERS ABOUT FUTURE IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 CRABTREE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This hasn't been a good season for Tim Crabtree, but
the low point might have come on a late-night flight from Anaheim
to Seattle on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He had just given up two runs in the eighth inning of a 6-1 loss
to the Anaheim Angels, all coming on a broken-bat single, two
defensive blunders, a walk and a sacrifice fly. He sat on the plane
wondering how it could get any worse and what his future with the
Rangers might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day in Anaheim got to me really good,'' Crabtree
said. ``I feel like I've pitched better than the results, but it's
just been real frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that frustration eased Friday night when he threw three
scoreless innings, allowing just one hit, in the Rangers' 12-3 loss
to the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to be able to get right back out there, get a
couple of good innings under my belt and pitch well,'' Crabtree
said. ``What's frustrating is I haven't been able to put a string
together of good outings. I feel like I'm throwing the ball well,
but then stuff happens like in Anaheim, or in San Francisco when a
fan reaches over the fence, catches the ball in front of Rusty
Greer and it's a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been weird, a lot of soft hits, bloopers, things like
that. That usually evens out over the course of a season, but it
doesn't seem to have evened out this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree saidstarted dwelling on his situation for next year
after the Anaheim game. The Rangers hold a $1 million option on his
services, and there was some talk earlier this year about a
possible contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   But that has subsided, and it's up in the air if the Rangers
will even pick up the option, a decision they don't have to make
until after the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you want to do well, for yourself, your team and
your family,'' Crabtree said. ``This is a performance-based game;
the better you do, the better you can provide for your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought about it up until after the Anaheim game. The
whole thing about possible trade rumors, my contract status, what
the Rangers are going to do, it hasn't bothered me until coming up
on the plane from Anaheim.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree still has talent. His fastball still comes in at 96 mph
with an effective split-finger pitch when he gets it over the
plate, but the Rangers want him to become a pitcher rather than
just another hard thrower.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said Crabtree did that Friday night
because, ``he knew he had to give us some innings and he had to
pace himself. But when he comes in for only one or two hitters,
that's when he tries to throw the ball through the backstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree said a chat with fellow reliever John Wetteland also
helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is prepare yourself and pitch the best you
can,'' Crabtree said. ``You've got to realize that if I make my
pitches, once the ball leaves my hand, I can't worry or control
what happens.'' nn

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Billed over 10 days as the ``Marion,
Michael and Maurice Show,'' the stars of the U.S. Olympic Track and
Field Trials did not disappoint yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The storylines are set. Marion Jones, bidding for five gold
medals at the Sydney Olympics, posted the fastest qualifying time
in the women's 200 meters and moved on to a semifinal showdown
against Inger Miller.
</P>
<P>
   And Baylor-ex Michael Johnson, despite feeling a cramp in his
Achilles tendon, raced his first-round heat of the men's 200 in
19.89 seconds and set the stage for his long-awaited match with
Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five days off were relaxing,'' said Jones, who earlier
made the Olympic team in the long jump and 100 meters. ``But I was
sort of going through withdrawal watching everyone on TV. All I
could think about was getting these 200s over and making the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a re-draw of heat assignments, that reportedly cut into
her warmup time, Jones surged away from a field that included
former University of Texas athletes Nanceen Perry and Carlette
Guidry and current Longhorn Aleah Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was timed in 22.62. Perry (22.84) and Guidry (23.12), a
two-time Olympian, also advanced to the semis. The day's
second-fastest time (22.85) was posted by Michelle Collins, who
went to high school at Garland Lakeview Centennial and made the
Olympic team last week in the women's 400.
</P>
<P>
   Miller won her heat in 23.13 and drew the lane next to Jones in
today's first semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the daughter of two-time Olympic medalist Lennox
Miller of Jamaica. She won the women's 200 at last year's World
Championships of Track and Field in Seville, Spain, but the title
came with an asterisk when Jones suffered back spasms and had to
withdraw from the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs felt today like they did at the worlds,'' Miller said
yesterday. ``The 100 is gone. That was last weekend. Today my form
was better. I even watched the \Rstadium\S TV during the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller had finished a well-beaten second to Jones eight days ago
in the women's 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strong,'' Jones said of her 200-meter preliminary,
``and let up with 15 meters to go. \RToday\S I'm looking for a much
faster time.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's 200-meter semifinalists include TCU's Darvis Patton,
who ran 20.40 and challenged Greene in their first-round heat, and
Horned Frog-ex Jon Drummond, who won his heat in 20.50. Drummond
made the men's 100-meter team on the trials' second day.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's Bryan Howard, nursing a hamstring injury, finished fourth
in his heat (21.06) and did not advance.
</P>
<P>
   After Regina Jacobs stirred the Hornet Stadium crowd late Friday
night with her American record run (14:45.35) in the women's 5,000
meters, yesterday's brief card, held in midday, included only three
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Gamble of Sumter, S.C., won the women's triple jump with
a leap of 45 feet, 9 3/4 inches. Baylor-ex Stacey Bowers, who
graduated from Waco La Vega, finished fourth in 45-4 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 400-meter hurdles, Angelo Taylor of Decatur, Ga.,
finished first in 47.62. Eric Thomas of Abilene Christian, a native
of Garrison, placed second in 48.22 and made the Olympic team after
barely missing a berth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In other qualifying events yesterday, two-time Olympic 100-meter
champion Gail Devers posted the fastest time in the women's
100-meter hurdles, 12.57. Dominique Arnold of Long Beach, Calif.,
led the men's qualifiers in the 110-hurdles, with a 13.36.
Defending Olympic champion Allen Johnson had the third-best time,
at 13.42.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning world champion in the discus, Anthony Washington of
Rome, N.Y., led the day's qualifiers in his event, throwing 219-7.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-day Olympic Trials will come to a high-voltage
conclusion today with finals scheduled in the women's pole vault,
800, 100 hurdles and 200, and in the men's high jump, triple jump,
discus, 800, 110 hurdles and 200. nn

HAWAII, TCU LOOK FORWARD TO EXTENDING `RIVALRY'
</HEADLINE>
 MEDIA DAY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Hawaii safety Dee Miller is quick to point
out the source of the budding ``rivalry'' between the Warriors and
the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think we have a rivalry,'' Miller said
yesterday at the Western Athletic Conference preseason media
session. ``It's just you guys pump it up so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports media might play in fanning the fire, but Hawaii
coach June Jones did his part in ruffling the feathers of a couple
Lone Star peers.
</P>
<P>
   After the Horned Frogs downed the Warriors, 34-14, in Honolulu
last season, Jones took serious exceptions with the blocking
tactics of the TCU receivers. He called the Frogs ``dirty,'' a tag
that didn't sit well with TCU coach Dennis Franchione.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches downplayed the incident yesterday. Franchione said
it wasn't an issue, and Jones said the hard feelings have subsided
and he is focusing on the teams' Oct. 7 meeting in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs and Warriors were picked first and third,
respectively, in the 2000 WAC media poll. TCU, Hawaii and Fresno
State tied for the league title last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything out of the ordinary \Rin the rivalry with
TCU\S other than they're a good football team,'' said Jones, the
WAC Coach of the Year last season. ``We'll have to play our best to
beat TCU at TCU. Even if we play our best, it may not be good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The score was not indicative last year of the ballgame. We did
not play very well on offense, and I don't think TCU played their
best game on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU defensive end Aaron Schobel brushed aside the off-the-field
drama last season, but he said he still expects a fight against the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have half the talent they had last year, it's going to
be a good game,'' said Schobel, the preseason WAC Defensive Player
of the Year. ``They lost a bunch of good guys, but I'm ready to
play anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs and Warriors, though not natural rivals, share several
common traits, such as rising from the college football depths with
their current coaches. Jones expressed disappointment in the series
ending after this season when TCU moves to Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them having won a bowl game last year, us having won a bowl
game will help create a real exciting atmosphere,'' Jones said.
``I'm disappointed that they're leaving the WAC. Dennis Franchione
has done a great job since he's been there.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Jones is saying all the right things dealing with TCU,
the feelings regarding another Texas school remain touchy. The
Warriors were scheduled to face Texas in the opener this season,
but the Longhorns pulled out of the game after citing costs and
scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who questioned why UT backed out, said yesterday he never
heard from Longhorns coach Mack Brown directly about the reasons
behind Texas buying its way out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we would have had an opportunity to play them, but it
didn't work out,'' he said. ``It's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is pretty sure he knows why Texas backed out and admits a
rivalry is developing with Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there may be a rivalry now because the last Texas team
backed out on us,'' Miller said. ``I like this stuff. I wish they
would have come back and taken the challenge. Being from the South,
I feel bad that they didn't take the challenge to play Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was in shock when \RTexas\S dropped us. It's like we
were 0-12 again; that's how we felt. They didn't want to come in
here a championship contender and we knock them off and they lose
all that. That's why they didn't want to come.''

ZITO ZEALOTS HAVE REASON TO CHEER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Barry Zito was so in awe of his new surroundings
Saturday, seven of his first eight major-league pitches missed the
strike zone. It took a trip to the mound by Oakland catcher Ramon
Hernandez to set his baby-faced teammate straight and set the
Anaheim Angels on the course to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice and easy,'' Hernandez told Zito. ``You can get these guys
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. Right. For a moment the southpaw from Encino had
forgotten that rookies are competitors, too. ``Every guy coming up,
you're going to see these guys and think they're immortal,'' Zito
said. ``They're just hitters like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Hernandez settled Zito down, the Angels' bats were as
good as silenced. By the end of the day, Zito had collected his
first major- league win, allowing one run and two hits in the
Athletics' 10-3 victory over the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable feeling for all of us,'' said Zito's
mother Roberta, who attended the game along with her mother Ann
Makeever, her husband Joe, their daughters Bonnie and Sally and 15
Zito Zealots, cronies from UC Santa Barbara where the pitcher
attended school as a freshman before transferring to Pierce
College. ``We've been envisioning this since he was 7 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Like those wobbly first steps or warbling first words of long
ago, these milestones were duly recorded: Zito, who was promoted
from Triple-A Friday to replace an injured Omar Olivares in the
starting rotation, walked on four pitches the first major-league
batter he faced, Darin Erstad. He threw his first strike to Benji
Gil, who went down swinging on six pitches.
</P>
<P>
   So it continued, this month of firsts for the Zito family. On
July 11 Roberta Zito celebrated the first anniversary of the liver
transplant that saved her life. Roberta was in the intensive care
unit at Cedars Sinai, her health deteriorating rapidly, when her
youngest child and only son pitched USC deep into the 1999
postseason (the Trojans' College World Series bid died at the
warning track, roped in by Stanford in a super regional).
</P>
<P>
   Zito, 22, the ninth overall pick of the 1999 draft, spent most
of last June and July shuttling between the Athletics' Single-A
team in Visalia and his mother's L.A. bedside. Next to those dire,
dark days, the scenario that unfolded Saturday afternoon in the
fifth inning was no cause for concern even if the crowd of 20,111
did grow ominously quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded, there were no outs and Angels slugger Mo
Vaughn was casting a large, menacing shadow over the plate. With a
single swing Vaughn could lop off half of the Athletics' 9-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Zito had hit Vaughn with a pitch that sailed on him the first
time he faced him, in the top of the first. A funny thing that:
before going to bed on Friday night, Barry took a call from his
father Joe. During their brief conversation the elder Zito had
warned Barry that Vaughn would settle in as though he had dibs on
home plate and had joked that maybe he should ``hit him in the
stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe Joe - who is fiercely proud and protective of
his progeny - was serious. Zito's sixth pitch to the burly first
baseman hit Vaughn in the arm. ``I wanted to let him know I wasn't
afraid to come in there. Obviously, I didn't try to hit him,'' said
Zito, who proceeded to retire Salmon on a deep fly to right to
escape from his first major-league inning unshaken and unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Houdini couldn't have escaped any more dramatically than Zito
did the third time he faced the heart of the Angels' lineup. He
struck Vaughn out on four pitches, the last of them a changeup that
Vaughn watched disappear in the glove of catcher Ramon Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Tim Salmon on four pitches, the last of which was
a fastball the Angels outfielder chased.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Garret Anderson on a curve, Zito's fifth having
built to a crescendo that rivaled Beethoven's Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Zito's Zealots commemorated every strikeout by taping a piece of
paper with a ``Z'' on the railing fronting Section 221. By the end
of the fifth, there were six Zs flapping in the breeze (Zito also
walked six, mostly because he was overthrowing his fastball).
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry battled, man,'' said Oakland manager Art Howe. ``He
reached down deep and made some great pitches in the fifth. Those
are three of the best hitters in the league. Very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, Roberta was near tears, knowing how close she
came to not seeing this shining moment. It turns out that Barry,
for all his aplomb, was affected, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of surreal for me for my whole family to be here to
see this,'' he said. ``After what my mom went through, doing what I
did today was just icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito's last pitch to Anderson was his 101st - sister Sally was
charting them from her seat in Section 221 while Joe paced in the
concourse, too nervous to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Howe had seen enough to form a first impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to wear him down the first time out,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   So, someone asked, has Zito earned another start?
</P>
<P>
   Howe smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so.''

   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. _ Layne Beachley, the two-time
defending women's surfing World Tour champion, bounced up and down
on the awards stage just south of Huntington Beach pier.
</P>
<P>
   An Australian, Beachley exhorted the crowd to cheer. She even
chided the announcers at the Pro Women's surf contest for talking
too much.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bradshaw, her coach, boyfriend and surfboard shaper,
couldn't help but smile.
</P>
<P>
   A giddy and outgoing Beachley signaled the return of the
confidence of a champion that she recently lost.
</P>
<P>
   Beachley not only won the Pro Women's event Saturday afternoon,
but she reclaimed her spot atop the rankings on the Association of
Surfing Professionals work tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets way more bubbly and way more excited,'' Bradshaw said
of Beachley. ``When she is not at that level there is something
missing .... she is not going off the walls.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months, something had been missing from
Beachley, who dominated women's surfing for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the first event on the Association of Surfing
Professionals 2000 World Tour in March, Beachley exited in the
quarterfinals in the next three tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The final quarterfinal loss, in South Africa in early July,
resulted in her losing the No. 1 ranking for the first time in 15
months and only the second time in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real foreign to be No. 2,'' Beachley said.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``You can only take so many losses before you doubt
yourself. To have three in a row, I was questioning my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw said he could see Beachley's confidence falling each
time he thought she surfed well but received low scores from the
judges.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts mounted in her first day in Huntington Beach when she
lost to Prue Jeffries, the only unranked woman in the competition,
in a preliminary heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed in my performance,'' Beachley said.
``I was really lackadaisical. It took hitting rock bottom to get
back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Beachley began to look at what she was doing. She went to the
judges and asked what she needed to do to get better scores.
</P>
<P>
   They told her to make harder turns when she first entered the
wave and worry less about setting up for the next move. And to take
her surfing to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Beachley also changed to a slightly bigger board for the
Saturday morning quarterfinals. A bigger board helps make harder
turns.

L.A. SCHOOL DISTRICT AUDITOR MAY LOSE AUTHORITY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an attack on a critical element in reform, the
Los Angeles school board will consider next week whether to strip
Inspector General Don Mullinax of his independent investigative
authority, the Daily News learned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal --set for a vote Tuesday under the authority of new
Superintendent Roy Romer -- would bar Mullinax from initiating any
investigation without board approval and require that all reports
from his office be kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax, who played a critical role in exposing the Belmont
Learning Center scandal and exorbitant management fees for
Proposition BB school repairs, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But a Los Angeles Unified source described him as outraged by
the attack on his independence, which was engineered by the
district's new director of governmental affairs, Fabian Nunez, a
former labor union official.
</P>
<P>
   The source said Mullinax had no warning that his independence
was under threat and has been given no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These recommendations are designed to give Nunez carte blanche
to lobby for these changes to the law,'' said the source. ``This
all goes back to what happened with Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Mullinax's role as inspector general comes at a
critical time when the state legislature is set to extend his
authority to subpoena witnesses and documents until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, who successfully pushed to
grant subpoena power to Mullinax when his efforts to investigate
Belmont were being thwarted, was upset to learn that the
reform-minded board elected a year ago might be backtracking on
granting the extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why Romer's doing it, or if he's immersed
himself enough into this issue,'' Hayden said. ``I would strongly
urge the board to reject this attempt to restrict the freedom or
the independence of the inspector general.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer, Nunez and school board President Genethia Hayes did not
return repeated calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But school board member David Tokofsky, who was instrumental in
creating the inspector general position in 1997, called the
proposal outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue goes to the core of the First Amendment, to the
core of checks and balances, and to the public's ability, and
right, to know,'' Tokofsky. ``The inspector should be able to
investigate whatever he feels is a possible violation of waste,
fraud and abuse in the school system.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nunez's report to the board under Romer's authority, he
recommends that Hayden's SB 1360 be amended to require that:
</P>
<P>
   ``1. Every investigation, including the identities of any
individuals or agencies, shall be kept confidential;
</P>
<P>
   ``2. The Inspector General shall not issue any report of an
investigation or release any findings or information resulting from
an investigation except to the governing board of the district or
superintendent;
</P>
<P>
   ``3. The Inspector General shall conduct an audit or
investigation upon the request of a majority of the members of the
Board of Education.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Mullinax's key role in exposing serious
administrative abuses and possible contractor fraud in Belmont, and
Romer's effort to reopen debate about the abandoned $175 million
property, the proposal poses serious questions about the school
board's continued commitment to reform.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, said he was upset by the
board's attempt to backpedal on needed reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely troubling. Frankly, the greatest value of
the inspector general is the independence,'' he said. ``As far as I
am concerned, as long as I am in the Legislature, LAUSD will not be
off the hook. The cloak of secrecy over the district has destroyed
the education of children in Los Angeles for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Most board members were elected last year in the wake of the
Belmont disclosures. While Superintendent Ruben Zacarias and
several other top administrators were ousted by the school board,
dozens of others have been retained and even granted substantial
pay raises as part of restructuring the massive LAUSD into 11
sub-districts.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD critics have become increasingly concerned about the
directions district officials are taking with regard to reforms and
the attempt to undercut Mullinax's authority has fueled that
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, chairman of the Proposition BB citizens
oversight committee and a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles, said
that any attempt to close the district's operations from public
scrutiny is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about parents, teachers and students by the
hundreds of thousands, and they want to know daily what decisions
are being made that affect their kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building momentum for education revolution in LAUSD and
the process needs to remain open to keep that momentum.''

L.A. HOSPITALS READIED FOR BIO-ATTACKS DURING CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Concerned about a possible biological or chemical
terrorist attack during the Democratic National Convention, Los
Angeles hospitals have stocked up on antidotes and undergone
decontamination training.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of U.S. Secret Service and other government
officials, about a dozen hospitals downtown also have received
special equipment to protect doctors and nurses and treat patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we are most concerned about is terrorism and
particularly, bio-terrorism,'' said Jim Lott, executive vice
president of the Healthcare Association of Southern California,
which represents hospitals countywide. ``We will be on super-alert
mode for the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not all equipped to handle biochemical terrorist
threats. But that doesn't mean it can't be handled.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI, Secret Service and police stress preparations for any
eventuality are necessary for a high-profile political event
involving the president, vice president and thousands of party
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at what occurred in Seattle and indications
that some of those folks are planning on coming and exercising
their First Amendment rights in Los Angeles,'' said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Emergency Operations Bureau Lt. Dennis Beene.
``There isn't anything we're seeing that we're concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials acknowledge there is always the potential for
terrorism and U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Frank
O'Donnell said agents have met with hospitals to ensure ``in the
event of an emergency, all the advance work has been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to that, both the president and vice president
travel with military doctors. All over town, depending on where the
president or vice president will be -- the west end or downtown --
we reach out to all the hospitals they will be close to.''
</P>
<P>
   At California Hospital Medical Center -- the closest hospital to
Staples Center where the convention will be held Aug. 14-17 --
doctors and nurses have been told they could be the first choice
for treatment in the event of a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have purchased a lot of equipment, specialized masks and
gowns,'' said Dr. Robert Splawn, medical director of the hospital.
``And the No. 1 one thing we need to do is secure the hospital
because if we're down, we won't be able to take care of anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers said the preparations are part of the ``hype
and hysteria'' concerning demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that protesters have any plans to be involved in any
terrorist activity is just outrageous and really discourages people
from exercising their First Amendment rights,'' said D2K protest
spokeswoman Margaret Prescod. She added law enforcement figures
that 50,000 protesters are expected at the convention are
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologists from the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have arrived in Los Angeles to help hospitals track any
outbreaks during the convention by using a special computer program
that will analyze the symptoms people report to emergency rooms
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for special events like the Olympics and political
conventions,'' CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said. ``We have CDC
people assigned to the Los Angeles area who will help local
officials detect early if there is an outbreak. Our software can
determine quickly if the illness is above normal levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the county's Emergency Management Council Steering
Committee met and approved the DNC emergency management plan to
handle the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for a coordinated effort between city and county
governments and the U.S. Secret Service, Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Governor's Office of Emergency Services, Los Angeles
Police Department and county Sheriff's and Fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, Secret Service and FBI
are the lead federal agencies, staffing communication and operation
centers in the Los Angeles area during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The plan notes that the convention has the potential to become a
target of terrorist acts ranging from individual acts of violence
to the use of weapons of mass destruction. It calls for government
officials to monitor water systems and to work with power utilities
to ensure county government is not blacked-out by a power
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that terrorists could be ``disguised'' as
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The county has been preparing for a potential terrorist attack
for more than three years, said Constance Perett, director of the
county Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital personnel have also been issued special suits to wear
and have undergone decontamination training, said Virginia
Hastings, director of the county Emergency Medical Services Agency.
</P>
<P>
   County supervisors voted in August 1998 to accept a $250,000
federal grant that allowed the county to prepare for nuclear,
biological or chemical terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles County is probably one of the most, if not most
prepared, counties in the United States,'' Perett said. ``But there
is still work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Perett said the county's preparation for Y2K put the county in a
mode of readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the interesting things about Y2K is it reached deeper
into the psyche of the government and private sector than any other
single event ever has,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Isbell, assistant director of the county Emergency
Medical Services Agency, said officials are making sure the
hospitals are well-staffed, have plenty of supplies and that roads
are open for ambulance drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any disaster, like Y2K, when you have a known event in
front of you, you have a better opportunity to plan than if you
have an earthquake when you least expect it.''

L.A. SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT HITS TALK SHOW CIRCUIT
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tinseltown, politics and education. Mix them
together, and you've got Los Angeles Unified School District
Superintendent Roy Romer, a seemingly irresistible draw for the
national media.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month on the job, Romer made the round of TV talk
shows last week, drawing more national attention than past school
chiefs by appearing on NBC's ``Today'' show, and ABC's
``Politically Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer downplayed the significance, noting he had been on
``Politically Incorrect'' when he was head of the Democratic
National Committee and Colorado governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is one where, before I got in the superintendency,
you can really take off on anything you want. But when you're a
superintendent of schools, you have to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certain bantering back and forth that I would not
participate in because I just can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the national attention for the LAUSD didn't find a warm
reception everywhere in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   School board member David Tokofsky, for one, was unimpressed,
saying he would rather see the superintendent focus on the
district's specific problems rather than play to a national
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind TV appearances, but all politics should be
local,'' Tokofsky said. ``We've got some local problems here that
require an understanding of local audiences to know communities
from Chatsworth to Pacoima to Watts to East L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those shows are particularly national audiences. And I
don't think the national audience cares much about L.A. Unified, to
tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   On the show, Romer did join in some of the bantering, getting in
a few barbs at host Bill Maher.
</P>
<P>
   Maher tried to provoke him by criticizing teachers, suggesting
that rather than following President Clinton's suggestion to hire
100,000 more teachers, they ought to fire 100,000 lousy teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta take you on that. Look, there are some lousy teachers
like there are lousy comics,'' Romer replied, to laughter and
applause from the audience. ``You just don't generalize for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And Romer did tout some ideas that he might try in the district.
</P>
<P>
   In between lighthearted repartee, Romer made a few serious
declarations about educational policy, saying teachers are
``tremendously underpaid,'' supporting merit pay -- as long as it
is based on more than just test scores -- and suggesting programs
to put high school seniors into the working world before they
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learn a lot by doing work out there,'' Romer said during a
debate on the problems of public education. ``I think you ought to
get out of the building. In fact, I think there's a very good
argument to be made to take the last year and cut it in half and
put you out in the field and have you experience what the world and
the job market's going to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later interview, Romer said he thinks seniors tend to lose
interest in classes once they've been accepted to college, so
schools should consider ways to send them out into the working
world.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has bounced the idea off several staff members but is
not yet actively working to create a program.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Today'' show, which was filmed in Los Angeles on
Wednesday, Romer appeared between Police Chief Bernard C. Parks and
a report on the county's recently completed subway system. He said
he supports merit pay for teachers -- a proposal bitterly opposed
by the Los Angeles teachers union -- but said it should be based on
more than test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``To pay a teacher only because of the scores of the students I
think is wrong,'' Romer said. ``You ought to pay a teacher in a
broader way. What does a teacher contribute to the whole school?''

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where's (beginitalic)Malcolm(enditalic)?
</P>
<P>
   That's my biggest complaint about this year's crop of Emmy
nominations, announced last week. While it's satisfying to see
(beginitalic)The Sopranos (enditalic)and (beginitalic)The West Wing
(enditalic)lead the pack with 18 nominations each, it's equally
frustrating to see (beginitalic)Malcolm in the Middle
(enditalic)get snubbed in the best-comedy category.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Everybody Loves Raymond(enditalic),
(beginitalic)Frasier(enditalic), (beginitalic)Friends(enditalic),
(beginitalic)Will &AMP; Grace(enditalic), (beginitalic)Sex and the City
(enditalic)- fine shows, all. But the Show That Saved Sitcoms is
funnier than any of them. (At least the increasingly
weird-for-weird's sake - and last year's winner - (beginitalic)Ally
McBeal (enditalic)got left out of the mix this time.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jane Kaczmarek, so hilarious as
(beginitalic)Malcolm'(enditalic)s mom, was nominated as best comedy
actress, and the Fox show got nods in other categories, including
writing and directing. But it deserved more.
</P>
<P>
   In a season in which sitcoms drowned in the wake of ABC's
insanely popular (beginitalic)Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire(enditalic), (beginitalic)Malcolm (enditalic)- which
didn't even get on the air until January - became such an
unexpected hit that it was widely credited with making the TV water
safe for comedy again. (Further proof: upcoming, lesser rip-offs on
the fall schedule.)
</P>
<P>
   Fine way to treat a life preserver.
</P>
<P>
   There were other snubs, to be sure. I could cry all day and
night about the omission of (beginitalic)Buffy the Vampire Slayer
(enditalic)from the best drama list, for instance, but it wouldn't
do any good. And while HBO's (beginitalic)The Corner (enditalic)was
nominated for best miniseries - nothing else approached its
brilliance - T.K. Carter and Khandi Alexander's harrowing, humane
performances were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. Guess it was too much to hope for (obviously), but it sure
would have been nice to see the late, great (beginitalic)Sports
Night (enditalic)and (beginitalic)Freaks and Geeks (enditalic)show
up in the best-comedy category. Or should that be best drama?
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Maybe that was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some old favorites showed signs of decline. (beginitalic)Ally
McBeal (enditalic)was joined on the left-out best list by dramas
(beginitalic)NYPD Blue (enditalic)and, for the second straight
year, (beginitalic)The X-Files(enditalic). As much as I like the
latter two shows, it's encouraging to see signs of life from the
Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences. In previous years voters
seemed to be asleep at the switch, nominating the same shows time
after time, no matter what their quality.
</P>
<P>
   And to be sure, some of that still goes on. How else do you
explain John Lithgow's presence among the nominees for best actor
in a comedy, the lame (beginitalic)3rd Rock From the
Sun(enditalic)? Or (beginitalic)ER'(enditalic)s place among the
best-drama candidates?
</P>
<P>
   But enough sniping. Let's look on the bright side. How fitting
is it, for instance, that Dominic Chianese, brilliant as the
scheming Uncle Junior in (beginitalic)The Sopranos(enditalic),
finally got his best-supporting-actor nod? (He was passed over last
year - ironic, because that was his better season.) How classy is
it that the late Nancy Marchand was nominated for best supporting
actress in a drama for her great work in the same show?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she was nominated last year. But, in a big shock, she
didn't win (Holland Taylor did, for her role as a judge in
(beginitalic)The Practice(enditalic)). The rules have changed,
however. Blue-ribbon panels - read, geezers - used to spend a
weekend at a hotel watching the nominated shows. No more. Now,
judges will watch tapes at home, a move designed to encourage more
younger voters to participate - and, with any luck, to produce
winners that don't leave viewers at home scratching their heads in
befuddlement.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what happened last year, when Dennis Franz beat out
James Gandolfini for best actor in a drama, and (beginitalic)The
Practice (enditalic)won for best drama over (beginitalic)The
Sopranos(enditalic). (We will resist the incredible temptation to
trash Lithgow's win for best actor in a comedy, even as we wonder
how he got nominated again this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Alas, all the rule changes in the world won't help
(beginitalic)Malcolm (enditalic)this time. And that's a shame.

   Salmon was asked why Bush would pick a running mate who'd be
more popular than he is?
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always said if you wanted to be successful, always hire
people who are smarter and more capable than you are,'' Salmon
said. ``They make you look good. If Bush swallows his pride and
takes McCain, I think people will really respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain, in turn, would become the hero of every regular guy
playing Abbott to some clown's Costello, of every working stiff
made to feel like Cheetah by some self-proclaimed Tarzan. Choosing
McCain would be a greater act of unselfishness and generosity than
Wynonna letting Naomi sing lead vocal.
</P>
<P>
   What if Bush (beginitalic)doesn't(enditalic) ask McCain to run
with him? Salmon was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't pick McCain,'' Salmon said, ``he'll get dumped
on by the media because he'll have had a chance to take someone who
virtually locked up the campaign and didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he believes McCain will be able to handle the role
of vice president because he has been in the military and
understands the importance of maintaining a chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question people are asking is, `Can McCain be Number 2?'''
Salmon said. ``I think he can.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an easy arrangement to picture with past examples like
Nixon and Agnew. Or Kennedy and Johnson. But Bush and McCain?
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way:
</P>
<P>
   If these guys were cartoons, who would be Rocky and who would be
Bullwinkle? Who would be Yogi and who would be Boo Boo? Who would
be Pinky and who would be The Brain?
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a director in Hollywood who'd cast McCain as Barney
Fife to Bush's Andy of Mayberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to win,'' Salmon said. ``Having gone through a
rough-and-tumble primary, Bush's natural tendencies probably don't
want to include McCain on the ticket. But he also wants to win. I
think this is one of those rare exceptions where a
vice-presidential candidate could make the difference. Al Gore and
the Democrats would have no answer for that ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to make it close, Gore would need a blockbuster second
banana of his own. Someone whose celebrity, competence and
popularity not only rival McCain's but completely outshine Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Gore likewise will swallow his pride and recognize
that the only person with enough political appeal and name
recognition is Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea.

 &HT;    By BARBARA YOST(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sherman Alexie would seem to have the world on a string.
</P>
<P>
   He's an acclaimed author ((beginitalic)Indian Killer,
Reservation Blues(enditalic)). His collection of short stories,
(beginitalic)The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in
Heaven(enditalic), was made into the popular film
(beginitalic)Smoke Signals(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   He's a fixture in his hometown of Seattle, where he lives with
his wife and 2-year-old son. He holds season tickets to the
Supersonics.
</P>
<P>
   His latest short-story collection, (beginitalic)The Toughest
Indian in the World(enditalic), is garnering good reviews. His
publishers, Atlantic Monthly Press, nurture him and consider him
one of their premier authors. They've sent him on a 28-city,
coast-to-coast tour.
</P>
<P>
   What more could a young writer want?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be taller,'' says the 6-foot-2-inch Alexie. ``Five
inches taller.''
</P>
<P>
   If Alexie has not achieved the physical stature he desires (he's
crazy for basketball), he has become something of a towering figure
in the literary world, being named one of the(beginitalic) New
Yorker's(enditalic) best American fiction writers under 40. In
1992, he won a National Endowment for the Arts Poetry Fellowship
and won the PEN/Hemingway Best First Book of Fiction Award for
(beginitalic)Lone Ranger(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a conversation before a reading at Changing Hands
bookstore in Tempe, where (beginitalic)60 Minutes II (enditalic)is
filming his performance for a fall segment, he alternates between
egotism and discontent. Self-confident as a writer, he's dismayed
that he's not being courted by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the book world, I'm Fidel Castro,'' he says. Powerful
dictator of a sovereign nation. ``In the movie world, I'm the
senator from North Dakota.'' Junior delegate from a lowly state.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to resolve the disparity but is at least happy with
the path his writing has taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked very hard,'' he says. ``It isn't like I tripped on
this career.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie, 33, is a Spokane/Coeur d'Alene Indian (his preferred
term) who grew up on the Wellpinit, Wash., reservation. Insisting
he will never write about Anglos, he derides Anglo authors who
write about Indians, at times singling out Tucson's Barbara
Kingsolver, author of (beginitalic)The Bean Trees (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Pigs in Heaven(enditalic). The novels are about a
White woman who adopts a Cherokee child.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Kingsolver ``colonial'' and ``possessory,'' he praises
her writing but dismisses her attempts to cross cultural
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people cross gender or cultures well,'' he says. ``We
don't do it in our lives, how could we do it in our literature?''
</P>
<P>
   Alexie bristles at questions about the universality of his own
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's racist, that's demeaning,'' he snaps.
</P>
<P>
   He stops in the middle of a plate of penne pasta at the
Scottsdale Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought human beings were universal. Everything in
Shakespeare lives on my reservation. King Lear lives there. Hamlet
lives there. Romeo and Juliet certainly live there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Alexie once lived there, son of a father who worked as a
truck driver and logger and a mother who was a social worker. For a
time, his life hung in the balance. Born hydrocephalic, he
underwent brain surgery at 6 months. Mental retardation was the
prognosis, but the boy defied the odds. At age 5, he was reading
Steinbeck.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington State University, he planned to become a
pediatrician but fainted repeatedly in anatomy class. A poetry
workshop convinced him that writing would offer a more vertical
career.
</P>
<P>
   A voracious reader, he was also a voracious writer. By the early
'90s, he had produced more than 300 poems, stories, essays and
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But if Alexie is hard on authors who offend his political
sensibilities, he is also hard on himself. His novels, he says, are
``not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By most standards, they're all right but not by my
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his screenplay for (beginitalic)Smoke Signals(enditalic), a
critical success even if it has not led to further Hollywood
contracts, rates only a B-minus from its author.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his writing has changed since he began his career a
decade ago, he's stumped. Though a Valley friend from college
suggests his style has become more sophisticated, Alexie says
simply that he hopes his work has gotten better as he has matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a different person,'' he says with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Success has brought Alexie highs and lows. He was pleased to be
driving down a Los Angeles freeway and spot a copy of
(beginitalic)Lone Ranger (enditalic)in the back window of a passing
car. He has also had encounters with stalkers.
</P>
<P>
   Book tours are a necessary evil. He quotes singer Dan Fogelberg:
``The audiences are heavenly, but the traveling is hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the road, he writes every day, recording his thoughts
longhand. There is no artifice to his regimen. Too many writers
engage in elaborate ceremonies when they work, he says, assembling
ritualistic tools and becoming creative only in prescribed
environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ceremonyless,'' Alexie says.
</P>
<P>
   No one reads his stories before he submits them for publication.
That, too, would be ceremonial, he believes. His wife, Diane, does
read them for continuity, to catch characters whose names or hair
lengths change capriciously.
</P>
<P>
   For less-fortunate writers, Alexie's status is fodder for envy.
Employed by a medium-sized publishing house, he's king of the
world. At a larger company, he would compete for attention with the
likes of literary giants Stephen King or John Grisham. He brags
that he has no boss, just a simpatico editor.
</P>
<P>
   His ambitions are simple: Write more books.
</P>
<P>
   Except for that pesky height problem, life doesn't get much
better, he agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard for it,'' he says. ``I was born with
absolutely nothing in this country - no class, no culture, no race,
no geography. Now I have a little bit.''

 &HT;    EVOLUTION'S BATTLE FOR ACCEPTANCE(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BARBARA YOST(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins at
Arizona State University, doesn't believe in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't (beginitalic)believe(enditalic) in gravity either.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds heretical for a man of science, Johanson says
that evolution is ``not a matter of belief. It's a matter of
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, which explains how plant and animal species arise and
why we have diversity among species, is the keystone of modern
biology. It is one of the most widely accepted notions in science,
ranking alongside gravity, the heliocentric view of the solar
system (planets revolve around the sun) and the roundness of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some doubters, mostly in America, reject the principles
proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin and detailed in his
1859 treatise (beginitalic)On the Origin of Species.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic) Darwin said that life on Earth began with simple
organisms and evolved into more sophisticated species over many
thousands of years through a process called natural selection.
Species adapt to their environment and pass on genetic
characteristics to their offspring.
</P>
<P>
   To proponents of creationism, the universe was created by God
through a process set forth in the first book of the Bible,
Genesis. God created all species simultaneously, the world was
completed in six days and humans descended from Adam and Eve - not
earlier primates.
</P>
<P>
   This month marks the 75th anniversary of the most celebrated
debate between those theories - the Scopes ``monkey'' trial, in
which a young Tennessee science teacher was prosecuted for
violating the state's prohibition against teaching evolution. He
was convicted but fined only $100, and the law was eventually
repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy did not end there.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists before Darwin had speculated about the diversity of
life. But it wasn't until such publications as (beginitalic)Origin
of Species (enditalic)defined the concept of natural selection that
the process was made clear. Darwin's book sold out in one day.
Almost immediately, scientists and then the public applauded his
principles as sound though incomplete. Over the past century and a
half, those principles have been even more solidly established,
says Jane Maienschein, professor of biology and philosophy at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more strongly confirmed as basic to science,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is even better understood than gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution explains everything about life,'' says ASU genetics
professor Elliott Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   By the turn of the century, evolution was generally accepted and
had found its way into America's classrooms. Then religious leaders
began a crusade. Accepted for the most part overseas, evolution has
had a roller coaster ride in the United States. Last year the
Kansas Board of Education voted to delete virtually any mention of
evolution from the state's science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona schools, teaching evolution is allowed, but some
teachers who fear protests decline. Legislators from time to time
try to ban evolution or include creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Why the battle?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a poor job of explaining it,'' says Goldstein.
``That's it in a nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   Maienschein agrees. Anti-evolutionists insist the term ``theory
of evolution'' suggests scientists are uncertain of the facts. But
the word ``theory'' does not mean ``guess,'' she says. Scientists
define theory as a series of provable facts, an organizing
framework that has predictions and is testable.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin was not the first scientist to shake the faithful. In the
16th century, Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus put forth the
startling notion that the Earth revolved around the sun, instead of
the reverse. Alarmed citizens of the Earth feared that God would
not be able to find them if their planet were constantly moving.
</P>
<P>
   To remove Earth from the center of the solar system was
disturbing enough, but then Darwin removed humans from the center
of the animal kingdom. The Bible taught that man was given dominion
over the creatures of the Earth. Darwin's ideas instead put man on
a par with every creature from gnats to whales.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin, who followed the tenets of the Church of England as well
as Unitarianism, was a reluctant prophet. Knowing his findings
would be unsettling, he published his research only at the urging
of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel was developing
rudimentary theories of genetics, though they would largely be
ignored until scientists rediscovered his work around 1900. The
field of genetics took root in the 1930s, building on Darwin's
studies and reinforcing evidence seen but not yet explained.
</P>
<P>
   While some people find belief in a divine creator easier than
understanding genes and chromosomes, Goldstein sees science and
faith as compatible. He equates God's work with the forces of
nature and sees the Bible not as a scientific textbook but as a
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Bible is God-inspired,'' Goldstein says. ``To
believe in God doesn't mean you have to believe in creationism.''
</P>
<P>
   To endorse creationism, he says, is to deny nearly all
scientific fields, including geology, astronomy, biology, physics
and chemistry. And to deny the elegant workings of evolution is to
miss the beauty of such a grand mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for them,'' he says of creationists. ``They're
missing God's wonders because they're misinterpreting God's
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Save the pity, says Dale Langmade, president of the Arizona
Origin Science Association. ``He doesn't need to feel sorry for me,
because I can see the same beauty in intelligent design.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental Christians like Langmade take the Bible literally in
its explanation of the creation of the universe, he says, though
some agree the Earth is older than 6,000 years. Some support the
notion of natural selection as one of God's tools.
</P>
<P>
   Langmade, who attended ASU and the University of Alaska, takes
exception to the idea that creationists cannot embrace the panorama
of science if they reject evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a cheap shot,'' he says, noting that such legendary
scientists as Copernicus, Galileo, Isaac Newton and Francis Crick
were men of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Langmade has spent time admiring the strata in the walls of the
Grand Canyon, which he calls evidence of the Biblical account of
the Great Flood. God put humans in charge of the animal kingdom, he
says, because they were created in God's image: ``Man is the image
of God, not flies.''
</P>
<P>
   But what most disturbs anti-evolutionists is that the theory
appears to remove God from life's equation. Larry Kisner, a retired
physicist in the aerospace industry and editor of the Arizona
Origin Science Association newsletter, believes a secular
explanation of the origin of the universe negates moral absolutes.
He points out that evolution has been used to justify eugenics and
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution is also a religion,'' Kisner says. ``It's
paganism.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's a reason that America more than Europe champions the
crusade against what has been dubbed ``evil-ution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America has been the moral agent of the world for many
generations,'' Kisner says. ``We were founded that way. {hellip}
That's why the battle is fiercer here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are waging their own battle, fearing America suffers
if evolution is not taught in schools. The public must be informed
on such issues as genetic research, the overuse of antibiotics, the
human genome project - all of which are built upon evolutionary
principles, Maienschein says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a poll commissioned by the liberal civil rights group People
for the American Way found that while 83percent of Americans favor
teaching evolution in public schools, 79percent think creationism
also has a place in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Such reports are ``good news and bad news,'' says science writer
Jonathan Weiner, whose book, (beginitalic)The Beak of the Finch: A
Story of Evolution in Our Time(enditalic), won the 1995 Pulitzer
Prize for non-fiction. Weiner takes heart that a majority of
respondents support the teaching of evolution, and he does believe
students should learn that some religious beliefs dispute those
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, ``Every educated person should know and understand
the theory of evolution. It's such a beautiful theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner understands why this is a sometimes frightening period in
scientific history. Cloning, gene therapy, genetic engineering -
where does it stop? Will scientists some day construct human beings
not just with a choice of hair and eye color but with specific
behavioral and personality traits as well?
</P>
<P>
   Evolution is sometimes taken as a symbol of science run amok. In
times of uncertainty, Weiner says, people embrace the familiar and
reject notions that appear too revolutionary. Creationists want to
halt the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake here is the future of our children, our
society and our world if our children are taught that there is no
God or that they must compartmentalize their faith from school,''
Kisner says.
</P>
<P>
   Maienschein argues that evolution will be the savior of a
fragile world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can screw up the environment and then save it,'' she says.
``That's a source of hope.'' Tim Koors/The Arizona RepublicIs a 3
million-year-old male skull on display at the Institute of Human
Origins in Tempe an ancestor of modern man?

   SHUTTERS _ CHARLESTON, S.C. - As he strolls amid the history of

Pinckney Seabrook Wilkinson is alarmed by the declining population.
Not of people, but of shutters. ``You see how silly the house looks
without them,'' said the College of Charleston English instructor
and self-appointed guardian of the historic district's exterior
window dressings. Though few, if any, are so fretful, Wilkinson
said the shutters are disappearing as well-heeled out of towners
snap up historic houses and, during renovation, are not aware, or
do not care, about zoning rules that require shutters to be
replaced. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

CHENEY WOULD PROVIDE STABILITY AND EXPERIENCE, ANALYSTS SAY &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney would
give George W. Bush an instant shot of gravitas and energize the
Republican Party, while reassuring the public that Bush has a
battle-tested No. 2 to deal with foreign and domestic problems,
party activists and political analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very thorough, very fair, always prepared, very stable. I
think that's what people saw during the Persian Gulf War,'' said
Becky Constantino, the Wyoming Republican Party chairwoman,
referring to Cheney's time as defense secretary. ``There's just
such a sense of security around Dick Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   But selecting Cheney, who also served six terms in the US House
and was chief of staff for President Ford, could undercut Bush's
appeal as a Washington outsider and reinforce speculation that his
administration would recycle figures from the administration of his
father, President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It also could raise questions of whether a 59-year-old running
mate with a history of heart trouble enables the Texas governor to
fulfill his chief criterion for a vice president: the ability to
become president in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cheney was touched by the House banking scandal and
criticized in 1991 for giving Pentagon briefings to GOP donors.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has been heading Bush's search for a running mate, but he
was identified as a leading candidate Friday, when he switched his
voter registration from Texas, where he has been running an oil and
engineering firm, to Wyoming, his longtime home. The move would
keep Electoral College voters in Texas from violating a prohibition
against supporting presidential and vice presidential candidates
from the same state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides cautioned that picking Cheney is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is spending the weekend contemplating his choice at
his ranch in Crawford, Texas. He and his wife, Laura, left the
ranch Saturday to attend the funeral of Senator Paul Coverdell of
Georgia, a Bush family friend who died Tuesday from a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cheney, speculation centers on Governor Frank Keating of
Oklahoma; Senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, George Voinovich of
Ohio, Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of Tennessee, and John McCain of
Arizona; former Missouri senator John C. Danforth; as well as
Governors George Pataki of New York and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
and former Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush often hails governors for their executive experience, while
the senators would offer him experience in the ways of Washington.
Dole could improve Bush's appeal to women, a traditionally
Democratic bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor will decide shortly, and when he does, the plan
is for he himself to make and announce the news. . . . It could
come as soon as Monday,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and longtime Cheney friends said any negatives are far
outweighed by the positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a wide variety of experience both in the executive
branch of government and he's got a wide variety of experience in
the legislative branch as well,'' said Tom Sansonetti, a Republican
National Committee member from Cheyenne, Wyo., who has known Cheney
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, a Washington political analyst, added: ``The
conservatives see him as conservative, the moderates see him as
moderate. He's clearly distinguished and he'd generate excitement
among the Republicans at their convention. The overall reaction
from the media would be one that he could definitely be president
if needed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Bush has said repeatedly that America needs a
fresh start from the moral and fund-raising problems that have
plagued President Clinton and, by extension, the Democratic
candidate, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is said to be focusing his search for a No. 2 on Senator
John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, as well as Senators Bob Graham of
Florida and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, and former Senate
majority leader George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   While only five years older than Bush, Cheney is a political
graybeard who would help the two-term governor on two fronts:
experience in dealing with Congress, and reassurance for the public
that Bush's lack of foreign affairs experience would not put the
nation at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., but raised in Wyoming, the son
of a US soil-conservation official. He worked in the Nixon
administration in the Office of Economic Opportunity and on the
Cost of Living Council before becoming deputy assistant to
President Ford. At 34, he became Ford's White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was first elected to Congress in 1978. He was reelected
five times and became House minority whip in 1988. While
maintaining a conservative record _ Cheney, like Bush, opposes
abortion _ he nonetheless appealed to moderates even as he strongly
supported a conservative icon, President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, President Bush appointed Cheney defense secretary after
the Senate rejected his first choice, former Texas senator John G.
Tower. It was in that post that Cheney gained his greatest fame,
offering a cerebral image as the United States sent a half-million
troops to fight Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was embarrassed in March 1992 when he was named among a
number of former and current House members in the House banking
scandal. He acknowledged overdrawing 21 checks in 1989-90 for
amounts ranging from $12 to $1,945, but said the deficits were
covered in no more than five days after his paycheck was deposited.
</P>
<P>
   While defense secretary, Cheney was also criticized for giving
Pentagon briefings to supporters who had donated $5,000 to the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's health has been questioned because he suffered mild
heart attacks in 1978, 1984, and 1988. He underwent quadruple
coronary bypass surgery in August 1988. During Cheney's
confirmation hearings for defense secretary in 1989, his doctor
called his recovery ``excellent'' and said there were no
restrictions on his work or recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Cheney has been chairman and chief executive officer
of Halliburton Corp., a $9 billion engineering and construction
conglomerate.

 &HT;    Watch out for the also-rans
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You're the winner.
</P>
<P>
   You've been offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   Before you take it, before you finish negotiations, there is a
critical question you must ask, advises Dr. Pierre Mornell: Where
are the in-house candidates you bested to get the job?
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't seem like a question you should ask? According to
Mornell, not only should you ask, but if you don't get a full and
detailed answer, you should rethink accepting the post at all.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mornell, author of ``Games Companies Play: The Job
Hunter's Guide to Playing Smart &AMP; Winning Big in the High-Stakes
Hiring Game,'' when you take a new position, it's in your best
interest to know who else wanted the job, particularly if the
losing candidates are still there, working for you or with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``These internal candidates can be your allies. They've given
thought to the job,'' Mornell says.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a flip side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can also be your greatest critics. If they feel slighted
by the person coming in, they're going to want to see you fail,''
he warns.
</P>
<P>
   Many an eager new jobholder has experienced that scenario,
typically played out with backstabbing, rumor-mongering or
passive-aggressive ``cooperation.'' Those problems can be reduced
by identifying the also-rans and addressing their respective issues
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing information about who didn't get the job is also in the
employer's best interests, Mornell contends.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many employers don't realize that. They worry
more about confidentiality and protecting the egos of the
also-rans. These are noble goals, but ones that may do more damage
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to discuss with the person hiring you what measures
are being taken to engage these people, to keep them productive,
engaged and happy,'' Mornell says.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a topic your new bosses don't want to entertain,
think again about working for them, Mornell warns.
</P>
<P>
   When the also-ran phenomenon is not handled properly, ``problems
will arise,'' Mornell says, ``so that's why I think it's important
to say `rethink the job.' It is also true, especially in today's
(low unemployment) job market, it's not a question of getting a
job. It's a question of getting the job you want,'' Mornell adds.
</P>
<P>
   So, Mornell says you need to learn the other candidates'
identities, then:
</P>
<P>
   Find out their strengths and interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask directly what are the strengths and weaknesses'' of
your previous competitors, Mornell says. Listen carefully, he
advises. ``You have (to utilize) a good BS detector. Have your
antennae out,'' he says. Again, if your potential employer is
hesitant in answering or is stringing you along, don't take the
job, Mornell says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you know how direct or indirect the person is being,''
says Mornell, and this is not information to ignore ``especially if
(the evasion is coming from) person you're going to work for. How
they respond is an indicator'' of what you might expect in your
future dealings with the person, he points out.
</P>
<P>
   Discuss with the management what measures will be taken to
develop a productive relationship with the also-rans. What will be
done should issues arise?''
</P>
<P>
   This may be the most important conversation you have as a new
hire or newly promoted manager. It's even more important than
asking what your raise will be, hard as that may be to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't assured of management's backing, and it isn't
clear that management understands that your success could be
undermined by jilted job candidates, then your path to success is
rock-strewn before you start.

 &HT;    For beer container collectors, it becomes a case of 'can do'
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A thousand cans of beer on the wall, a thousand cans
of beer. Take one down and pass it around _ and one of these guys
will likely offer to buy it from you.
</P>
<P>
   Not the beer, mind you; just the can.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting beer cans is something most would associate with
determined recyclers or serious suds swillers. But there are
approximately 5,000 people across the nation who simply like the
color, the nostalgia, the thrill of discovery, or the basic
``guy-ness'' of amassing and displaying large numbers of beer cans.
Saturday, (July 29), the Atlanta chapter of the Beer Can Collectors
of America will host a regional gathering and swap meet at the
Holiday Inn in Cartersville, Ga. They call it a ``canvention.''
</P>
<P>
   In their search for the truly rare can, these collectors have
been known to scour roadside ditches, dig up dump sites and make
deals with undersea salvage operators. They also like to poke
around homes being remodeled, mostly to hunt in old wall spaces for
beer cans the original construction workers might have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   A rare can of Rosalee beer recently brought $10,000 through an
Internet auction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a treasure hunt,'' said Ken Jones, a BCCA board
member. ``You can find things that you didn't even know the
breweries made.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could find yourself in a trashy quandary. Consider this
account of a ``dumping'' (beer-can hunting at old dumps) excursion
written up by John Kotteman of Oakville, Mo. Kotteman went out into
the Georgia countryside looking for cans while he was stationed at
Fort Gordon, near Augusta,Ga.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped at an abandoned farmhouse and spied some old soup
cans across the road. He kicked around the area of the cans a bit,
then discovered some 50-year-old quart beer cans from a long-closed
New York brewery. There was more, a whole pit full of old cans. Had
he come across a pile of rubies, he could only have been slightly
happier.
</P>
<P>
   Kotteman kept pulling cans out of the pit, until he discovered
he was about 8 feet deep inside an old well. He tossed out more and
more precious beer cans, until he stopped and thought, ``How deep
is this well?''
</P>
<P>
   Danger is only rarely associated with beer can collecting, but
the hobby does have a way of taking over a collector's life _ or at
least his basement.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has most of the basement walls of his home decorated with
old metal signs from a long-gone Atlanta brewery, The Atlantic
Brewing Co. Jones is one of the collectors who specializes in the
products of a single brewery, from the cans to the coasters to the
advertising placards.
</P>
<P>
   The brewery, located in downtown Atlanta, produced one of the
major local beer brands from 1876 until the 1950s. It was bottled
until the 1930s, when breweries figured out how to send metal cans
through their bottling lines. This process produced the
``cone-top'' cans, later replaced by the flat-tops (some of which
carried instructions on how to use a church key to open them), and
then by the aluminum cans with pull tabs and pop tops.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, the Atlantic Brewing Co. started making a brand of
beer called ``Old South,'' and some of the advertising products
used to promote it have become collectors' items themselves, Jones
said. The metal signs depicting a black waiter carrying a tray with
a cold glass of Old South are highly prized by both the beer can
collectors and collectors of black Americana items.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he has found some of the signs at places like
abandoned country juke joints, where the owners would turn the
metal signs around and use them for siding. Some Old South signs
bring $1,000 to $1,500 on the collectors' market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he could legally drink, Bill Beaudin, of Marietta,
Ga., recalls picking up a can of Bullfrog Beer on the road near his
home in Bronson, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Beaudin, the head of the Atlanta chapter of the BCCA, has
approximately 5,000 beer cans that pretty much make up the wall
decor of three rooms of his basement.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst the rows with easily recognizable labels, he has brands
like Idris Old English Ginger Beer; a series of beers by a Swedish
brewery featuring cans embossed with fine-art reproductions; and a
new item from capitalistic Russia, Leningrad Cowboy Beer. However,
Beaudin notes, neither he nor other serious collectors consider
Billy Beer, the label that tried to capitalize on former President
Jimmy Carter's brother Billy, as a collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in their association surged in the early 1970s, then
declined after some canning companies churned out novelty beer
labels, saturating the collectibles market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the membership rolls are growing again, Beaudin said, and
some of it may be due to beer-drinking demographics. Some guys
started collecting cans when they were young but stopped when they
married and began raising their families, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their kids grown, they want to get back to their hobby
again,'' Beaudin said. ``They want one last vestige of their happy
college days.''

 &HT;    For Gwinnett teen, traffic accident as bad as nuclear one
 &HT;    By Joey Ledford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mariya ``Masha'' Malikina survived the radiation that
spewed from the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the former Soviet
republic of Belarus, her native land.
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 nuclear accident about 150 miles from her home poisoned
her family's food and water. Her grandfather died of leukemia. Her
grandmother is battling breast cancer. Masha, now 16, is still
plagued by chronic internal bleeding believed caused by the
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But her greatest health challenge came years later after she and
her mother, Nina, found a promising new life in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were coming home from school, me and four other kids,''
said Masha, a green-eyed blonde who speaks perfect English after
nine years in America, the last seven in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Masha was in the back seat of a red 1990 Acura Integra being
driven by a 16-year-old classmate. School had just been dismissed
on Oct. 29, 1999, a Friday afternoon, and the five teens _ three
boys and two girls _ were trailing another car of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy in front kept speeding up and slowing down, and in
high school terms that means he wants to race,'' said Masha.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all said no, but (the driver) tries to do it anyway,'' she
continued. ``He tries to pass him, and he runs off the road and
hits some trees.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the five was wearing seat belts. The driver had head
injuries, a collapsed lung and internal bleeding. One of the girls
required plastic surgery on her face. A second girl was in a coma
for about two weeks. The second boy remains in a coma to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics, on the scene within minutes, called in a Life Flight
helicopter for Masha.
</P>
<P>
   She spent about three weeks in the hospital before she could go
home. Now the karate belt holder is a paraplegic, paralyzed from
the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This girl has incredible will and desire,'' said Ralph Parker,
who volunteers to work with refugees, helping them adapt to
American life. ``She is determined to overcome the paralysis and go
to college. Her spirit is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Masha has learned to drive a car with hand controls. She's
attending summer school, trying to catch up on all the classes she
missed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to go in there and sit the whole day,'' she
said. ``My back hurts so bad, and the class, it's so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens' reckless nature and horrendous crash records aside, I
asked her why so many fail to protect themselves with seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they think they are invincible,'' she said. ``You
think it can't happen to you. I'm real, and I'm telling you, yes it
can. It happened to me, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she must use a wheelchair, she said, some kids treat
her differently. Like, for example, the boy she dated for a year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to the hospital one time and never called again,'' she
said. ``I hope that when I start walking, and he comes up . . . I
will say, `Don't talk to me.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Masha is determined to walk again. While specialists in Atlanta
say they have tried every approved therapy to make that happen, she
and her family have decided they want her to go to a facility in
Tijuana, Mexico, that claims success with some spinal injury
patients using an experimental treatment called embryonic cell
transplant therapy. The surgical treatment has not been approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Masha said the surgery will cost at least $57,000, and
post-surgical treatments even more. Because the treatment is
experimental, her mother's insurance won't cover it, and the family
is already deeply in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many bills,'' she said, her voice breaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ask people to borrow money,'' she said. ``We'd have
to tell them we don't have the money to pay you back. We're asking
for people who are generous and have compassion to help us out.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site _ www.willeobaptist.org/Masha/masha.html _
tells how to contribute. A Bank of America account, No.
003270464508, has been set up on Masha's behalf.

 &HT;    Easy pieces mix it up for chic travel
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to vacation packing, be a fashion
survivor, not a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Simply invest in easy-to-pack, mix-and-match items that make
light of travel. Then combine them into multiple outfits that take
you from a casual morning breakfast to a dress-up evening _ in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Weekenders U.S.A. is one company that has done all the work for
you. The clothing line is sold via fashion coordinators through
in-home parties. It consists of jackets, skirts, shells, shorts and
trousers in a wrinkle-resistant poly-cotton knit.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic Line is available year-round in red, cream, black or
navy. And the Fashion Line, available for six months only,
introduces designs and colors twice a year. Sizes range from extra
small to extra large and you don't need a body like Russian tennis
star Anna Kournikova to look good in the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   To show how the system works, fashion coordinator Mary Williams
took nine classic pieces and created a wardrobe that could take you
around the world or on a weekend getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pieces never go out of style,'' says Williams. ``Best of
all, they are so comfy.''
</P>
<P>
   Her choices? A simple white cardigan jacket ($69); a black
T-dress (comes with four sets of straps) that slips down to double
as a long slim skirt ($35); cream shorts ($30); red short-sleeve
top with scoop neck ($32); white sleeveless shell top ($25); pair
of red trousers _ the company calls them jodhpurs ($39); black
long-sleeve tunic with V-neck ($35); and a full white skirt with
elastic waistband ($45).
</P>
<P>
   And the ninth piece? It's a water-repellent, mid-thigh navy
jacket ($69) that converts to a tote bag for carrying your
Weekenders clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply roll the pieces you are not wearing into the bag and
off you go,'' says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   To find a coordinator near you or for more information, call
1-847-229-1200 or visit www.weekenders.com.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta, Ga.-based Labyrinth is another company that promotes
comfy and practical mix-and-match pieces. Designer/owner Jorgi
Shipley describes her collection as ``modular clothing pieces that
can be fitted together to make a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Pieces, available in cotton knits, gauzes and washable silks,
include dresses, tops and trousers. One size fits a variety of
figures but Shipley says she can accommodate most shapes. Prices:
$20-$39.
</P>
<P>
   Order at www.labyrinthclothing.com.
</P>
<P>
   For easy travel, Casual Corner stores has introduced
Collectibles. It's a collection of mix-and-match classics in
wrinkle-resistant acetate/rayon or matte jersey. The jackets,
trousers, sheath dresses and suits are available in black or navy.
Added pieces include pinstripe and polka-dot blouses. Prices range
from $39 to $99 and are available in sizes 2-14.

 &HT;    On powerful boards, women are most notable in their absence
 &HT;    by Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The lack of women decision-makers on Georgia state
boards is appalling _ especially at agencies that deal with issues
of concern to women.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Board of Regents. There are more women than men
enrolled in the state's colleges and universities, but the
16-member regents board has one female member.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Resources Board, which oversees policies that
primarily affect women and children, has only five women on its
15-member board. The powerful Department of Transportation Board
has no women on it. Zero. It had one woman 55 years ago when board
member Frank Dennis' wife served for two years after his death. DOT
officials didn't even bother to record her first name.
</P>
<P>
   But some women have finally decided to do something about the
inequity.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Women's Foundation, at the urging of its executive
director, Stephanie Davis, is launching a project called ``Women on
Board,'' aimed at attaining gender equity on state government and
nonprofit boards. According to Davis, Gov. Roy Barnes and his staff
have committed to help. ``They've even called to ask for our
suggestions for the board that deals with men's health,'' she said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, of course, has good reason to pay attention to the
initiative: He owes his election victory largely to the votes of
women and African-Americans. But the foundation's making waves on
other fronts as well. Davis is collaborating with women legislators
on a bill that would set goals for state boards to reflect the
gender makeup of the population served.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina passed a similar law last year. Proposed by the
North Carolina Women's Forum, the gender-equity bill started out as
a mandate but was watered down and made voluntary by the time the
law was passed. Still, the legislation has placed a public
spotlight on the issue and is getting results, according to Florrie
Glasser, who lobbied for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and the Atlanta Women's Foundation are taking aim at
nonprofit boards, too. While small nonprofit boards often include a
lot of women, high-profile boards tend not to. For example, the
Robert F. Woodruff Foundation, which is worth billions and often
plays a key role in getting crucial projects executed in metro
Atlanta, has no women on its five-member board.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' group is committed to helping disadvantaged women and
girls, but Davis sees no incongruity in also taking the lead on a
``glass ceiling'' issue. ``It's simple,'' she says. ``When there
are more women at the decision-making tables, our issues get
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has transformed the organization from a fledgling fund in
1992 into an endowed foundation that can raise half a million at a
single fund-raiser. And she has made key alliances with political
and business leaders, many of them women.
</P>
<P>
   When an organization that helps women make the transition from
welfare to work needed a van recently, Davis phoned a key
supporter, Paula Rosput, president of Atlanta Gas Light. An AGL van
was at her door within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is getting plenty of advice from a Georgia organization
that works for gender equity on corporate boards _ the Board of
Directors Network. That group's latest survey is bleak as well,
given the number of qualified women in business. Of the state's 229
publicly held corporations last year, 67 percent had no women on
their boards.
</P>
<P>
   BDN President Jane Salter, a partner with Ernst &AMP; Young, says
that while different strategies are needed for getting women on
government, nonprofit and corporate boards, there's a common
challenge: convincing men that power is not a zero-sum game.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis puts it, ``It's about women and men gaining more power.
What could be more powerful, after all, than equality?''

 &HT;    Are you older than 18? Of sound mind and body? Not acting under
undue influence? Then why don't you have a will?
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Welcome to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? The mortality rate is 100 percent. And contrary to
what the Egyptians believed, evidence points to the unsettling fact
that you cannot take it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. Then, someone, somewhere will don
your gay apparel, drive your car and raise your child. Want to be
able to speak from the grave and determine who gets the Spode
Christmas china? Don't trust relatives and friends to remember that
Aunt Charlotte's emerald ring goes to the first grandchild born on
a Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   You need a will. A duly executed, properly witnessed,
comprehensive will.
</P>
<P>
   The worst states to die in? California and Ohio, where
complicated laws and mandatory fees make distributing assets
expensive. That is just one of the things I learned from several
attorneys, all board-certified in wills and estates, and a
professor who literally wrote the book on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Wills make interesting reading, revealing so much about their
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin left daughter Sarah a picture of the King of
France (set with 408 diamonds) on the proviso that she would not
reset the diamonds into ornaments for herself or her daughters and
thereby ``countenance the expensive vain and useless fashion of
wearing jewels in this country. ``Ben and I do not share
philosophies here.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine poor Louis XVI of France, who from his prison cell
in 1792 wrote a last testament exhorting that his son, ``should he
have the misfortune of becoming king,'' to forget ``all hates and
grudges.'' (Louis was a better person than I.)
</P>
<P>
   And what was cobbler Charles Cairine conjuring when he left a
complex will bequeathing the rents from his Scottish farmlands to
his brother's male descendants with the birthday closest to Nov.
11? Last March, the latest beneficiary in the 256 years of Cairin
generosity learned he will receive more than $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis leave her good friend and
companion Maurice Tempelsman a Greek alabaster head?
</P>
<P>
   And who could forget poor Vivien Leigh's brilliant azure eyes?
She bequeathed them to an organ bank, only to have them rejected
because she suffered tuberculosis. Sometimes, you can take it with
you.
</P>
<P>
   Are you among the estimated 70 percent who do not have a will?
Do you regularly shush that nagging little voice that admonishes
you for not appointing a guardian and executing a durable power of
attorney? Wonder what the heck a power of attorney is, anyway, and
where to get one? Care to find out what power Frank Sinatra exerts
from the beyond and what the heck holographic means? Then this
edition of the Greig Files will enlighten and amuse you.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, experience will power _ Use this Greig Files as an
excuse to write a will, any kind of will.
</P>
<P>
   WHY IS IT CALLED A LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT?
</P>
<P>
   In early English law, personal property was disposed of by a
legal instrument called a will; however, real property (castles,
moats, real estate) was disposed of by a testament. So a person of
means had both a will and testament in order to dispose of both
types of property. Nowadays, the phrase is redundant because a will
disposes of both real and personal property.
</P>
<P>
   WHO NEEDS A WILL?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone 18 or older with a stick of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Want to hear something really scary? The Texas Legislature has
written a will for everyone, notes UT School of Law professor
Stanley Johanson. You can write your own will, of course. It is
legal to do so. But it is also legal to take out your own appendix
_ generally not a good idea, remarks Johanson. Even with a properly
executed will, sometimes tragedy strikes _ usually in the form of a
legal pad and pen as folks decide to write their own codicils. Mary
Mayfield Gooch did just that, and in the ensuing litigation (two
trips to the Texas Supreme Court and one denial by the U.S. Supreme
Court), the City of Austin, the Austin National Bank and the Humane
Society lost some of what Gooch (yes, the Mayfield Park Mary)
wanted to bequeath.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GETS THE LA-Z-BOY IF I DO NOT HAVE A WILL?
</P>
<P>
   Well, cowboy, when and how did you acquire the national chair of
Texas? (Is it leather?)
</P>
<P>
   In the Lone Star State, a community property state, your spouse
receives half of all the property acquired during marriage with the
remaining half passing to your children. Are your children the same
as your spouse's? (Not everyone's are.) Then all community property
is inherited by the spouse, notes attorney William Pargaman.
</P>
<P>
   Separate property (anything inherited during the marriage or
owned before the marriage) is governed by another set of rules.
Married with children? One third of separate real estate passes to
your spouse for life; the remainder goes to your descendants. Once
your spouse dies, his or her one-third must go to your children as
well. Separate personal property however, (items such as stocks,
jewelry or money), passes one-third outright to your spouse (who
may then bequeath the goods to anyone) and two-thirds to your
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a will, those who have smaller assets suffer the
most,'' concludes Pargaman, ``as their beneficiaries suffer the
expensive court costs to receive remaining assets.''
</P>
<P>
   DO MILLIONS GO TO THE DOGS?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes dogs receive the lion's share. Estates have been left
to fish and fowl.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that about 25 percent of pet owners include
animals in their wills. Making a conditional gift to a pet's
caregiver in trust is a reliable method of providing for Fido.
</P>
<P>
   The largest known bequest was to the lucky canines (all 150 of
them) of Quaker State heiress Eleanor Ritchey. Her estate was
willed to a veterinary research program at Auburn University in
1968 with the stipulation that her canine friends were well cared
for. Ritchey's original $4.2 million increased to more than $10
million before the last dog died.
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T I JUST WRITE MY OWN?
</P>
<P>
   If you must.
</P>
<P>
   Properly dated holographic wills _ written entirely by the
person whose will it is. Other wills (written by someone else,
typed or a form) must be properly executed, witnessed and signed by
two people in the presence of the person whose will it is, says
attorney Sara Atkins of Saunders &AMP; Norval LLP.
</P>
<P>
   When writing your will, be as specific as possible (``I give''
and ``I bequeath''), and remember, most wills are probated, or
proved to be genuine, so appoint an independent executor to serve
without bond.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to cause problems for heirs. Why not spend a
few hundred dollars up front to make sure the will is properly
drawn? A holographic will is better than no will at all. Going up
the ladder, a form will from a CD or book (reminds me of Mad Libs
for heirs), then a will drawn up by an attorney, any attorney.
</P>
<P>
   DID MAMA REALLY SAY YOU COULD HAVE THE MING DISH?
</P>
<P>
   Funny how what Mama promised but failed to write down can make
enemies of the best sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Itemizing your wishes is one gift to your heir that will not be
forgotten. Feeling feisty? Do what Frank Sinatra and Gene
Roddenberry did. Insert a provision that contesters are
automatically disinherited. That should stop the haggling _ or at
least publicly mute it.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY?
</P>
<P>
   In the event you are unable to make health-care decisions for
yourself, a medical power of attorney for health care gives another
person the authority to make decisions for you.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Marilyn G. Miller does a substantial amount of
elder-law work and advises clients that no document is
self-executing, and ``such papers are only as good as the agent you
select.'' Once this document is properly executed and witnessed,
make copies for everyone _ your spouse, your children, your
neighbors, your pastor, your physician.
</P>
<P>
   In the planning mood? Consider a living will, a medical
directive of specific instructions regarding end-of-life care
decisions (e.g., artificial nutrition and hydration).
</P>
<P>
   DO ALL WILLS GO THROUGH PROBATE?
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under limited circumstances, if all family members with an
interest in the estate enter into a settlement agreement, it is not
necessary to have the will admitted to probate,'' advises attorney
Tom Barton.WHADDAYA MEAN, REVIEW IT?
</P>
<P>
   That's what you should do to your will every two to five years,
advises attorney Stephen Saunders. Even though a will represents
what you reasonably see down the road, things change. Children
become adults (employed, even); property is acquired (especially
problematic if it is in Louisiana, which is the only state that has
laws based on French code) financial situations turn. Occasionally,
the law changes. Touching base with your attorney costs little
(often nothing) and can save your heirs heartache.
</P>
<P>
   CHILLING THOUGHT: FROZEN ASSETS
</P>
<P>
   Most attorneys recommend wills and other important documents be
stored in a safety deposit box with copies sent to executors and
relatives. Not interested in standard security measures? Why not
store your papers in the freezer between the Blue Bell and the
venison sausage?
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-life planning kit, ``Before I Go, You Should Know,''
from the Funeral Consumers Alliance allows you to do just that. The
information comes with a plastic button-tie pouch with
state-specific Living Will and other advance directives, such as
``Death Away from Home,'' a directory of U.S. funeral consumer
groups, and a checklist of other important documents to store (such
as military discharge papers), plus a 20-page write-in booklet with
illustrations by Edward Gorey. (Yes, some call it ``The Gorey
Details'' packet.)
</P>
<P>
   Good way to spend a sawbuck ($10 includes shipping). Call (800)
765-0107 to order.
</P>
<P>
   FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO PROBATE
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortest will: Karl Tausch, January 1967, ``All to wife.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Record will verbiage: 95,940 words (4 volumes) by the
loquacious Mrs. Frederica Stilwell Cook, dated November 1925.
</P>
<P>
   _ Largesse award: To Mrs. Robert Hayes, who in her will
requested that her husband marry her stepdaughter from a previous
marriage within a week of the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alas, poor Yorick medal: To an anonymous business executive
who left his money to endow acting scholarships with the condition
his skull be used in a performance of Hamlet. It was.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bequest that begat: Charles Millar, who left the bulk of
his $1 million estate to the woman who gave birth to the most
children in Toronto in the 10 years after his death. The money was
shared by four ``winners,'' each with 10 children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Death wish come true: For Charles Bronson, who was left
$300,000 by fan Audrey Knauner, who idolized but never knew him.

 &HT;    Face of triumph
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lance Armstrong has the look of a champion. The
look of a man so possessed of dream, so obsessed with what it is he
wants to accomplish, that the heart ignores fatigue and exhaustion
and wills the body to push itself beyond the normal bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Had she not known the undeniable outcome of the Tour de France,
a grueling, three-week endurance contest, Jill Sterkel still would
have recognized the fierce, unrelenting spirit that pushed
Armstrong to ride down the Champs-Elysees as champion once more.
</P>
<P>
   Those pale blue eyes tell it all. Sterkel, a four-time Olympic
swimmer and gold medalist, sees the embodiment of that unparalleled
inner drive in Armstrong's steely gaze that never has wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who's been at the bottom of life,'' said Sterkel,
the current University of Texas women's swimming coach who won two
gold and two bronze medals in Olympics spanning 12 years. ``You can
see the determination and the focus in his eyes. I wish I could
suck it out of him and put it in some other people. He's figured it
out. If you want to be great, look at Lance Armstrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than half of the 21-stage event, the other riders were
looking at him _ from behind.
</P>
<P>
   In wiping away the field as he did under the most severe
conditions imaginable, where the mountain descents are every bit as
dangerous as the climbs, Armstrong established himself as one of
the elite athletes in American sports history. In addition, he
reaffirmed himself in the pantheon of Austin heroes such as Ricky
Williams, Darrell Royal, Ben Crenshaw and Jody Conradt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance is such a compelling story, it's captivated all of us,''
said Conradt, the Hall of Fame University of Texas women's
basketball coach who has kept tabs on Armstrong's progress while
recruiting at Amateur Athletic Union tournaments in Tennessee. ``In
Austin, having experienced the support for women's sports, we know
it's a city that embraces some non-traditional sports. Of course,
you have to be No. 1 or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had already won the respect and admiration of sports
fans worldwide, but by repeating in such spectacular fashion he
further esconces himself in the lore of American sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance Armstrong represents everything that is right,'' Texas
football coach Mack Brown said. ``He has shown unparalleled courage
and has the talent to be the best in the world at what he does, and
he does it with class. Most of all, he's a nice guy who believed
that he could do anything and was willing to work hard enough to
make that happen. That defines a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   _ `I think it's the most incredible American sports story I've
seen in years, maybe ever. It's a blessing from the good Lord.' _
Earl CampbelL, Former University of Texas Heisman Trophy winner
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, a lanky 28-year-old Texan whose lean physique carries
3 percent body fat, shocked the world a year ago when he won his
first Tour de France in imposing fashion. The win came after he was
diagnosed with testicular cancer in October 1996, and he had taken
a full year off from competitive riding.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Tour again stamps him as one of the greatest
cyclists ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sterkel can relate. She brought home a gold medal from the
Montreal Olympic Games in 1976 at the tender age of 15 after
swimming a leg of the 400-meter relay team. Eight years later she
swam on the same winning relay squad in the Olympic Games at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gets harder the second time,'' Sterkel said. ``The
first time I had no clue what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As an older and more mature athlete, Sterkel said she learned
how to balance the pressures of performing with the rush of
competing. She learned how to internalize the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did Keith Moreland as a catcher and designated hitter
for the world-champion Philadelphia Phillies in 1980. The former
All-America third baseman for the Texas Longhorns reached the
pinnacle of his 12-year major-league baseball career in just his
third season as the Mike Schmidt-led Phillies beat the Kansas City
Royals in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Although those same Phils jumped to a five-game lead in the
summer of 1981, a strike interrupted their defense of the crown but
they didn't survive the truncated season with split-season
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the world is shooting at you,'' Moreland said.
``You could tell the difference. We had basically the same club,
but we'd go in every city where when they introduced the starting
lineups and said, 'Now for the visiting world-champion Phillies . .
.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Conradt, the all-time winningest women's basketball coach, won a
national championship in 1986 with a perfect record and has been to
only one Final Four since 1986. ``You do it the first time, you
think it's going to happen again,'' she said. ``You don't realize
how difficult it'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong repeated without so much as a bump.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shrinking under the weight of the expectations, he
stunned the competition and the sports world by taking the lead at
the 10th stage and never looking back.
</P>
<P>
   _ `I don't think there's ever been an athlete at the top of his
game who didn't say it's tougher to stay on top than to get there.
You would think just being able to look cancer in the face and whup
it, that would take all the push out of him. But he has such
intestinal drive and the mental capacity to overcome physical
adversity. And he's doing it in sort of a matter-of-fact way.' _
Keith Moreland, former All-American Texas third baseman
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Armstrong was accepted as a champion of champions by
everyone except the French in what is his adopted second homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Critics harped on his failure to speak in French at his press
conferences. Others absurdly protested that he was using
performance-enhancing drugs, although we're still waiting the rush
of cyclists to take chemotherapy before the Tour. Some decried the
lack of competition with so many top riders absent, as if that
could be blamed on Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his miraculous ride through the French countryside in
1999, this year was going to be different.
</P>
<P>
   The field was better. The course more difficult. The
expectations bigger. Instead of being considered a bigger novelty
than the bearded lady at the circus, Armstrong was the focus, the
target.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized as the favorite to become the first American to
repeat as Tour champion since three-time winner Greg LeMond,
Armstrong backed off some after a crash into a wall at the Col du
Solour when he hit a rock. He emerged in late June as a fresh,
supremely confident rider.
</P>
<P>
   He bided his time in the flat lands of western France where the
sprinters were dominant and then gutted it up to take a commanding
lead while racing up the side of Mount Venoux. The mountain looked
like the final wave of ``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the weight of such intense anticipation, Armstrong not
only persevered in this year's race, he raised the level of his
cycling. As Campbell noted, Armstrong adjusted his training after
his bout with cancer and remained implanted on his bike rather than
standing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for his cancer, he wouldn't have changed his
training,'' Campbell said. ``He learned standing up burns more
energy. If you sit down, you're stronger. Maybe it was meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a true champion, Armstrong proved he was no one-year
wonder. This was no comeback, just confirmation that Armstrong is
among the greatest cyclists of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Gosh, I followed the race every day. I am in total awe of his
talent and his tactical skills. And I don't know of any athlete
with more heart.' _ Ben Crenshaw, former Texas Longhorn who has won
two Masters titles
</P>
<P>
   Heart is so hard to define, but all will agree it is the one
intangible that separates the contenders from the pretenders. No
one questions the mental resolve of Armstrong, who not only
repeated but improved on his 1999 performance against even greater
odds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his has been a career that's not about limits but
possibilities, not about risks, but rewards.
</P>
<P>
   While some might have written off his 1999 championship as a
fluke, one of those bizarre sports occurrences that no one can
explain like a Bud Adams team in the Super Bowl, a Northwestern
team in the Rose Bowl or a Buster Douglas upset of Mike Tyson, no
one can dismiss two Tour de France titles in a row. Not this time
when Armstrong had to fight off the charges of previous winners
Marco Pantani and Jan Ullrich and other former world champions such
as Lauren Jalabert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance Armstrong's achievements in the Tour de France are
inspiring,'' said computer company mogul Michael Dell, who knows
something about hard drive, ``and reflect his phenomenal drive for
success.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does Lance go from here besides Jay Leno's couch? Does
he set his sights on three Tour de France victories or four or take
aim at the five titles of Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault, Eddy
Merckx and Miguel Indurain? Does he retire at the top of his game
and raise his family? Has he had his fill of this torturous
profession in conditions tantamount to running marathons, what,
every third day for three weeks?
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has already shown he's the Tiger Woods of cycling, the
Mark McGwire of the mountains. No cyclist has the raw power he
packs on a lithe, 5-foot-11-inch, 160-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   While other riders, Pantani among them, dropped by the wayside,
victim of injury or illness, Armstrong only got stronger. Few have
the fiery resolve of this unquestionably supremely conditioned
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   _ `I wish he'd have weighed 270 pounds because I would have
liked to have had him on a goal-line stand. He's got a heart, man.
He's a one-man team.' _ Darrell Royal, former Texas football coach
</P>
<P>
   Sterkel thinks of Armstrong's accomplishment and shakes her head
in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   She can identify with Armstrong better than most. Her father,
Jim Sterkel, a former basketball player at Southern California,
fought lymphoma for five years and once was considered cancer-free
before succumbing to the disease at age 63 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my dad at the bottom of the bottom,'' Sterkel said.
``It's a sight I'll never forget. It must have been the same for
Lance. He was basically a goner. But Lance has that inner drive,
and if you add the fuel, no one can beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years riding, no one has.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lance Armstrong has the look of a champion. The
look of a man so possessed of dream, so obsessed with what it is he
wants to accomplish, that the heart ignores fatigue and exhaustion
and wills the body to push itself beyond the normal bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Had she not known the undeniable outcome of the Tour de France,
a grueling, three-week endurance contest, Jill Sterkel still would
have recognized the fierce, unrelenting spirit that pushed
Armstrong to ride down the Champs-Elysees as champion once more.
</P>
<P>
   Those pale blue eyes tell it all. Sterkel, a four-time Olympic
swimmer and gold medalist, sees the embodiment of that unparalleled
inner drive in Armstrong's steely gaze that never has wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who's been at the bottom of life,'' said Sterkel,
the current University of Texas women's swimming coach who won two
gold and two bronze medals in Olympics spanning 12 years. ``You can
see the determination and the focus in his eyes. I wish I could
suck it out of him and put it in some other people. He's figured it
out. If you want to be great, look at Lance Armstrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than half of the 21-stage event, the other riders were
looking at him _ from behind.
</P>
<P>
   In wiping away the field as he did under the most severe
conditions imaginable, where the mountain descents are every bit as
dangerous as the climbs, Armstrong established himself as one of
the elite athletes in American sports history. In addition, he
reaffirmed himself in the pantheon of Austin heroes such as Ricky
Williams, Darrell Royal, Ben Crenshaw and Jody Conradt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance is such a compelling story, it's captivated all of us,''
said Conradt, the Hall of Fame University of Texas women's
basketball coach who has kept tabs on Armstrong's progress while
recruiting at Amateur Athletic Union tournaments in Tennessee. ``In
Austin, having experienced the support for women's sports, we know
it's a city that embraces some non-traditional sports. Of course,
you have to be No. 1 or better.''
</P>

   ANIMATION-DECLINE (Phoenix) _ It may not be dead, but some are
wondering whether animation's pulse _ at least the traditional,
two-dimensional variety made by anyone other than Disney _ might be
fading, perhaps signaling an end to a costly, five-year cycle that
saw several major movie studios build their own traditional
animation divisions in an attempt to steal a bit of Disney's

   AZERBAIJAN-REFUGEES (Aghjabedi, Azerbaijan) _ A population of 1
million refugees who fled the invasion by neighboring Armenia into
Azerbaijan's mountainous enclave of Nagorno Karabakh in 1992 is
scattered throughout 40 or more camps in this former Soviet
republic where promised oil riches have yet to materialize and per
capita income is less than $2,000 a year. Long after the fighting
stopped, the refugees remain victims of a little-noticed war,
forgotten by the outside world, insufficiently cared for by their
government and on the verge of abandonment by international aid
organizations. They live without running water, electricity or
medical care in railroad cars, tents, temporary prefabricated
houses and holes in the ground, surviving on a few dollars a month,
on handouts and heartache. By Douglas Frantz.

   IRELAND-GAELIC (Ballinahown, Ireland) _ Ireland recently has

the tongue of the poor and uneducated _ those from the ``back of
beyond.'' The lilting language is coming to represent the
self-confidence of a country finally enjoying economic and cultural
prosperity. Gaelic, it seems, has become chic. BY Dan Barry.

   MEDICARE-POLITICS (Washington) _ Republicans warn of the dangers
of a big, ``one-size fits-all'' prescription drug program for the
elderly, run by the heavy hand of government bureaucrats. Democrats
rail against the prospect of elderly Americans at the mercy of
profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, and scoff at Republican
efforts to provide drug coverage through the private sector. For
months now, pollsters and strategists in both parties have been
testing and honing these arguments. But as the recent drug bill
passed by House Republicans underscored, all the positioning comes
down to an old philosophical division between the parties, many
analysts say: How big a role should the government play in

 &HT;    G8 SUMMIT PLEDGES ON THIRD WORLD LEAVE SOME COLD
 &HT;    500&AMP;add. Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington
categories.
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ The leaders of the eight largest industrialized
democracies ended their annual summit Sunday with a pledge to help
close the gap between the developing and the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   After the eight heads of state attended two and half days of
meetings, dinners and cultural performances in this resort area of
semi-tropical Okinawa, they issued a 15-page communique covering
everything from aging to nuclear safety to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But their plans for bridging the global divide in education,
health and technology, seen by some as a response to the growing
backlash against globalization, were criticized by groups observing
the summit as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the leaders called for another round of world trade
talks by the end of the year, following the World Trade
Organization's failure in Seattle last December to complete its
agenda, their communique acknowledged potential negative
consequences of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world of ever-intensifying globalization, whose
challenges are becoming increasingly complex, the G8 must reach
out,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-page final communique by the G8 countries _ the United
States, Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia _
contained a number of pledges along that line. The leaders said
they would work to achieve:
</P>
<P>
   _ A reduction in the debt burden of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal primary education for all the world's children by
2015 and gender equality in schools by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   _ A one-quarter reduction by the year 2010 in the number of
young people infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>

 &HT;    G8 SUMMIT PLEDGES ON THIRD WORLD LEAVE SOME COLD
 &HT;    500&AMP;add. Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ The leaders of the eight largest industrialized
democracies ended their annual summit Sunday with a pledge to help
close the gap between the developing and the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   After the eight heads of state attended two and half days of
meetings, dinners and cultural performances in this resort area of
semi-tropical Okinawa, they issued a 15-page communique covering
everything from aging to nuclear safety to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But their plans for bridging the global divide in education,
health and technology, seen by some as a response to the growing
backlash against globalization, were criticized by groups observing
the summit as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the leaders called for another round of world trade
talks by the end of the year, following the World Trade
Organization's failure in Seattle last December to complete its
agenda, their communique acknowledged potential negative
consequences of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world of ever-intensifying globalization, whose
challenges are becoming increasingly complex, the G8 must reach
out,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-page final communique by the G8 countries _ the United
States, Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia _
contained a number of pledges along that line. The leaders said
they would work to achieve:
</P>
<P>
   _ A reduction in the debt burden of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Universal primary education for all the world's children by
2015 and gender equality in schools by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   _ A one-quarter reduction by the year 2010 in the number of
young people infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased access to computer technology. The G8 created at
Digital Opportunity Task Force, or ``Dot Force,'' to bridge the
digital divide between rich and poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   While G8 leaders hailed the success of their summit, many
non-governmental organizations said they were disappointed by the
package of initiatives announced in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   The group Jubilee 2000, saying the G8 has made little progress
in meeting its year-old promise of canceling up to $100 billion in
Third World debt, called it a ``squandered summit.''
</P>
<P>
   The $750 million spent by Japan to host the Okinawa event and
two earlier ministerial meetings could have canceled the debt of
nine poor countries, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders ``just repeated the promises from a year ago,'' she
said. ``Why should they keep them this year?''
</P>
<P>
   This was the last G8 summit for President Clinton, who left
immediately after the final session to return to the Camp David
negotiations on Middle East peace, and G8 leaders were not above a
little sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night all the leaders of the G8 spoke not just of our
immense affection for President Clinton, personally, but of our
real admiration for his strength and his leadership over these past
few years,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain told reporters.
``We're all going to miss him very greatly indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   To make his prompt departure possible, Clinton moved up his
scheduled address to U.S. military personnel on Okinawa. But his
comments at that event and others did not satisfy local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival was preceded by a protest of tens of thousands
of people forming a human chain around the Kadena air base, the
largest in Asia, to register their unhappiness with the huge U.S.
military presence on the island. Tensions were exacerbated earlier
this month when a drunken U.S. marine entered a local home and
allegedly molested a teenage girl.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said several times, to both Japanese and American
audiences, that America is trying to be a good neighbor in Okinawa
and to reduce the burden to the Okinawan people by consolidating
its bases.
</P>
<P>
   But in comments to reporters Sunday morning, Clinton added: ``We
have not yet reached the time, in my judgment, when the Japan-U.S.
security partnership requires no presence of the United States
forces in northern Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Okinawans were deeply dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left only anger here,'' said Akira Kato, a local anti-base
activist. ``There was no apology, no explanation, of that terrible
incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Kato said Okinawans were also angry because Clinton made no new
commitments on reducing the U.S. bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He referred to reducing the footprint here, but I (have) heard
the same thing many times,'' he said.

   AZERBAIJAN-REFUGEES (Aghjabedi, Azerbaijan) _ A population of 1
million refugees who fled the invasion by neighboring Armenia into
Azerbaijan's mountainous enclave of Nagorno Karabakh in 1992 is
scattered throughout 40 or more camps in this former Soviet
republic where promised oil riches have yet to materialize and per
capita income is less than $2,000 a year. Long after the fighting
stopped, the refugees remain victims of a little-noticed war,
forgotten by the outside world, insufficiently cared for by their
government and on the verge of abandonment by international aid
organizations. They live without running water, electricity or
medical care in railroad cars, tents, temporary prefabricated
houses and holes in the ground, surviving on a few dollars a month,

profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, and scoff at Republican
efforts to provide drug coverage through the private sector. For
months now, pollsters and strategists in both parties have been
testing and honing these arguments. But as the recent drug bill
passed by House Republicans underscored, all the positioning comes
down to an old philosophical division between the parties: How big
a role should the government play in providing health care? By

BRIEF NEWS ITEMS ABOUT THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Bylines at end of briefs) c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   APPLE AND MICROSOFT TOGETHER AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   It may not be ``Sex and the City,'' but relationships in the
computer industry often run from frosty to passionate awfully
quickly. Just look at that old yin-yang pair, Apple and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft antitrust case, the longtime adversaries traded
charges once more, depicting even their apparent armistice in 1997
as a kind of corporate hostage deal. Apple testified that Microsoft
threatened to stop development of its popular Office suite for the
Macintosh, unless Apple agreed to distribute Microsoft's browser.
Microsoft replied that Apple was blackmailing it with a
long-running patent dispute and paid it $150 million to stop the
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But last week at the Macworld exhibition in New York, Microsoft
and Apple were again the best of friends. ``Our relationship with
Microsoft has been getting better and better,'' Steven Jobs,
Apple's co-founder and chief executive, told the assembled
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, Microsoft executives trooped to the stage with good
news for Mac users. Microsoft announced its new and improved Office
2001 for the Mac. A new look, new packaging and a raft of new
features developed ``only for the Mac,'' as Kevin Browne, a
Microsoft executive, put it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Next up came Ed Fries, vice president of Microsoft's games
division, who said the company planned to bring popular Microsoft
games like the ``Age of Empires'' series and ``Flight Simulator''
to the Mac in an alliance with a new company, headed by Peter
Tamte, a former senior Apple executive and a former senior
executive at Bungie Software.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Microsoft acquired Bungie, a company with deep Mac
roots. The purchase, Fries explained, prompted Microsoft to revisit
its approach in games, publishing most of its games for the Mac as
well as for machines running Microsoft's Windows operating system.
``We didn't want to exclude some people,'' he said, ``just because
they chose a certain platform,'' meaning the Mac instead of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   As they left the stage, Jobs warmly thanked the Microsoft
executives. ``Microsoft has done a great job for us,'' he said.
``Who would have thunk it a few years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   _ STEVE LOHR
</P>
<P>
   MAKING MONEY VS. DOING GOOD?
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley entrepreneurs fall into two categories, John
Doerr, the Valley's most prominent venture capitalist, told a group
of Internet executives last week. There are the missionaries, he
said, and there are the mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missionaries obsess on the customer,'' explained Doerr, a
partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers. By way of an example,
he offered Jeff Bezos, the somewhat embattled chief executive of
Amazon.com, a Kleiner investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercenaries,'' he continued, ``obsess on compensation.'' His
example was an executive who has founded several Kleiner-backed
companies, Jim Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, in fact, had just an hour earlier astounded the 800
executives at the $4,200-a-head Internet Summit sponsored by The
Industry Standard magazine by saying he opposed the government's
plan to break Microsoft up. Clark, of course, is the founder of
Netscape Communications, who played a role in convincing the
Justice Department to bring the antitrust suit in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But since Microsoft had won the browser software war, Clark told
the audience, he had purchased 1 million shares in the company.
``Since I own the stock,'' he said, ``I'd rather see Microsoft stay
together.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clark did not tell the audience is where he got the money
to buy the Microsoft shares: Earlier this year, he sold the entire
stash of America Online shares that he had received when that
company bought Netscape last year. AOL's subsequent deal to buy
Time Warner turned him off, he explained in an interview. He argues
that that content producers, like magazines and cable networks,
should be separate from distribution systems like AOL's online
service.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the AOL stock proceeds, he said, are still in cash. But
in addition to Microsoft, Clark said, he has also bought a big
stake in Amazon. Still, it is not clear that Clark is as enamored
as Doerr with companies run by missionaries. ``So far I've lost $40
million on Amazon,'' he said.

<P>
   Gazing out at the nearly 7,000 software developers assembled in
Orlando, Fla., two weeks ago, Bill Gates recalled how much things
had changed since his company, Microsoft, was founded in 1975. Back
then, he said, there were fewer people in the software industry
than had gathered that morning in the cavernous convention center.
``It was a tiny, tiny business,'' recalled Gates, Microsoft's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Software, to be sure, is a big business today. But in many ways,
it once again has the up-for-grabs feel of the early days of the
personal computer industry, before Microsoft became the dominant
force. And that is why big companies like Microsoft, IBM, Oracle
and Sun Microsystems are spending so much time, energy and money
these days trying to woo outside programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be in demand, and in a satisfying profession that
has turned out to be fairly lucrative,'' observed Basim Kadhim, a
29-year-old programmer who telecommutes from Bend, Ore., to Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate campaigns are a sign that the industry is entering
``a disruptive new era of opportunity in software,'' according to
Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a technology research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity lies in building all the software needed to make
the promise of Internet commerce a reality. So far, e-commerce is
in its infancy, rarely going beyond browsing the Web and executing
some rudimentary transaction, like buying books online or ordering
office supplies on an in-house corporate Web site. And the
information is still typed by hand on a computer keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   But for software developers like Kadhim, the goal is to help
build a far smarter Internet, where most exchanges of information
would be automated. Before long, for example, information from the
purchasing department of a carmaker might be shuttled automatically
to and from the accounting department of a parts supplier. Most
steps in a transaction would be computer-to-computer communication,
eliminating mounds of paperwork and hours of human toil.
</P>
<P>
   Or a person's cell phone or Palm-like device might be able to
automatically match his calendar with the doctor's schedule,
suggesting times for a check-up. Thousands of similar labor-saving
uses will add up to the next generation of e-commerce, representing
the real payoff from the Internet _ both in terms of personal
convenience and economic productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Software will make it happen. And most of the work will be done
not by engineers at the big software houses like Microsoft, IBM and
Oracle, but by the 80 percent of programmers who labor, often in
relative obscurity, at old-line companies, Web site contractors,
computer consultants and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Such programmers are in demand because they are the ones who
write all the handcrafted software programs that keep the nation's
computer-dependent economy running. And many thousands of them now
face the task of bringing brick-and-mortar businesses into the
future. They are the bricklayers of the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   This army of behind-the-scenes programmers will largely
determine who the big software winners will be in this, the
Internet era of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, companies like Microsoft, IBM, Sun, Oracle, BEA,
Hewlett-Packard and others are scrambling to establish their
software tools and technology as ``platforms,'' or environments, in
which large numbers of programmers will want to develop software
applications for the Web. The stakes are high. The market for such
e-commerce platform software, according to some analysts'
projections, could grow to as much as $100 billion over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects any single supplier to become as powerful as
Microsoft has been in personal computing, because Internet
computing is such a diverse milieu, with many of the key technology
standards in the public domain. But the PC era proved the
importance of attracting developers. Today, many technologists
still believe Apple's Macintosh and IBM's OS/2 were better
operating systems than Microsoft's Windows. But Microsoft lured far
more developers to write applications for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``A platform is an ecosystem,'' noted Charles Fitzgerald,
director of business development in the developer division at
Microsoft. ``And there are a few thousand people at Microsoft whose
job it is to help developers.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft plans to spend $2 billion over the next three years on
the tools and training to help software developers build Web
applications using Microsoft technology. IBM also puts a $2 billion
price tag on its three-year Internet software initiative intended
to lure developers to its camp. Other companies are also spending
heavily to win over developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software developers are a hot commodity today, and they
increasingly drive platform decisions within companies,'' explained
Valerie Olague, who is leading the IBM program. ``We can only be
successful if we attract developers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the developers seem beyond the reach of conventional
salesmanship. They are the kind of people who cultivate deep
intellectual interests in particular fields like Japanese animation
and science fiction, according to research done for IBM by
Renegade, a marketing firm. They share the mindset that drives a
person to stay up all night to solve the puzzle of a few buggy
lines of programming code.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, at industry events, developers want to do more than
drink and dance. So IBM is sponsoring gatherings in cities
including New York, Seattle and San Francisco, which feature talks
by renowned Internet programmers and team coding contests with
hand-held computers as prizes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no hard sell. The goal is primarily to prompt the
developers to go to IBM's Web site, because increasingly, company
Web sites and specialist sites like Slashdot (``News for Nerds'')
are where developers hang out, exchange tips and download software
to try out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Developers seem most impressed by the simple beauty of code that
works. At the Microsoft Developers Conference in Orlando recently,
the crowd yawned when Microsoft executives talked of the company's
Internet vision. They clapped politely for the slick videos and
chuckled at the early-morning warm-up routine of the comedian
Richard Jeni, who began, ``I couldn't be more excited to be here if
I knew what you guys did for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rousing applause came for a string of programming code,
written partly in the hot new Internet standard, XML _ for
Extensible Markup Language _ that was projected onto giant blue
screens and performed precisely as it was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Software programming is problem solving, and developers tend to
gravitate to the technology that is the most useful for the task at
hand. The young developer from Oregon, Kadhim, speaks of the appeal
of software as a kind of infinitely malleable medium for technical
artistry. ``You get a rush when you build something and make it
work,'' he said. ``It's like cracking a puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadhim has a Ph.D. in computer science, and he is fluent in
programming languages including Basic, Cobol, C, C++, Java and
Linux. He calls himself a ``Linux lover,'' referring to a version
of the Unix operating system that is distributed free over the
Internet and is regarded as a threat to Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in January, Kadhim joined Fujitsu Software, which makes
specialized software tools for Cobol programmers. And he was in
Orlando at the Microsoft conference, demonstrating how some of
Microsoft's new technology can bring applications written in Cobol,
a 40-year-old programming language still widely used in business,
onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this because it's a challenging software engineering
problem _ how do you bring so much of the old world into the
future?'' he said. ``So far, most of the Web development amounts to
toy applications, interesting but not yet hooked to the core of our
economy. And Cobol, whether you like it or not, is at the heart of
our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Elaine Power manages a group of two dozen
programmers at Organic, a Web site builder and consultant. Power,
36, got a taste for computers as a teen-ager in Britain when she
wrote a program in BASIC, a simple programming language, that sent
a digital ball bouncing around the screen of her brother's personal
computer. The fascination was enough to prompt her to major in
computer science in college and eventually learn computer languages
ranging from Fortran to Java.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young engineers she works with today program in
Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun
Microsystems. They see it as the programming language of the
moment, and a skill of the future. ``Programmers can be very
religious about their platform and their tools,'' Power said.
</P>
<P>
   But experienced programmers tend to value flexibility rather
than religion because the field moves so quickly. In the 1960s,
after all, Cobol was the hot programming language, the skill of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a good programmer is a lot like being a good
carpenter,'' said Tim Howes, chief technology officer of Loudcloud,
a start-up founded by Howes and three other former executives of
Netscape, the Internet pioneer. ``You should have a breadth of
knowledge and know when to use the appropriate tool _ when to use
your hammer, your saw and your screwdriver.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, many companies are using a variety of tools when building
Web applications rather than becoming overly dependent on any
single technology supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a group of longtime Silicon Valley software
developers founded Liquidprice, a reverse-auction Web service,
which allows electronics retailers and auto dealers to bid for the
business of individual consumers on the basis of where they live
and what products they want. To run the service, Liquidprice, based
in Cupertino, Calif., deploys a smorgasbord of software _ Oracle
for the database, Microsoft for its Web servers, Java as its main
programming language, and IBM's Websphere as the development
environment for its specialized Web applications.
</P>
<P>
   At each tier, says Piyush Gupta, the president and co-founder,
the company has insured that it can quickly switch to other
suppliers. The trickiest one to abandon would presumably be its Web
development software, Websphere. Still, it is a tentative win
indeed for IBM in the emerging market for Web development software.
Liquidprice engineers have written a thin layer of code intended to
isolate the company's in-house applications from the IBM software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day Websphere doesn't satisfy me, we'll switch,'' Gupta
said. ``For the smart developers, the world of being locked in to
any one software vendor is over.''

ALL THE IRANIAN NEWS, ALL THE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By JORDAN RAPHAEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years after fleeing his native Iran for the United
States, Sassan Kamali is a full-time television newsman once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a born-again journalist,'' Kamali said.
</P>
<P>
   A TV personality in Iran before the 1979 Islamic revolution,
Kamali now produces and anchors a daily newsmagazine on National
Iranian Television, or NITV, a 24-hour satellite television station
that began full-scale broadcasts last month out of a North
Hollywood, Calif., warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   NITV, which features Farsi-language news, lifestyle and cultural
programming, is among several Iranian-American TV stations based in
Los Angeles, where there are an estimated 600,000 Iranians, but it
is the first to broadcast to a worldwide audience. Programming runs
on a 12-hour cycle; the broadcast is repeated during daytime hours
in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day begins with a morning talk show in which a
man-woman anchor team reads news reports and interviews guests in
the style of ``Good Morning America.'' Last Thursday morning, the
hosts bantered about the heat wave in the United States, an Iranian
gymnast and an Arab sheik with more than 1,000 wives. The 10 a.m.
news program reported on President Clinton's trip to Japan and the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The station's offerings also
include international sports, Iranian- and French-language music
videos, cooking shows and classic Iranian movies.
</P>
<P>
   NITV's founder, Zia Atabay, says the station's purpose is to
culturally unite Iranian expatriates in the United States, Canada,
Europe, Australia and elsewhere. Its other goal is to show Iranians
what life is like in America.
</P>
<P>
   Atabay, a popular Iranian singer who left Iran after the
revolution and has lived in Los Angeles since 1987, said he was
particularly interested in reaching young people in his homeland,
because ``the young generation there wants to be free.'' He added,
``Young people ask us to go out with a camera and show them what
America is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Atabay is quick to point out, however, that NITV does not have a
political agenda. ``We cannot take a political side because of our
journalistic mission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The station's shows do address issues like religion, freedom and
culture clash, which, Atabay admitted, are inherently political.
``We are not going to say who or what to support, but we are going
to promote change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially prominent are messages about liberated women. There
are no chadors to be seen anywhere: Female news anchors,
correspondents and singers all fully reveal their faces, and in
some cases, much more. ``We want to show the people that there is
nothing wrong with what you wear,'' Atabay said, gesturing toward a
music video in which an Iranian pop star, Noush Afarin, wearing a
miniskirt and a shirt that left her midriff bare, was dancing.
``Here, Iranian women show the belly.''
</P>
<P>
   NITV is a modest operation, run by a skeleton crew of 35
producers, writers, on-air personnel and camera operators.
Additional programming is purchased from independent production
companies. In-house shows are filmed in a single cramped studio
containing three sets, which can be converted from program to
program in under five minutes. Engineers edit and manage live
broadcasts from a control room the size of a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Atabay and his wife, Parvin, who also own a surgery center in
the Los Angeles suburb of Encino, provide the station's $250,000
monthly budget. They hope to recoup the money through subscription
fees, advertising sales and program sponsorships. Already, the
station has attracted a few advertisers, including Porsche and
Sharp Electronics Corp., according to Atabay.
</P>
<P>
   NITV's audience is difficult to measure, particularly in Iran,
where most viewers use illegal satellite dishes. But the volume of
feedback has been tremendous, Kamali said, holding a congratulatory
poem he had just received by fax from Karaj City, west of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The use of illegal satellite receivers in Iran is so widespread
that the government's occasional crackdowns have had little effect,
said Ali Jalali, chief of Voice of America's Farsi Service, which
broadcasts a weekly one-hour TV program to Iran. ``It's grown
beyond the capacity of the government to control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jahanshah Javid, publisher of Iranian.com, a Web site for
expatriate Iranians, said that even though Iran's local stations
had loosened up in recent years, Iranians still prefer to watch
foreign channels via satellite. ``There is a huge untapped audience
there, and for years no one has been able to exploit it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this stage, I don't think the quality of NITV is going to
matter, because they'll watch almost anything that comes from Los
Angeles,'' Javid added, noting that for most Iranians, Los Angeles
typifies American culture. ``But in the long run, the station will
have to prove itself with good programming.''
</P>
<P>
   During his show, Kamali encourages viewers to send in reports
about Iranian communities around the world. He also culls
Iranian-themed news items _ for example, about an Iranian-American
student earning academic honors _ from American publications.
Recently, Kamali reintroduced Iranians to Art Buchwald, whose
column has been absent from Iran's newspapers since the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is glad to be on the air regularly again, Kamali,
who spent the last 14 years working as a finance adviser and
computer programmer, said he dreams of one day returning to his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to live in Iran again if I can be free as I am
here,'' he said.

SOME NETWORKS WEIGH CHANGES IN CONTESTANT SELECTION FOR `REALITY'
SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Network programming executives for CBS and
Fox, expressing concern about the risks of putting contestants with
uncertain backgrounds on prime-time television ``reality'' shows,
said they were considering changes in the selection process for
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, which has
broadcast the two most talked-about reality shows this summer,
``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother,'' said at a news conference that
his network, which employed two private investigation firms to vet
participants in the shows, would ``re-examine'' the process.
Contestants were selected for the shows after volunteering and then
being interviewed. Moonves said he would hesitate before again
using the firm that investigated contestants on ``Big Brother.'' He
declined to name the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' which isolates 10 strangers in a house full of
cameras, was criticized after one of its participants was revealed
to have connections to the black leader Khalid Abdul Muhammad, who
has expressed anti-Semitic views in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate news conference here before reporters covering the
television industry, Sandy Grushow, the chairman of entertainment
for the Fox network, said he had hired the firm of Price Waterhouse
Cooper to provide ``risk management'' assessment for reality shows
Fox was developing.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had its own problems earlier this year with ``Who Wants to
Marry a Millionaire?'' in which women competed for the chance to
meet a man they had never met, after revelations that the groom,
Rick Rockwell, had once been the subject of a judge's temporary
restraining order issued at the request of Rockwell's former
fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has deals for at least three reality shows in the next year.
One, ``Wanted,'' will send a team of contestants around the country
trying to accomplish certain tasks before they are captured by a
team of bounty hunters. Another, ``Million Dollar Mysteries,'' will
offer cash to viewers who are able to crack long-unsolved criminal
cases. The third, ``Boot Camp,'' will put contestants through the
rigors of military-style training for a chance to win a big cash
prize.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS and Fox executives both acknowledged that the reality
shows carried risks. Moonves defended CBS's decision to broadcast
its reality shows this summer, citing strong ratings, as well as
the attention they have brought to the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are writing about CBS who never wrote about us
before,'' he said. ``But right now we're on a high wire without a
net. It's very scary. It's very exciting.'' He added that he was
proud of ``Big Brother'' and saw no reason to apologize for
anything that has been on the show, including revelations that one
participant's marriage was deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be held responsible,'' Moonves said. ``People are
going into these things out of their own free will.'' He called
``Big Brother'' an experiment and a ``work in progress,'' but he
did not rule out producing another ``Big Brother'' series during
the next television season.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said the reality shows had been extremely important
financially to CBS because they had attracted the younger viewers
that advertisers pay a premium to reach. He noted that on Aug. 23
CBS will devote its entire three hours of prime time to the finale
of ``Survivor,'' the program that has chronicled the efforts of 16
people on a tropical island to survive a Darwinian game of
attrition. The show, expanded from its usual hour to two hours that
evening, will be followed by a one-hour panel discussion show.
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers will pay as much as $600,000 for a 30-second
commercial in the finale. ``That's unheard of at CBS,'' Moonves
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the reality shows have flourished at CBS this summer, and
ABC and Fox have announced plans for other shows in the genre, NBC
still has not announced the acquisition of any reality shows. NBC's
program executives conceded last week that they had hurt their
ratings position by being slow to recognize the reality programming
trend. Moonves said, ``If we didn't have these shows on the air we
would have been criticized for not having summer programming.''
Still, Grushow, at Fox, said the popularity of the shows was
forcing programmers into a choice between risk and ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're paralyzed if you're unwilling to assume some risk, and
you're a fool if you say risk be damned,'' Grushow said. ``I think
we are all trying to balance two impulses: the desire and need to
win, based on obvious corporate pressures, and trying to do it with
some honor and some integrity and some dignity. When you're looking
at reality programming, boy, never have those two impulses collided
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said CBS had turned down additional reality shows
offered to the network. But CBS does plan to capitalize as soon as
possible on the spectacular success of ``Survivor,'' which has set
ratings records this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves announced that a second 13-week run of ``Survivor,''
this time isolating contestants somewhere in the Australian
outback, will start its run on a Sunday night January, immediately
following the broadcast of the Super Bowl.

STEPHEN KING BREAKS NEW GROUND IN INTERNET PUBLISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the horror writer Stephen King leading a revolution in the
way books are published, or just exploring the power of celebrity
in the Digital Age?
</P>
<P>
   His latest thriller, entitled ``The Plant,'' describes a vicious
vine that terrorizes a small publishing house, extorting human
sacrifices. To some in the book business, the image is apt, because
with ``The Plant'' King plans to become on Monday the first major
author to self-publish on the Internet. He will offer the new book
to fans in electronic installments available for downloading from
his site, www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   The launch has touched off a debate over whether the Web can
liberate authors from their dependence on publishers, or just make
it easier for truly famous people to rally their fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Plant'' may not make history with literary critics, but
King, who is fast becoming the public face of electronic
publishing, feels he stands at a crossroads in the history of
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sense of being in a place and time where I might
actually make a difference in how people view the Web,'' he said in
an interview. ``There is a possibility of opening up an area of
publishing that won't be touched by the major publishers _ not
necessarily for John Grisham or Tom Clancy, because they don't need
to do this, but this might be a way for a lot of other writers to
publish.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he hopes to advance the cause of online publishing by
whetting readers' appetite for electronic books. ``If you develop a
taste for anchovies on pizza _ that's me, the pizza _ then you
might start looking around for other foods with anchovies,'' he
says, referring to other digital works.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers and authors will be watching closely. In March, King
shocked the major publishers into jump-starting their digital book
efforts when, at his behest, Simon &AMP; Schuster published his novella
``Riding the Bullet'' in electronic form. More than 400,000 eager
fans logged on to download it as soon as it debuted.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, all the major publishers have beefed up their output
of electronic books, from distributing texts over the Internet to
setting up print-on-demand service for low-selling titles.
</P>
<P>
   King's decision to publish himself comes as a disappointment to
Simon &AMP; Schuster. King is one of the industry's best-selling
authors, and to win the right to publish his novels, the house
agreed to an unprecedented profit-sharing partnership with King
instead of the traditional royalty-advance contract. But Jack
Romanos, Simon &AMP; Schuster's president and chief operating officer,
said the house supported his new venture, and even offered to help.
``At Simon &AMP; Schuster, Stephen King rules, to borrow from the MTV
lingo,'' he said. ``Because he rules, he frequently can make the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   King is not the only author to toy with self-publishing over the
Web. Authors frequently grouse about their conventional publishers,
usually bemoaning the quality of the editing, the amount of
publicity, or the size of their paychecks. Some authors now hire
their own editors and publicists. Plenty of companies already offer
the rest of the services publishers provide _ from book design to
printing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But even for authors who did not need advances, a publisher's
marketing and publicity clout were always irreplaceable, especially
in winning over booksellers. Now some say the advent of the Web may
change that.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Seth Godin, a former Yahoo marketing executive and a
former Simon &AMP; Schuster author, self-published his book,
``Unleashing the Idea Virus'' after turning down an advance. He
persuaded the online booksellers BarnesandNoble.com and Amazon.com
to distribute electronic editions for free to anyone who cared to
download it, and reaped a bonanza of publicity from the stunt.
</P>
<P>
   The pass-around dynamic of Web publishing will create demand the
way radio generates demand for new songs, he says, and he hopes
people will buy the physical books as ``souvenirs of the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of selling the rights to a publisher, he paid a book
packager $40,000 to edit his manuscript and turn it into a
hardcover book for release in September. He will pay about $4 a
copy for printing and distribution to the two biggest online
bookstores, and keep the remainder of the sales revenue for
himself. He plans to sell hardcover copies for the unusually high
wholesale price of about $20, which means he will earn about $16 a
copy and cover his initial costs after selling roughly 3,000
copies. His previous book sold 100,000 copies in hardcover at a
typical wholesale price of about $12, earning him about $300,000 in
royalties.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``This model is significantly more profitable for an author,''
Godin said, which, he believes, is bad news for publishers. On one
hand, ``slush pile'' authors who haven't yet published will offer
their work online because it is cheap and easy. On the other hand,
successful authors with enough fame, prestige or gimmickry to
market their own books will find online self-publishing more
lucrative than receiving royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that is left for publishers is the authors in the unwashed
middle, which is the least profitable part of publishing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon &AMP; Schuster's Romanos predicted that few other authors
would follow King's lead. ``The average writer is really more
interested in writing than the transaction part of the process,''
he said. What's more, he says, big publishers' economies of scale
allow them to do business more cheaply and effectively than authors
could by paying editors, printers and everyone else. Publishers
often pass along much of the savings to their marquee authors, as
in Simon &AMP; Schuster's profit-sharing deal with King.
</P>
<P>
   David Card, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, says King's
self-publication resembles the efforts of other celebrities to talk
or sell directly to their fans, as musicians like Prince and
Courtney Love have done on their Web sites. O.J. Simpson is
starting a Web site where he will sell memorabilia and, for a fee,
he will answer questions from the public. Still, Card says, most
writers' and performers' time is better spent doing what made them
famous.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most innovative aspect of King's plans for ``The
Plant'' is his novel honor-system payment plan. King is trusting
his readers to send him a dollar after each download, instead of
requiring them to pay beforehand as Simon &AMP; Schuster did to sell
his previous electronic book. ``No stealing from the blind
newsboy!'' he admonishes on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage payment, King has his own security device:
suspense. If he does not receive payments for at least 75 percent
of the downloads, he says, he will stop writing after two chapters,
and readers won't learn the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't pay me, I will put my guitar over my shoulder and
head on down the road,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers have already posted on his Web site offers to pay
much more than a dollar a chapter in order to see him finish the
work. If he asked, he says, many of his die-hard fans would mail
him money even if there wasn't a new book.
</P>
<P>
   King says ``The Plant'' may extend for nearly 10 installments.
``Theoretically, I could make a fortune,'' he says, noting that he
made $130,000 from his last electronic book for a story that might
have earned him $15,000 from a magazine. But he insists that isn't
his motive. Amazon.com eagerly signed on to collect payments from
readers for him.
</P>
<P>
   James Gleick, a science writer who considered and rejected the
idea of self-publishing over the Internet, says the pay-later plan
is the most promising aspect of King's latest publication. ``You
want to take advantage of the ability of online stuff to spread
around _ you want people to be able to pass your book around and
e-mail it to their friends,'' he says. The honor system may not be
widely practicable, but publishers and encryption companies are
working on technology to let consumers read some of a book first
and then pay to finish and keep it.
</P>
<P>
   King hastens to say that he has nothing against traditional
publishers. He even intends to publish a paper version of ``The
Plant'' with Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   But his Web site might spook some in the business. ``My friends,
we have a chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare,''
writes King.
</P>
<P>
   And he is an expert in nightmares.

 &HT;    Armstrong does it again!By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Lance Armstrong paid close attention to what his fellow
cyclists were saying about his 1999 Tour de France championship.
All winter he read their quotes, which were widely reported in the
European press.
</P>
<P>
   The Austinite read their words in the spring and heard them
repeatedly on television as summer arrived. No one, it seemed, gave
him much respect for what he accomplished last July, when he
completed his comeback from advanced testicular cancer by winning
one of the world's premier sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   According to his fellow competitors, it was more of a fluke than
one of the most amazing sports achievements ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were critical of my performance,'' Armstrong said. ``You
could field a whole team with the people who thought they could win
the Tour after I did it. They all said, `If he can win it, then I
can win it.' Well, they're all here now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely better. This is definitely a vindication.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 128 of the original 180-man field survived the grueling
marathon of 2,270.7 miles over 21 stages in three countries to pass
the finish line in Paris on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Those riders, along with more than an estimated 100,000 fans,
including actors Robin Williams, Michael J. Fox and Eric Idle and
Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, watched Armstrong take his ceremonial
victory stroll Sunday afternoon on the famed cobblestones of the
Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, gaunt and sunburned from three weeks of intense
cycling, was ecstatic as he hoisted his 9-month-old son Luke to his
shoulders after accepting a blue porcelain trophy commemorating his
win. He kissed his wife, Kristin, and waved to the crowd that also
included his mother and approximately 80 fans who made the trip
from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from Austin feel a special attachment to Lance,'' said
Watson, who like Armstrong is a survivor of testicular cancer.
``They feel part of what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong dominated a weak Tour field in 1999. But he repeated
the feat against much stronger competition this year, including
former Tour champions Jan Ullrich and Marco Pantani. On Sunday,
Armstrong became just the 12th man to successfully defend his
championship in the Tour's 87-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the cyclists actually raced Sunday afternoon,
as the riders completed their final 12 laps in downtown Paris under
brilliant skies with balmy temperatures in the mid-70s. The
cyclists, with a joking Armstrong donning a brunette wig, started
at the Eiffel Tower and passed such landmarks as the Arc de
Triomphe and Place de la Concorde. There was a large Texas flag
flying from the nearby Hotel de Crillon. That was a special honor
for Armstrong, considering the ritzy hotel only displays the French
flag or the banners of a sitting head of state staying there.
</P>
<P>
   There were hundreds of smaller U.S. and Texas flags being waved
along the course, especially near the finish line, where officials
from the U.S. Postal Service _ which sponsors Armstrong's cycling
team _ were sitting in the grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is humbling to watch Lance do this,'' said William J.
Henderson, U.S. Postmaster General.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's final stage hardly mattered to most of the riders. To
start the race, members of the Postal Service team rode in back of
the peloton, or main pack of riders, and locked arms to salute the
fans and media. Once the riders started the laps around the Champs
Elysees, a group of sprinters picked up the pace, trying
desperately for one final stage victory.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Stefano Zanini won the stage, with his teammate Fred
Rodriguez, the American pro champion, finishing fourth. Armstrong
casually rode in the back of the pack, content to allow others to
take the limelight. He finished 76th, although he was credited with
the same winning time as Zanini _ 3 hours, 12 minutes and 36
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It took Armstrong 92 hours, 33 minutes and 8 seconds to ride the
2,270 miles. Ullrich, the German-born 1997 Tour champion, was
second, 6:02 behind Armstrong. Ullrich, whom Armstrong described as
the most naturally talented cyclist in the world, has finished
second in the Tour three times. Meanwhile, Pantani, who won the
Tour in 1998, was one of the 52 riders who quit the Tour before its
finish.
</P>
<P>
   WORLDWIDE ATTENTION
</P>
<P>
   The acting trio of Williams, Fox and Idle rode in one of the
official cars following the riders for all but the final two laps.
The three then joined members of the Lance Armstrong Foundation
staff from Austin in the VIP grandstands. Fox was there with his
wife, actress Tracie Pollan, and children. He said he had been in
Paris on vacation and was set to leave on Sunday but delayed his
trip back to the United States to see Armstrong claim victory. He
met the champion Sunday evening at a private dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just amazing,'' Fox, who has been diagnosed with
Parkinson's disease, said of Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who sported yellow shoes to honor Armstrong, has been
a fan of the cycling champion for several years. He has ridden with
the Tour champion once and plans to make it to Austin to do so
again. He also has donated auction items to Armstrong's Ride for
the Roses charity benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He humbled my butt this year,'' Williams said of riding with
Armstrong. ``This is all such an amazing thing to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Idle, who like Williams is a comedic actor, said he loved
supporting Armstrong's foundation because the initials LAF sound
like ``laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, similar to his performance in 1999, was so dominating
he wore the yellow jersey for the final two weeks of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The field Armstrong beat in 1999 was considered weak. There were
no past Tour champions in it, and only one man _ American Bobby
Julich _ had stood on the podium to commemorate a top-three finish.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's field was considered very strong. In addition to
Pantani and Ullrich, French champion Laurent Jalabert also was back
in the Tour after sitting out 1999. Jalabert, who has won the Tour
of Spain and more than 100 other races, was one of four riders who
wore the yellow jersey this Tour. But he finished 54th, 1:58.47
behind Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   With victory clear, Armstrong found himself answering questions
about whether he was ready to dominate his sport the way past
champions Miguel Indurain, Eddy Merckx, Jacques Anquetil and
Bernard Hinault did by winning five championships. Armstrong also
felt uncomfortable being compared to American Greg LeMond, who won
three championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win two, you don't leave a legacy,'' Armstrong said.
``I'll be back next year, but I don't know how someone wins this
five times.''

Not of people, but of shutters. ``You see how silly the house looks
without them,'' said the College of Charleston English instructor
and self-appointed guardian of the historic district's exterior
window dressings. Though few, if any, are so fretful, Wilkinson
said the shutters are disappearing as well-heeled out of towners

<P>
   Negotiators for striking actors and the advertising industry met
face to face last week for the first time in three months. But the
talks broke down almost immediately _ apparently dashing hopes for
a resolution of the long and bitter labor dispute, which has
battered many small businesses that play a role in the production
of commercials.
</P>
<P>
   From casting directors to talent agencies to editing studios,
companies in Hollywood and New York have watched their business
shrink since 135,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists struck the
advertising industry on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   No one can pinpoint how much the strike has cost, but
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., a quasi-public
organization, estimates that Los Angeles County is losing about $1
million a day.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike producers, who are able to escape the reach of American
pickets by taking their projects to other English-speaking
countries like Canada, Australia and South Africa, many ancillary
businesses are stationary. The association that represents
camera-rental companies figures that business is off by 15 percent.
Other trade groups say things are even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's suffering,'' said Nitza From, a New York editor
and the president of the East Coast branch of the Association of
Independent Commercial Editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been very painful for us,'' said the president of one
postproduction house, who has had to lay off 31 employees out of a
staff of 220. He requested anonymity because he did not want to
publicize his business problems.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Schwartz, the owner of Recording, a company in New York,
said: ``The postproduction industry has been hit very hard. When an
actor doesn't work, that's my messenger, my engineer, the music
guys _ everybody in the chain.'' Schwartz has not had to lay off
any of his 45 employees, but he has required them to use up
vacation time, eliminated overtime, and refrained from replacing
people who retire.
</P>
<P>
   Like other talent agencies that specialize in commercials,
Schiffman, Ekman, Morrison &AMP; Marx is coping by placing actors in
categories not covered by the disputed contract, like personal
appearances and industrial films. But the strike is taking a heavy
toll, said S. Fred Schiffman, the president of the agency.
``Everybody, I understand, has downsized their office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties of the work stoppage even include companies at a
far remove from the central issue that has prolonged the strike:
the compensation structure for actors in television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Berdis &AMP; Co., a commercial production house in Hollywood,
has furloughed five of its 20 employees and imposed a 20 percent
pay cut on everyone else. Nearly all of Berdis' spots are made for
radio, not television, yet his commercial business has declined by
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Berdis signed an interim agreement with AFTRA, but he said the
large advertising agencies were not giving business to companies
covered by these contracts. The advertising industry does not
consider these agreements legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really frustrating is that this stuff has nothing to do
with radio,'' said Berdis, referring to the issues in the strike,
``and yet all of us are being dragged along into this thing. This
makes no sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday, at the request of federal mediators, the
two sides met for brief negotiating sessions. Each angrily blamed
the other for breaking off the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back with absolutely nothing,'' said Paul Reggio, a
strike coordinator for the unions. ``This is really not a good
development. This is going to get ugly now.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Saturday, Ira M. Shepard, a
negotiator for the advertising industry, said the unions had made
no concessions. But he acknowledged that his side had not yielded
any ground either and he characterized the offer on the table as
generous enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're standing by that,'' he said, ``if that does not buy
labor peace, nothing will. There are some people in the union
hanging onto the past. I can't make them drink the water. I can
only bring them to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side has accused the other of intransigence. ``It's like
the Israelis and the Palestinians,'' said Morty Dubin, the chairman
of the New York Production Alliance, an industry group. ``Both have
points and both have dug in their heels.''
</P>
<P>
   And both have engaged in a nasty war of words. The advertisers
have accused the unions of illegally threatening to blackball
nonunion actors who cross their picket lines. Actors have accused
the advertisers of trying to destroy their unions. Producers who
have chosen to film in the Los Angeles or New York area have often
faced interference from picketers. The unions say they have
disrupted numerous shoots, including a campaign spot for Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in the strike is how to pay actors for
performing in commercials. Negotiators for the advertising industry
say they want to eliminate obsolete residual rules from the 1950s,
when only a few channels existed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, most actors get a session fee of $475
a day for their work on the set and a residual each time the spot
is shown on network television. But the industry wants to replace
residuals with a one-time fee for unlimited use during a 13-week
period, the same method used for cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The actors, however, want residuals _ so-called pay-for-play _
to be retained on network television and extended to cable.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say they are holding firm because an important
principle is at stake. ``This is about how to modernize a
contract,'' Shepard said. ``The unions want to live with the way
the industry was in the 1950s. We want to reflect the industry in
the year 2000.'' He said that under the industry's offer, an actor
stood to get $4,000 for a single day's work.
</P>
<P>
   But many actors depend on commercials for a substantial portion
of their income. They accuse the advertising industry of trying to
shortchange them at a time when revenues are at an all-time high.
They say the pay system proposed by the industry would result in
career-threatening overexposure, while failing to compensate them
for the long intervals between jobs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The actors point out that their aggregate pay of about $720
million a year amounts to only about 2 percent of what is spent on
producing the spots and buying the time. Shepard, however, said
that if production costs alone are considered, the actors' fees
represent from 33 percent to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although producers say they are caught in the middle, many blame
the union for forcing them to shoot their commercials in Canada or
overseas. ``It's teaching the clients that there's a much cheaper
way to do this,'' said Marc Smerling, an owner of Notorious
Pictures, a production house in New York. ``Now that the clients
know about this, how do you get them to come back?''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Rose, a vice president of Moxie Pictures, a production
company in Los Angeles and New York, said it does not take long for
producers to establish the relationships needed to work overseas.
``It's hard to go there the first time, and maybe the second
time,'' he said, ``but it's not so hard the third time.'' So many
producers are shooting in Vancouver that local camera crews cannot
keep up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose and other producers said they would much prefer to work
with American actors. ``The members of SAG are probably the most
talented pool of actors on the planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reggio, the union strike coordinator, said the unions should not
be held accountable for the increasing reliance on overseas
locations. ``These claims are really ringing false,'' he said.
``They've been going out of the country long before our contract
expired.''

COMPARING HERSELF TO POPE JOHN PAUL II ON GAYS, DR. LAURA FIGHTS AD
BOYCOTT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative radio host who has been
the target of a nationwide protest by gay groups, has unleashed a
counteroffensive aimed at retaining her advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign by Schlessinger, the second highest rated talk show
host on radio after Rush Limbaugh, came as her syndicator disclosed
just how many sponsors have left the program because of the
protest. Kraig Kitchin, the president and chief operating officer
of Premiere Radio Networks, said the show has lost 12 brands, or
nearly 10 percent, of its national advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on the sponsors began to mount in April, after months
of protests failed to persuade the Paramount Television Group to
back away from plans to produce a new syndicated TV show starring
Schlessinger, who has described homosexuality as ``deviant'' and
derivative of ``biological error.'' The show is to make its debut
Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   In May, one of the first advertisers on the TV program, Procter
&AMP; Gamble, dropped its sponsorship. Radio sponsors began dropping
immediately after that, though Paramount executives said no other
advertisers have abandoned the TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the gravity of the situation, Schlessinger last
week began urging her listeners to start a letter and e-mail
campaign thanking those sponsors who have remained with her radio
show and urged them to buy their products. Schlessinger, who had
previously been relatively passive amid the attacks, also announced
that she will begin making on-air plugs for the sponsors who have
remained with her.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to her listeners, which was posted on her
Web site DrLaura.com, Schlessinger painted her fight as a heated
battle over family values, saying, ``folks who don't share our
beliefs about what's right for children and the family are trying
to disrupt our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a brief telephone interview, she said, ``I think
anybody who has traditional values has been put on notice that if
they express their values, they'll be put under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger's offensive represents her first public attempt to
dam the flow of ad dollars from her radio advice program, which
draws an estimated 18 million listeners weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have severed their ties with Schlessinger include
some of the largest corporations in the nation: Toys ``R'' Us,
United Airlines, AT&AMP;T, Kraft, General Foods and Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Two more advertisers ceased sponsorship of her radio show during
the first two weeks of July. One, SkyTel, the wireless company,
said it was doing so amid an overall retreat from talk radio,
though a spokeswoman could not name any show other than
Schlessinger's for which it was a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Another, the Geico insurance company, said in a statement that
its withdrawal from the program was in direct response to the
controversy, adding, ``Geico is an equal opportunity employer and
does not condone discrimination of any type.''
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com and Natrol _ on whose board Kitchin sits _ as well
as a Web site called Supportkids.com, are among those that have
stuck with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The continued success of the protest campaign against
Schlessinger _ led by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation and a group called Stopdrlaura _ has been notable. The
actions have reflected the growing political and economic power of
gays, who are now exercising the sort of influence on the
entertainment industry that conservative groups have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has said she believes she is being unfairly
targeted, claiming that her statements about gays are being taken
out of context and that she is simply espousing family values. She
has said that while she opposes homosexuality and a ``gay activist
agenda,'' she does not oppose gays.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, during the brief telephone interview, Schlessinger
said she began her countercampaign in response to calls and letters
from listeners asking her how they can help.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger said that she does not believe that her views are
any different than those of Pope John Paul II, who recently stated
that homosexuality goes ``against natural law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see stopthepope.com, do you?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger complained that the campaign against her has
spilled over into her personal life, citing ``personal threats to
me and letters sent to neighbors with no return address telling
them to accost me verbally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a pretty disgusting, relentless attack on my
life, on my career, on my work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the groups were unapologetic about their campaign and said
it would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are letting all advertisers for Dr. Laura know about the
rhetoric,'' said John Aravosis, co-founder of stopdrlaura.com,
which keeps tabs on developments with her radio and television
programs. ``If they think that Dr. Laura is bad for business, it's
their choice _ it's a free country and a free market.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, he would like to see Paramount cease
production of the Dr. Laura show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the television show is suffering much less than the radio
program. Despite heavy pressure on the television stations that
have agreed to show the program _ which is expected to reach 97
percent of the country _ so far none has tried to break their
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   And despite loud complaints even from within its own ranks,
Paramount said it is sticking with the program. In fact, production
started last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchin of Premiere said he was confident that all of the
sponsors would return to the radio show, which he said is still
financially healthy. But that is only if and when the controversy
dies down. ``There are some who have said, `The heat's a little hot
in this kitchen, give us a call when it cools off,''' he said.

 &HT;    Say farewell to Kathie Lee
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The farewell countdown for the Kathie Lee in ``Live
With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee'' has hit the 5-4-3-2-1 sequence and, for
some, either too quickly or not a second too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this morning and continuing through Friday, each
episode will highlight Gifford's 15 years sitting next to Regis
Philbin. The show airs locally from 9 to 10 a.m. daily on WSB.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's finale is a guaranteed tearfest (VCR-Plus code: 54312).
And the celebration isn't stopping there. ABC's ``The View'' claims
it will have ``the first exclusive post-talk show interview,
live,'' beginning at 11 a.m. Friday (51138). Gifford also is
expected to make several other talk show stops before the final
day.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News reports that the show will be
rechristened ``Live With Regis'' starting July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Producer Michael Gelman also told the News: ``It's not
just going to be five hours of goodbye Kathie Lee. Monday through
Thursday there will be some special segments and special moments.''
</P>
<P>
   So who takes the chair next to Regis? For now, Gelman sees a
series of co-hosts, starting with Philbin's wife, Joy.

`A BLIND MAN CAN SEE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU': A FINE NEW SHORT STORY
COLLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exotic intimacies color the sharply wrought stories in Amy
Bloom's fine new collection. And they reveal themselves hauntingly
as these tales unfold.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the title selection the closeness of a mother
named Jane and a child named Jessie is the starting point for an
unusual journey, since it turns out that Jessie's visit to a
gender-reassignment surgeon is the story's galvanizing event.
Jessie is about to become Jess. Her mother is about to strike up a
heterosexual liaison that, in the context of this story's sense of
mutable sexual identity, seems far more peculiar than what
Jessie/Jess is going through.
</P>
<P>
   In a set of stories whose characters find themselves bridging
various chasms _ medical, sexual, racial _ and casually breaking
assorted taboos, Bloom writes warmly and astutely, with arresting
precision, about the various adjustments that they make.
</P>
<P>
   So we learn in ``A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' with
the unconditional acceptance inherent in its title, that Jessie and
Jane were always close, even when the mother had not yet fully
acknowledged her child's anomalous sexual nature.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when young Jessie rejected a dress for a wedding and
insisted on a boy's navy blazer with gray pants, ``Jane knew that
she had managed not to see it, as you manage not to see that your
neighbor's new baby has your husband's eyes and nose.'' But it is
clear from the story's first sentence (``Jane Spencer collects
pictures of slim young men'') that the mother will follow her child
anywhere, even to a parents' support group where one father is a
general trying hard to understand his former son:
</P>
<P>
   ``Loved that boy, fed him a hot breakfast at 4 a.m., drove him
to tae kwon do tournaments all over Minnesota and then all over the
Midwest. They flew to competitions in Los Angeles for 10 and 11, to
Boston for under 13, then to the National Juniors Competitions, and
there are 300 trophies in their house. That boy is now swinging one
small-ankled foot, dangling a pink high-heeled sandal off it and
modeling himself not on Mia Hamm or Sally Ride or even Lindsay
Davenport ... but on Malibu Barbie. And the general has to love
this girl as he loved that boy, or be without.''
</P>
<P>
   By this point in the story Jane herself is so immersed in Jess'
experience that she thinks potential transsexuals might be
everywhere if the surgery were easy enough, ``and they might be
considered no worse than Roseanne or Burt Reynolds.'' So when she
meets a man named Cole, whose hands are the same size as hers and
who refers to his ``soon-to-be ex-wife,'' she finds herself
``trying to figure out whether he means `wife' in the sense of
`woman I am married to,' or `wife' in the sense of `man in my life
who played a kind of wifely role.'''
</P>
<P>
   The story ends with each character poised expectantly on the
brink of change and the wonderfully apt memory of Joe Brown, in
``Some Like It Hot,'' ``crowing with delight, clutching his straw
boater and Jack Lemmon as the speedboat carries them off to a
cockeyed and irresistible future.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stories here also hinge on unusual alliances, and often on
a strong sense of foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rowing to Eden,'' Bloom presents the temporary menage a
trois of Mai, who is undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer;
Ellie, Mai's lesbian best friend, who has herself already had a
mastectomy; and Charley, Mai's husband, who plays host to the group
on Fishers Island and is trying hard _ in Mai's view, too hard _ to
maintain good cheer in the face of Mai's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   In her own mind Mai ``had been walking down a sunny street,
minding her own business, doing no harm, when something sank its
teeth into her breast, gnawed it from her body, stripped her skin
off with its great claw and dangled her, hairless head first, over
a great invisible chasm while poor Charley stood on the other side,
mistaking everything he saw and heard for something that had to do
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   This situation holds obvious potential for anger and sorrow. Yet
Bloom imbues it with wisdom and tenderness until Ellie and Charley
reach an unexpectedly visceral accommodation in the shadow of Mai's
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly she writes of Lionel and Julia in two consecutive
stories, ``Night Vision'' and ``Light Into Dark,'' with an almost
matter-of-fact acceptance of their tricky situation. Julia is 21
years older than Lionel; she is white, he is black, and years ago
they once slept together. That she is the stepmother he calls Ma,
and that both were in shock over the death of Lionel's father when
they drifted into incest, are matters of ancient history as Bloom
tells the story. The question now, in a tale rich with cannily
observed unease and redolent of the smell of cornbread, is how they
will get through Thanksgiving dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The collection's last and most atypically bitter tale, ``The
Story,'' finds Bloom overtly manipulating the process of creating
fiction as she first presents a pleasantly sanitized version of how
a Connecticut accountant works her way into the lives of the
golden-looking couple next door. Able to stand this only so long,
her narrator then abruptly drops the niceties and tells how she
hated the wife, coveted the husband and stopped at nothing to get
what she wanted. The end of this particularly piercing story finds
the author speaking, in a sense, for all the unconventional
liaisons she has described. As her narrator puts it, ``I have made
it as the world should be and not as I have found it.''

`THE VIEW' RECONSIDERS ON SIMPSON; NO NEED FOR LIFELINE AFTER
KATHIE LEE; NEW YORK MAGAZINE CONTEST ENDS
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Walters has decided to cancel an appearance by O.J.
Simpson scheduled for Wednesday on ``The View,'' after being
deluged with protests from viewers and members of the staff of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was booked last week to appear on the show, a syndicated
daytime discussion program. Simpson has scheduled a number of
television appearances this week in conjunction with the start of a
Web site that will solicit money from the public for an opportunity
to ask Simpson questions.
</P>
<P>
   The site will also sell memorabilia associated with Simpson, who
was acquitted in 1995 of murdering his ex-wife Nicole and her
friend Ron Goldman, but found liable later in a wrongful-death
civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said in a telephone interview that she and Bill Geddie,
who are co-executive producers of ``The View,'' had made the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received more very unhappy phone calls from viewers than I
have in a very long time,'' Walters said. ``That was not the
defining thing, but that troubled me.'' In addition, she said, she
heard from a large number of people on the show's production staff.
``They had very serious concerns about having O.J. on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns mainly dealt with giving Simpson a forum to defend
himself and to promote the Web site, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that she had often interviewed controversial figures,
but said this situation was different because ``The View'' is a
program that encourages open expressions of opinion by
interviewers, unlike the interviews she does for ABC News programs.
</P>
<P>
   Also important were the opinions of two of the show's other
hosts, Meredith Vieira and Joy Behar. ``Meredith and Joy both
expressed their unhappiness about it on the air last week,''
Walters said. The fourth host, Star Jones, had indicated that she
would be eager to talk to Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said she told Simpson's representatives of the
cancellation and ``they took it very well.'' Brian Barry, Simpson's
spokesman in conjunction with the Web site, did not return phone
calls over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson is scheduled to appear on NBC's ``Today'' show Tuesday.
The show has no plans to cancel that appearance, an NBC news
spokeswoman, Alex Constantinople, said. Nor has ``Today'' received
an unusual number of calls protesting his appearance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to make other television appearances later in
the week, on the Fox News cable channel, Court TV and others. None
of the other channels is reporting second thoughts about booking
him.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said: ``I am sensitive to the feelings of the other
members of our program and our production staff. We don't need to
do this. We don't need it for the ratings. It was just very
uncomfortable.''
</P>

   No Need for Lifeline After Kathie Lee &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday July 31, ``Live with Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee'' will be
known as ``Live with Regis.'' After sitting next to Regis Philbin
each morning for 15 years, drinking coffee and often going on and
on about her children, Kathie Lee Gifford is leaving the late
morning talk show to pursue a career in acting and singing.
</P>
<P>
   How badly will her absence be felt? Not clear, say those she is
leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   If Philbin was not at the top of the heap these days _ as host
of ABC's ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' _ the loss of Gifford
could have caused some major agita. After all, the sparring banter
of the two co-hosts has helped ``Live'' maintain its place as one
of the most popular syndicated talk shows on television. But
executives said they believe Philbin's popularity would hold the
show up through the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, if Kathie Lee were not Kathie Lee, executives with the
program may also have had more reason to worry. Gifford's perky,
pesky television style is not for everyone, they concede. And she
has had her share of controversy (starting with a little scandal
over underage labor and a Wal-Mart clothing line). The negative
attention she has received also contributed to her decision to
leave, Gifford has said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathie Lee is extremely popular,'' said Michael Gelman, the
program's executive producer. ``At the same time, she can be
polarizing. She kind of prides herself on that. The downside to
that is, some people love you and some people don't like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Without her on set, he said, he believes it is possible that
``we can get a bigger sampling.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, executives at Buena Vista Television, the division of
the Walt Disney Co.that syndicates the program, have been unable to
find an adequate replacement for Gifford and will use guest
co-hosts until they do. That is expected to take many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford's last appearance on the show will be on Friday.

<P>
   New York Magazine contest ends
</P>
<P>
   The contest began in 1968, a few months after New York Magazine,
formerly The Herald Tribune's Sunday supplement, started publishing
on its own. Printed two out of every three weeks (the third week
was originally reserved for crossword puzzles devised by Stephen
Sondheim), the contest, known as the New York Magazine Competition,
quickly became a mainstay of the magazine, its mix of wordplay and
puns beloved of readers and contestants alike.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing lasts forever. After 973 separate contests, the
competition's creator and editor, Mary Ann Madden, has decided to
call it quits. And New York, which last week published the winning
entries to the latest set of contests, has announced that the
competition will be no more.
</P>
<P>
   It was not for lack of interest. ``We're sorry to see it go,''
said a New York spokesman, Christopher Bonanos. The feature has
long been one of the magazine's most popular, he added. Still,
despite its popularity, New York's editors felt that the feature
could not continue without Madden, who had run it since its
inception. ``We agonized over it somewhat,'' Bonanos said. ``But it
had evolved so much into Mary Ann's thing that we didn't feel that
anyone else could do it justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition's formula was a simple one, though it had
seemingly limitless permutations. Invited to provide questions to
answers supplied by the magazine, to supply comic definitions of
common words or to complete writing assignments among many other
things, contributors would vie for prizes of one- and two-year
subscriptions with tongue-in-cheek offerings that were usually
hilarious, though some were almost too painfully cute to mention.
</P>
<P>
   For example, from the 1970s, there was this response to a
request for a ``literary limerick,'' written as Richard Nixon might
have done while still seeking the presidency: ``I'm coolest when
faced with a threat/ Too calm and decisive to fret/ Six crises to
date (I'm trying for eight)/ And I'm not even president yet.'' More
recently, in the category of geographical puns, a reader offered,
``Religion is the Opiate of Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did Madden leave? ``You take your 973 best shots,'' she
said. ``And then it's time to stop.''

THE NEW ECONOMY: CONCERN OVER ONLINE PRIVACY HAS MANY NUANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM RACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public cares deeply about electronic privacy. And so the
federal government sued to try to stop the bankrupt e-tailer
Toysmart.com from selling customer data that the company collected
online.
</P>
<P>
   The public cares intensely about electronic privacy. And so
civil liberties and privacy rights groups oppose an FBI e-mail
surveillance technology called Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   The public cares passionately about electronic privacy. And so
people have been flocking to the Web version of CBS' voyeuristic
social psychology experiment ``Big Brother''
(www.bigbrother2000.com).
</P>
<P>
   Online, it seems, privacy is in the eye of the beholder. That's
why the public debate over electronic privacy can get so confusing.
Whose privacy? Protected from whom?
</P>
<P>
   If there is any consistency in this debate it may be the
assumption that what people want most is freedom of choice:
</P>
<P>
   _ freedom to be left alone
</P>
<P>
   _ freedom to gawk at others
</P>
<P>
   _ freedom to use a technique known as ``opting in'' when it
comes to allowing commercial Web sites to collect personal data
about oneself
</P>
<P>
   _ freedom to use a technique known as ``kicking out'' when it
comes to William or Jordan or Karen or any of the other
exhibitionists in the ``Big Brother'' house that the public deems
displeasing to the Webcam's unblinking eye.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, the contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   It often seems, for example, that the most outspoken
electronic-privacy-rights advocates are among the most technically
adept _ presumably because the real techies understand how powerful
the Internet's data-gathering capabilities can be.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, are some of the most technically adept people
willing to take on even potentially broader privacy risks than the
perils of receiving e-mail and surfing the Web? Think, for
instance, of people adept enough to use Napster or Gnutella or
various other software programs that let people swap digital music
or other media files over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the debate over file sharing has focused on copyright
issues. The critics, including the Recording Industry Association
of America, which is suing to shut Napster down, say that too many
of those music files are swapped with too little regard to
copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   But services like Napster also involve latent privacy issues. To
use one of these services means _ draw the shade and lock the door
_ giving total strangers access to your own computer's hard drive.
If it is true that even a few of those strangers have few scruples
about copyright law, is there any reason _ besides thieves' honor _
to expect them to limit their foraging to the earmarked music files
on someone else's PC?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Napster uses safeguards and partitions meant to
prevent such unauthorized snooping. But the technically adept _
including a computer security expert named Mark Seiden, a hacker
known as DT, and some Napster users on the Napster.com software
forum where I posted a query on this subject _ acknowledged some
risk. The Napster users, though, generally dismissed hacker
intrusions as not being a cause for worry.
</P>
<P>
   One Napster user, going by the screen name spyrl, described the
Zone Alarm firewall software that he had installed to protect his
computer from intruders. He also noted, ``So far there have been no
known cases of people hacking through Napster and I am not going to
let the idea of it give me paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   Spyrl, who in a follow-up e-mail exchange identified himself as
15-year-old Clint Johnson of North Myrtle Beach, S.C., added, ``I
do not have sensitive files on my computer, because if they are
that important I would print them out and delete them.''
</P>
<P>
   BlinkyWillis _ the forum screen name for James Willis, a retired
auto-parts salesman in a Portland, Ore., suburb _ wrote that the
four people in his household share a computer for their Internet
access. This machine is not linked to their individual personal
computers. ``I do not think we are unusual in our not conducting
personal business (or at least leaving no record) on our Internet
connection computer,'' Willis wrote in a subsequent e-mail message.
``We presume that individuals and institutions are accessing the
information on our hard drives.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a separate computer for Internet access was a common theme
on the Napster.com forum. (See? The technologically rich really are
different from you and me.)
</P>
<P>
   A Napster.com forum member going by the online name Drakonix
also reported using firewall software, adding that ``the computer
which has the physical connection to internet also has no sensitive
or irreplaceable files.'' As for Napster, ``I suppose there is
still some chance that it could be exploited,'' Drakonix wrote,
``but it is doubtful that Napster user systems would serve useful
purpose as targets.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of these techies, then, using Napster presents only
theoretical privacy risks. But for most people, the risk of an
online merchant's stealing one's identity or the FBI's subsuming
one's digital soul is probably only theoretical, too, right?
</P>
<P>
   So is there really much difference among the theoretical privacy
risks? Plenty, according to Seiden, the computer security expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of choosing to supply any service to the world,
like Napster, it's your own choice to do so, and you can calculate
the risk and reward,'' said Seiden, chief consultant at Securify, a
network security consulting firm in Palo Alto, Calif. ``In the case
of corporate spyware and the government, you are unaware of what
they're doing until some reverse-engineering whistle-blower
embarrasses the offenders. Meanwhile, they might have been watching
you for years.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Big Brother'' is a social psychology experiment about
privacy and group dynamics, so is that big, diverse group house
known as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably are real differences among people in the extent
to which they are willing to entrust private information to
others,'' writes Anthony G. Greenwald, a social psychology
professor the University of Washington, who has used the Web to
conduct experiments among volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because some are more trusting than others,'' Greenwald said
via e-mail, ``there should be a segmentable market for things that
will attract the more trusting (online shopping, music via Napster,
opening messages that may contain viruses).
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is also a market for things that appeal to the less
trusting (alarm systems, unlisted phone numbers, etc.). We have an
unattractive name for those who seem to live in excessive fear of
attacks on their person or identity _ paranoid _ but I don't know
of a name for the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. How about the name William? Or Jordan? Or Karen?

COMPUTER-GENERATED WIZARDRY PUMMELS EVERYONE BUT DISNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A U-Haul truck, back door gaping, was parked on the
circular drive facing the roar of lunchtime traffic on Camelback
Road. Inside, Gary Goldman and a few helpers were sorting through
what was left of Fox Animation Studios: 40 cardboard boxes. Don
Bluth, the studio's creative force, had packed up his office the
week before and was long gone.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot-high Lego-block statue of Bartok, the bat in
``Anastasia,'' the studio's first major animated feature, still sat
in the lobby beside some posters from ``Titan A.E.,'' its most
recent and final animated film. In the nearly empty underground
garage, rows of chairs were clustered in groups _ swivels to the
left, tall-backed rockers in the middle, blond-wood reception
chairs to the right _ like prisoners sorted for transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animation isn't dead, not by a long shot,'' Goldman said.
``And neither are we.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be dead, but some are wondering whether animation's
pulse _ at least that of the traditional, two-dimensional variety
made by anyone other than Disney _ might be fading. This downturn
perhaps signals an end to a costly five-year cycle in which several
major movie studios built their own traditional animation divisions
in an attempt to steal a bit of Disney's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   When 20th Century Fox announced last month that it was closing
its Phoenix-based animation studios _ about a week after the
abysmal mid-June opening of ``Titan'' and just three days after the
studio chief, Bill Mechanic, announced his hasty resignation _ Fox
executives said they were convinced that the immediate future, at
least as far as their studio was concerned, was in
three-dimensional, computer-generated animation.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences, they argued, were demanding up-to-the-minute digital
magic and shying away from the traditional animation they
remembered, unless the name Disney was attached.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is not alone in its new, cautious stance toward traditional
animation: Warner Brothers, which also had its problems with
feature animation, has slowed its efforts, while Paramount has
largely been content with more inexpensive animation based on
well-known brands like ``Rugrats'' and ``South Park.'' Only
DreamWorks remains gung-ho.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Meledandri, president of Fox Animation, said the company
was closing the traditional animation studio that Bluth and Goldman
had opened for it in August 1994, laying off the six dozen people
left in the three-story office building here. Fox was transferring
its future animation hopes to White Plains, N.Y., where Blue Sky
Studios, which it partly owns, is now producing newfangled
computer-generated films along the lines of Pixar's ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer-generated animation, it's the flavor of the month,''
Bluth, a legendary animator credited with helping spur the
renaissance in feature-film animation over the last 15 years, said
over lunch in a trattoria near his shuttered studio. ``I will never
draw another character and give the rights to someone else. And I
think that pretty much puts me out of the movie business.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is the tail end of a cycle of interest in
traditional animation, Bluth said. Interest has always been
cyclical, even in Walt Disney's heyday. ``It's a trend thing,'' he
said. ``People get tired of looking at the same old thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional animation, pioneered by Disney and others in the
1920s and '30s, involves putting pencil to paper and making a
series of drawings, each slightly different from the one before,
that, when photographed and then projected at 24 shots per second,
give the illusion that the drawn figures are alive. Although
techniques changed over the years to include more multilayered cels
that allowed different artists to create characters and
backgrounds, the concept remained basically the same and resulted
in decidedly two-dimensional images that were often richly textured
but looked like what they were: paintings on flat surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated animation, in which the figures are created
out of pure computer code, begins with virtual skeletons overlayed
with some sort of skin and texture. Adding virtual lighting sources
can give the resulting figures a sense of solidity and the scene
the aura of a three-dimensional universe. The result looks less
like paint on paper than a film of a moving sculpture, existing in
a real world of light and space. It is the difference between
``Bambi'' and ``Toy Story,'' between Saturday morning cartoons and
``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   After costly missteps with ``Quest for Camelot'' (1998), ``The
King and I'' (1999) and ``The Iron Giant'' (1999), Warner Brothers
has eased off on its large-scale, in-house animation. This summer
Warner is offering ``Pokemon the Movie 2000,'' a relatively cheap
animated film capitalizing on the popular children's television
series and its related games and toys. Even Fox might be tempted to
get back into traditional animation if a project grew out of its
television division and could be made cheaply, Meledandri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But otherwise our focus right now is really reflected by the
pictures we are currently working on, which are either
computer-animated or some form of mixed media,'' he said. Only
DreamWorks, it seems, continues determinedly in efforts to match
Disney in traditional animated fare, despite the lackluster
box-office performance of ``The Road to El Dorado,'' its most
recent traditionally animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think the appetite for traditional animation is
greater these days,'' said Ann Daly, head of animation for
DreamWorks. ``What's happened, though, is that animated movies have
become more numerous, so people have become more discriminating and
discerning about what they like.''

 &HT;    Guys just dye for trendy hair color
 &HT;    By Erin Coyle
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This summer, 20-something men and teenage boys are
going platinum or white-blond, a trickle-down trend started by
entertainment stars such as Sisqo, Eminem and Green Day's Billie
Joe Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourselfers can be spotted perusing dye offerings at local
drug stores. Madgelyn Mitchell, manager of a CVS in Alpharetta,
Ga., says the neophyte dye-jobbers often ask if their hair might
change into funky colors. Not an expert in the field, her advice is
limited to: ``The directions are in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   But the guys buy, anyway. About a year ago, L'Oreal placed a
man's picture on its platinum dye, and now it is the top seller in
its line.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-year-old Richard Meisemann went the home-dye route,
enlisting his mother to help lighten his dark blond hair right
after school let out.
</P>
<P>
   Richard was a bit of a fashion trailblazer among his friends,
and he got some funny looks at first. ``But now that a lot of
people have it,'' he says, ``it's kind of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Other guys spring for the full beauty-parlor treatment _ some
after failed attempts at home. Karen Hinson of Van Michael Salon
says parents bring in their sons for corrective coloring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in when it gets to about an orange point. It's
nowhere near platinum, and it's very scary looking.'' Platinum is
one of the hardest shades even for professionals to attain, Hinson
says.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be one of the most painful to apply. ``I had a guy
who started crying in my chair,'' Hinson says. ``Even if you use
the best products in the world, it's going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Holladay, 26, a construction worker, rolled on the floor of
his parents' salon the time he went platinum. ``It just hurts,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The process is particularly painful because it requires bleach
to remove the hair's natural color. Most people get tiny nicks on
their scalp from combing their hair, and when the bleach hits those
nicks, it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Jake's father, Don ``Doc'' Holladay, has coined a term for the
men and boys who show up for platinum or other radical shades of
dye: ``the after-hours crowd.'' Doc asks them to come in late
because it can take a long time to bleach hair. Doc's been at work
as late 3 a.m., stripping and applying color to reach the shade his
client wanted.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, three men with shower caps covering the bleach
on their heads sat underneath big bowl-shaped hair dryers, reading
GQ, Harper's Bazaar and sports magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The guys say being blond really is more fun, at least for this
summer. Jesse Hamrick, a 28-year-old Atlantan who had his hair done
at the Holladays' salon, loves his hair platinum. It helps with his
work as an artist to be fashion-forward, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But it may not be hot for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably once people start doing it a lot,'' Hamrick says,
``fashion will change.''

 PHOENIX: they like.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DreamWorks has several traditionally animated features in the
works, and is also forging ahead with computer-generated fare from
PDI, the company that made ``Antz,'' beginning with a
troll-meets-princess tale called ``Shrek,'' set for release next
summer. And the studio has a multi-picture deal with Aardman, a
British animation house that uses stop-motion techniques in which
actual physical models are manipulated one frame at a time, a
method that resulted in this summer's hit ``Chicken Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney, of course, has never let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to speculate about the future,'' said
Peter Schneider, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. ``What I do know
is that whether they're animated traditionally or on a computer,
good movies will find their place in the marketplace. I do think
that the market does go through this ebb and flow, where people are
more excited about certain kinds of movies or less excited about
them, and there is always a correction in the marketplace when
things get too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth was a veteran at Disney in 1979 when he decided that
animation at the studio had grown moribund and that he needed to
strike out on his own. Goldman left Disney with him. In 1982 they
released ``The Secret of N.I.M.H.,'' a somewhat dark and highly
regarded animated feature about animals escaping from a research
lab; this attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, with whom
they worked on ``An American Tail'' (1986), about Fievel, an
immigrant mouse, and ``The Land Before Time'' (1988), about
dinosaurs in search of literally greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   During the '80s Bluth and his partners led a resurgence in
feature-film animation, while Disney remained fairly dormant. But
that changed in 1989 when Disney released ``The Little Mermaid,''
the first of its new generation of re-energized animated features
that eventually produced huge hits like ``Beauty and the Beast''
and led Disney to reassert its dominance in feature animation in
the '90s. In particular the enormous success of ``The Lion King''
in 1994 _ the film made more than $300 million _ inspired other
major Hollywood studios to build their own animation divisions and
try to compete for what appeared to be a growing and enormously
lucrative family market.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s Bluth had transferred his operations to
Ireland, where he felt it was easier to keep costs down and compete
more effectively with Disney's deeper pockets. But financial
problems with his partners at the time coincided with an offer from
Fox to move back to the United States in 1994 and set up a new
animation studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted us to move to Los Angeles, but we said no, that
was a deal breaker, so we eventually settled on Phoenix, which was
close enough to satisfy them and far enough from Los Angeles to
satisfy us,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Those were heady times. Warner Brothers also set up an animation
division, and Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney and, with David Geffen
and Spielberg as partners, set up the new DreamWorks studio, vowing
to compete with Disney in feature-film animation. Experienced
animators found themselves the targets of bidding wars. ``Suddenly,
animators who had been making $1,000 a week were being offered
$4,000, $5,000, even $6,000 a week,'' Goldman said. ``Everybody got
an agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox leased 66,000 square feet of office space in a prime corner
of northeast Phoenix. DreamWorks built a beautiful new animation
campus in Glendale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the resulting movies were not coming anywhere
close to ending Disney's dominance. Only DreamWorks' ``Prince of
Egypt'' earned more than $100 million. Most came and went with
barely a ripple, while Disney kept pumping out blockbusters. For
Fox the final straw was this summer's ``Titan,'' an $85 million
production that was calculated to appeal to teen-agers, who are
normally averse to animated fare. But they stayed away, and the
movie quickly sank at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, soon after the spectacular success of
Pixar's ``Toy Story 2,'' a computer-animated feature, Bluth said,
Fox officials came to Phoenix and told the studio to cut back on
staff as soon as ``Titan'' was finished. The studio went from a
high of 362 employees to a core crew of 70 or so. Some of those
remaining hoped that Fox would continue to make animated features,
but Bluth and Goldman said it became increasingly obvious that
their studio would never make another movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they said, Fox officials flew to Phoenix and
announced that the studio was closing and that everyone left on the
staff had three hours to pack up and get out.
</P>
<P>
   The first group of animators who left the Phoenix studio late
last year had fairly good luck landing jobs, Bluth said. ``The ones
it was hardest on was the last 70,'' he said, ``because they died a
hard death.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth and Goldman said they hoped to get involved in animation
for the World Wide Web, some of it along the lines of the popular
``Dragon's Lair'' computer game they created a decade ago and some
of it animated stories, both short and feature length. Perhaps,
they said, by distributing their work directly over the Internet,
they would be able to bypass the Hollywood studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're in the distribution business, you're not in the
movie business,'' Bluth said. ``We learned that the hard way.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a front remains nearly stationary over the Southeast, an area
of low pressure moving to the Northeast along the front will bring
a widespread area of showers and steady rain to the region. It will
remain very cool under thick clouds with onshore breezes. The
northeast seaboard will become mostly cloudy as high clouds stream
north ahead of the system in the Southeast. Thunderstorms with
heavy rain will plague northern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms are likely in the northern Plains as
low pressure treks east along the Canadian border. Slightly cooler
weather will follow the front. Meanwhile, the southern Plains will
not be as hot with afternoon highs in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California will turn warmer as offshore breezes
increase. The deserts of the Southwest will stay hot.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: LIGHTNING DETECTION
</P>
<P>
   Bolts of lightning can often appear to strike randomly. However,
networks of lightning detectors suggest patterns that may help
forecasters predict the growth of thunderstorms. Conventional radar
tracks storms by detecting microwave radiation reflected by
precipitation. The heavy rain and hail in strong storms reflect
more radiation. Lightning detectors show that the greatest
electrical activity in a storm often precedes the heaviest
precipitation by about 15 minutes. Thus, observations of increasing
numbers of lightning bolts may help predict the sudden growth of a
thunderstorm.

PROGRAMMERS' IMAGE PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SOFTWARE-DEVELOP) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is some uncertainty about how many software programmers,
or developers, there are in America. Estimates by the government
and private research firms range from fewer than 700,000 to 2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   But there is wide agreement that there are too few programmers,
and that the shortage can only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Money is not the issue. These are high-paying jobs, well into
six figures for elite programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Image, it seems, is the problem. Most teen-agers around the
country still think of programmers as socially inept nerds,
according to focus groups and a series of town meetings conducted
last year by the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work is seen as boring, difficult and solitary,'' said
Kelly Carnes, assistant secretary for technology policy at the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   The image problem is especially pronounced among teen-age girls.
``It's seen as not cool and you don't have boyfriends,'' Carnes
noted.
</P>
<P>
   To burnish the image of programmers _ and encourage more young
people to go into the field _ the Commerce Department is planning
an advertising campaign this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The government, Carnes says, has not yet decided whether it will
use celebrities, teen-agers or programmers to make the pitch. But
the message, she said, will be that programming is ``cool, exciting
and you can do it.''

his flagship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, struck a sandbar in 1718,
the pirate certainly never conceived of anyone else boarding her.

re-connect two pieces of the Cross Florida Greenway that were split
30 years ago by highway construction. By day, hikers, bicyclists

   CORPORATE-MIGRATION (Jacksonville, Fla.) _ Companies have been
migrating for decades, moving operations both within the United
States and overseas for many reasons, including the search for
cheaper labor. But since 1996, corporate migration within the
country has soared, roughly doubling to more than 11,000 moves a
year, according to Site Selection Magazine of Atlanta, the only
organization, public or private, to track the phenomenon. At the
same time, the emphasis has shifted from factories, the traditional

republic where promised oil riches have yet to materialize and per

stopped, the refugees remain victims of a little-noticed war,
forgotten by the outside world, insufficiently cared for by their
government and on the verge of abandonment by international aid

`GISELLE': BOLSHOI PERFORMANCE IS SEAMLESS AND ELEGANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bolshoi Ballet ended its too brief season Sunday
as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, but not before there was
room for the young Svetlana Lunkina to triumph in ``Giselle'' amid
a cascade of other major debuts on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At 20, Lunkina, a porcelain figure with black hair and inherent
elegance, has become the public's instant darling. Her Giselle
absorbs the best of tradition but allows her presence to radiate
across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, Yekaterina Maximova, one of the world's
great Giselles since she was the young revelation of the Bolshoi's
historic New York debut in 1959, was in the New York State Theater
to watch her protegee. Much of the seamless beauty of Lunkina's
performance undoubtedly comes from Maximova's coaching. One
recognizes her emphasis on dramatic motivation within a pure
classical style. Every step and gesture is absorbed into a coherent
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Vladimir Vasiliev's 1997 production of ``Giselle''
snaps into place. This is not to say that it is short on
idiosyncrasies or that it does not accommodate performers who have
their own ideas about the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Lunkina was paired with Nikolai Tsiskaridze, who was not shy
about taking liberties in his first New York appearance as
Albrecht, the aristocrat in disguise who seduces and betrays
Giselle, the innocent village lass. Natalia Malandina was the
excellent new Myrtha, queen of the Wilis, the ghosts from whom
Giselle saves Albrecht in the world of the spirits. Ruslan Pronin
was new as Hilarion, the gamekeeper who loves Giselle.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening Andrei Uvarov made his debut as Albrecht opposite
Nina Ananiashvili, who was in top form as she was on opening night
on Tuesday. Maria Allash was the new Myrtha.
</P>
<P>
   Ananiashvili carries the ballet by remaining herself. She has a
spontaneous style with a formidable technique and keeps well within
the production. Nonetheless she often stands out in relief from the
staging by the power of her performance, while Lunkina, younger and
more malleable, has been clearly coached to remain within
recognizable stylistic parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giselle'' was the idea of the French romantic poet Theophile
Gautier. Its blend of realistic drama in Act I and the formal
choreography of Act II embodied his view of ballet as ``at once the
most material and ideal of spectacles.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Lunkina's triumph to convey a visual and emotional beauty
rooted in classical style, to hark back to Gautier's vision. Some
productions of ``Giselle'' aptly emphasize the realism of the first
act, contrasting with the more abstract corps patterns of Act II.
Yet this venerable ballet, created in 1841 to Adolphe Adam's
enduring score, survives on two levels: a ballet that is romantic
in content and expression but well within the tradition of
classical ballet.
</P>
<P>
   There was no verismo in Lunkina's performance, in which every
step, gesture and pose was part of a continuous act of
accomplishment, a story told in a consistent and classical idiom.
Her village girl had a touch of sadness from the start, while
Ananiashvili's brimmed with the joy of life.
</P>
<P>
   Injured earlier this week, Lunkina did remarkably well under the
circumstances. Her major solo in Act I, which Vasiliev has
repositioned so that Giselle dances for Bathilde, Albrecht's
fiancee, rather than earlier, took no risks but was a model of
clarity and placement. The light skips of the first act grew into
strong leaps in Act II; Lunkina did not offer the deepest of
arabesques but described a superbly etched ethereal image.
</P>
<P>
   This was a Giselle who could touch with her prettiness and
innocence in Act I, where she reacted sharply to Hilarion. Vasiliev
has given that role more bravura, which occasionally breaks with
dramatic logic. Pronin, like the more enraged Hilarion of Alexander
Petukhov on Saturday night, had the impressive committed vigor apt
for the demi-charactere dances that are new.
</P>
<P>
   Hilarion is more present than Albrecht, who cannot see Giselle's
big solo, because he is hiding from Bathilde. Why Giselle should be
upset over an absentee lover is not clear in this version, but
Lunkina's mad scene had the virtue of a carefully coached set piece
made to look utterly natural: a girl losing touch with reality but
without hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Tsiskaridze on the other hand is an emotional performer, which
is to his credit. Had he not substituted his own choreography for
Albrecht's solo in Act II (he omitted the three double air turns)
and not danced so wildly in the needless virtuosity added to the
very end, his Albrecht would have persuaded with its tender
passion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unlike other Albrechts he also wore a big jeweled cross in Act
II just as he wore a cross as Mercutio in ``Romeo and Juliet'' on
tour last month. It was a questionable, even provincial touch.
</P>
<P>
   To know romantic ballet is to understand it, and here one
recommends the writings on ``Giselle'' of Lincoln Kirstein, who
founded the New York City Ballet with George Balanchine. Referring
to the romantic disillusionment of the creators of ``Giselle,''
Kirstein writes in ``Movement and Metaphor'': ``The cross on
Giselle's grave is simply decorative since the collaborators were
entirely cynical. The divine symbol was now simply picturesque.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Giselle'' and ``Romeo and Juliet,'' as a play, have endured
because their authors were not sectarian. Private faith is one
thing; performance tradition is another. Carlotta Grisi, the
original Giselle of 1841, came from a Jewish family of prominent
dancers and singers but she did not wear a Star of David as Giselle
onstage. To impose a sectarian view on such works is to deny their
universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Happily they can be appreciated on the immediate level of
performance. Uvarov, a fine dancer whose image is elongated and
vertical in his air turns, offered an unassertive but elegant
Albrecht. The Myrthas contributed space-devouring leaps with
Malandina dancing with special authority. May the Bolshoi come back
soon.

IF THE RHYTHM'S WEIRD, IT MUST BE MESSIAEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no stopping Messiaen's ``Turangalila
Symphony,'' which the New York Philharmonic played on Friday night
under Hans Vonk to end the Lincoln Center Festival 2000 celebration
of the composer. One moment the solo pianist is playing a slow,
sultry rising arpeggio, so that you think you must just have missed
a song by Frank Sinatra, and then all of a sudden a group of
percussionists is pattering out arcane rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner has the score's electronic instrument, an ondes
martenot, lent its weird voice to processional music with an Asian
twist than trumpets and full orchestral strings come rampaging in
with one of the work's exultant, yelping love themes. The mix is
absurd, impossible and bang on. It works.
</P>
<P>
   It works even in an imperfect performance like this one.
Although Leonard Bernstein conducted the world premiere, with the
Boston Symphony in 1948, he never put the score on the
Philharmonic's program, and the piece was nearly 40 years old by
the time the orchestra played it for the first time. To judge from
Friday's performance the musicians are still not familiar with it.
Or to put it another way, they still cannot quite believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of belief would account for the underpowered playing of the
big tunes in the work's love music, into which it keeps rushing
with arms wide open. These tunes need to be passionate. They need
to be extreme. They need to have the musicians fully committed, on
their toes and playing their hearts out. Instead there was a sense
here of people replicating notes on the page, and not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   More rehearsal might have helped. Shaky entries, missed detail,
smudges where the rhythm turns fast and awkward (especially in the
eighth of the 10 movements) and patches of poor ensemble all
indicated that preparation time had been inadequate. This was a
pity, especially when Vonk's pacing of events was so sure, and when
the orchestra kept on producing rich textures that just needed a
little more precision and polish.
</P>
<P>
   Even so there was a good deal to enjoy. The percussionists were
in good form, ready to pounce. The brass section had a lot of the
right extravagance. Some neat playing from solo strings, especially
violas, decorated one of the work's more abstract passages.
Clarinet solos were mostly delightful. Valerie Hartmann-Claverie
unleashed the ondes martenot's wailing to good effect. And Andreas
Haefliger was nicely crisp, quick-witted and resonant in the solo
piano part.

ANESTHESIOLOGIST COMES UP WITH A PROCESS THAT HE SAYS MAKES
CIGARETTES SAFER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.) By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tobacco industry is facing a nearly $145 billion penalty
after a jury in Florida decided earlier this month that cigarette
makers had known for decades that their product causes deadly
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Lane, a doctor in Del Ray Beach, Fla., says industry
scientists have also known for much of that time that it was
possible to prepare cigarettes that would not cause so many deaths.
But they didn't pursue the evidence, he said, so he did. And he has
now won a patent for a process that he contends will make
cigarettes safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate part is that people are going to smoke,'' said
Lane, an anesthesiologist. And when they do, he said, they expose
themselves to a common fungus that can grow on tobacco leaves when
they are stored in barns to cure and age. The mold's spores produce
something called an aflatoxin, which Lane described as ``the most
potent toxin in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He is hoping that the tobacco industry might be interested in
his process as a way of creating a product that might be marketed
as potentially less harmful than conventional cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said decades of research had shown that aflatoxins can
suppress the immune system, cause mutations in a tumor suppression
gene, and prompt tumors in laboratory animals that are similar to
tumors found in cigarette smokers. It can also cause birth defects,
he added, and inhibit protein synthesis. If that wasn't enough,
aflatoxins have also been used in chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Lane first heard of aflatoxins as a medical student in 1977,
when he worked in a toxicology lab at a pharmaceutical company. For
his experiments, he simply bought aflatoxins from a medical supply
company. The federal government has since banned those sales out of
concern that the fungus could be used to make weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The government also controls aflatoxins in another manner: the
Food and Drug Administration restricts the levels of the fungus
permitted in food crops. ``The FDA regulates aflatoxin levels in
corn, grain, wheat and peanuts because it is a deadly carcinogen,''
Lane said. ``No one has proven that aflatoxins are bad in tobacco,
but we know they cause all these other things. But limits are not
required on tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane's interest in aflatoxins was revived when several states
filed lawsuits against the tobacco industry a few years ago. He
began studying scientific papers and other reports made public
during the suits, and during hearings in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found all these documents showing that the tobacco companies
knew about aflatoxins in the 1960s,'' he said. Because they burn
only at temperatures higher than 550 degrees, the mold spores can
survive when a cigarette is smoked. That means they are present in
second-hand cigarette smoke as well. ``There was even one study
that showed a complete transfer in cigarette smoke. The level found
on the leaves was 200 parts per billion, and the same was found in
the smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   He also learned that federal regulations limit aflatoxin levels
on corn to 20 parts per billion and in milk to 0.05 parts per
billion. He saw a government report stating that a batch of
marijuana leaves had aflatoxin levels of 8,000 parts per billion,
he said. But he couldn't find published statistics for aflatoxin
levels in commercial tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started looking at tobacco patents,'' Lane said. ``There are
literally thousands and thousands, and the industry does everything
imaginable to tobacco. They extract certain elements, among them
nicotine, and then spray things back in that they think they'll
need.''
</P>
<P>
   He found patents that covered ways to neutralize the fungus in
food crops, he said, ``but nothing to do with removing aflatoxins
from tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to invent a method himself. His patent covers
methods of preventing the growth of aflatoxins in the first place,
testing for its presence, and treating tobacco to remove the mold
spores when they are present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mold attacks dying or dead organisms,'' he said. So he
designed a system to prevent mold growth in tobacco storage
facilities. ``A prepackaged cartridge is provided to inject
nontoxic benevolent fungal spores into the chamber,'' Lane wrote in
his patent. ``The purpose of the benevolent fungal spores is to
crowd out harmful toxigenic microbes with a harmless species.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane also suggests filling the storage area with an inert gas to
prevent the mold from growing. The patent also describes ways to
monitor the chemicals used to make what are known as
``reformulated'' cigarettes, like those with low-nicotine tobacco.
The chemicals are tested for the presence of aflatoxins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the invention includes a process for removing those
aflatoxins when they show up. The tobacco is immersed in a solvent
like acid or emulsifier, ethers, alcohol, ammonia, bleaches, or
hydrogen peroxide. The solution is agitated, and the solvent
leeches the aflatoxins from the leaves. The liquid is monitored,
and the leaves are tested for remaining aflatoxin levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting brand new jeans in the wash that are real
blue, and after every wash they become less blue,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   The process is repeated if necessary until aflatoxin levels in
the tobacco fall. How low they should go is ``the billion-dollar
question, because no one knows what an adequate level should be,''
Lane said. He hopes the FDA will decide on a level and then set the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Lane said he had offered to license his
invention to 160 tobacco processing and manufacturing companies. He
is still waiting for their replies. Lane received patent 6,058,940.

SPORTS COLUMN: TIGER SHOULD GIVE THE OTHER PROS STROKES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ In golf, a handicap is the great
equalizer. It enables anybody to play against anybody else, even
Tiger Woods, on theoretically even terms. If you have a 15 handicap
and shoot 87, your net score would be 72, even par at most courses.
But that's only if you're an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a pro, you compete without a handicap, or belly to
belly as Ben Hogan once told a young pro. In golf, a pro is a pro
is a pro.
</P>
<P>
   But as Tiger Woods keeps proving all pros are not created equal,
maybe it's time to establish the Tiger Handicap Equalizer system,
by which the other pros would get a few strokes from him, at least
in the four major tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods walked off the 18th green of the hallowed Old Course
in the Royal Burgh of St. Andrews on Sunday, he had won the 129th
British Open by eight strokes. He won last month's United States
Open at Pebble Beach by a record 15 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1997 Masters and last year's Professional Golfers'
Association Championship already stashed away, he joined Jack
Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Gene Sarazen as the only
golfers with a career grand slam of the four majors.
</P>
<P>
   And at 24, Woods is the youngest to do it: Nicklaus was 26 when
he completed his slam by winning the British Open at Muirfield in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also joined Bobby Jones, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Hogan
and Sarazen as the only golfers to have won both Opens in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   For him to be in such fancy company at such a young age is all
the more reason to establish the Tiger Handicap Equalizer system in
the majors. Give the other top 50 pros in the world ranking four
strokes over 72 holes, the next 50 six strokes and the others eight
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   That formula would still not have been enough for anybody else
to win (or even force a playoff) in the British Open or the United
States Open, but at least it would provide the other pros with some
hope _ an element that Woods has seemed to have all but destroyed
in other pros.
</P>
<P>
   Before this British Open began, the Scots warned that the
bunkers, of which the Old Course has 167, lurked for Woods. But he
was never in a bunker in four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunker,'' he said when told that some thought he had been in a
bunker on the seventh hole on Friday. ``I was in a bunker every day
_ on the practice range.''
</P>
<P>
   But as dazzling as Woods' talent and work ethic on the range
are, he is believed to be the first golfer to prepare so studiously
for tournaments, especially those with the major titles. Before
this British Open, he studied videotapes of previous British Opens
and Dunhill Cup matches at the Old Course going back to the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods had an afternoon tee time here, as he did Friday,
Saturday and Sunday, he spent the morning watching the BBC telecast
in his suite in the Old Course Hotel overlooking the 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you an understanding of how the golf course is
playing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the fairways are receiving the shots, how the greens are
receiving the shots, what spin you need to come in with _ overspin,
backspin. Some of the pin locations are a little different than
we're used to seeing so it's neat to take a look at the shots and
how the green is receiving them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving here, Woods viewed St. Andrews videotapes at the
Golf Channel studios in Orlando, Fla., and in his villa in the
nearby gated Isleworth area, with the emphasis on worth. He also
owns two Isleworth lots where he plans to build a more spacious
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to build that home with prize money that he's earned
on the golf course _ not with any of the money from any of his
sponsors or endorsement contracts,'' said Bev Norwood, one of his
International Management Group business advisers. ``It's important
to him to build that home with prize money that he's earned.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods could start building that home any time. He has already
earned about $20 million worldwide in less than four years as a
pro.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the British Open at St. Andrews, Woods also joined
the other Americans to have won it here, going back to Jones in
1927, Denny Shute in 1933, Sam Snead in 1946, Tony Lema in 1964,
Nicklaus in 1970 and 1978 and John Daly in 1995. When Snead, at 88
the oldest living British Open winner, was here early last week for
a reunion of past champions, he remembered playing two holes with a
little boy named Tiger Woods, who also remembered it in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 5 or 6, we played at Calabasas Country Club,'' recalled
Woods, who grew up in Cypress, Calif. ``He was playing an
exhibition where he had a new group of playing partners every two
holes. I got a chance to play with him the last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't carry this little par 3 with a creek in front. I
was trying to bounce it on the cart path and through the creek. I
missed it. My dad says I missed by a few yards to the right. It
rolled into the creek, a rocky creek. I got in there to play it.
The ball was sitting up. From behind me, Sam yells, `What are you
doing?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I look around, look dumbfounded. I'm going to hit the shot. He
says: `Just pick it up and drop it. Let's go on.' I didn't like
that very much. I remember looking at my ball and saying: `I've got
to hit it. I don't want to drop. That's a penalty.' So I hit a
7-iron out onto the green, all wet, two-putted, got my bogey and
bogeyed the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made bogey, bogey and Sam beat me by two _ par, par.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was when Tiger Woods needed to have a handicap. Now all
the other pros do. &QL;

IF YOUR MAN TREATS YOU BAD, IT'S GREAT TO BREAK LOOSE BUT BETTER TO
GET EVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dixie Chicks paused during their concert last
Thursday night at Radio City Music Hall for a slide show of their
own goofy baby photos and high school fashion errors: what they
called ``the really ugly pictures.'' With country music well into
its video era, when hit makers like Shania Twain and Faith Hill
pose like models, the Dixie Chicks have some sympathy for the
unglamorous. ``You may still be ugly, but there's hope for
everyone,'' said Natalie Maines, the group's lead singer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a homey touch in a slick, good-natured show that seesawed
between clinging love songs and declarations of female
independence. With their two major-label albums, the Dixie Chicks
have become country's latest blockbuster group by mixing
old-fashioned musicianship, smart song choices, diligent touring
and cheerful blond image building.
</P>
<P>
   Martie Seidel, on fiddle, and Emily Robison, who plays banjo,
dobro and guitar, are sisters and founding members of the Dixie
Chicks. Maines replaced the group's lead singer in 1995, as the
group turned from bluegrass and cowgirl songs to more current
material; she sings in a tangy honky-tonk voice while the sisters
harmonize above her.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Chicks' songs are about estranged lovers. Sometimes
the singer wishes her man were back, or that she could tear him
away from a rival, promising ``I Can Love You Better''; sometimes
she's ready to give him the heave-ho. ``Wide Open Spaces''
(Monument/Sony), the Dixie Chicks' first big-label album, was
mostly accommodating, but their second, ``Fly'' (Monument/Sony),
turned much more feisty. Like Twain, Mary Chapin Carpenter and
Martina McBride, the Dixie Chicks have discovered that
country-music audiences thrill to songs about women breaking loose
and, even better, getting even.
</P>
<P>
   The concert opened with ``Ready to Run,'' in which the singer
flees commitment to ``have some fun,'' and peaked with the bouncy,
triumphant ``Goodbye Earl,'' in which a battered wife murders her
husband and gets away with it: ``It turned out he was a missing
person nobody missed.'' Lest anyone miss the narrative, the song's
video clip was shown onstage while Maines sang from a perch in the
audience. ``Sin Wagon,'' in which the singer decides to go out and
find a partner for ``mattress dancing,'' toyed with musical
blasphemy by including part of the bluegrass gospel standard ``I'll
Fly Away.''
</P>
<P>
   Onstage the sisters reminded fans of their days playing
bluegrass festivals and showed their proficiency with a glistening
banjo-fiddle duet. They also inserted the banjo into more modern
country-pop songs; they have been credited with returning the sound
of the banjo to country radio stations that had lately considered
it too rural.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the Dixie Chicks use slightly less rock muscle than
Twain or Garth Brooks, they're not reviving the past. For every
honky-tonk shuffle in the set, there were two or three tunes based
on fingerpicking 1970s soft rock, and the Chicks' harmonies owe as
much to Crosby, Stills and Nash as to bluegrass.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks are in line with country tradition when they
sing about strains on the marital bond. But they're in modern,
suburban-country territory when they take it lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Griffin, who wrote ``Let It Fly'' (the title song for
``Fly'') and sang it with the Dixie Chicks onstage, plunged into
rock with an adventurous opening set. Like Sarah McLachlan and P.J.
Harvey, she writes songs about a tormented, mystical love that
merges desire, memory and religious faith. For most of her set, she
placed her resolute voice amid churning, droning, distorted
guitars, vividly capturing the visionary tone of her songs even as
some Dixie Chicks fans fled for the lobby.

THEATER OR TV, IT'S JUST THAT SHE CARES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ To Gail Berman the cultural chasm is not especially
wide between serious plays like Athol Fugard's ``Blood Knot'' or
David Rabe's ``Hurlyburly'' and television shows like ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' and ``Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman produced all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producing is producing, whether you're on Broadway or
television,'' said Berman, the new president for entertainment at
the Fox Broadcasting Co. ``You have to remember who your consumer
is in the theater, just as you do on television. You have to be
wrapped up and emotionally engaged in what you're doing. And in
both cases you have a company of actors, and you're living through
the issues and problems and highs and lows of that group of people
for months and months and months.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman is nonetheless an anomaly in the television business: an
executive with a taste for the offbeat who is rooted in the New
York theater.
</P>
<P>
   Her appointment to her new job, by Sandy Grushow, chairman of
the Fox Television Entertainment Group, came at a significant
moment for a network that once monopolized the teen-age and
young-adult audiences. Hugely successful Fox shows like ``The X
Files'' are aging, and signature shows like ``Beverly Hills
90210,'' ``Melrose Place'' and ``Party of Five'' are no longer on
the air. Last season saw a run of new shows flop in succession:
``Action,'' ``Time of Your Life,'' ``Family Guy,'' ``Ryan
Caulfield,'' ``Harsh Realm'' and ``Get Real.''
</P>
<P>
   In appointing Berman, Fox was clearly seeking to revive the
network's formula of luring mainstream audiences with offbeat
shows. Berman was formerly president of Regency Television, the
studio that created ``Malcolm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The network has only succeeded when it has done genuinely
interesting and exciting things,'' Grushow said. ``And Gail will
figure out how to make original and distinctive programming.'
</P>
<P>
   But Berman's sensibilities do not seem in tune with the kinds of
shows that Fox has often presented. Although the network, which is
owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., has promised to eschew
``exploitative specials,'' Fox is still known for the kind of
downscale shows that are not seen on other networks. In recent
years its specials have ranged from ``Ghosts, Fact or Fiction'' and
``Paranormal: Do You Believe?'' to ``When Good Pets Go Bad'' and
``World's Wildest Police Videos'' and ``World's Scariest Police
Shootouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said one of the network's problems was an executive suite
revolving door. Her predecessor, Doug Herzog, had been in the job
only 16 months. His predecessors had also been relatively
short-lived, mostly because of internal tensions, ratings problems
and the demands of the two men running News Corp., Murdoch and
Peter Chernin.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of this volatility it seems unlikely to her
friends and associates that Berman will pull her punches. ``Gail is
forthright,'' said Linwood Boomer, the creator of the
semi-autobiographical ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' which is about a
brilliant young boy and his affectionately wacky family. ``She's
not one of those executives who say, `I don't know what to think
until one of my bosses tell me.' She's not afraid of alienating
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berman is not the usual brash television hot shot in her
20s or 30s. She is a 43-year-old mother of 7-year-old twins, a boy
and a girl, who lives a relatively quiet life in the Pacific
Palisades with her husband, Bill Masters, a television writer and
producer. She grew up in Bellmore, on Long Island, and in the
Philadelphia suburbs and attended the University of Maryland, where
she was a theater major. Shortly after graduating in 1978, Berman
and a college classmate, Susan Rose, saw an early production of
``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' at Catholic
University, in Olney, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a Mickey-and-Judy sort of way, we decided we would like to
take that production to Ford's Theater in Washington,'' she said
with a laugh. ``We were incredibly naive.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed, she said, were phone calls, sometimes three times
a day, to the New York offices of Robert Stigwood, the show's
producer. A sympathetic assistant to Stigwood led the young women
to David Land, a top executive of the Stigwood organization in
London. ``He was an elderly gentleman who, I think, was kind of
amused by these two girls,'' Berman said. ``We got the rights to
the show at Ford's Theater. And then we raised money for it like
Girl Scouts selling cookies.'' The two women were helped
financially by Melvyn J. Estrin, a Washington businessman, who also
invested in their later productions.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which was set for a six-week run, lasted nine months.
With the help of the producer Zev Bufman they brought the
production to New York, where it ran for two months off-Broadway
and for two and a half years on Broadway at the Royale Theater.
</P>
<P>
   It was followed by an instant flop, ``Almost an Eagle,'' with
James Whitmore, but the women hung in and went on to produce
``Hurlyburly,'' with William Hurt, Christopher Walken, Harvey
Keitel, Judith Ivey, Cynthia Nixon, Sigourney Weaver and Jerry
Stiller and ``Blood Knot.'' Berman was then one of the producers of
Larry Shue's moderately successful ``Nerd.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, ``I sort of felt that I had spent my youth
sitting in people's living rooms raising money,'' she said. ``But
it was scary giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that she got a phone call from executives at HBO,
who were beginning a comedy channel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about television,'' she said. ``I
didn't know what I was doing. But I did know how to read a script.
I did know how to work with writers. I did know how to work with
production people. And what I learned eventually was that producing
is the same, in whatever medium. ''
</P>
<P>
   With her husband working in Los Angeles, Berman moved there in
1990 and got a job working in the television division of Sandollar,
the management and production company owned by Sandy Gallin and
Dolly Parton. Six and a half years later she became a partner in
the company and was also executive producer of the highly
successful ``Buffy'' and its spinoff, ``Angel,'' on the WB Network.
</P>
<P>
   At Fox Berman has brought in a new team of executives to deal
with scheduling, marketing and ``long-form'' shows, or movies.
Several executives have since been replaced. She has announced
plans for a hip-hop version of ``The Wizard of Oz'' and a drama,
``World War III,'' which will star Timothy Hutton and Vanessa
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The hip-hip ``Wizard'' was, she said, essentially a statement
that Fox was intent on doing what she called ``quality event
programming'' that would appeal to a broad range of 28- to
49-year-olds. Fox has shied away from the 90-minute or two-hour
dramas, musicals or extravaganzas that other networks periodically
present. ``It's right up my alley from my theater background,''
Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said that the success of ``Malcolm in the Middle'' also
provided a lesson that resonated with her theater background and
that will help shape programming. Too often, she said, series are
created by committee or with the heavy interference of executives.
``Malcolm'' was the product of Boomer, who created a distinctive
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a writer's singular vision is everything,'' Berman
said. The family in the show, she added, struck a chord among
viewers who seem to identify with it. ``Everything isn't tied into
a neat bow. But they're doing their best. They're working hard. And
the parents love each other and love their children. It's a pretty
accurate description of many families.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile there is the wave of ``reality programming'' to
contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get ahead of the curve and not just do
something in the wake of `Survivor' and `Big Brother,''' she said.
``We have to come up with new and better and original stuff and not
just try to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Fox was the home for precursors to these shows.
``Frankly our highest-rated show last week was `Cops,''' she said,
pointing to the long-running series that features videos of police
officers hunting down crime suspects. That show, as well as
``America's Most Wanted,'' has made Saturday one of the network's
strongest nights.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem a long way from Broadway, but Berman said she
planned to return one day to New York to produce theater again.
``As difficult as it was, I was living my fantasy doing it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say she hasn't found a home in her new world.
``There are things you can do on television that you can't do
anywhere else,'' she said.

ADVERTISING: CLAIROL TAPS BRITNEY SPEARS FOR HERBAL ESSENCES LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clairol lady just got younger _ she's now just 18, to be
exact.
</P>
<P>
   After years of working with more mature celebrities, Clairol, a
unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb, will feature the pop singer Britney
Spears in a new print and television advertising campaign for its
Herbal Essences shampoo line. In a special coup for Clairol, the
singer has recorded her own song for the brand called ``I've Got
the Urge to Herbal'' that is featured in 60-second radio spots and
is part of a preconcert video presentation during Spears' 50-city
summer concert tour, which Herbal Essences is sponsoring.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old Spears is one of the youngest endorsers for
Clairol, which has had a long association with celebrity
spokeswomen like Linda Evans for Ultress in the 1980s, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus of ``Seinfeld'' for Nice 'n Easy in the 1990s, and
now Debra Messing of NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' also for Nice 'n Easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, Clairol's business had been in hair color, and
hair color traditionally had an older demographic that called for
older spokespeople _ of course, these days everyone uses hair
color,'' said Andrew Shepard, senior director of marketing for hair
care and skin care at Clairol.
</P>
<P>
   The Herbal Essences campaign with Spears is a special effort
designed for teen-age girls, but the brand will continue its
broader, long-standing campaign aimed at females from 16 to 49.
That campaign, themed ``A totally organic experience,'' features
women who simulate sexual ecstasy while shampooing, usually in an
inappropriate setting like a crowded airliner, and has been
credited with helping make the brand one of the leading
shampoo-conditioners. It also helped build the reputation of its ad
agency creators, the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, which was
formed in 1997 and was acquired last year by what is now the B Com3
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age girls are an important audience in hair care partly
because they are heavier users of the products, Shepard said. He
noted that Herbal Essences had always marketed to teen-agers by
running its advertising in teen-appropriate media, and had begun to
use music marketing last year. But this is the first time the brand
has a full-scale campaign aimed specifically at the younger
audience and it is the brand's first celebrity endorser.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a natural extension of earlier marketing work, Larry
Lucas, the Herbal Essences senior manager, said. Last year, Herbal
Essences sponsored the concert tour of the pop band 'N Sync, and
found music to be such an effective way to reach teen-agers that
the company began seeking out a musical tie-in for this year, he
said. While 'N Sync worked well, the band did not endorse the
product and the only advertising that ran was related to the
concert tour, Lucas said. In contrast, Spears brings a beauty
perspective to the relationship, and will appear in advertising
beyond the concert tour and into mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an opportunity to sponsor a female performer
that looks as great as Britney Spears, you can take the
relationship to the next level,'' he said. ``She's upbeat and
energetic, all the things that fit our brand personality.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Herbal Essences brings more than just a
concert sponsorship to Spears, said Robin Koval, Kaplan Thaler
executive vice president and director of account services.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's trying to make her image a bit more sophisticated and
glamorous, and Clairol is a big name in the beauty world,'' Koval
said.
</P>
<P>
   The television advertising is not completed yet, but print ads
will appear in August in Teen People, Seventeen and YM magazines.
The ads are classic beauty layouts, featuring the golden-tressed
Spears in cover girl poses with headlines such as ``Does this look
like a girl who stays home Friday nights to wash her hair?'' The
answer is yes, because she can't resist Herbal Essences.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal Essences is the nation's second-best-selling shampoo with
roughly 8 percent of the $1.7 billion market, according to
Information Resources Inc., a Chicago market research firm. The
market leader, Procter &AMP; Gamble's Pantene Pro V shampoo, has a 14
percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Unit sales of Herbal Essences were down 2.5 percent for the year
ended May 21, while Pantene's sales were up 3.7 percent, the
Information Resources numbers showed. Other top products in the
market, which was stagnant over all, were P &AMP; G's Head &AMP; Shoulders,
down 5 percent in unit sales; Unilever's Suave shampoo, down about
1 percent; and Unilever's ThermaSilk Shampoo, up 14.4 percent. The
new campaign, however, will promote the full Herbal Essences line,
which accounts for some $329 million in total sales; included are a
conditioner as well as body products like a moisturizer and a body
wash.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal Essences represents an unusually successful product
reinvention, according to Carol Davies, managing partner at Kane,
Bortree &AMP; Associates, a New York marketing firm. Created in the
1970s, the brand had virtually disappeared by 1995, when it was
reintroduced with a new formulation, new packaging and a
contemporary ad campaign. (The original version is still available
under the name Herbal Essence.)
</P>
<P>
   The new Herbal Essences captured the trend toward natural, often
fruit-based fragrances, as epitomized in the success of brands like
Bath &AMP; Body Works, which are sold in mall shops of the same name,
she said. And the trend shows no signs of waning, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural is as big as ever _ consumers love it,'' Davies said.

WOODS COMPLETES CAREER GRAND SLAM
</HEADLINE>
 By CLIFTON BROWN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ For the second time in two months, Tiger
Woods rewrote the record book and reaffirmed his place in golf
history.
</P>
<P>
   With an eight-stroke victory at the 129th British Open, Woods,
24, became the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam,
winning all four major championships. Woods has also won the 1997
Masters, the 1999 PGA Championship, and this year's U.S. Open,
which he won by 15 strokes, the largest victory margin in major
championship history.
</P>
<P>
   Only five players have captured the career Grand Slam _ Woods,
Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus. But nobody
has done it more quickly, or more decisively than Woods. Sunday's
winning score of 19 under 269 set a British Open record in relation
to par, surpassing Nick Faldo's winning score of 18 under in 1990.
Woods now holds three major championship scoring records, the
Masters (18 under), the U.S. Open (12 under) and Sunday's record,
which was accomplished at a symbolic setting, the Old Course at St.
Andrews, where golf has been played for centuries, but where no one
has played it quite like Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the world's best players, Woods cruised to victory
ahead of Ernie Els and Thomas Bjorn, who tied for second place at
11 under. It was another performance that left Woods in a familiar
place, in a class by himself. At an age when most people are
starting careers, Woods has become a legend in his career. After
hoisting and kissing the claret jug, the trophy awarded to the
winner of golf's oldest major championship, Woods admitted he had
captured the career Grand Slam even faster than he had anticipated
when he turned professional in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I've had a wonderful young career, and hopefully I can
continue to have success,'' said Woods, who won $759,150, and
became the first player to win two consecutive majors since Nick
Price won the British Open and the PGA Championship in 1994.
``There's no substitute for understanding what it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to put into words the emotions and feelings
going through me. To complete the Slam at St. Andrews, where golf
all started, makes it even more special.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the final round with a six-stroke lead, Woods never led
by less than three strokes in the final round. He pulled away by
making birdies on three of his first five holes on the back nine,
showing the consistency that has been his trademark at recent major
championships. Woods made just one bogey Sunday, on No. 17, the
famous Road Hole, one of the world's hardest par 4s.
</P>
<P>
   How controlled was Woods' game? There are 112 bunkers on the Old
Course, but Woods avoided all of them for 72 holes. And by making
his final six-foot putt at No. 18, Woods completed his fourth
consecutive round in the 60s (67, 66, 67, 69), something he had
never done at a major.
</P>
<P>
   At this point Woods' peers are wondering what it will take to
beat him, acknowledging that he is the world's best player, by a
wide margin that appears to be growing. Woods has won 13 of his
last 23 starts on the PGA Tour, and he already has 21 career
victories. The record that Woods most covets belongs to Nicklaus,
who won an unprecedented 18 professional majors. But with four
majors already, and winning at a faster pace than Nicklaus did, no
record in golf appears to be out of Woods' grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago that I said there would not be another
Jack Nicklaus, but in fact we are looking at one,'' said Mark
Calcavecchia, winner of the 1989 British Open who tied for 26th
place Sunday. ``He is the chosen one. He is the best player who has
played the game right now, and he is only 24. Jack Nicklaus was the
greatest of all time, and when all is said and done, he still might
have the greatest record. But if Jack was in his prime today, I
don't think he could keep up with Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the world's No. 2 ranked player, could not keep up
with Woods Sunday. Woods and Duval were paired together in the last
group, the first time they had ever played together in the final
round of a major. The showdown started well for Duval, who birdied
four of the first seven holes, despite missing an 18-inch putt at
No. 5, and closing his deficit to three strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But a huge turning point came at the par 4, 379-yard No. 10.
Woods reached the green on his drive, then left his putt for eagle
10 feet short. Then after Duval left a 15-foot putt for birdie just
short, Woods made a 14-footer for birdie to take a four-stroke
lead. Then at the par 4, 314-yard No. 12, Woods extended his lead
back to six strokes, when he birdied and Duval bogeyed. Woods drove
the green again, then two-putted. Meanwhile, Duval's drive was
short of the green, he left a poor chip still 50 feet short of the
cup, and from there, he three-putted.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was six strokes ahead with six holes left to play, and
Duval knew it was Woods' day. But at the Road Hole, the day took a
cruel turn for Duval, who made a quadruple bogey after hitting his
third shot into the Road Hole bunker. It took Duval four attempts
to escape the bunker, which is about six feet high. His first two
tries hit the wall of the bunker and came back. Then Duval was
forced to take a back-hand swipe at the ball in the sand, giving
him enough room to finally hit the ball just over the bunker's top
lip. That regrettable episode tumbled Duval into a tie for 11th
place at 7 under. But there was no doubt in Duval's mind, or anyone
else's, about who was No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a spectacular performance, to say the least,'' Duval
said. ``He simply did not make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Woods walked down the 18th fairway, he was saluted with
applause from fans in the grandstands, and from the crowded gallery
beside the green, which included his mother, Tida, and his
girlfriend, Joanna Jagoda.
</P>
<P>
   Another milestone had been reached, another challenge had been
met. Meanwhile, there was increased anticipation for the year's
final major, the PGA Championship in Louisville, Ky., where Woods
will attempt to become the first player to win three majors in one
year since 1953, when Hogan won the Masters, the U.S. Open and the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday evening, Woods was content to savor a week that had
ended the way he had hoped, with the claret jug in his hands and
with more goals in sight. Asked how he felt, Woods smiled, and gave
a three-word response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too bad.''  &QL;

AN ANGERED ARMSTRONG ANSWERS CRITICS WITH ANOTHER TOUR TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Lance Armstrong made it official Sunday, winning his
second consecutive Tour de France as easily as he did his first.
This victory pleased him more, he said, since he viewed it as
confirmation of his talent, proof that the first triumph was not a
fluke, as he thought was implied by some rivals who were absent
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's here, the critical ones were here,'' Armstrong
said Sunday before the last of 21 daily stages. ``Everybody was on
the start line'' July 1 when the 87th Tour began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't answer their criticism last year but I heard it,
thought about it,'' Armstrong said. ``If I did answer it, I
answered it simply, subtly. I said, `They'll see. We'll see.' It
was good for me to have that over the winter, in the spring, before
the Tour _ it was good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Channeling his anger, the 28-year-old leader of the U.S. Postal
Service team crushed his rivals in the first major individual test
on July 10, the Hautacam climb in the Pyrenees _ ``It was
full-on,'' Armstrong says now, ``full-on aggression'' _ and he
remained virtually untouchable thereafter in a 6-minute-2-second
victory that seemed as lucid and inevitable as a Bach suite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's stage, the traditional mass sprint that closes the
race was won by Stefano Zanini, an Italian with the Mapei team who
is usually the pacesetter for Mapei's top sprinter, Tom Steels. But
Steels dropped out of the Tour two weeks ago after scoring two
victories, so Zanini was free to ride for himself Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He finished half a wheel ahead of Erik Zabel, a German with
Telekom who ended a three-year victory drought on Saturday. Third
was Roman Vainsteins, a Latvian with Vini Caldirola. They and
nearly all the rest of the 128-man field finished the 87-mile 21st
stage in 3:12:36. Robbie McEwen, an Australian with Farm Frites who
won in Paris last year, was eighth this time.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong rode serenely in the pack to record his second
successive Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   He saw the sights of Paris on his way to the top step on the
victory podium. There was the Eiffel Tower as the starting point
for the first time, followed by such tourist spots as the Louvre,
the Place de la Bastille, the new Opera, the Hotel de Ville, or
city hall, and finally 12 passages along the broad Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his teammates and easy to notice because of his
yellow jersey as the race's leader, Armstrong crossed the final
line in a discreet 76th place. He finished the 3,660-kilometer
(2,774-mile) race, generally considered the toughest endurance
event in sports, in a total of 92:33:08.
</P>
<P>
   So Armstrong remains No. 1, four years after a diagnosis of
testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain
and that he needed three months of chemotherapy and a year off from
the sport to arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Like his first victory, this one was marked by panache, the
flair that Bernard Hinault, five times a winner of the Tour, has
described as ``the cherry on top of the cake.'' Last year,
Armstrong won a long time trial and the first stage in the Alps
back to back. This year, he generously allowed a major foe, Marco
Pantani, to pass him at the finish line for victory in the climb of
Mont Ventoux.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture worked out badly. The Italian climber, whom the
Texan regards as one of those absentees from last year who did not
respect his victory, said after the Ventoux climb that he did not
need any help to win and that indeed he had received none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret Mont Ventoux,'' Armstrong said Saturday. ``I felt I
was the strongest rider there but I also respected him then and
thought he deserved the honor of winning a monument. I still
respect him as an athlete, a rider, a climber. He's the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I'm in a position to give a gift next time, he ain't
getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was spoken like a patron, as the riders call the dominant
rider who sets down the informal rules of the race. Armstrong
rejects the role. ``There hasn't been a patron in years,'' he said.
``The last one was Hinault. Racing has changed.'' Hinault retired
in 1986. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Armstrong, a Texan, is in the classic mold of the patron. He
intimidates his opponents with his supple power in the mountains
and time trials, convincing them that their attacks will not
succeed. So why try? His physical superiority was evident
throughout this tour except on the last of three days in the Alps
and there he lost only two minutes of his seven-and-a-half-minute
lead.
</P>
<P>
   He dominated, he said, over a course that did not please him.
``Last year's course was almost perfect for me: not a lot of
climbing relatively, two long time trials _ good time trials for
me, in Metz, rolling hills, perfect,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this Tour de France, it's almost as if they designed it
for other guys,'' he said. Lots of climbing, one time trial and the
time trial in Jan's hometown.'' Be was referring to Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, it was less stressful for me this year,'' he said.
``The innuendo, the controversy,'' _ meaning the suspicions about
the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs that were widespread
in the 1999 Tour _ ``there was none of it this year. Physically, it
was more stressful. It was a harder Tour, harder for me, more
mountains.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has any complaints now. Asked if he could remember
disappointments in the three-week race, Armstrong thought long and
hard. ``The team time trial,'' he finally said. ``I thought we
could win the team time trial.'' The U.S. Postal Service team
finished second among the 20 teams, not really much of a
disappointment to anybody but Armstrong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Virgo,'' he said. ``Always looking for perfection.''

 &HT;    TV getting more diverse _ but is it enough?
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This fall, when CBS launches a new version of ``The
Fugitive,'' the guy doing the running (actor Tim Daly) will, as
always, be white.
</P>
<P>
   But the guy doing the chasing will be black. Actor Mykelti
Williamson, who played Forrest Gump's shrimp-lovin' buddy Bubba,
will play the dogged cop, Lt. Gerard.
</P>
<P>
   He's part of a small wave of African-Americans in more
noticeable roles on the TV series premiering in the fall, a result
of pressure put on the networks by the NAACP a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some new shows this fall that show some promise. I
really think there's been some movement,'' says Doug Alligood,
senior vice president at BBDO, a major ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   Among the black faces coming in the fall: Andre Braugher
(``Homicide'') stars as a doctor in ABC's highly integrated medical
drama ``Gideon's Crossing;'' David Allen (``In Living Color'')
plays a hapless Secret Service agent protecting the first lady in
the NBC sitcom ``DAG''; and dramas ``The District'' (about
Washington, D.C., cops) and ``Boston Public'' (about a Boston high
school) feature fully integrated casts. UPN, which already has some
African-American comedies, adds another, ``Girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, change is happening, but it's not enough,'' NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume said last month in a speech. ``Television is
showing more people of color, but most important is off-screen,
where very little has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume and the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People brought the issue (which has waxed and waned in
attention over the years) to the fore a year ago, noting that there
were hardly any minority characters in television's freshman class
of 1999 shows. The networks subsequently signed various agreements
with the NAACP without actually committing to quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Both NAACP leaders and network executives didn't return numerous
phone calls seeking comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Grier says there was ``a completely different climate'' this
year when the networks were developing shows, and that black actors
and writers talked about how much more they were being courted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very much a result of the NAACP,'' says Robert
Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the Study of
Popular Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (TV) people were embarrassed and ashamed by what the
NAACP report showed. I think the networks should be pleased to say,
'Yes, we had a wake-up call and we're trying to do something about
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to adding more African-Americans into the new fall
shows, CBS also renewed ``City of Angels,'' the predominantly black
hospital drama that has struggled in the ratings since its premiere
in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly German, a copy editor at CNN, e-mailed CBS twice last
season when ``Angels'' was on the verge of cancellation. ``I think
it's a quality show and should stay on the air,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested the network move ``Angels'' off Wednesday night
because ``that's a night many black people are having Bible study
or church services.'' CBS has since moved the series to 9 p.m.
Thursdays, where it will remain in this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But while African-Americans will be seen in increasing numbers
this fall, Latinos are frustrated by their lack of comparable
progress. Apparently the only Latinos in new series are Jessica
Alba, star of Fox's ``Dark Angel'' and Ruben Blades in ``Gideon's
Crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're happy that African-Americans seem to be doing
better this fall, we arguably are as bad as we were when this
situation first started,'' says Lisa Navarette, spokeswoman for the
National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, television has been more open to blacks than
Latinos and remains so despite rapid Latino growth in the U.S.
population. Whites currently make up about 72 percent of the U.S.
population, blacks 12.2 percent and Latinos 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Latino population surge, the share of jobs remains
about 2 percent, according to a new study by the Screen Actors
Guild titled ``Still Missing: Latinos In and Out of Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry has had a kind of dichotomous approach to
race: race is often equated with African-Americans,'' says Jesus
Salvador Trevino, director of Showtime's Latino drama
``Resurrection Blvd.'' ``In another five years, nationally, we will
be the largest minority. Looking at television, we're virtually
non-existent.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``Resurrection Blvd.'' plays on the pay-cable channel
Showtime is a mini-trend within the overall trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable is now the test kitchen for innovative programming''
says Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Showtime launch ``Resurrection'' last month, it
also debuted ``Soul Food,'' a multigenerational black drama. And
kids channel Nickelodeon has two Hispanic-oriented shows: ``The
Brothers Garcia,'' a comedy about a family in San Antonio that
premiered Sunday, and ``Dora the Explorer,'' a cartoon aimed at
pre-schoolers about a young Latina coming Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some confusion among the networks, thinking that
Latinos want their shows in Spanish,'' says BBDO's Alligood,
referring to the popularity of Univision and Telemundo. ``But
that's just not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers understand the marketplace is diversified. They
want to reach all races, almost without exception'' says Alligood.
But, he adds, ``Advertisers are saying we would like to see more
diversity, but they're not forcing it. The agencies are saying the
clients don't want to get involved in telling the networks what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversity issue gets trickier when observers talk about the
types of characters on TV and not just the numbers.
African-Americans actually are over-represented, says Darnell Hunt,
director of African-American Studies at the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   While blacks are 13 percent of the U.S. population, they're 16
percent of the characters on TV, according to Hunt's study of 384
TV episodes in 1999. He found that 44 percent of African-American
characters were on the WB and UPN, and more than half appeared in
sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   These comedies, such as ``The Parkers'' and ``The Jamie Foxx
Show,'' while very popular among African-Americans, are also
sometimes criticized for their broad comedy. Hunt doesn't echo that
criticism, but says the high number of black characters in WB and
UPN comedies amounts to ``ghettoization.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Steve Harvey, whose WB sitcom ``The Steve Harvey Show''
is frequently referred to as a ``black show,'' bristles at that
shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be 'the black show,' '' he told an audience
of ad buyers at the WB's upfront presentation in May. ``I wish the
media and America would stop labeling us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new study by the non-profit group Children Now, titled
``Fall Colors: How Prime Time TV Deals With Race,'' found that
``characters of color are not as well-developed as white
characters,'' says senior associate Kevin Donegan.
</P>
<P>
   Even in shows with diversity, Donegan says, ``characters of
color are less likely to be integral to the story lines,
particularly in dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Syracuse's Thompson : ``You want more diversity, and then
you want diversity to take place in shows that are good, not
embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you get so diversified that you can put an
African-American idiot on as well as an African-American brain
surgeon, we're going to have a comment on everything that comes
out.''

E-COMMERCE REPORT: ONLINE RETAILERS ARE STREAMLINING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, retailers hailed the Internet as the ideal
self-service medium, a place where they could set up shop, post
thousands of pages of product information and give scarcely a
thought to spending on customer service.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of cheap and easy customer service on the
Internet turned out to be a hollow promise. When companies extol
one-to-one relationships with their customers _ as when retailers
know your name and your purchase history as soon as you reach the
Web site's front page _ customers expect the same level of
personalized service when something goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web retailers have set up enormous call centers to deal
with the problem. But for traditional retailers, the task is much
more complicated. Customers naturally think that whether they give
their credit cards to a store clerk, a catalog telephone
representative or a Web site, they are dealing with one company.
And they expect to be able to get help from any of those sources,
no matter where in the company's supply chain they made a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, traditional retailers had little reason in the
past to keep individualized records of purchases. Instead, they
focused on which products moved off the shelves most quickly, and
designed their technology systems accordingly. So if a consumer
asks a customer service representative at a catalog about a
purchase at a store or on the Web, the chances are the catalog will
have no record.
</P>
<P>
   In retailing parlance, this issue falls under the heading of
``channel synchronization.'' In the last several months, some of
the more forward-looking bricks-and-mortar companies have begun the
long and expensive process of synchronizing their catalog, Web and
retail operations. And though it may take time to refine these
systems, the retailers hope the effort will yield not only better
service for consumers, but higher profits for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies is Borders Inc., which operates Borders and
Waldenbooks bookstores and an online store, www.borders.com. Gordon
Eiland, Borders' vice president for strategic planning, said the
company was gathering all its purchasing information into one
database. ``Right now, everything's scattered in computer files
throughout the company,'' Eiland said.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland said the central database, planned for completion in the
next five months, would enable the company to track a customer's
purchase history across each of the Borders divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to use that information to make book and music
recommendations to individual customers via e-mail and its Web
site, and to eventually enable representatives to respond to
queries whether the customers came to Borders on foot, by phone or
through the Internet. If they ordered books at a store, for
instance, they would be able to go to the Web and check the status
of that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to fix problems on the front end to make sure they
don't happen,'' Eiland said. ``But when customers do need service,
you need to make sure it's outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say synchronized systems are even more crucial for
retailers dealing with products that have high return rates _ like
apparel _ or categories in which service after a purchase is
important, like consumer electronics and computers. But that does
not mean most businesses are yet following the example of Borders
and the other companies that have begun to synchronize their
customer databases, including Home Depot, IBM and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, less than 10 percent of traditional retailers
had integrated their customer service systems,'' said Bob Chatham,
an analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm.
``And that state of affairs hasn't gotten much better. Companies
have been under so much pressure to produce revenue, the idea of
synchronizing customer service has been pushed down the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatham said that in a recent Forrester survey of 12,000 online
shoppers, 40 percent said they would use more than one route to
customer service. ``So companies are kidding themselves if they
think consumers won't demand a synchronized experience,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But companies have plenty of reasons to be reluctant to
undertake such an effort. First, it can cost $10 million to $20
million for a large retailer to install what is commonly known as
customer resource management technology, or CRM.
</P>
<P>
   CRM vendors like Siebel Systems, E.piphany and Xchange charge
much less than $10 million for their software. But before the
software can work, companies must build central databases, as
Borders is doing, and then integrate the CRM applications with a
patchwork of computer systems that often predate the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To get a CRM effort off the ground, executives must also
persuade managers within different divisions to support a
companywide task that will do little to improve the short-term
revenue of their operations. In companies in which the Web store
might already be seen as a black hole of technology spending,
mustering support for a synchronization effort can be particularly
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   To entice executives to proceed anyway, many sellers of CRM
software promote its potential to improve the bottom line. With
E.piphany software, for example, a customer service representative
not only sees what the customer has bought from a retailer's
various divisions but can receive tips for offering the customer
upgrades, free products or discounts _ and then convey those offers
by phone, through e-mail or even in an online chat.
</P>
<P>
   If the customer has bought inexpensive items and returned
products repeatedly, the customer service person might decide to
forgo the sales effort altogether, saving the time to spend on more
potentially profitable customers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that for most traditional retailers, such an
integrated service-and-sales approach was at least two years away.
But those who do synchronize their customer service systems could
emerge with a sizable advantage over their competitors, whether
they are of the bricks or the clicks variety.

   Mike Anderson, vice president for information systems at Home
Depot, said the company recognized the advantage of the
synchronized technology approach two years ago. ``Customers move
around _ especially the professional customers,'' Anderson said.
``So we saw a real need to centralize the customer information
databases.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, which also owns EXPO Design Centers, an upscale
furnishings retailer, will be one of the last major retailers in
the United States to enter the world of e-commerce, when it begins
taking orders via its Web site later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But because it has a centralized database, Anderson said, the
company will eventually be able to offer a more seamless customer
service experience to the approximately 50 million people who are
in the Home Depot database as a result of making special orders or
registering for credit.
</P>
<P>
   The database should also allow the company to better analyze
customer buying patterns and to tailor its merchandising
accordingly, Anderson said. ``This will be a tremendously powerful
thing for us,'' he said.

 &HT;    Florida invests in wildlife preservation
 &HT;    By Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a busy stretch of Interstate 75 near Ocala, Fla., a
piece of man-made wilderness is rising above the highway.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens in September, a 17-foot-high and 52-foot-wide
bridge will be lined with native oaks, pines and saw palmettos. A
path made of finely crushed oyster shells will run down the middle
of the 200-foot-long span.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.2 million elevated nature trail will re-connect two
pieces of the Cross Florida Greenway that were split 30 years ago
by highway construction.
</P>
<P>
   By day, hikers, bicyclists and horseback riders will once again
be able to traverse the 110-acre recreation and conservation area
without having to stop for a speeding car or truck.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark of night, deer, foxes and possums can scamper across
the bridge to avoid becoming roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   The ``land bridge'' _ the first ever built in the United States
_ is the latest example of efforts by state and federal
transportation departments to protect wildlife along highways and
link fragmented natural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, special crossings have been built for
Florida panthers on Alligator Alley and State Road 29 in southwest
Florida and for black bears on SR 46 in north central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are in the works to build additional bear underpasses
along roadways in the Wekiva River Basin northwest of Orlando and
crossings for deer along U.S. 1 in the Florida Keys. Work will
begin next year on a second land bridge along I-95 in Flagler
County to join the Florida Agricultural Museum with the Princess
Place Preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge just south of Ocala sits on land where the Cross
Florida Barge Canal was once envisioned. Construction of the canal
began in 1935, but was stopped a year later because of a lack of
money. Work resumed in 1964, but a series of lawsuits that claimed
the project would destroy natural habitats led to its demise in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took something that was environmentally unsound and was
going to destroy nature and turned it back into something good,''
DOT project engineer Alan Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   But wildlife advocates and environmentalists say much more needs
to be done in planning new highways and rebuilding old ones to make
them more environmentally friendly. Roads should not run through
preserve areas, they say, but if there is no other alternative
roads should be built on pilings to cause the least disruption to
wildlife in their natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do it right at the outset, we're going to pay in
the future with the loss of important, significant resources,''
said Laurie Macdonald, state representative for Defenders of
Wildlife, a national, nonprofit conservation organization. ``I
don't think there's too many places in the state where you can go
where there are no roads.''
</P>
<P>
   LOSS OF BOTH HUMAN AND ANIMAL LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Each year, millions of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds
are killed on the nation's highways while looking for food or
trying to reach mating or nesting sites. Many are slow-moving
tortoises and snakes that aren't as popular as endangered species,
like the panther and black bear, but an important part of regional
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The problem also affects motorists' safety. More than 200 people
are killed and thousands injured annually in vehicle collisions
with animals, according to the Federal Highway Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Public awareness of the need to blend wildlife conservation into
transportation projects has increased significantly in the past few
years, according to federal ecologist Paul Garrett. The $218
billion Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA-21,
approved by Congress two years ago provides $3 billion to states
for environmental enhancements. ``Critter crossings'' were added as
an eligible improvement, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, scientists are studying how desert tortoises use
storm drains to move under a highway in the Mojave Desert.
Researchers in Massachusetts are monitoring how roadway tunnels aid
spotted salamanders on their annual migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is one of the states that has been very active in this
area,'' Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more innovative projects is located at the Paynes
Prairie State Preserve near Gainesville. Thousands of animals from
80 different species were killed every year on a 2-mile stretch of
U.S. 441 that runs through the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   A 3.5-foot wall with a 6-inch lip at the top _ similar to walls
in zoo serpentariums _ prevents animals from reaching the highway.
Animals move along the wall to one of eight underpasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do the studies up front to know where to place the
crossings, wildlife will use them,'' said state ecologist Gary
Evink. ``I think people see enough dead animals along the roads to
realize this is something we need to be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   BLENDING INTO NATURE
</P>
<P>
   The land bridge on I-75 in Marion County was modeled after
wildlife overpasses in the Netherlands called ecoducts. The
ecoducts link natural areas that were split by highways and are
part of migratory routes for moose and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they went to great extremes to give the
bridge a sense of ``natural connectivity'' so it blends into the
surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   Stones covering the walls were gathered from horse farms around
Ocala. Mature pines and oaks aren't found in plant nurseries, and
some of the trees are being imported from Arizona, said the DOT's
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect quite a few animals will use it, if they have a
strong urge to get across the highway,'' said Dave Bowman, a
wildlife biologist at the state Department of Environmental
Protection
</P>
<P>
   But MacDonald of Defenders of Wildlife said it's too early to
tout the bridge as an environmental success. MacDonald said she
wonders if animals will use the same path tromped on by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say it won't work,'' she said. ``It may be
trying to serve too many purposes, but I give a lot of credit to
the people in the state who are trying to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   State environmentalists are sure it will work. Workers building
the bridge said they've already found animal tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there are skeptics so we can prove them wrong,'' Bryant
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 panther crossings on the western end of Alligator Alley _
the highway connecting Fort Lauderdale and Naples _ cost about $20
million. They were put in more about 10 years ago as part of a $350
million road widening project.
</P>
<P>
   At each crossing, the road was raised or a bridge was built over
a low spot, creating an 8-foot-high, 120-foot-wide pathway for the
panthers and other animals. Fences along the road direct animals to
the crossings. Before the work was done, biologists monitored the
panthers' movements with radio-tracking collars and put the
pathways where the animals usually crossed the road.
</P>
<P>
   No panthers have been killed or injured on Alligator Alley or SR
29 since the crossings were installed, according to Darrell Land, a
research team leader with the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission. Before that, several panthers were killed
or injured each year on the two roads, Land said.
</P>
<P>
   State engineers and biologists followed a similar plan to design
the black bear underpass on SR 46 in Lake County. The 8-foot-high,
24-foot-wide dirt-floor tunnel was put at the spot where bears were
most often hit by cars while crossing the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The state spent about $3 million to buy 40 acres of
privately-owned land in the bears' travel corridor to put in the
crossing, Evink said. So far, no bears have been hit near the
crossing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bear underpass is ``a great first step,'' but the state
needs to build additional crossings along the road which runs
through the Ocala National Forest, said Jennifer McMurtray, the
transportation and wildlife ecology coordinator for Defenders of
Wildlife. State officials said another $4 million to $5 million is
available over the next few years for additional bear crossings in
this area.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a 1.5-mile stretch of the road in the most
densely-populated area of the preserve should be raised, McMurtray
said. Highway officials said that's too costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underpasses are great for big animals like bears, but the
average snake or mouse is not able to travel four miles to cross
the road safely,'' McMurtray said.
</P>
<P>
   JOINT EFFORT OF STATE AND UNIVERSITY
</P>
<P>
   DOT officials have been working with University of Florida
scientists to develop a set of guidelines to use in deciding where
to build future wildlife crossings and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   A geographic information system lets transportation planners
identify roadkill ``hot spots'' around the state. As well, UF
researchers are conducting field studies to evaluate the usefulness
of existing crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The state will only build crossings that connect publicly-owned
land, Evink said. ``We don't want a McDonald's or a housing
development popping up next to a wildlife crossing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both environmentalists and highway officials admit there is so
much more they can learn about the problems associated with
transportation and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beginning to understand what we need to do to in
planning roadway projects and we ought to be implementing better
plans,'' MacDonald said. ``It's not good for people in cars to hit
animals on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Highway Administration has sponsored three
international conferences on the topic and a fourth meeting is
tentatively planned for next year. Last year's conference in
Missoula, Mont., brought together more than 300 people to share
information on various solutions, both those that been successful
and those that have have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Administration ecologist Garrett said despite the gatherings,
``I don't think we'll ever get to the point where we prevent all
wildlife mortality.''

IN GUERNICA, DETERMINATION TO `FORGIVE, BUT NEVER FORGET'
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., this was filed on July 7 as GUERNICA-DOCUMENTARY, and held.
It is now released and is being repeated for all needing.)  
 By HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUERNICA, Spain _ Strolling around the serene square of this
Basque town not far north of Bilbao, it is hard to imagine the
scene as it was some 60 years ago, when an indelible atrocity took
place here on the eve of World War II. Only a few outward marks of
physical devastation are still visible, but the human damage
remains embedded in people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   If you tap the memories of the survivors of the German bombing
during the Spanish Civil War, and listen to local officials and
historians who are trying to turn one of the symbols of fascist
militarism into a place of peace and reconciliation, the day is
always April 26, 1937. That Monday _ a crowded market day when
farmers from nearby villages came to Guernica to sell and exchange
livestock and produce _ was deliberately chosen by the Luftwaffe to
inflict the greatest number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new documentary film, ``The Bombing of Guernica: The Mark
of Men,'' has been produced by a peace research center here and is
being offered to public and commercial broadcasting stations all
over the world. It includes the voices of the people who survived
the attack. (The Basques call their most sacred town Gernika;
elsewhere, it's known by its Spanish name.)
</P>
<P>
   Before the civil war, Spain's Republican government commissioned
Picasso to create a painting for its pavilion at the Paris World's
Fair. After learning of the bombing, Picasso said, ``The painting
that I am presently working on will be called `Guernica.' Through
it, I express my abhorrence of the race that has sunk Spain in an
ocean of pain and death.'' Working steadily in 1937, he laid out
``Guernica'' in a matter of weeks, creating an apocalyptic scene of
grotesque and mutilated human and animal figures depicted in tones
of black, white and gray. The painting now hangs behind bulletproof
glass in its permanent home at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent exhibition at the Guernica Museum in the center of
town documents the bombing with photographs and artifacts,
including bomb fragments bearing German markings. On that fateful
market day a single fighter from the Luftwaffe's Condor Legion
circled the town, scouting the best targets. The bells from Santa
Maria Church alerted the townspeople that an air attack might be
coming. A month before, the Condor Legion had bombed the nearby
town of Durango, a center of communications and armaments factories
behind Republican lines. The people of Guernica immediately built
several flimsy wooden shelters, protected by sandbags, around the
town center.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing began at 4:30 p.m. and continued for three hours.
Low-flying Junkers transports, being used as bombers, appeared over
the horizon, coming in waves, unloading thousand-pound bombs and
thousands of incendiary projectiles. The German aicraft were
protected by Italian fighter planes, the first jointly-coordinated
attack by the forces of Hitler and Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Luftwaffe's fighter planes, machine-gunning
anything that moved. Guernica was flattened in a day; uncounted
hundreds of people died from the bombs, shrapnel and fires. Nobody
knew the exact number of casualties because the town's population
had swelled on that market day.
</P>
<P>
   On one wall of the Guernica Museum is a framed letter from
former President Roman Herzog of Germany, dated March 27, 1997. It
acknowledges that the Condor Legion was responsible for the attack.
``It was an indefensible act of aerial bombardment,'' the letter
says. ``The victims of this terrible atrocity suffered human
anguish. We renounce the bombardment by the German aviators and the
horror it caused. Now we call for reconciliation and peace between
our two peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of Picasso's working drawings for ``Guernica'' are also
on display in the museum. An accompanying note says he produced 25
sketches a month after the news of the bombing reached Paris. An
oil painting in the spirit of ``Guernica'' covers an entire wall of
the exhibition. This triptych by Sofia Gandarias, an artist
originally from Guernica, shows the devastation caused by the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks from the Guernica Museum, on the first floor of a
small office building in the town square, is the peace research
center named, in Basque, Gernika Gogoratuz (Guernica Remembered),
where the new documentary was created. ``The horror of that day
marks the survivors forever,'' the film's narration says in part.
``What is more, they were forced to conceal the truth about the
crime committed against them during the four decades that General
Franco's dictatorship held power. Now the survivors don't want the
remembrance of this horror to fall into oblivion.'' A slogan
accompanies the film: ``Forgive, but never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guernica Museum will become the first peace museum in
Spain, thanks to the support of the government,'' said Iratxe
Momoitio Astorkia, the museum's director.
</P>
<P>
   Above the town square is a park dedicated to peace and
reconciliation. It includes a bronze by Henry Moore called ``Great
Figure in a Shelter.'' The Moore, installed in 1990, was
commissioned by the Basque regional government and paid for by the
Madrid government. The sculpture recalls the helmeted figures that
Moore, a Loyalist sympathizer, created during the Spanish Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a peace monument, ``Our Father's House,'' by Eduardo
Chillida. A tall, semiabstract structure sheathed in concrete, it
was installed in 1988 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of a
historic moment that the people of Guernica hope will continue to
inspire those who seek to end the slaughter of innocent civilians
everywhere.

ELS MAKES HISTORY WITH A SECOND-PLACE FINISH IN THIRD MAJOR EVENT
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Besides Tiger Woods, Ernie Els also made
history Sunday at the British Open as the first golfer to finish
second in three consecutive major championships. Not that he is
particularly proud of having trailed Woods by eight strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing a different tournament,'' he said with a wry
smile. ``I play the regular tournament and Tiger plays his own
event. In one way it is incredible to watch a guy play so much
better than the rest of the world. In another way it is tough to
talk about him every time, but I guess I might have to get used to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 3-under-par 69 for 277, Els shared second with Thomas
Bjorn of Denmark. A 30-year-old from South African, Els had been
second to Woods in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and tied David
Duval for second behind the Masters winner, Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   In Woods' six PGA Tour victories this year, Els finished second
in four: the Mercedes Championship and the Memorial as well as the
two Opens. Els birdied four of the first five holes to move to 12
under par, five strokes behind Woods at the time. But he never made
another birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is awfully hard to keep that level of play up,'' he said of
his fast start. ``You're happy to make those birdies but you know
you've got to make many more. You try to push yourself harder and
harder and you know that if you keep on pushing, you start trying
too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being four under through five, I felt I had to keep going. I
hit good putts, but the putts did not go in. I guess I just tried
too hard instead of taking Tiger's philosophy _ just playing and
enjoying it. But we don't all have his ability, so it is tough at
times. It's tough to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let a birdie slip away on the 10th hole,'' he continued. ``I
was just short of the green. I did not get it up and down there.
The next hole I three-putted from 30 feet for a bogey and on the
12th, which is another birdie hole, I was actually fortunate just
to make par there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament started, Els hoped that the wind would
blow, but it never really did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have helped my game,'' he said, ``but it would have
helped Tiger's game also.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 Jack Nicklaus finished second or tied for second in
three majors _ the Masters (to Arnold Palmer), the British Open (to
Tony Lema) and the Professional Golfers' Association Championship
(to Bobby Nichols) _ but not in succession.
</P>
<P>
   If Els were to finish second again at the PGA Championship at
Valhalla outside Louisville, Ky., next month, he would complete a
second-place grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked how he played at Valhalla in the 1996 PGA
there, he shook his head and said, ``I played terrible there that
year.'' &QL;

AFTER DELAYS, IVORY COAST VOTERS ARE EXPECTED TO APPROVE NEW
CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Seven months after this country's first
military coup, Ivoirians voted Sunday on a new constitution
intended to restore civilian rule by laying out the guidelines for
elections starting in September.
</P>
<P>
   Voting for some of the Ivory Coast's 4.8 million voters was
marred by substantial enough delays and other problems that
balloting was extended until Monday. But with the country's three
major parties calling for a yes in the referendum, a new
constitution was expected to be adopted eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The voting took place after the country's military rulers
declared a state of emergency from Friday to Tuesday. There were no
reports of violence Sunday night. Still, most store owners had
chosen to remain closed throughout the day; fearing looting, some
store owners in a popular neighborhood had moved their goods to
stores in the wealthy corner of Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid,'' said Laure Nessou, 28, who had gone to vote at
7 a.m. but still not cast her ballot by 9 a.m. because of technical
delays in the neighborhood of Yopougon. ``I wanted to vote early
and go home quickly. I'm going to stay home all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Robert Guei, the leader of the junta that has ruled this
West African nation since last Christmas, has been campaigning hard
in favor of the proposed constitution, which was drawn up by a
committee set up by the military rulers. Guei personally made
last-minute changes to the text, tightening the requirements for
candidates in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The move was seen as an attempt by the general, who is widely
believed to want to run for the presidency, to exclude a rival,
Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister and deputy managing
director of the International Monetary Fund. An election for
president would be Sept. 17, if the draft constitution is approved,
followed by parliamentary and municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the people who drew up this constitution _ I don't see
any reason why the yes vote would not prevail,'' Guei said after
casting his ballot.
</P>
<P>
   If a yes vote did not seem in doubt, more uncertain was whether
the referendum would draw a turnout large enough to give the
document indisputable validity. The proposed constitution includes
many changes, from lowering the voting age to 18 from 21 to
granting immunity from prosecution to the coup and junta leaders,
who after a mutiny in the military over low pay seized power in
December charging that President Henri Konan Bedie was creating
ethnic division in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the text's most crucial changes focus on who can become a
candidate for president in the Ivory Coast. According to the draft
constitution, a presidential candidate must be born in the Ivory
Coast of a father and mother born in the Ivory Coast; what's more,
a candidate must have never availed himself of another nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara's opponents, including the toppled president, Bedie,
have said that his father was born in neighboring Burkina Faso and
that he once held Burkinabe citizenship. Ouattara, who has always
denied those claims, called on his supporters to endorse the draft
constitution under which he said he was fully eligible to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many of his followers still saw the draft
constitution as an attempt by Christian southerners to exclude
Muslim northerners like Ouattara. Many said Sunday they were voting
no.
</P>
<P>
   After casting his ballot Sunday, Ouattara did not disclose how
he had voted, saying only: ``We must take the next steps in peace,
Ivoirians must be allowed to choose their president in a
transparent manner and candidates must be permitted to participate
in the contest.''
</P>
<P>
   At a voting station in the sprawling neighborhood of Abobo,
Muhammad Sisse, 36, and Fanny Abdoulaye, 28, said they were
card-carrying members of Ouattara's party. They said they would
vote no, because they saw the draft constitution as a way to
marginalize Muslim northerners like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am voting no for my children,'' Sisse said. ``Why haven't we
started voting yet? They want to discourage us and make us go home.
It's the military that does not want to leave power.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the same line, Blaise Kouadio Yao, 29, said he
belonged to the party of former president Bedie. He was going to
vote yes, he said, because he wanted to make sure an Ivoirian
becomes president and he considered Ouattara an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot confide the direction of this country to an
opportunist,'' Yao said. ``The Ivory Coast is for Ivoirians.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Sparing the approaching Republican national
convention a civic eyesore, bulldozers are moving in on the last of
the 957 sinking homes of the Logan triangle, a stricken
working-class swath of north Philadelphia that has festered as an
urban disaster for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city suddenly told me I had to get out,'' said Suzette
Williams, hurriedly packing a moving van after 30 years on North
11th Street. This is the epicenter of a once vital 17-block
neighborhood that is now an inner-city prairie dotted with skeletal
buildings and a score of lingering residents of Logan's last stand.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old neighborhood's collapse into its own unstable
landfill is stark evidence that the vaunted Philadelphia
renaissance that is attracting the Republican conventioneers is at
least a tale of two cities: the glittering downtown of new hotels
and trendy restaurants, and frayed old working-class neighborhoods
like Logan, five miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens in poor, predominantly black areas complain that the
city leadership has been preoccupied with attracting downtown
tourists who stay overnight, rather than stemming the working-class
flight of some 250,000 residents in the last decade from
neighborhoods freighted with neglect.
</P>
<P>
   As the city government hurries to raze the Logan hulks, and even
mow the summer weeds on the ghostly 47-acre wasteland, what
remains, church and civic leaders are emphasizing, is a gaunt but
most inviting campaign backdrop for any venturesome presidential
contender who might want to stop by during the convention and speak
firsthand to the issue of inner-city housing for the working class
and striving poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush should come here and put some meat on the bones of
his compassionate conservatism,'' said the Rev. Kermit L. Newkirk,
pastor of the Harold O. Davis Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, city officials had promised to raze all 957 buildings
and to compensate and relocate the 5,000 residents within three
years. That was in 1986, when the crumbling neighborhood first
seized the city's attention with an explosion caused by an
underground gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   The initial prescription of relocation and redevelopment that
was supposed to take three years to accomplish is now in its 15th
year, having spawned a separate quasi-government agency with its
own patronage, retirement benefits and petty scandals.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, activists in this old-line Democratic
neighborhood have been politely courting Republican state
officials, some of whom have been responsive and credible, Newkirk
said. His frustration is clear after 14 years of struggling with
successive Democratic city administrations over the houses'
cracking and sinking as their landfill of ash heaps shifted with
saturation from an underground creek and ruptured utility pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Activists with assorted protest causes, from the global economy
to gay rights, will soon be arriving in the city to take to the
streets for the four-day Republican convention, opening on July 31.
But only Logan is offering a vivid on-site experience and
eyewitness guides through a tortured saga of neighborhood blight,
political promises and bureaucratic nostrums.
</P>
<P>
   When the opening gavel sounds at the convention center, Logan
will have its own uptown welcoming event. Handbills and public bus
advertising downtown will offer conventioneers graphic photos of
the devastation, and pose the question ``What is the Republican
response?''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the convention preparations have spurred city
officials into faster demolition action. ``We're getting rid of
everything over in Logan; I never want to hear that name again!'' a
city official shouted from his car last week at the Rev. Mary
Laney, of St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   The church serves the surrounding neighborhoods, where, Laney
noted, property values have become depressed and housing sales have
frozen. This is because of warnings that the nearby problem with
unstable landfill and underground piping may be spreading to as
many as 4,000 additional houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trapped here,'' said Michael Brown, who owns a home just
outside the officially defined area of sinkage, which some city
officials concede was arbitrary in the first place. He watched
Williams pack for her move from North 11th Street.
</P>
<P>
   He stood in front of his own house just 30 feet away and told of
the same problems of deep foundation cracks, sewage flooding in the
basement, and tilting, cracked walls and porch. ``My house is paid
for, but no one will buy it and no one will put up a mortgage for
it,'' Brown said, sounding desperate. ``You can't give my house
away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Logan's local leaders underline the news from City Hall that
Mayor John F. Street, a Democrat, will be attending the
neighborhood welcome, nine months after he campaigned in Logan
promising fresh initiative and $37 million in additional help for
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   This would roughly double what has been spent so far. Logan
activists criticize former Mayor W. Wilson Goode for his handling
of the initial crisis and former Mayor Edward G. Rendell for
managing Philadelphia's downtown renewal far more successfully than
Logan's.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bulldozing amounts to a victory for us,'' said Ceci
Schickel, chief organizer for Philadelphia Interfaith Action, a
regional church and civic association. The group has been working
with the Industrial Areas Foundation, a nationwide organization
that is trying to make a campaign issue of housing, low wages and
other problems of the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are in denial about complicated, massive problems
like Logan,'' said Mike Kecan, a foundation organizer. ``Their talk
of faith-based solutions is tokenism.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustrations in Logan were only compounded last summer when
some homes were ruled endangered in the city's predominantly white
Wissinoming neighborhood because of unstable landfill. Residents
affected by this far smaller problem involving a dozen homes
received relocation and compensation help within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had nothing but trouble for years trying to get my
money,'' Williams said after completing her packing. ``This is
still my community,'' she said as she departed.

   AGHJABEDI, Azerbaijan _ For the past eight years, through
relentless seasons, Ali Orudjev and his family have lived in a hole
in the ground. He and his wife, Samsiya, have watched helplessly as
two of their infants died because they could not afford medicine,
and they fear desperately for their surviving children, a tiny
5-year-old girl and a 1-year-old boy who rarely smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel ashamed because I can do nothing for my family and make
no money,'' said Orudjev, a trained veterinarian who was among
hundreds of thousands of his countrymen who fled the invasion by
neighboring Armenia into Azerbaijan's mountainous enclave of
Nagorno Karabakh in 1992. ``I'm afraid for the future of my kids. I
don't want them to grow up in a dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred refugees live here on treeless, desolate land in
south-central Azerbaijan. Their homes are, essentially, graves for
the living: pits carved by hand from the parched earth, 15 feet or
so wide, 20 feet long, 5 or 6 feet deep, covered with mud-caked
thatch and outfitted with a solitary wood platform for sleeping and
small windows for ventilation. They are neither cool in summer nor
warm in winter. Meant to be temporary, the holes have become
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The Orudjevs are among the poorest of the poor, banished to the
bottom of a population of 1 million refugees scattered throughout
40 or more camps in this former Soviet republic where promised oil
riches have yet to materialize and per capita income is less than
$2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the fighting stopped, the refugees remain victims of
a little-noticed war, insufficiently cared for by their government
and on the verge of abandonment by international aid organizations.
They live without running water, electricity or medical care in
railroad cars, tents, temporary prefabricated houses and holes in
the ground, surviving on a few dollars a month, on handouts and
heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping strong tea at a roadside cafe after touring refugee
camps, Gesche Karrenbrock, an official from the Geneva headquarters
of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, explained with
professional detachment that the situation is Azerbaijan is
complicated by several factors.
</P>
<P>
   People's lives have been disrupted for so long that many have
lost the power to help themselves, she said. Job training for young
people has provided a glimmer of hope, so the United Nations and
other aid groups are shifting emphasis from food and shelter to
programs that encourage self-sufficiency. One result, Karrenbrock
said, is that the meager food for refugees will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be people left over after our efforts,'' she
said. ``Here, 200,000 may be beyond our reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Her agency's budget for the country is being reduced from $12
million last year to $4.7 million. Many private organizations have
also cut back or pulled out after eight years of little progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Azeri government, which has reached a ceasefire with Armenia
but no peace agreement that would allow at least some refugees to
return home, has not taken up the slack. Some Western diplomats and
humanitarian workers said the camps are political pawns in the
government's effort to negotiate the return of the 20 percent of
the country now occupied by ethnic Armenians. They also said some
aid is siphoned off through corruption. But even the
best-intentioned government would find an enormous burden when one
out of every eight of its citizens lives in refugee camps _ among
the highest ratios anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government raised financial assistance to the
refugees to about $5 a month each from $1.50, even the president,
Heydar Aliyev, acknowledged that their plight remains abysmal. ``It
is a horrible thing that hurts my heart,'' Aliyev said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The people were displaced in 1992 and 1993 when the war that had
erupted in 1988 between Azerbaijan and Armenia over
Nagorno-Karabakh _ a predominantly Armenian-populated enclave in
Azerbaijan _ turned decisively in Armenia's favor. After four years
of indecisive conflict and pogroms that drove ethnic Armenians from
Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, Armenian troops swept into the
mountainous, 1,700-square-mile region, emptying villages and
collective farms and driving out Azeris.
</P>
<P>
   A shaky cease-fire was established in 1994, but sporadic
negotiations have failed to end one of the most intractable
conflicts that emerged as Communism, which had squelched ethnic and
religious differences across the Soviet empire, simply collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   These refugees insist _ as do refugees almost everywhere _ that
they will never abandon hope of returning home. But a bleak
permanence has settled over their blighted lives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
</P>
<P>
   On the far edge of the camp near Aghjabedi, the first people
were buried in 1994, after residents accepted that they would be
living and dying in holes in the ground far longer than they once
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Agil Dunemaliyev, 13, was silent as he gently lifted the latch
on the wire gate. Some of the 250 graves within were marked by
impressive headstones, etched with the faces of the dead and
purchased at mind-boggling sacrifice by grieving families. Others
bore only a small brick of mud and straw, and one mounded grave was
covered by a hand-made carpet, its nomadic design faded by time and
sun. Somewhere here were the graves of Ali and Samsiya Orudjev's
infants, Elvin and Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
   The camp's romantic name, Lachin Winterland, belies the living
conditions. For centuries, the seminomadic cattle breeders who
lived in the Lachin region of Nagorno-Karabakh, 100 miles away,
brought their herds here to graze in winter. When their villages
were emptied by the war in 1992, some 20,000 people came here,
where the land cannot support cattle or people year round.
</P>
<P>
   Salatin Novruzova, who looks far older than her 39 years, boiled
potatoes over a fire of dried cow manure outside the dugout where
her family of seven lives. The heat in summer and the cold in
winter, the snakes and lizards that crawl in, the mile walk for
drinking water, the absence of irrigation water _ she described it
all without emotion. Only when asked why the family stays did she
raise her head from the pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray to Allah to just lift us and move us back to the other
place,'' she said. ``People are staying because they can't move
because they don't have money. The little we get must be spent for
food. We have nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the dirt steps leading down into his home, Orudjev
told much the same story. Though he is trained as a veterinarian,
there are no jobs for him in a country where university professors
drive taxis and physicists work as waiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are healthy enough and we are strong enough to work, but
there is no work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he and his wife live with their remaining children in a place
with dirt walls, a dirt floor and a dirt roof. They share the hole
with their small flock of chickens. The latrine is 100 yards away,
drinkable water at least half a mile distant.
</P>
<P>
   To get the government-allotted food money each month, Orudjev
walks two miles to a paved road and hails a taxi to take him into
Aghjabedi, another five miles away. Sometimes the money is
inexplicably unavailable, so he must sign a note promising to pay
the taxi later. Even when he gets the money, he said, it is always
less than the allotted 20,000 manat. ``Local officials reach in,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his neighbors are more fortunate. The U.N. refugee
agency, with $2.25 million from Eni, an Italian energy company, is
building 400 limestone houses in three regions of Azerbaijan,
including Aghjabedi. They are rare bright spots on a dark
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   No houses are being built at the three camps where about 3,000
people live in abandoned railroad cars, which are scorching hot in
summer and freezing cold in winter.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the rail camps, near the town of Saatli about two
hours' drive from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, 100 rusting boxcars
sit on two parallel rail sidings. For seven years, the cars have
been home to 400 people from the farm village of Boyuk Marjanli in
the occupied territory. It is the smallest of the train camps and
it has no name, but the residents have fostered a semblance of
community.
</P>
<P>
   Old blankets strung between cars provide shade and a place to
sit and chat. A few enterprising residents have planted vegetables
in pots, but they are not thriving. About 40 men and women have
been married here over the last eight years; twice as many have
died.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, the men huddled in small groups under shade
trees a few hundred yards away, jobless and persistently idle. The
women tended the children and many people still lay under cars,
where they had slept to escape the heat.
</P>
<P>
   One stone-faced old woman kneaded bread, oblivious to the swarm
of flies around her. Another washed clothes in a blue plastic
bucket. An elderly man hobbled off to fetch water from a communal
spigot on the other side of the rail yard.
</P>
<P>
   For children younger than 7, a boxcar is the only home they have
known _ they attend school in four cars, play hide-and-seek beneath
them, live within them. Inside, the cars are neat and clean, with
sheets to partition the interiors and burlap bags suspended from
the ceilings to hide the metal.
</P>
<P>
   Nasiba Gakhramanova, 24, was married in the camp. She has had
two babies in it and watched her husband leave when he was drafted
into the army. Still, she wants nothing of permanence. What she
savors are memories of Boyuk Marjanli. What she wants is to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the land, good fertile land, that we are missing,'' she
said as her 14-month-old son played in a discarded tractor tire.
``We can't plant anything here. There is no land here that is not
hard and dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, mostly single men, have left in search of work in
Baku and other places. Everyone knows their prospects are poor and
that many are now living in squalid, abandoned buildings in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   More important, explained a knot of women simultaneously, the
ones who leave will lose out on that great day when the aging
boxcars are hitched to a locomotive and trundled back to the green
pastures of Boyuk Marjanli.
</P>
<P>
   Even the few thousand people who have returned to villages
overrun at the start of the fighting and retaken by Azeri troops
have found hope to be a scarce commodity. Homes, shops and
factories were shattered by mortars and fire. The United Nations
and other relief agencies are rebuilding houses, but progress is
slow and spotty.
</P>
<P>
   In one settlement a few miles from the buffer zone between
Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, a father pointed out live mortar
rounds on land where children like to play. In the village of
Akhmedalilar, a factory where 2,000 people once assembled heavy
machinery is a skeleton of brick and steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough for normal life,'' said Khanish
Allahverdiyev, 76, vowing in the same breath never to leave again.

 PHOENIX: they like.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DreamWorks has several traditionally animated features in the
works, and is also forging ahead with computer-generated fare from
PDI, the company that made ``Antz,'' beginning with a
troll-meets-princess tale called ``Shrek,'' set for release next
summer. And the studio has a multi-picture deal with Aardman, a
British animation house that uses stop-motion techniques in which
actual physical models are manipulated one frame at a time, a
method that resulted in this summer's hit ``Chicken Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney, of course, has never let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to speculate about the future,'' said
Peter Schneider, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. ``What I do know
is that whether they're animated traditionally or on a computer,
good movies will find their place in the marketplace. I do think
that the market does go through this ebb and flow, where people are
more excited about certain kinds of movies or less excited about
them, and there is always a correction in the marketplace when
things get too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth was a veteran at Disney in 1979 when he decided that
animation at the studio had grown moribund and that he needed to
strike out on his own. Goldman left Disney with him. In 1982 they
released ``The Secret of N.I.M.H.,'' a somewhat dark and highly
regarded animated feature about animals escaping from a research
lab; this attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, with whom
they worked on ``An American Tail'' (1986), about Fievel, an
immigrant mouse, and ``The Land Before Time'' (1988), about
dinosaurs in search of literally greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   During the '80s Bluth and his partners led a resurgence in
feature-film animation, while Disney remained fairly dormant. But
that changed in 1989 when Disney released ``The Little Mermaid,''
the first of its new generation of re-energized animated features
that eventually produced huge hits like ``Beauty and the Beast''
and led Disney to reassert its dominance in feature animation in
the '90s. In particular the enormous success of ``The Lion King''
in 1994 _ the film made more than $300 million _ inspired other
major Hollywood studios to build their own animation divisions and
try to compete for what appeared to be a growing and enormously
lucrative family market.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s Bluth had transferred his operations to
Ireland, where he felt it was easier to keep costs down and compete
more effectively with Disney's deeper pockets. But financial
problems with his partners at the time coincided with an offer from
Fox to move back to the United States in 1994 and set up a new
animation studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted us to move to Los Angeles, but we said no, that
was a deal breaker, so we eventually settled on Phoenix, which was
close enough to satisfy them and far enough from Los Angeles to
satisfy us,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Those were heady times. Warner Brothers also set up an animation
division, and Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney and, with David Geffen
and Spielberg as partners, set up the new DreamWorks studio, vowing
to compete with Disney in feature-film animation. Experienced
animators found themselves the targets of bidding wars. ``Suddenly,
animators who had been making $1,000 a week were being offered
$4,000, $5,000, even $6,000 a week,'' Goldman said. ``Everybody got
an agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox leased 66,000 square feet of office space in a prime corner
of northeast Phoenix. DreamWorks built a beautiful new animation
campus in Glendale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the resulting movies were not coming anywhere
close to ending Disney's dominance. Only DreamWorks' ``Prince of
Egypt'' earned more than $100 million. Most came and went with
barely a ripple, while Disney kept pumping out blockbusters. For
Fox the final straw was this summer's ``Titan,'' an $85 million
production that was calculated to appeal to teen-agers, who are
normally averse to animated fare. But they stayed away, and the
movie quickly sank at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   About six months ago, soon after the spectacular success of
Pixar's ``Toy Story 2,'' a computer-animated feature, Bluth said,
Fox officials came to Phoenix and told the studio to cut back on
staff as soon as ``Titan'' was finished. The studio went from a
high of 362 employees to a core crew of 70 or so. Some of those
remaining hoped that Fox would continue to make animated features,
but Bluth and Goldman said it became increasingly obvious that
their studio would never make another movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they said, Fox officials flew to Phoenix and
announced that the studio was closing and that everyone left on the
staff had three hours to pack up and get out.
</P>
<P>
   The first group of animators who left the Phoenix studio late
last year had fairly good luck landing jobs, Bluth said. ``The ones
it was hardest on was the last 70,'' he said, ``because they died a
hard death.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth and Goldman said they hoped to get involved in animation
for the World Wide Web, some of it along the lines of the popular
``Dragon's Lair'' computer game they created a decade ago and some
of it animated stories, both short and feature length. Perhaps,
they said, by distributing their work directly over the Internet,
they would be able to bypass the Hollywood studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're in the distribution business, you're not in the
movie business,'' Bluth said. ``We learned that the hard way.''

WHAT'S LEFT TO SAY ABOUT TIGER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tiger Woods has created quite the conundrum in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   What does one say about an athlete after everything possible has
already been said?
</P>
<P>
   Are there any words left to describe the way he plays? How he
continually outdrives bigger men, the way he plays aggressively
without being risky, the efficiency that allows him to play 72
holes at one of the storied courses on the planet, St. Andrews, and
post only three bogeys?
</P>
<P>
   Is there a calendar around that can tally his accomplishments?
He was the youngest golfer to ever win a major, the Masters in 1997
at the age of 21. Now he's become one of only five golfers with a
career Grand Slam -- titles in all four major tournaments, the
British, U.S. Open, PGA and Masters -- and at the age of 24.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison sakes, Ben Hogan was 41, Gene Sarazen 33, Gary
Player 29 and Jack Nicklaus 26 when they completed their slams. It
took Sarazen 13 years to complete his slam, Player nine, the
legendary Hogan seven, and Nicklaus five years. Woods did it in
four.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is now the reigning champ of three of the four majors, and
the thought that he can post a true Grand Slam -- all four major
titles in a single year -- is no longer foolish talk.
</P>
<P>
   And the concept that he could break Jack Nicklaus' record for
most majors titles, 18 -- the one mark colleagues once thought was
unreachable -- has gone from the unthinkable to a slow, inexorable
march on history.
</P>
<P>
   The only way anyone may stop Tiger Woods is to get the justice
department to declare him a monopoly and break him up into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``To complete the Grand Slam at his age is frightening,'' said
Nick Faldo, a pretty fair golfer himself. ``He'll be playing
blindfolded by 2005, at our request.''
</P>
<P>
   If all that doesn't paint a complete enough picture, then add
these colors.
</P>
<P>
   He is well-liked by his colleagues. He takes his game seriously
but isn't a separatist. Olympic hero Carl Lewis shunned his
colleagues and Michael Jordan kept his at arms length. But Woods is
considered one of the guys.
</P>
<P>
   He is deferential to the game and its history. He wants to know
about the history of courses and tournaments and holds them dear.
He treasures having his name mentioned with Nicklaus, Hogan, Sam
Snead, Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson and others. He treats Pebble
Beach, Augusta, St. Andrew's the way a baseball man might tiptoe
around Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   He has found a way to handle the media, no small success
considering the crush that follows him around the world. Al Gore
and George Bush should attract as many reporters and TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   He has attracted a new following that has driven Nielsen TV
ratings up 50 percent the last two years as well as attendance at
events. Prize money has also received a generous bump as more and
more companies jump on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   He has even found a way to deflect things that can get in the
way of his sport and his game, like his status as a man of color in
a sport that was a half-century behind baseball when it comes to
race relations. Jackie Robinson's greatest achievement was getting
people to look at him not as an African-American but as a
ballplayer, while at the same time serving as perhaps the ultimate
role model for millions of other blacks. Woods is walking an even
richer multicultural path.
</P>
<P>
   He is even able to remain humble and respectful while carrying
around the biggest wallet in sports. He's already the career leader
in earnings on the tour and his endorsement deals are near $100
million in value. ESPN The Magazine just pegged his career earning
potential at $6 billion, and that doesn't include potential changes
in the marketplace that could further feather his bed.
</P>
<P>
   All one can do is to keep track of the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   -- His win at the U.S. Open in Pebble Beach was by 15 shots, the
biggest margin ever in a major.
</P>
<P>
   -- His 19 shots under par in winning the British Open was the
lowest total ever in a major. The last time someone won the British
Open by eight strokes was 1913.
</P>
<P>
   -- He now has 21 career tour wins, and has won 13 of his last 23
events. Those totals include the six straight wins he had earlier
this season, which tied Hogan's runner-up mark (set in 1948) and is
second only to Byron Nelson's amazing 11 straight wins in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   -- The last golfer to be the reigning champ in three of the four
majors was Jack Nicklaus, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   -- It took Nicklaus 19 majors to complete his Grand Slam, while
Woods complete his in 15.
</P>
<P>
   And as dominating as he has been lately, the golfer himself and
his coaches all say he's operating at only 75 percent efficiency,
that he can get better.
</P>
<P>
   One can't imagine how. If he ever gets to the point where he's
20 under every tournament and beating the field by double digits,
the momentum of the sport will come to a halt. That would be bad.
It's perhaps the only real shadow on the man and the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The public's appetite for sport can only be sustained by one man
for a short time. Michael Jordan did his thing in the '90s and the
NBA today isn't half the league it was when he was playing.
Walkovers are inherently dull. Competition has always been a keen
aspect in defining a superstar or a sport.
</P>
<P>
   Would Muhammad Ali be the legend he is without Joe Frazier?
Would Magic Johnson and Larry Bird have been as special if they
hadn't had each other? What made Mark McGwire's march to 70 home
runs in 1998 extra special was the presence of Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   One only has to look at how dull Gorilla Baseball has become,
too, with everyone crushing home runs at a sick, fraudulent pace.
</P>
<P>
   Woods could use a foil. But when you see a player as great as
David Duval go through what he did on the 17th Sunday -- buried in
the mother-of-all bunkers, needing a shovel more than he did a
club, finally getting up and down with a quadruple bogey -- you
have to wonder whether anyone can stand up to the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping he finds a few. The veterans on the tour aren't
giving up -- why should they, considering all the money Woods has
attracted? -- and youngsters like Sergio Garcia and Notah Begay
seem up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   They need to be, because when it comes to Tiger, we're running
out of words.

A TALE OF ADULTERY, CORRUPTION AND MURDER IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Maria Bernal became the talk of Mexico during a
national financial crisis in 1995, when newspapers published a
photo of her frolicking on a yacht in the arms of Raul Salinas, the
playboy brother of the former president.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation of the peso had wiped out millions of Mexicans'
life savings, and investigators had discovered that Raul Salinas
had stashed $100 million in foreign accounts during his brother's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas and Bernal quickly became protagonists in a scandal
about sex, graft and the abuse of power that fed public anger with
the political party that had ruled for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans learned that the president's brother had committed
adultery, avarice, even murder,'' said Guadalupe Loaeza, a writer
who studies social mores. ``People were hungry, and Raul was eating
lobster on a yacht with this girl. Immorality had become
intolerable, and that photo rubbed it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernal's memoir of her tempestuous affair with Salinas hit the
bookstores last week, just when Mexicans' obsession with his
family's sins had finally begun to ease. Raul Salinas is serving a
50-year prison sentence for the murder of a rival, and former
President Carlos Salinas is living in exile in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The current president, Ernesto Zedillo, has governed as a sober
steward, and after the governing party's election defeat this
month, Mexico is awaiting the inauguration of Vicente Fox, an
opposition businessman who campaigned against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   With Bernal's book, Mexicans are pausing for a look back at the
time not so long ago when presidents ruled like kings, with powers
so vast that even presidential siblings enjoyed license to pursue
extravagant and sometimes criminal whimsies. The book's details are
likely to fuel the resentments and desire for reform that led
Mexicans to vote the governing party out.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Raul Salinas and I,'' has sold 10,000 copies in one
week, making it appear likely to become a best-seller. The author
has been interviewed interminably by newspaper reporters and radio
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   During their two-year affair, Salinas and Bernal romped together
through his prodigal world of ranches, thoroughbred horses and
beachside mansions. She became a witness to the underbelly of a
ruling political elite that was degenerating into a criminal clique
before its final defeat at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal eventually sealed Raul Salinas' fate by turning state's
witness at his murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was a twice-divorced man of 45 when he met Bernal in
1992 during a drunken binge in Spain. She was a 30-year-old clerk
in an exclusive tailor's shop, and helped Salinas buy a new suit
and shoes to replace his soiled clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Mexico, Salinas began courting her long-distance,
cabling flowers and eventually flying her to meet him at the Summer
Olympics in Spain. Salinas was accompanied by an entourage of army
officers, secretaries and other retainers who careered about
Barcelona in a convoy of armored Mercedes-Benzes, Bernal wrote in
her memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every moment, Raul displayed his enormous fortune, and some
exotic desire had only to occur to him for it to be turned into
reality,'' Bernal wrote. ``He had people to satisfy every whim. The
least important factor was cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He flew Bernal to Mexico, setting her up in a penthouse
apartment and ferrying her about in a private helicopter or plane.
They partied at his half-dozen homes in Mexico City, his beach
mansion in Acapulco, his various properties in Monterrey, his home
in La Jolla, Calif., and his hacienda in Puebla State, in the
shadow of two magnificent volcanoes east of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The Puebla property was his favorite, with extensive gardens, a
colonial chapel, a bull ring, a staff of 100 peons and walls hung
with costly paintings, including one by El Greco.
</P>
<P>
   In a closet there, Bernal discovered that Salinas had an Imelda
Marcos-like fetish: He owned more than 70 charro suits, the
silver-buckled outfits and matching sombrero, boots and spurs worn
by mariachi singers.
</P>
<P>
   On the hacienda's wooded property there was an enclosure stocked
with deer, moose, coyotes and other animals that Salinas would kill
when he felt like shooting. He fancied himself a big-game hunter.
During their affair, Salinas traveled to Zimbabwe, Bernal wrote,
``where he wanted to have some new fun shooting elephants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that to kill one of those enormous animals gave him
indescribable pleasure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their famous tryst on the yacht in Acapulco harbor came on
Bernal's second day in Mexico. It was there, she recalls, that
Salinas grabbed her in a tight embrace and first consummated their
love affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first time was not what I had expected,'' she wrote.
``Raul was very nervous, and the subtlety of the courtship gave way
to clumsy movements. I tried to calm him, but all the security he
projected in his personal life disappeared in that intimate
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks after Bernal arrived in Mexico, Salinas proposed
marriage and she accepted, she wrote. But he aspired to become a
state governor, she wrote, and months later informed her abruptly
that because his political career demanded a native wife, he would
be marrying a Mexican socialite instead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he begged Bernal not to leave him, and she agreed. She
attended his wedding to her rival, and days later he moved her into
his new wife's former home, where he continued to visit her.
</P>
<P>
   But during 1994, the tumultuous final year of Carlos Salinas'
presidency, Raul Salinas became increasingly mysterious, distant
and manipulative, Bernal wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She describes in some detail the moment in which she asserts
that Raul Salinas confessed to her his involvement in a plot to
murder Francisco Ruiz Massieu, his former brother-in-law, who was
the No. 2 official in the governing party. One month before the
September 1994 murder, Bernal wrote, Raul Salinas arrived at her
home drunk and in a rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wretch finally showed his face to me,'' Salinas told
Bernal, she wrote. ``The ex-husband of my sister _ that guy is
going to die soon. Everything's ready. He's done me a lot of dirty
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Salinas left office in December 1994, Raul
was arrested and charged with Ruiz Massieu's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have never fully established the origin of the
fortune Salinas accumulated during his brother's rule. The Swiss
authorities sought to prove that the funds were the profits of drug
trafficking, but their efforts ended inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas has acknowledged he engineered huge profits from insider
deals during the sell-off of government-owned enterprises. Bernal
notes that for months during 1994 and 1995, Salinas' staff worked
feverishly to shred documents.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, Bernal began cooperating with prosecutors,
and in the course of his trial, she became involved in a bizarre
plot by prosecutors to seal Salinas' conviction by planting a
skeleton on one of his ranches. She was charged with perjury and
served eight months in prison, where she began writing her
manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   She portrays her book as a discourse on love and its lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with Raul's way of being,'' she said in the
interview. ``He was an attractive man, very refined. Later it was
different, because you learned it was all deceit, and at the end,
there was nothing but threats and blackmail. I felt more like I was
in prison when I was with Raul than when I was in the
penitentiary.''

 UNDATED: in royalties. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This model is significantly more profitable for an author,''
Godin said, which, he believes, is bad news for publishers. On one
hand, ``slush pile'' authors who haven't yet published will offer
their work online because it is cheap and easy. On the other hand,
successful authors with enough fame, prestige or gimmickry to
market their own books will find online self-publishing more
lucrative than receiving royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that is left for publishers is the authors in the unwashed
middle, which is the least profitable part of publishing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon &AMP; Schuster's Romanos predicted that few other authors
would follow King's lead. ``The average writer is really more
interested in writing than the transaction part of the process,''
he said. What's more, he says, big publishers' economies of scale
allow them to do business more cheaply and effectively than authors
could by paying editors, printers and everyone else. Publishers
often pass along much of the savings to their marquee authors, as
in Simon &AMP; Schuster's profit-sharing deal with King.
</P>
<P>
   David Card, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, says King's
self-publication resembles the efforts of other celebrities to talk
or sell directly to their fans, as musicians like Prince and
Courtney Love have done on their Web sites. O.J. Simpson is
starting a Web site where he will sell memorabilia and, for a fee,
he will answer questions from the public. Still, Card says, most
writers' and performers' time is better spent doing what made them
famous.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most innovative aspect of King's plans for ``The
Plant'' is his novel honor-system payment plan. King is trusting
his readers to send him a dollar after each download, instead of
requiring them to pay beforehand as Simon &AMP; Schuster did to sell
his previous electronic book. ``No stealing from the blind
newsboy!'' he admonishes on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage payment, King has his own security device:
suspense. If he does not receive payments for at least 75 percent
of the downloads, he says, he will stop writing after two chapters,
and readers won't learn the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't pay me, I will put my guitar over my shoulder and
head on down the road,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers have already posted on his Web site offers to pay
much more than a dollar a chapter in order to see him finish the
work. If he asked, he says, many of his die-hard fans would mail
him money even if there wasn't a new book.
</P>
<P>
   King says ``The Plant'' may extend for nearly 10 installments.
``Theoretically, I could make a fortune,'' he says, noting that he
made $130,000 from his last electronic book for a story that might
have earned him $15,000 from a magazine. But he insists that isn't
his motive. Amazon.com eagerly signed on to collect payments from
readers for him.
</P>
<P>
   James Gleick, a science writer who considered and rejected the
idea of self-publishing over the Internet, says the pay-later plan
is the most promising aspect of King's latest publication. ``You
want to take advantage of the ability of online stuff to spread
around _ you want people to be able to pass your book around and
e-mail it to their friends,'' he says. The honor system may not be
widely practicable, but publishers and encryption companies are
working on technology to let consumers read some of a book first
and then pay to finish and keep it.
</P>
<P>
   King hastens to say that he has nothing against traditional
publishers. He even intends to publish a paper version of ``The
Plant'' with Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   But his Web site might spook some in the business. ``My friends,
we have a chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare,''
writes King.
</P>
<P>
   And he is an expert in nightmares.

 UNDATED: between jobs.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The actors point out that their aggregate pay of about $720
million a year amounts to only about 2 percent of what is spent on
producing the spots and buying the time. Shepard, however, said
that if production costs alone are considered, the actors' fees
represent from 33 percent to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although producers say they are caught in the middle, many blame
the union for forcing them to shoot their commercials in Canada or
overseas. ``It's teaching the clients that there's a much cheaper
way to do this,'' said Marc Smerling, an owner of Notorious
Pictures, a production house in New York. ``Now that the clients
know about this, how do you get them to come back?''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Rose, a vice president of Moxie Pictures, a production
company in Los Angeles and New York, said it does not take long for
producers to establish the relationships needed to work overseas.
``It's hard to go there the first time, and maybe the second
time,'' he said, ``but it's not so hard the third time.'' So many
producers are shooting in Vancouver that local camera crews cannot
keep up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose and other producers said they would much prefer to work
with American actors. ``The members of SAG are probably the most
talented pool of actors on the planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reggio, the union strike coordinator, said the unions should not
be held accountable for the increasing reliance on overseas
locations. ``These claims are really ringing false,'' he said.
``They've been going out of the country long before our contract
expired.''

IMAGINE YOUR LIVING ROOM WAS ONCE SOMEONE'S SIXTH GREEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The book: ``The Missing Links: America's Greatest Lost Golf
Courses and Holes''
</P>
<P>
   The author: Daniel Wexler
</P>
<P>
   The essential info: Sleeping Bear Press, $35, 222 pages
</P>
<P>
   The intent: Find out what happened to some of the most famous
courses across the country that no longer exist - most of which
were victims of The Depression and the post-World War II housing
boom - and reconstruct them.
</P>
<P>
   The execution: Fantastic. Wexler's research through information
that some hadn't looked at in decades unearthed more than 100
courses by some of the sport's most famous designers. ``Sort of
like rediscovering a lost Rembrandt, I suppose, only in this case I
got to rediscover dozens.''
</P>
<P>
   The local angle: About 15 of the courses that once dotted L.A.
are gone, most noticeably the original El Caballero Country Club in
Tarzana, which hosted the 1927 Los Angeles Open. Wexler devotes
several pages to the old El Cab (adjacent to the current one) and
describes it hole by hole, particularly marveling at the 144-yard
No.5, ``one of golf's most spectacular holes,'' that played
directly into the top of the canyon. In Wexler's opinion, that El
Cab would measure favorably to many of today's layouts but not as a
serious comparison to Riviera (which originally was to have two
18-hole layouts), Bel Air or L.A. Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The George C. Thomas-designed Fox Hills Golf Club courses in
Culver City, site of the current Fox Hills Shopping Mall, are also
covered in depth by Wexler. And in his appendixes, he includes a
map of L.A. pointing out all the defunct courses, including
Hollywood CC in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   The cover: It's a painting of the third green of the 400-yard,
par 4 at Baldwin Hills Golf Club, another great lost hole.

million refugees who fled the invasion by neighboring Armenia into
Azerbaijan's mountainous enclave of Nagorno Karabakh in 1992 is
scattered throughout 40 or more camps in this former Soviet
republic where promised oil riches have yet to materialize and per
capita income is less than $2,000 a year. Long after the fighting
stopped, the refugees remain victims of a little-noticed war,
forgotten by the outside world, insufficiently cared for by their
government and on the verge of abandonment by international aid
organizations. They live without running water, electricity or
medical care in railroad cars, tents, temporary prefabricated
houses and holes in the ground, surviving on a few dollars a month,
on handouts and heartache. By Douglas Frantz.

   MEDICARE-POLITICS (Washington) _ Republicans warn of the dangers
of a big, ``one-size fits-all'' prescription drug program for the

rail against the prospect of elderly Americans at the mercy of
profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, and scoff at Republican
efforts to provide drug coverage through the private sector. For
months now, pollsters and strategists in both parties have been
testing and honing these arguments. But as the recent drug bill
passed by House Republicans underscored, all the positioning comes

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Not long after W. Lee Nutter took over last
year as chairman of Rayonier Inc., a big wood and pulp company with
headquarters in Stamford, Conn., he called in a top executive, Jack
O'Grady, and asked, ``Why are we here?''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons, in fact, had peeled away. Modern technology now
allowed the company to distance itself from New York's financial
markets and still have complete instant communications. More of
Rayonier's timberland and mills were in the Southeast, and
Jacksonville beckoned with $2.7 million in public subsidies. And,
in a booming economy, managers and executives were increasingly
expensive. Moving to an office tower here this summer cut executive
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight people transferred from Stamford, but others
declined to relocate and 44 men and women, mostly executives, are
being hired locally at salaries that are at least 10 percent lower,
on average, than those paid in Stamford. In relocating, Rayonier
shrank the headquarters staff to 72 from 85. And the new executives
expect less. ``Salaries in the Southeast do rise more slowly than
in the Northeast,'' said O'Grady, who is senior vice president for
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have been migrating for decades, of course, moving
operations both within the United States and overseas for many
reasons, including the search for cheaper labor. But since 1996,
corporate migration within the country has soared, roughly doubling
to more than 11,000 moves a year, according to Site Selection
Magazine of Atlanta, the only organization, public or private, to
track the phenomenon. At the same time, the emphasis has shifted
from factories, the traditional migrants, to every type of service
operation, and across a range of jobs, from Rayonier's six-figure
executives down to call center operators earning $7 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing restlessness of U.S. business is beginning to be
noticed by economists, government officials and industry groups.
``Corporate migration within the United States is definitely
accelerating,'' said Allen J. Scott, a geographer at the University
of California at Los Angeles who specializes in economic issues.
``The booming economy is prodding companies to relocate or expand
in new places.''
</P>
<P>
   As labor shortages and competition for workers drives up wages
in one city, companies have shifted work or have expanded in
another location, where the same tasks can be done at lower pay.
This movement helps to answer one of the big questions about the
recent economy: How has the United States managed to achieve its
lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s and yet not experience as
much upward pressure on wages as it has during past booms, even
when labor markets were not as tight as they are today?
</P>
<P>
   Various explanations have been offered by economists for the
failure of labor shortages to give a bigger kick to wages in the
record long expansion that started in 1991: weaker unions, the
greater use of temporary workers, a minimum wage that has lost
value, a flood of immigrant workers, layoffs and job insecurity,
global competition. Often overlooked, however, has been the impact
of the stepped-up rate of corporate migration, which adds another
critical element to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   But if lower labor costs drive the process, technology greases
the way. High-speed telecommunications and fiber-optic lines, now
available almost everywhere in the country, allow a Rayonier to
communicate as easily from Jacksonville as from Stamford, and they
also allow a great variety of service companies to link operations
in different cities, as if these operations were all in one office.
In addition, the talent pool is more evenly spread across the
country in the 1990s than in earlier generations, said Lawrence F.
Katz, a Harvard economist, meaning ``you can find similar labor
forces and similar amenities in many more places in America.''
</P>
<P>
   While technology facilitates corporate migration, so does the
growing use of call centers to deal with the public. Many companies
use centers to take orders for merchandise, to service credit
cards, to handle securities transactions, to give investment
advice, to help owners of computers solve software problems, to
collect debts, to sell insurance, to help people navigate the
Internet. No one has yet counted all the call center operators, not
even the Labor Department, but their importance is beginning to
rival that of assembly line workers 50 years ago. And call centers,
generally requiring only telephones and desk-top computers, are
much more mobile than factories.
</P>
<P>
   Midsized cities in the Southeast and Southwest are prime targets
of the corporate migration, cities like Charlotte, Memphis, Phoenix
and Jacksonville. But companies have also been drawn in growing
numbers to the Midwestern states or to Maine or Pennsylvania or
Kentucky _ to any place, in fact, that offers lower wages and
public subsidies. Maine has fewer than 6,000 people making shoes,
less than half the number it had in 1985, but out-of-state
retailers, banks, pharmaceutical companies, even a newspaper
clipping service, have placed operations in the old shoe towns,
re-employing workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are searching for pockets of unemployment,'' said
Steven H. Levesque, commissioner of Maine's Department of Economic
and Community Development, ``and Maine has these pockets.''

   Mobility Restrains Wage Momentum
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up corporate migration has spread jobs and living
standards more evenly across the country than in some earlier
expansions. Rather than expand several of its operations in New
York or New Jersey, for example, Merrill Lynch has gradually added
2,000 employees here in Jacksonville, locating them in four
imposing pink stone office buildings on a bucolic site in a
suburban office park.
</P>
<P>
   For a migrating company, the money saved in labor costs often
goes into earnings, helping to explain the extraordinary
profitability of U.S. business in recent years, economists say. And
by lowering labor costs, corporate migration serves to keep
inflation under control. But it also serves as a counterweight to
the social benefit of a low unemployment rate. The ability to move
almost any kind of work easily gives employers a more powerful
response to the demands of their employees for greater pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just the greater mobility, but the threat of it helps to
hold down wages,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, average hourly earnings have risen faster than
inflation in the boom years since 1996, the first time that has
happened for so long a stretch since the 1960s and early '70s. But
compare the 1990s with those earlier decades and a more complex
story emerges. Wages moved up more persistently in the '60s as the
unemployment rate fell. In response, the inflation rate also rose
more in the '60s than it did in the '90s. Corporate migration has
helped, in effect, to hold down labor costs and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Public attention has focused on manufacturers that shift
factories abroad, particularly to Mexico and the Far East. But
corporate migration within the United States, which dawdled along
at fewer than 5,200 occurrences annually from 1980 through 1994,
jumped in the late 1990s to more than 11,400, according to Site
Selection's research.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's totals cover not only corporate migrations
but also the initial investments of newly started companies.
Because only the largest startups are counted, however, they
represent only 10 percent of each year's total, says Jack Lynes,
Site Selection's executive editor. The totals, including the
startups, reached 12,702 in 1999. Before 1995, the high point was
5,686 in 1989, the last full year of the previous expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request for data on corporate migration, the
American Management Association polled 63 of its chief executives
last month, asking by e-mail messages whether they intended to
relocate their headquarters. Forty-two percent said they had either
recently relocated or were actively considering doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to conclude that relocating operations is very much
on the agenda of corporate America,'' said Eric Greenberg, the
association's director of surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing migration of millions of families to the Sun Belt
and the Mountain States serves as a magnet for many companies. The
labor force has grown more rapidly in these regions than in the
Northeast or Midwest. In Jacksonville, for example, the labor force
has been growing at 3 percent a year since 1990, or three times as
fast as the national average.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, skilled executives _ accountants, financial
analysts, personnel managers and computer specialists _ are finally
as easy for Rayonier to find here as they are in the Northeast,
O'Grady says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who have moved for the amenities of life,''
said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist, ``and in some long-run
sense their wages are going to be relatively low because they want
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rayonier is the 19th large company to move an operation to
Jacksonville this year, or expand one here, and the company is
still unpacking. Framed paintings are propped against a wall in the
conference room, waiting to be hung. Potted plants will also
decorate the room, O'Grady promises, and out in the lobby the black
plastic counter encircling the receptionist's station will soon be
changed for a green marble one, matching the green in the new
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Rayonier's headquarters had been in Stamford for 20 years and in
Manhattan for 30 years before that. Its new executives in
Jacksonville earn $85,000 and up, some as much as $175,000 a year.
For that sort of money, O'Grady said, the pickings are better and
the turnover less.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have more people competing for our jobs at this pay
range,'' he said. And the quality is better. In the Northeast, you
get a personnel executive, for example, with experience only in
workmen's compensation, O'Grady explained. ``Here, for the same
pay, they also have experience in medical and dental insurance and
401(k) plans. You get a broader experience base.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other advantages. Office space is cheaper, and because
headquarters is now ``closer to the bulk of our operations,''
O'Grady said, fewer executives are needed. The company likes to
promote from within, but getting promising employees to transfer to
Stamford was harder and more expensive than bringing them here is
likely to be. Housing costs are less, the climate milder, and the
beaches spectacular. The Jaguars football team also figures as a
draw in the Rayonier calculation, O'Grady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a new condo here,'' said O'Grady, who transferred to
Jacksonville himself in the spring, ``and I asked my neighbors,
`Where are you from?' and I would bet 80 percent are from other
places.''
</P>
<P>
   More Places Seen As Viable Locales
</P>
<P>
   Companies that once put down deep roots are also showing up in
Colorado, Idaho, Texas, Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio _ just
about everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the South is still a favorite. People have been migrating to
the South for more than a generation, and now their children, those
raised and educated in Jacksonville, for example, are everywhere at
Merrill Lynch. William A. Bridy, Merrill's senior director in
Jacksonville, often recruits graduates of the University of North
Florida, whose campus, with 12,000 students, is only three miles
away. Recent graduates are among the 25 ``profilers'' stationed at
Merrill's suburban campus.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill developed profiling at its Somerset, N.J., office, using
the profilers to build a database of biographical information on
new clients for use as a tool in selling more services. The
expansion, seven months ago, was in Jacksonville and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Here a profiler's starting wage of $26,000 is 10 to 20 percent
less than in New Jersey, Bridy said. ``There is not the demand for
New Jersey wages,'' he said, adding that if labor costs do rise,
Jacksonville will become less attractive. That is beginning to
happen in Denver. ``The problem you have there is turnover, which
is higher than Jacksonville,'' Bridy said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the corporate migration is only a few counties away.
Pressed by the Big Three automakers to hold down prices, some parts
manufacturers are shifting from the Detroit environs to Traverse
City and other locations in upstate Michigan, where wages are
lower. Principal Financial Group, which manages pension plans for
thousands of companies, found that wages were rising in Des Moines,
its headquarters city, for the counselors who field telephone calls
from people seeking information about their plans or shifting
investments. So work has been moved, through computer links, to
offices in Waterloo and Ottumwa, Iowa, where wages for counselors
with the same skills are 5 to 10 percent lower than in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Burrelle's Information Services is a constant migrant. The
company employs nearly 2,000 people who cull newspaper, magazine,
video and Internet citations for corporate customers. As wages rose
in Livingston, N.J., its headquarters, and business grew, the
company added an office in Salt Lake City, then Presque Isle,
Maine, and most recently in Houlton, Maine _ all in a successful
effort to keep the hourly wage of most of the employees below $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unemployment rate is a little higher in Houlton than in
Presque Isle because it does not have an airport and tends to be
bypassed by other companies,'' said Robert Waggoner, chief
executive at Burrelle's. ``You have to be adventurous in finding
new places.''
</P>
<P>
   Towns Try to Draw The Better Wages
</P>
<P>
   While Maine, with an unemployment rate of 5 percent or more in
many towns and cities, vies to attract lower-wage jobs _ or any
jobs _ Jacksonville is taking a different tack. The unemployment
rate here has fallen to 3.1 percent from 6.6 percent in 1992, and
with the pressure reduced to bring in jobs, whatever they pay, the
Chamber of Commerce and the Economic Development Commission are
trying to attract companies with jobs that pay more than $31,000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the aerospace giant, is one beneficiary. Servicing and
overhauling aircraft is a growing part of its business, but rather
than expand existing repair centers in Wichita, Seattle or St.
Louis, where mechanics earn $20 an hour and up, Boeing has opened a
center in Jacksonville. So has Northrop Grumman and Jet Turbine
Services. Skilled mechanics, trained in the Navy and mustering out
here, sign on for $18 an hour or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go where the workers are,'' said Dee Burcham, manager of
Boeing's Jacksonville repair center.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has a big presence in Jacksonville, but part of its
complex, Cecil Field, an air station, was closed and turned over to
the city last fall. Now the city is leasing hangar space to Boeing
and others for the giveaway price of $1.50 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pump priming,'' said Paul Krutko, a director of the
Economic Development Commission. ``Later the rates will go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Beecham, the Boeing manager, whose 55 employees will rise to 120
by January, acknowledges that Cecil Field's subsidized facilities
were an important lure. ``All we had to do was organize a work
force and we were up and running,'' he said. But he gave equal
billing to ``the availability of knowledgeable aviation mechanics
and electricians'' at $18 an hour or less.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Michael Zipp, 39, who trained in the
Marines as an aviation electrician. He joined Grumman in Bethpage,
N.Y., in the early 1980s, long before its merger with Northrop.
Earning $17.50 an hour, with a wife and four children, he could not
make ends meet on Long Island, he said. So he quit in 1988, moved
himself and his family to nearby St. Augustine, where Grumman had
an operation, and rejoined the company at $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that lower wage, he says, he could finally afford to pay
his bills and, for the first time, purchase a home. Only now, more
than a decade later, has his wage risen back to its old level of
$17.50 an hour. He is aware that people with his skills earn more
elsewhere in the country. The starting wage in Wichita, for
example, where Boeing also has operations, is $25 an hour, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why not move? ``I'm settled here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville Chafes At Call Center Label
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville got its start in economic development as a mecca
for call centers, thanks to AT&AMP;T, which set up a center here in
1983, after the phone company's breakup, to handle queries from
shareholders whose stock was split. Inexpensive land drew more call
centers, as did Florida's status as a largely nonunion, right to
work state.
</P>
<P>
   Public subsidies also helped. They still do, although they are
angled now toward companies like Boeing and Rayonier, which is
receiving from the city a $1.8 billion cash grant for bringing its
headquarters here and additional ``incentives,'' as O'Grady calls
them, from the state government.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the efforts of the city fathers to bring higher
paying jobs to Jacksonville, the call centers still play a dominant
role. America Online, Citibank, Bank of America, MediaOne all have
a big presence here. ``We have gone from being a call center town
to wanting to not be called a call center town,'' said Faye
Kullberg, director of human resources for MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies employ more people here than a descendant of the
original AT&AMP;T call center, now absorbed into a corporation called
Convergys, headquartered in Cincinnati. Convergys operates 37 call
centers nationwide, with 45,000 employees, including 4,500 here.
The operators do not mention Convergys; they take on the identity
of the companies that purchase its services. A recent client is
AT&AMP;T Wireless, whose cell phone customers get a Convergys operator
when they call an 800 number for help.
</P>
<P>
   But Convergys has not expanded recently in Jacksonville. The pay
for call center operators has risen by about $2 an hour in the last
18 months, to between $10 and $12 an hour. Turnover is also rising,
and Jacksonville is losing its luster as a suitable site for
low-wage call centers. So Convergys opened its newest center in
Brownsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay the same in Brownsville as in Jacksonville,'' said
Frank Kelly, a Convergys executive, ``but the unemployment rate
there reached 14 percent, and we were able to hire very good
people. They consider our job to be a white collar job.''

GUN-CONTROL MOVEMENT IS MOBILIZING TO GAIN SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After many years of being outspent and outmuscled
by the National Rifle Association, the gun-control movement has
begun the most ambitious campaign in its history to raise money,
recruit foot soldiers and build public support for stronger gun
laws in preparation for this fall's national elections.
</P>
<P>
   From established groups like Handgun Control Inc. to fledgling
ones like the Million Mom March, more gun-control organizations
than ever before are doing the kind of grass-roots organizing that
has made the NRA so powerful: opening offices across the nation,
training campaign volunteers, devising media campaigns and building
political war chests.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, wealthy proponents of gun control seem more
willing than in the past to contribute to the cause. Several major
philanthropists, including George Soros, have given millions of
dollars over the last two years to groups that are providing
intellectual and strategic support to the organizations and
politicians who advocate more regulation of guns.
</P>
<P>
   And in just the last few weeks, a handful of anonymous donors
have given more than $2 million to two new groups that will use the
money to help candidates who support gun control and attack those
who do not.
</P>
<P>
   Though the gun-control groups will probably still be outspent by
the NRA by at least two to one, their voices in this election are
likely to be louder than ever before, through television
commercials, mailings and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not lonely out there anymore,'' said Joe Sudbay,
political director of Handgun Control, which for years was the only
gun-control group active in elections. ``There is a burgeoning
sense that the elections are all-important this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling this burst of organizing is a new-found confidence among
gun-control leaders that public support for regulating firearms is
as high as it has ever been. Outrage over mass shootings combined
with enthusiasm about the Million Mom March last May has helped
change the political climate, they say. And the NRA has lost clout,
they contend, as evidenced by the defeat of a referendum to allow
people to carry concealed weapons in Missouri last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 22 years I've been working on this issue, I have never
seen the climate as favorable'' for gun control, said Peter Hart, a
Democratic pollster who works with Handgun Control.
</P>
<P>
   Hart cites polls showing that the electorate's support for gun
control _ always high _ is now also more intense, meaning that more
voters are making it a top priority. ``Education is 1, the economy
No. 2,'' he said. ``But then, ahead of foreign policy and ahead of
abortion, right there with moral issues and taxes, is gun
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the most optimistic of the gun-control leaders
acknowledge that they cannot match the resources of the
battle-hardened NRA, whose leaders have pledged to spend $15
million on state and federal elections this year, nearly twice as
much as in 1996. The group has already raised $8 million this year
and has more than $5 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with its 3.8 million members, three magazines, vast
e-mail contact list and national network of affiliated groups, the
NRA is bigger, more experienced and better equipped to mobilize its
core supporters than the gun-control forces are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our membership is larger,'' said James J. Baker, executive
director of the NRA political wing, the Institute for Legislative
Action. ``And our reach extends well beyond our members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important election,'' Baker said, ``maybe the
most important general election in the 20 years I've been here _
for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both camps say the sharp differences between the two
major presidential candidates this year are helping to energize
their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has called for an array of new
restrictions, including the licensing of new handgun buyers and a
ban on certain inexpensive handguns. But Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas has generally sided with the NRA, signing bills that allow
people to carry concealed weapons and prevent municipalities from
suing gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the NRA has tried to demonize Gore in its fund-raising
efforts as a threat to Second Amendment rights, Handgun Control has
sought to cast Bush as a pawn of the NRA who would team up with a
Congress controlled by Republicans to rescind every major gun law
on the books.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent fund-raising letter, Sarah Brady, chairwoman of
Handgun Control, wrote: ``My friend, if you and I truly want a
safer America, we cannot allow George W. Bush to be elected
president of the United States. A political disaster of that
magnitude would mean four long years of being on the defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Such appeals seem to be working. Handgun Control has raised
nearly $1 million in the last year, three times what it spent in
the entire 1996 campaign. The group intends to spend at least $4
million on races this year, focusing on about 20 closely contested
congressional races where gun control is an issue. In most cases,
it will be supporting Democrats, said Sudbay, of Handgun Control.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans that Handgun Control is likely to work
against are Rep. James Rogan of California and Sen. John Ashcroft
of Missouri. The group has also run ads in several cities
criticizing Bush's record on gun control, and plans to buy more air
time in closely contested states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``In swing areas, our mission is to make sure voters,
particularly women voters, understand the Bush record,'' Sudbay
said.
</P>
<P>
   In past campaigns, Handgun Control largely stood alone in the
fight against the NRA. But this year it has been joined by at least
two new advocates. One is the Million Mom March, the nonprofit
group behind the Mother's Day rally in Washington. The group
recently created a political arm that has raised $1 million from a
single anonymous donor for political work.
</P>
<P>
   The second new group, the Campaign for a Progressive Future, has
raised over $1 million, also from anonymous donors, to spend on
campaigns this year, said Steve Cobble, one of its founders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both groups organized their fund-raising committees under
Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, which has allowed them to
hide the identities of their donors. But Congress recently enacted
new rules which will require the groups to disclose the names of
future contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its fund raising, the Million Mom March has also opened
more than 240 chapters in 46 states, and expects to be represented
in every state by the fall. Those chapters will be able to lobby
state legislatures, train volunteers for campaigns and disseminate
``voters' guides'' evaluating candidates' records on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Modeling itself on Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Million
Mom March will try to help its allies, and hurt its opponents, by
staging emotional rallies that feature victims of gun violence or
their survivors. The group plans to endorse a presidential
candidate _ almost certainly Gore _ and will get involved in state
and congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is always to get people who have personal experiences
involved in trying to change policy, because they are the most
powerful forces,'' said Andrew McGuire, executive director of the
Million Mom March and a former board member of MADD.
</P>
<P>
   Cobble, a former adviser to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, said his
group would focus on a small number of closely contested
congressional races where there were stark differences between the
candidates on gun issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a well-defined, well-developed constituency which
they have proven they can mobilize,'' Cobble said, referring to the
NRA. ``The difference this year is, you will see the first
stirrings of a not-as-well-defined but potentially larger
constituency that supports gun control. Whether it plays out by the
end of the year remains to be seen. But I do think the tide has
turned.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth group, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, is
considering creating a political action committee. But at the very
least, the group plans to hire political organizers to help
mobilize pro-gun-control voters in 10 to 15 closely contested
congressional races, said Mark Pertschuk, the organization's
legislative director.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's social change going on with guns that is very similar
to what happened with tobacco 15 years ago,'' said Pertschuk, who
formerly worked with an anti-tobacco group called Americans for
Non-Smokers' Rights. ``There was this gradual but distinct shift
from `You can smoke in my house and tobacco companies are good
corporate citizens' to `No smoking here, and the tobacco companies
are drug pushers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Soros, the billionaire financier, has led recent efforts by a
number of philanthropists to support nonprofit groups that are
pushing for tighter gun laws. Although many of those groups are not
overtly involved in politics, they are providing the intellectual
groundwork for the political activists.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Funders' Collaborative for Gun Violence
Prevention, a year-old group created with matching $5 million
donations from Soros and the Irene Diamond Fund, has helped finance
litigation against gun manufacturers, a study of gun-related
injuries by the Harvard School of Public Health, and an array of
groups that lobby for tougher gun restrictions, including the
Violence Policy Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Peters, program director for the Funders' Collaborative,
said one of her main goals was to overcome what she considered the
mistaken, but widespread, perception that there were already many
tough gun laws on the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy-makers and the public believe that the law is much
stricter than it is,'' Peters said. ``We are funding information
which will allow people and policy-makers to understand how
sparsely regulated this product and this industry are.''

GROUP OF 8 PLEDGES TO HELP POOR COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ The leaders of the world's richest nations
concluded their annual economic summit meeting in this island
resort Sunday with a broad commitment to help poor countries reduce
their debt burden and increase their access to better education,
health care and information technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique issued at the end of a three-day meeting in
Okinawa, Japan's southernmost island, the leaders of the Group of 8
promised action on a wide variety of issues, most notably to
curtail extreme poverty and the spread of infectious diseases like
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan, this year's host, said
that wealthy nations have an obligation to break the ``vicious
cycle'' of poverty and disease faced by poor countries. In addition
to Mori, the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy,
France, Germany and Russia participated in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We commit ourselves to the agreed international development
goals, including the overarching objective of reducing the share of
the world's population living in extreme poverty to half its 1990
levels by 2015,'' the leaders said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to bridge the so-called digital divide, a technological
gap that separates the world's haves from the have-nots, the
leaders agreed to establish a task force to help developing
countries reap the benefits offered by new information
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's final 15-page communique, drafts of which had
been circulating for days, contained few new initiatives and
provided few details on how the leading industrialized nations
would achieve their lofty goals, bringing criticism from some human
rights groups and nongovernmental organizations that the summit
meeting had lacked substance.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did, however, mention the need for joint attention
to a number of issues, including the safety of genetically modified
foods, research into the human genome, cross-border criminal
organizations, the aging of populations in many developed countries
and environmental issues like global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders promised to speed up efforts to achieve debt relief
for 20 of the most heavily indebted poor countries. A similar
pledge was made a year ago at the group's summit meeting in
Cologne, Germany, but so far only nine of those impoverished
countries have received some relief.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders at the meeting also pledged to jump-start the
multilateral trade talks under the World Trade Organization before
the end of the year. Last December, the trade organization's policy
meeting in Seattle collapsed when officials failed to reach an
agreement on the agenda and street demonstrations against
globalization turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meetings are a chance for world leaders to make an
impression, and in Okinawa President Vladimir Putin of Russia stole
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Okinawa, Putin visited the North Korean leader,
Kim Jong Il, and there was widespread interest at the summit
meeting in his trip.
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing Sunday, Putin said he believed Kim was a man
with whom the world could do business and urged more contacts with
him to help to defuse tensions in the region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were widespread fears that, as in Seattle, there would be
disruptive demonstrations around the Okinawa meeting after Okinawan
police officers arrested a U.S. Marine accused of sexually
molesting a 14-year-old island girl. The episode did lead to huge
demonstrations by Okinawans, who have long demanded the removal of
the many U.S. military bases on the island.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests, which were held at military bases and at
hotels and conference centers used for the meeting, remained
orderly, and the police reported no violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a private meeting with Mori, President Clinton apologized for
a series of crimes, including sex attacks, committed here in recent
years by U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government came under sharp criticism, though, for
spending more than $750 million to hold this event.
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental organizations said that Japan's record
expenditure was nearly 100 times higher than the amounts spent at
the meeting in Cologne or an earlier one in Birmingham, England,
and that the money could have been used to relieve the debt of the
world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000, a protest group that seeks to reduce the debt of
developing countries, said the amount that Japan spent on the
meeting could have been used to erase the debt of Gambia or
Equatorial Guinea. ``The world's leaders have retreated to this
remote island of Okinawa and have turned their backs on the poor,''
the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government said that the $750 million included the
cost of staging the three-day meeting in Okinawa and earlier
meetings of finance ministers and foreign ministers in Fukuoka and
Miyazaki. About $300 million of the $750 million was spent on
security, which included 22,000 police officers drafted from across
the country to work at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly a quarter-century since the first summit
meeting of the world's major industrialized countries was held _ in
Rambouillet, France, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were initially intended as informal gatherings
where the leaders of the world's richest countries could resolve
problems of common concern, like inflation, economic growth and
currency crises. The premise was that they could do more together
than separately.
</P>
<P>
   But the conferences have evolved in recent years to include
discussions of broader political and social significance, including
armed conflicts, technology, hunger, health care and other issues
affecting the developing world, and to include Russia, which,
despite its ailing economy, is a central figure on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   In his press briefing Sunday, Putin also said he would continue
lobbying Washington to abandon plans to build an antimissile
defense shield against possible attack from hostile countries like
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin conducted himself like a true statesman, unlike his
predecessor, Yeltsin, who acted erratic and was probably drunk at
previous summits,'' said George von Furstenberg, a professor in
economic and financial policy at Fordham University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin didn't come here looking sad with his hand out begging
for loans,'' the professor said. ``He was confident and mature and
had a bag of North Korean goodies to share with the group.''

   ``I didn't know anything about television,'' she said. ``I
didn't know what I was doing. But I did know how to read a script.
I did know how to work with writers. I did know how to work with
production people. And what I learned eventually was that producing
is the same, in whatever medium. ''
</P>
<P>
   With her husband working in Los Angeles, Berman moved there in
1990 and got a job working in the television division of Sandollar,
the management and production company owned by Sandy Gallin and
Dolly Parton. Six and a half years later she became a partner in
the company and was also executive producer of the highly
successful ``Buffy'' and its spinoff, ``Angel,'' on the WB Network.
</P>
<P>
   At Fox Berman has brought in a new team of executives to deal
with scheduling, marketing and ``long-form'' shows, or movies.
Several executives have since been replaced. She has announced
plans for a hip-hop version of ``The Wizard of Oz'' and a drama,
``World War III,'' which will star Timothy Hutton and Vanessa
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The hip-hip ``Wizard'' was, she said, essentially a statement
that Fox was intent on doing what she called ``quality event
programming'' that would appeal to a broad range of 28- to
49-year-olds. Fox has shied away from the 90-minute or two-hour
dramas, musicals or extravaganzas that other networks periodically
present. ``It's right up my alley from my theater background,''
Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said that the success of ``Malcolm in the Middle'' also
provided a lesson that resonated with her theater background and
that will help shape programming. Too often, she said, series are
created by committee or with the heavy interference of executives.
``Malcolm'' was the product of Boomer, who created a distinctive
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a writer's singular vision is everything,'' Berman
said. The family in the show, she added, struck a chord among
viewers who seem to identify with it. ``Everything isn't tied into
a neat bow. But they're doing their best. They're working hard. And
the parents love each other and love their children. It's a pretty
accurate description of many families.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile there is the wave of ``reality programming'' to
contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get ahead of the curve and not just do
something in the wake of `Survivor' and `Big Brother,''' she said.
``We have to come up with new and better and original stuff and not
just try to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Fox was the home for precursors to these shows.
``Frankly our highest-rated show last week was `Cops,''' she said,
pointing to the long-running series that features videos of police
officers hunting down crime suspects. That show, as well as
``America's Most Wanted,'' has made Saturday one of the network's
strongest nights.
</P>
<P>
   This might seem a long way from Broadway, but Berman said she
planned to return one day to New York to produce theater again.
``As difficult as it was, I was living my fantasy doing it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say she hasn't found a home in her new world.
``There are things you can do on television that you can't do
anywhere else,'' she said.

OPTIONS FOR MEDICARE DRUG PLAN SHAPING UP AS PRIME ELECTION-YEAR
ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans warn of the dangers of a big ``one-size
fits-all'' prescription drug program for the elderly, run by the
heavy hand of government bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats rail against the prospect of elderly Americans at the
mercy of profit-hungry pharmaceutical companies, and scoff at
Republican efforts to provide drug coverage through the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, pollsters and strategists in both parties have
been testing and honing these arguments, knowing that the cost of
prescription drugs _ and the lack of Medicare coverage for them _
is one of the most powerful issues of this election year. But as
the recent drug bill passed by House Republicans underscored, many
analysts say, all the positioning comes down to an old
philosophical division between the parties: How big a role should
the government play in providing health care? How much should be
left to the private sector?
</P>
<P>
   The issue flared, briefly but bitterly, on the NBC News program
``Meet the Press'' Sunday when Robert Shrum, an adviser to Vice
President Al Gore, said Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was giving
short shrift to the plight of the elderly. Shrum said Democrats
wanted a drug plan ``that provides for all senior citizens under
Medicare,'' while Bush ``wants one that lets seniors go out and beg
the HMOs and insurance companies for coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, countered
that Gore had ignored ``bipartisan opportunities'' to pass drug
legislation, and said that Bush was ``committed to reforming and
modernizing Medicare to provide prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the role of government has waxed and waned
around Medicare, which covers 39 million Americans who are over the
age of 65 or disabled, since the program was created 35 years ago
this month. But coming now, when both the White House and the House
are up for grabs, it is a struggle fraught with implications not
only for how older Americans get their drug coverage _ which many
believe will ultimately be determined by the next administration
and Congress _ but also for how the broader Medicare program is
reconfigured over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake to say it's only political
positioning,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation, a health policy research group. ``There is an
underlying philosophical difference, with the Democrats preferring
to expand a public program and the Republicans wanting to go with
private insurers and the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health at
Harvard University, argued, ``When people say there's nothing
fundamental going on in this election, my answer is that there is
something fundamental going on about the shape of this program.''
With the Democrats controlling the House and the White House, he
said, ``We'd end up with a very different Medicare in 10 years than
if the country went Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prescription drug plan passed three weeks ago on party
lines, House Republicans looked to the private sector to provide
new coverage, using federal subsidies to encourage insurance
companies to offer drug policies to the elderly. The plan promises
every Medicare beneficiary a choice of two drug plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Greenwood, one of the leaders in getting the plan
through the House, argued that it sought to ``create the climate
and the incentives for these companies to offer competitive
products in the marketplace,'' and thus ``reflects our faith in the
marketplace versus our faith in government.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats lined up behind the idea of adding a
standardized drug benefit to the traditional Medicare program,
voluntary but guaranteed to every beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats firmly believe that a social program such as
this needs to be managed and controlled by government, whereas
Republicans believe if you're going to have this type of program,
make it a voucher-type program for private insurance,'' said Rep.
Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, one of the Democratic Party's experts
on health.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the details of these proposals, the
philosophical line can get fuzzier. The House Republican proposal
for example, allows for a government ``fall-back'' plan if private
companies fail to enter a market, which critics say is a major
danger. And not all Republicans support the House legislation. Last
week, Sen. William Roth Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, offered a very different approach. Both the
House Democrats' drug proposal and the administration's, meanwhile,
allow for private pharmaceutical benefit managers _ acting as
intermediaries for the government _ to negotiate with the drug
companies and administer the program.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in recent years many Democrats _ including the
administration __ have advocated a gradual restructuring of
Medicare to encourage more involvement by private managed-care
companies, in hopes of improving the quality and controlling the
costs of health care for the elderly. Currently, only about 16
percent of Medicare beneficiaries are in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are divisions between the parties over Medicare that
transcend prescription drugs _ about the pace of any Medicare
restructuring, how much the traditional fee-for-service program
should be protected in any new competitive marketplace, what kind
of oversight and regulation should exist, and what kind of
financial incentives should be used to encourage older Americans to
consider managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The track record of managed care in Medicare _ many private
plans have pulled out of the program, asserting that it was
unprofitable _ has stoked the doubts of Democrats about the virtues
of the private market. And in the House debate over prescription
drugs, Democrats had agreement from an unlikely source: the Health
Insurance Association of America said the Republican plan was
unlikely to work, because insurance companies would not be
interested in offering drug-only policies to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts have raised questions for years about the willingness
of the marketplace to care for older and really sick people, Altman
said, ``and those questions are still there, whether it's the
willingness of HMOs under Medicare or the willingness of insurance
companies to provide drug benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   These divisions are already playing out in the House and Senate
elections. The New York State Democratic Committee has run a
television commercial against Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican
candidate for Senate, that declares: ``Bowing to the drug
companies, Lazio voted for a plan that would leave millions without
affordable coverage. Tell Lazio: Next time vote for us.'' The
AFL-CIO is running similar commercials in several House districts.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Republican Leadership Coalition is
running radio advertisements in several districts assailing each
Democrat for ``turning his back on prescription drug coverage for
seniors'' by voting against the Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, asserted that people ``just
laugh'' in focus groups when asked which approach they prefer:
assistance in purchasing private insurance for prescription drugs,
or a government benefit. Anger at the drug companies is far
outweighing any fears of government, Lake asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Garin, a chief pollster for House Democrats, argued,
``George W. Bush has been trying very hard and with some success to
avoid any debate about big philosophical questions, but Medicare
really is a chance for Democrats to raise a question about the role
of government versus the private sector, on a topic where voters
have already made a pretty clear decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, of course, disagree. Their pollsters say the
promise of ``choice'' _ different private plans from which to
choose _ versus a ``one-size-fits-all'' government plan is an easy
one. Voters want the choice and fear the government, the pollsters
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Republicans talk about the Democratic plan as bureaucrats
and politicians in Washington making decisions about prescription
drugs, that's extraordinarily effective,'' said Glenn Bolger, a top
pollster for House Republicans. This framing of the debate was used
by Republicans and industry groups in the struggle over the Clinton
health care plan _ notably in the ``Harry and Louise'' campaign _
with much success.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential campaign, the contrast is not as clear,
largely because Bush has remained vague on Medicare issues. For
example, when asked Bush's position on the Medicare prescription
drug bill recently passed by his party in the House, Ari Fleischer,
a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that Bush ``wants to review
the final congressional product.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the governor supported ``reforming'' Medicare,
adding that he had endorsed six principles that will guide his
reform, among them maintaining Medicare's guaranteed access to all
elderly and promising all beneficiaries a choice of health plans,
``including the option of purchasing a plan that covers
prescription drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his spokesmen have also talked approvingly of the work
of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare,
and faulted the administration for blocking its work _ although the
commission was advocating a market-oriented plan that by some
estimates could have made it significantly more costly for the
elderly to stay with traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and
raised the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the specifics of Bush's thinking on Medicare may not come
until this fall's debates, when Gore is sure to raise it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, recognizing his party's long-standing image as the
guardian of Medicare, has campaigned hard on the issue, vowing to
put Medicare in a ``lock box'' so its $400 billion in surpluses
cannot be used for tax cuts or other new spending, and to extend
the solvency of the Medicare trust fund to 2030. He has also
advocated adding a prescription drug benefit to the traditional
Medicare program, in line with his party, and has scoffed at the
House Republican plan as ``a pretend plan that even the insurance
industry doesn't think will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also committed to the ``modernization'' proposals put
forth by the Clinton administration, which try to inject more
competition among health plans while protecting the fee-for-service
program.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Medicare may turn out to be much more of an issue in
congressional elections than in the presidential contest. Several
health policy analysts noted that Bush was far more willing to
plunge into the politics of Social Security than Medicare, which
remains among the most popular government initiatives. Even so,
analysts maintain, this election has big consequences for the
program, which was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson
as the centerpiece of the Great Society.

U.N. PONDERS RISING PROBLEM: AIDING THE FORGOTTEN REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ From the Caucasus to Kosovo, Congo, Colombia
and East Timor, millions of people have been displaced by civil war
or ethnic violence. But almost everywhere, particularly in Africa,
they struggle to survive without much, if any, international help
because they have not crossed an international border and are not,
strictly speaking, refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the United Nations has been without a coherent
policy for helping those victims of war, known to international
agencies as ``internally displaced people,'' or IDPs. Because there
is no agency and almost no money regularly set aside for these
people, responses to crises have been haphazard and often
opportunistic. Some get help, often because they are mixed into
refugee populations. Many never do.
</P>
<P>
   The leading U.N. relief official, Carolyn McAskie, said last
week that she wanted to look for ways to bring existing United
Nations agencies into a common effort to pay more attention to this
problem. Although she has yet to name an official to coordinate
that effort, officials say that the job will go to Dennis McNamara,
who has most recently been a deputy to the United Nations
administrator of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing this approach, rather than designating a new or lead
agency to deal with the problem, McAskie, the United Nations'
emergency relief coordinator, has placed herself in opposition to
the United States, and particularly its ambassador here, Richard C.
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who since visiting Africa late last year has been on
a campaign for action on the issue, said last week that he was
``skeptical of the so-called collaborative approach.'' He said
American diplomats and aid experts abroad would be asked to report
on how coordination is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see the new system at work,'' he said in a speech to the
United Nations Economic and Social Council. ``And ultimately, let's
see if it makes any difference on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McAskie said the concept of putting one agency
in charge of the internally displaced had been studied. ``We have
looked at that option very seriously, and we do honestly believe _
and most of the agencies and quite a few of the governments
honestly believe _ that that's not necessarily the best answer,
partly because IDPs are so mixed in with the rest of the population
that we have to find ways of addressing the war-affected population
as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``IDPs have specific needs, though,'' she acknowledged.
``There's no doubt about it. And we can do better to address that.
We've come out with a policy on protection. We're trying to
increase the knowledge and awareness of country teams.'' She said
that one of the major hurdles to increased help to the internally
displaced has been a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   Sadako Ogata, who will retire later this year after serving for
nearly a decade as United Nations high commissioner for refugees,
underlined in a speech in New York last Tuesday that it is more
difficult to raise cash to aid displaced people within their own
countries than for other refugee groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are failing internally displaced people,'' she said. ``By
`we' I mean to include governments, the United Nations system and
the broader humanitarian community. The scale of suffering and the
human cost are staggering.'' She said that in Asia, Africa, Europe
and the Americas she had seen ``appalling examples of forced
displacement and misery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In many of these situations,'' she said, ``displacement is not
merely a consequence of conflict, but its very objective. The
governments responsible for protecting the rights and well-being of
internally displaced people are often the cause of their
predicament as they pursue calculated strategies aimed at changing
the ethnic map of the country or gaining control over its economic
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The help these uprooted people now get, she acknowledged, ``is
selective, uneven and, in many cases, inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ogata appealed for $8.4 million for 300,000 people
who have been forced to flee homes in three provinces in Angola,
where 1.5 million people have been displaced since another peace
agreement fell apart in 1998. The United States has pledged $2
million to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will others follow their example?'' Ogata asked. ``I will be
blunt,'' she said. ``Making a real difference for internally
displaced people will require a very substantial and sustained
commitment of resources.''

COMMENTARY: FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a disturbing, almost willfully irresponsible quality to
the giddy rush by politicians to enact huge federal tax cuts
without regard to how much of the projected surpluses are real, and
with little or no debate about other, better ways in which some of
that money might be used.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if very little was learned during those long years of
wandering in the debilitating environs of big budget deficits. Now
surpluses are blossoming in the midst of a campaign season and the
politicians seem determined to devour them with immediate and
mindless tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about taking steps to shore up the nation's
infrastructure, or clean up the environment, or do something real
about the sorry state of public education, or poverty, or the
millions who lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about any of the complex issues that deserve to be
debated and that would require some substantial amount of federal
financial support. Big tax cuts are on the table, and even bigger
tax cuts are being promised. And once these monster cuts become law
there'll be very little left for investment in a sounder American
future.
</P>
<P>
   According to Congressional Budget Office projections released
last week, the non-Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years
will be about $2.2 trillion. But that figure is wildly unrealistic.
It would be reduced sharply by any slowdown in the economy, and it
assumes that nonentitlement spending, including defense spending,
will grow no faster than the rate of inflation _ a phenomenon that
no sane person in Washington would believe.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
have come up with estimates that fit more comfortably with the real
world. They noted that when you set aside that portion of the
projected surpluses that come from the Medicare trust fund (which,
like Social Security, should remain off limits, according to
officials from both parties); and when you look realistically at
spending already committed to by the White House and Congress; and
when you take into account some of the non-Social Security money
that most agree will be needed to help shore up the Social Security
retirement system _ when you take all of that into account, the
surplus available over the next decade falls to just $700 billion
or so.
</P>
<P>
   That's the amount that would be available for tax cuts and new
spending. If you wanted to improve the schools, or help cover the
uninsured, or offer a prescription drug benefit, or whatever _
you'd have to pay for it out of that $700 billion or so, after you
deduct whatever tax cuts come out of that same $700 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates from both parties have been less than responsible on
this issue. But the Republicans, especially, have gone way over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of how dizzily out of whack things have become,
all you have to do is consider that George W. Bush's proposed tax
cut is $1.3 trillion. There is no way the non-Social Security
surpluses projected over the next decade would be able to cover tax
cuts of that magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cut bills passed or about to be passed in this session of
Congress (some face a presidential veto) would reduce government
revenues by $730 billion over the next 10 years. Not only are the
tax cuts being pushed by the GOP excessive, but they are in many
cases ``backloaded,'' which is to say written in such a way that
the biggest portion of the cuts occur after some years have passed.
</P>
<P>
   So the proposed elimination of the estate tax, for example,
would result in a loss of $100 billion in revenue over the first 10
years, but more than $500 billion over the second 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   This is insidious. We are manufacturing rather than solving
problems for subsequent generations.
</P>
<P>
   Modest, affordable tax cuts are fine. But what's more important
as the United States enjoys this best of economic times is to take
the opportunity to engage some of the big problems we've put off
for years because we didn't have the money to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   There are Americans who, despite the unprecedented prosperity,
still are not being paid an honest dollar for a day's work, who
still are without health insurance, who still are not receiving a
quality education.
</P>
<P>
   Now would be a good time to start bringing them into the
prosperous mainstream.

 &HT;    CLINTON RETURNS TO CAMP DAVID FOR FINAL MIDEAST PUSH
 &HT;    640&AMP;insert.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ An ``invigorated'' President Clinton returned to
Camp David on Sunday night, hoping to press Israeli and Palestinian
leaders to take the last difficult steps toward a long-elusive
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went directly into conference with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to take the temperature of the talks and was
expected to meet late into the night with Prime Minister Ehud Barak
of Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's invigorated by getting back here and re-engaging with the
leaders,'' said White House spokesman P.J. Crowley, who accompanied
Clinton on his four-day trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we expect heavy-duty activity by the president,''
said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. ``We expect
meetings into the night.''
</P>
<P>
   The president arrived in Washington on Sunday afternoon from the
G8 summit of major industrialized nations in Japan. As he began the
half-hour helicopter ride from the White House to the mountains of
western Maryland, his daughter, Chelsea, at his side, Clinton held
up crossed fingers for luck.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived just after 6:30 p.m. at Camp David, where Clinton is
trying to broker an end to half a century of bloodshed and conflict
between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have continued to make headway'' in his absence,
Clinton said before leaving Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But with Arafat and Barak stuck on questions over the future of
Jerusalem and the fate of Jewish settlers and Palestinian refugees,
Boucher said the summit's outcome remained uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole variety of things that could happen now,''
Boucher told reporters gathered in this Catoctin Mountain hamlet
five miles from the secluded presidential retreat, ``one of which
is we might reach a deal, and the other of which is we might not _
definitively.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton away, the talks have continued at a low ebb under
Albright's guidance.
</P>
<P>
   She took Arafat to her northern Virginia farm for an informal
lunch on Saturday, and on Sunday she escorted Barak to Gettysburg,
just across the border in neighboring Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   There, in a sober reminder of the price Americans paid for peace
nearly a century and a half ago, Barak and Albright stood at the
foot of a towering monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee
and gazed out across the broad field of grass where Gen. George
Pickett, on Lee's orders, made his fateful charge into the full
force of Union battle lines, in one of the costliest tactical
errors of American military history.
</P>
<P>
   Listening intently to a park guide, Barak stared across the
battlefield, apparently pondering the engagement that historians
regard as the turning point of the Civil War, as a casually dressed
Albright looked on, wearing dark glasses and a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Gettysburg had historic echoes. President Carter
took President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem
Begin of Israel to Gettysburg as a break in the proceedings of the
1978 Camp David summit that resulted in the historic
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's summit lasted 13 days, a duration that would be
exceeded if the current talks stretch into Monday, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher stressed that there was no magic to the 13-day time
period. Nor can the talks meander on indefinitely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not running on a 22-year-old schedule,'' said Boucher.
``We're running on whatever schedule we can make out of the talks
now and how we can progress on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a news blackout meant to insulate the
negotiations from the pressures of media speculation, Boucher would
not discuss the details of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian press reports have agreed, though, that
the sharpest thorn in the thicket of issues dividing the two sides
has been the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have hung up, apparently, on the question of
sovereignty _ whether Israel or the Palestinians will have
political control over East Jerusalem, which was Arab territory
when Israel was founded in 1948 and was captured by Israel during
the 1967 war with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to retain the ancient city as the eternal and
undivided capital of Israel. Before the talks began July 11, he
suggested expanding Jerusalem to take in a number of neighborhoods
already effectively under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is demanding that Israel cede East Jerusalem, which
contains some of the holiest sites in the Christian, Jewish and
Islamic religions, to Palestinian control. He is insisting that
East Jerusalem, the center of Palestinian life in the West Bank,
become the capital of a new state of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the senior statesman of the
Arab world, publicly called on Arafat over the weekend to stick to
his demand for full Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Syria, other Arab neighbors of Israel, issued their
own public statements endorsing Arafat's position.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II also weighed in on the difficult issue Sunday,
saying the city's holy sites should come under the control of an
international administrative body.

 (ATTN: Mich., Ga.)  By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The meetings would always start after dark.
Three nights a week, as the stream of cars turned onto the
residential street and parked, the neighbors would start wondering
all over again: what was going on inside that house?
</P>
<P>
   It had a basketball goal, and a barbecue grill, and appeared to
be an unremarkable two-story emblem of suburban conformity except
for those strange gatherings that lasted until past the normal
bedtime of Donnefield Drive. By breakfast, all the cars were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had theories,'' said Scott Furr, who lives across the
street. ``My girlfriend thought they were religious meetings,
because she thought she heard some singing. Some people thought it
was drugs. But I just thought it was a party house, where they got
together and had a good time. Boy, were we wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery was solved on Friday, when the owner of the house
was arrested, along with 17 others, and charged with being part of
a conspiracy to smuggle cigarettes and send the profits to the
Hezbollah, the radical Islamic group based in Lebanon. The federal
government said the homeowner, Mohammed Youssef Hammoud, was the
leader of a Hezbollah support group that met regularly in his home
and elsewhere to denounce the United States and collect money that
was sent to the organization in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hezbollah is listed as a terrorist group by the State
Department, Hammoud and several of those arrested were charged
with, among other things, providing aid to a foreign terrorist
organization. It is one of the first major arrests under the
anti-terrorism law passed in 1996 in the wake of the bombing in
Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   None of those arrested were charged with planning violent acts,
but the possible presence of a Hezbollah group on a quiet street in
Charlotte _ a financial capital that lacks even the slightest trace
of intrigue or subversion _ was oddly unsettling to residents here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense to me,'' said Dwayne Eldridge,
another neighbor of Hammoud. ``I mean, we thought they were strange
because they didn't wave back or talk to anybody on the block. But
that doesn't mean we thought they were helping terrorists or
anything. I guess you never really know your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation for the group's presence here may lie
in the nature of the charges against its members. According to an
affidavit filed by U.S. Attorney Mark T. Calloway in U.S. District
Court here on Friday, the group raised money by buying large
quantities of cigarettes in North Carolina, where the tax is only
five cents a pack, and smuggling them to Michigan, where the price
of cigarettes is much higher because of the 75-cent state tax. The
70-cent profit on each pack produced hundreds of thousands of
dollars that, the government charged, was helping to finance
Hezbollah activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one load of illegal cigarettes in a panel van, you can
make a profit of $8,000 to $10,000,'' said Earl Woodham, a
spokesman for the Charlotte office of the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested will be able to enter formal pleas to the charges
at hearings beginning on Wednesday. At least six of the 18 were
released on bond over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut on Saturday, the Hezbollah issued a statement denying
that it had any ties to the 18 people arrested, or to any other
``organizational structures'' in the United States. Several Muslims
who showed up this weekend at the Cedars Lebanese Restaurant and
grocery store in Charlotte _ only to find it had been shut down by
the government as a money-laundering front for the group _ insisted
that those arrested had nothing to do with the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   A man who identified himself only as Ahmed said he was a friend
of some of the suspects. Brandishing the business cards of two FBI
agents as proof, he said his home had been searched by agents on
Friday before he was allowed to go. He said the only money sent to
Lebanon by those arrested went to relatives or to legitimate
charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are only doing this because we are Arabs and this is not
an Arab place,'' he said. ``I know the people in this store. They
are regular businessmen who would never smuggle cigarettes or get
involved with terrorism. The FBI took the Koran from my home. It
just shows the real reason they are doing this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Around the corner, at the only other store here that sells halal
meat approved for use by orthodox Muslims, patrons said there were
several thousand Muslims in the area, only a small portion of whom
are Lebanese. No one in the store said they believed the charges
were true, and several said the civil liberties of the suspects had
been violated.
</P>
<P>
   When the anti-terrorism law was passed, civil libertarians said
they were concerned that the law infringed on free speech and free
association. Damon Camp, an associate professor of criminal justice
at Georgia State University in Atlanta who specializes in domestic
terrorism, said that prosecutions under the law have been rare, and
this could provide an interesting test case if the defendants
challenge that charge.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, however, that the suspects were also charged with
cigarette smuggling, a more routine crime that does not raise the
same civil liberties issues.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting twist in this case is the group's extensive use
of computers, several of which were seized as evidence. Eldridge,
the neighbor of Hammoud, said he saw five desktop computers removed
from the house, and an empty Dell computer carton was in the
house's garbage can. The affidavit, citing confidential sources,
said that Hammoud downloaded speeches and songs from Hezbollah
sites on the Internet to use at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Another man charged on Friday, Said Mohammed Harb, was accused
of running a fraudulent Internet Web site design firm that had done
so well he recently purchased a $36,000 BMW and a Lincoln
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential source ``believes this business is fraudulent,
and involves the theft of credit card numbers, but Harb is being
extremely secretive about it,'' the affidavit said. ``The business
is called Digital Karma.''

REPUBLICANS PASS SPENDING BILLS AT RECORD CLIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to project a generous and efficient image
before their party's convention, Republican leaders in Congress are
passing spending bills at a whirlwind pace.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Republican lawmakers even seem willing to
increase spending on programs that are not usually first on their
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by accusations of being a ``do-nothing Congress'' that
cannot govern, House and Senate leaders have pushed through a
series of spending measures with a speed that has surprised many
longtime congressional watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been other years when they've completed their work
on appropriation bills by the end of the fiscal year,'' said Robert
Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and
now president of the Urban Institute. ``I don't ever remember there
being this sort of turbo-charged activity in July.''
</P>
<P>
   When the House convenes this week, its leaders expect members to
approve the last of 13 bills that finance the federal government, a
$414 million spending measure for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Should that measure be approved as expected, it would be the
first time in recent memory that the House had passed all 13
spending bills before its August recess.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate has not moved quite as quickly, it has approved
nine of the 13 bills and is expected to approve two more this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has ever done this many, this quick in less time,''
said Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, as he entered
the House chamber on Thursday night for one of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the speed that is remarkable. This week
negotiators from the Senate and House, and possibly the Clinton
administration, will try to reach agreement on a mammoth bill that
finances the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   As those talks begin, House leaders have already signaled a
willingness to increase spending in the bill by $6 billion,
bringing the total for discretionary spending to over $106 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is about the same amount that President Clinton had
requested for the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Republican lawmakers to spend more on
domestic programs helps illustrate how the party's outlook has
changed. It is the result of the projected surplus of $2.2 trillion
in the non-Social Security budget over the next 10 years, election
year politics and the need to protect its slim majority in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Far from talking about dismantling the Department of Education,
as they did after taking control of Congress five years ago,
Republican leaders are now saying they would propose spending more
money on education than Clinton had requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be on the wrong side of education,'' said an
aide to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``The debate is going
to be on who gets to spend the money and what it's spent on, not on
us being against spending it.'' Still, John Podesta, the White
House chief of staff, said Sunday that important differences
remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't funded our program to put more teachers in the
classrooms,'' Podesta said on the ABC News program ``This Week.''
``They haven't funded our program to repair crumbling schools. They
haven't funded our program to demand more accountability from
schools, to increase teacher standards, to provide after-school and
summer-school care.''
</P>
<P>
   Several conservatives in the Republican Party are unhappy
because they believe the bills will push spending beyond the $600
billion limit on discretionary spending for the current fiscal year
that Congress already has agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to blow the doors off the Treasury,'' said
Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., one of the chamber's most conservative
members. ``I feel we're heading towards $640 billion in spending,
maybe $650 billion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans are not the only ones who are acting in ways that
belie recent rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, large numbers of Democrats in the House and the
Senate deserted their party's leadership and voted to repeal the
estate tax and to cut taxes for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   Reischauer said the existence of the surplus meant that charges
of fiscal irresponsibility could not be easily leveled against
those who were advocating tax cuts or spending increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are unsure that the promise of tax cuts won't
suddenly catch hold with the electorate, so they're inching towards
where the Republicans are,'' he said, ``and the Republicans are
realizing that they don't want to go into an election with the
president pounding on them for denying funds for things like
education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   None of this guarantees that there will not be a reprise of the
bitter, end-of-the-fiscal-year negotiations over the federal
budget. Clinton has vowed to veto six of the spending bills,
largely because he believes they do not provide enough money.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials worry that House Republicans may add
money to several bills in order to reach agreement with the Senate
before the Republican National Convention. But without an agreement
to spend beyond the $600 billion ceiling, other measures, like the
one financing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, may
be shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they start fixing bills to get them through before the
recess, you've got to ask if there will be enough to fix all of
them,'' said Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and
Budget.

 &HT;    Tiger's slam dunk Career slam at 24
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Forget the comparisons of Tiger Woods to
Michael Jordan. They're totally bogus. At least Jordan had Larry
Bird or Magic Johnson around at crunch time to occasionally match
him basket for basket.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is going unguarded at every major championship, and
there's no telling when it will end.
</P>
<P>
   His British Open victory Sunday at the Old Course came as no
surprise to anyone who could distinguish the Road Hole from a road
trip. He closed with a 3-under-par 69 to win the 129th British Open
by eight shots with a tournament record score of 19-under 269.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also became the youngest golfer, at 24, to win all four
majors, surpassing Jack Nicklaus, who accomplished the feat at 26.
Ben Hogan, Gene Sarazen and Gary Player are the only other players
to win all four majors during their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute California ice plant for Scottish gorse, and this
Open could have been called ``Pebble Beach II,'' where Woods won by
15 shots last month. In fact, it appeared the toughest thing he did
all week was gather his stuff at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago that I said I didn't think there'd
ever be another Jack Nicklaus, but we're looking at one,'' Mark
Calcavecchia said of Woods. ``He is it. He is the chosen one. . . .
If you want to know my honest opinion, he's the best player that
ever played right now, and he's only 24.''
</P>
<P>
   And who can argue? Of Woods' four major victories as a
professional, only the PGA Championship at Medinah last year did
not produce a record score. He set new marks at the 1997 Masters
(18-under 270), the 2000 U.S. Open (12-under 272) and now the
British Open, breaking Nick Faldo's 1990 mark of 18-under 270.
</P>
<P>
   His next test will come next month at the PGA Championship at
Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Ky., when Woods will try to
become the first player in 47 years to win three majors in the same
year. Ben Hogan did it in 1953 with victories in the Masters, U.S.
Open and British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to put into words the emotions and the
feelings going through me and the thoughts that are running through
my head,'' Woods said, while looking at his name which had just
been engraved into the Claret Jug. ``It has surprised me that I
would have all four, but I thought I would have a chance to win all
four. . . . I know I felt my game was good enough and I knew I had
the drive to compete, but you need to have luck going your way and
have an opportunity to get a few bounces.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension was never really a part of the Sunday story. Playing
partner David Duval cut Woods' six-shot lead to three at the turn,
but the momentum turned at the 12th hole, when Woods birdied and
Duval bogeyed after failing to chip over a slope at the green.
Everything totally disintegrated for Duval at the 17th, when he
found the dreaded Road Hole Bunker with his second, required four
shots to exit and took a quadruple-bogey 8. Instead of second
place, Duval finished a tie for 11th with a 75, finishing at
7-under 281.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also bogeyed the 17th, but made so few errors all week, he
never even found one of the Old Course' 112 bunkers. He is the
first to win back-to-back majors since Nick Price won the 1994
British Open and PGA.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 19th time in 21 opportunities that Woods has closed
the deal on Sunday with at least a share of the lead. He won for
the 16th time in his last 29 worldwide events and collected 500,000
British pounds ($759,150).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy, shocking, and it's the best player in the world
doing it,'' said Fred Couples, who tied for sixth at 9-under.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Nicklaus has got the greatest record of all time, and by
the time it's all said and done he might still have the greatest
record of all time,'' Calcavecchia said. ``But if Jack was in his
prime today I don't think he could keep up with Tiger.''

WITH LITTLE WATER LEFT, TEXANS BAND TOGETHER TO HELP TOWN DIG
TOWARD NEW SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THROCKMORTON, Texas _ Herbert Williams is 75 years old, and no
one would blame him if he stayed home and took it easy. But with
the broiling heat pushing the thermometer to 104 degrees, Williams
stood in his blue overalls and joined in a project that has become
a matter of survival for this dusty little town _ shoveling dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every corner of Texas knows the grip of drought this
year. But here, more than anywhere else, that grip is a choke hold.
In about 50 days, maybe 60, officials say, the lake that provides
water for the 1,063 residents here will go dry _ unless there is a
miraculous turn in the weather.
</P>
<P>
   There is no other water, no backup system and no sign of rain.
</P>
<P>
   So this week the town began a variation of an old-time barn
raising: volunteers are working to dig about 20 miles of
underground pipeline to connect with a water system in the nearby
town of Elbert before time, and water, run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Steve Bowlin, head of Throckmorton's
Public Works Department, taking some shade beneath an oak tree as
crews worked nearby. ``It tells me that there are still a lot of
fine people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state made rich and famous by oil, there is no more
precious natural resource today than water. Reservoirs are at their
third lowest capacity in 23 years. Small cities like Abilene and
San Angelo, and metropolitan areas like San Antonio, are under
water conservation plans. The state usually suffers one drought
every decade, but this is the third in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One word, dry,'' said Leonard Olson, the spokesman for the
Texas Water Development Board, noting that it had not rained in
Austin, the capital, in 31 days. ``I think Throckmorton is probably
the worst case that we know of,'' because of the lack of alternate
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated in the rugged ranch country of northwest Texas, about
three hours west of Dallas, Throckmorton was once the last stop on
the railroad, a place still called the ``capital of cow country''
because of the surrounding cattle ranches. For years, the town has
drawn water from the lake bearing its name, but without any
underground aquifers, it has no other source.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I moved down here, it was raining all the time,'' said
Bowlin, 39, who came three years ago. ``I made the comment to my
wife that I thought my feet were going to go webbed. But it hasn't
rained since.''
</P>
<P>
   It has rained occasionally in Throckmorton, but little that has
fallen has accumulated in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   By last fall, Bowlin and Mayor John Kunkel realized that another
water source would be needed to prevent an emergency. But the town
had floated bonds in the 1980s to build its pumping system and
could not afford the money for a new pipeline. So it went looking
for money, and received a $200,000 federal grant. It also received
a state grant in June, and Gov. George W. Bush declared the town a
disaster area. The state grant included $800,000 for materials but
required that Throckmorton provide the labor.
</P>
<P>
   With only 11 full-time and part-time municipal employees, the
town needed help. So Bowlin and Kunkel began spreading the word to
surrounding communities that volunteers were needed. The story made
the news media. On Monday, the first planned day of digging, no one
knew if anyone would show up.
</P>
<P>
   They did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is anybody is working on this project,'' said
Charles Fischer, the pastor of the town's First Baptist Church, who
worked on the pipeline all week before breaking to prepare for a
wedding and his Sunday sermon.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people were waiting on Monday, and have been
coming back since. They include most of the town's available,
able-bodied citizens; those unable to work sent donations or, like
a Baptist men's group, helped nourish the diggers.
</P>
<P>
   A chain gang of inmates did not have a choice about digging. But
a group of enlistees from the nearby Air Force base did, and they
reported for work along with a group of volunteers from the Navy. A
chaplain on a motorcycle rumbled in from east Texas. Others came
from Amarillo and beyond, and Williams arrived from the town of
Rule, about 45 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came over here to help our neighbors,'' said Williams
</P>
<P>
   A television station in Abilene led a drive for bottled water,
and nearly three truckloads of water arrived from San Antonio,
courtesy of a grocery chain. Construction companies have donated
backhoes and ditch-digging machines. Surrounding towns like Seymour
have loaned city equipment and workers. The local fire whistle is
sounded every time a truck arrives with shipments of suntan lotion,
caps or bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's listening for the fire whistle to go off, because
that means we need to go unload a truck,'' said Angela Oliver, who
hands out cold drinks and wet rags to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlin, the public works director, is cautiously optimistic.
Five miles of trench have been dug, and he was expecting fast
progress due to the ditch-digging equipment. He hopes more
volunteers arrive to help shovel sand into the trench after the
pipe is connected. He thinks the line can be completed in less than
a month.
</P>
<P>
   His main worry is whether two pumping stations can be finished
in time. If not, he said an emergency plan calls for trucking in
water.
</P>
<P>
   There is still hope, however bleak, for a downpour. Every
Tuesday, people gather outside the county courthouse to pray for
rain. Two letters have arrived at City Hall with instructions on
how to properly pray for rain. Another letter, published in The
Throckmorton Tribune, suggested killing a snake and laying it over
a fence at dusk as one way of provoking the skies. Other people are
watching for turtles and tarantulas crossing the road to high
ground, a sure sign of rain in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, people are digging. Cots are set up in the church
assembly halls for volunteers, and other out-of-towners are staying
with residents. The hospital has donated wet rags for people
working in the oppressive heat. A Red Cross disaster relief truck
drives along the work site, and a voice over the intercom
announces, ``Watermelon slices! Orange slices!''
</P>
<P>
   One worker, Lester Sullivan, 31, drove a few hundred miles east
from Amarillo when he heard about Throckmorton on the local news.
An out-of-work truck driver in sandals, Sullivan was shoveling sand
into the trench to make a bed for the pipeline. He was relieved
when Oliver arrived with a Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   Why drive several hours just to shovel sand for strangers?
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan smiled and said he planned to stay until the job was
done. ``One of these day I might need some help,'' he said, ``and I
figure somebody from here might come to help out.''

 &HT;    Inductee's speech left some holding their breath
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Broadcaster Marty Brennaman's induction
speech Sunday at The Clark Sports Center outside Cooperstown and
about a mile from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum had
some people's brows sweaty the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Brennaman told several people he planned to address Pete Rose's
situation in his speech, perhaps making an impassioned speech on
Rose's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   It was a major topic of discussion at a party in the Hall of
Fame Saturday night. Hall of Fame manager Tommy Lasorda and
baseball commissioner Bud Selig discussed it at length, with
Lasorda saying some Hall of Famers might walk off the stage if
Brennaman made a political statement.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds Hall of Famers Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan
talked with Brennaman, making requests to keep it cool. Reds
television broadcaster George Grande, the induction ceremony master
of ceremonies, chatted with Brennaman.
</P>
<P>
   And Brennaman did talk about Rose during his speech, but it was
little more than passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . And now for those who should be in the Hall of Fame and
aren't,'' Brennaman said.
</P>
<P>
   Shouts of ``All right,'' erupted from some in the crowd after
Brennaman said that.
</P>
<P>
   But what he said was, ``Bob Howsam, for what he has done for the
game of baseball, belongs. Davey Concepcion, the premier shortstop
of his time, belongs, and, yes, by God, Peter Edward Rose, and the
only broadcasting partner I ever had, Joe Nuxhall.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. A mention. A few cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Perez broached the subject, too, including Rose along with
four Latins who Perez believes should be enshrined, including
teammate Dave Concepcion, who was in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Concepcion, Luis Tiant, Minnie Minoso, Tony Oliva and
Pete Rose, I hope, will get here because the feeling is so great,''
Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, though, finished his speech by saying, ``My advice to
everybody playing this game is to respect and honor the uniform you
wear, the fans, and the game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparky Anderson sidestepped Rose perfectly during his 25-minute
speech by saying, ``I'm not going to mention players or coaches
individually.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig was introduced and a smattering of boos
rippled through the crowd. As he began a short talk there were
chants of, ``We want Pete, we want Pete.'' Rose was in downtown
Cooperstown Friday, Saturday and early Sunday selling his
autograph.

CLINTON RETURNS TO MIDEAST TALKS AS THEY REACH MAKE-OR-BREAK
POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ With stakes mounting as the Camp David summit
nears its third week, President Clinton returned to negotiations
Sunday evening and American officials suggested that the talks, now
centered on the future of Jerusalem, could break apart in the next
day or solidify into a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a new aura of gravity to the discussion over Jerusalem,
the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, traveled to Saudi Arabia to
ensure Saudi support for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, as
he weighs an American proposal on the contested holy city.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomacy by Mubarak, who enjoys the best relations with
Arafat of any Arab leader, was seen by the Israelis and the
Americans as an effort to fashion a wall of Arab solidarity behind
the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans made it plain through the State Department
spokesman, Richard Boucher, that the summit would not go on
indefinitely and could reach a make-or-break point as soon as
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here for an unlimited period of time,'' Boucher
said. The president would be given an immediate assessment and this
would be ``very important'' in how the talks moved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, American officials suggested that if progress was not
made by Monday, it would be difficult to keep going. If the talks
moved toward midweek, they added, that would be a sign that things
were going well.
</P>
<P>
   At his summer palace outside Rome, Pope John Paul II entered the
Camp David debate, exhorting the summit leaders in his weekly
Sunday address to adopt a long-held Vatican position that a special
international status be extended to the holy sites in the old city
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As important figures on the outside tried to nudge the
conference toward an agreement, Clinton left behind the relative
calm of an uncontentious economic summit in Japan, and entered what
appeared to be, from several accounts, a razor-edge atmosphere
among the Israelis and Palestinians at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve the tensions, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak,
visited the Civil War battlefields at Gettysburg Sunday with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Arafat relaxed at Albright's
Virginia farm where she served him lunch Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But these outings were mere interludes in a process that is
inexorably building toward a climax, one way or the other. The
conference went into its 13th day Sunday, the entire duration of
the first Middle East peace conference at Camp David under the
auspices of President Carter in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have been publicly stating over the last few days
that Barak was willing to make concessions on Jerusalem, though it
was far from clear that they would be enough for Arafat. Gadi
Baltiansky, Barak's spokesman, suggested that the Israelis believed
the summit had entered its critical phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't take a lot of time,'' Baltiansky said. ``President
Clinton will return to Camp David and then we will see if there is
any point in staying here, and going on with the talks, or to pack
the luggage and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's absence, the stakes grew in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter he wrote to Clinton before the summit was pronounced
dead and then swiftly revived last Wednesday night, Barak stated,
according to leaks in the Israeli press, that if the summit ended
with no overall accord, he would walk away from even those points
to which he had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have suggested that they may be facing an
all-or-nothing outcome and a situation at the very end in which
Clinton will be trying to rescue partial progress from the rubble
of a blow up over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   One way of looking at the negotiations as they unfold in the
next day or so, according to this scenario, is as a rock being
pushed up a hill. If a full agreement formally bringing an end to
the 52-year conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is not
achieved, then the progress on some of the less explosive issues,
like the territorial shape of a new Palestinian state and the fate
of Palestinian refugees, could be wiped out as the rock rolled back
down the slope.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton left for Japan, he and his negotiators, according
to Israeli and Palestinian reports, presented some compromise
solutions for Jerusalem. These centered on degrees of sovereignty
in East Jerusalem for the Palestinians, who claim all of East
Jerusalem as the capital of their new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The principle of the American compromise appears to be virtually
full sovereignty for the Palestinians over Palestinian villages in
East Jerusalem and what one analyst called a ``sense of
sovereignty'' over the Muslim religious sites in the center of Old
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals reportedly envision some form of ``shared
sovereignty'' over parts of East Jerusalem adjacent to the eastern
part of the old city.
</P>
<P>
   The reports in Israel say that these are ideas that Barak has
agreed to and that they are concessions that go far beyond what any
other Israeli leader has made.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Israeli accounts of the American proposal _ which is
believed to have been worked on and amended in Clinton's absence _
report that a final decision on the status of the old city, site of
monuments considered most holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians,
would be deferred.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian reports say that these ideas are not sufficient
for Arafat to do a deal. Officials who have been in touch with the
Palestinian delegation report that Arafat is unimpressed by the
American proposals. Given the news blackout covering all aspects of
the negotiations, it is impossible to know how much these
descriptions of a defiant Arafat are for home consumption or how
much they reflect a true picture.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Palestinian negotiators, Abu Mazen, who had left the
talks to return home, came back Sunday saying that Arafat would not
accept a deal that did not include satisfaction on Jerusalem. A
partial agreement was not in the cards, Mazen said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's visit to King Fahd in Saudi Arabia also raised the
stakes because the Saudi royal family are the protectors of Mecca
and Medina, the two holiest Islamic sites, and have a huge interest
in the Islamic site in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers met to
discuss the Camp David negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has often contended that he did not have a mandate from
the Arab and Muslim world to make decisions that would permanently
cede sovereignty to Israel in East Jerusalem, in particular over
the Muslim and Christian religious sites in the old city.
</P>
<P>
   The Haram al-Sharif, or noble sanctuary, in East Jerusalem is
the third- holiest Muslim site, consisting of the Al-Aqsa Mosque
and the Dome of the Rock. The complex was in the custody of the
Jordanian royal family until the 1967 war when the Israelis pushed
the Jordanians out of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As Arafat considered what to do about East Jerusalem, he got
pressure from another quarter Sunday. The leader of the militant
Hamas movement, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said in Gaza that he would be
willing to declare a truce with Israel only if Israel agreed to
withdraw completely to the 1967 borders from the West Bank, Gaza
strip and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's appeal was based on a longstanding view of the Roman
Catholic church that the Israeli conquest of East Jerusalem and its
annexation to Israel was an act of occupation. In February, the
Vatican signed an accord with the Palestinians calling for freedom
of worship in all the holy sites of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In his address at his summer retreat, Castel Gandolfo, the pope
said: ``The Holy See continues to maintain that only a special
statute internationally guaranteed can effectively preserve the
most sacred areas of the Holy City.''
</P>
<P>
   Such international safeguards would ``assure freedom of religion
and of worship for all the faithful who, in the region and the
entire world, look to Jerusalem as a crossroads of peace and of
coexistence,'' John Paul said, invoking the city's ``holy places
and the three monotheistic religions that surround them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Japan for Washington, Clinton praised the two
sides for making a ``sort of systematic effort'' on a lot of
issues. But he was cautious about an outcome: ``Whatever happens,''
he said, ``I think they have continued to make headway.''

 &HT;    This day belongs to Reds
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ A sign far out in the crowd, beyond a snow
fence in a grassy pasture on the outskirts of Cooperstown and the
Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, put the right twist on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   ``And this day belonged to the Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rip-off of newly inducted Hall of Fame broadcaster
Marty Brennaman's patented final out of a game call when the
Cincinnati Reds win, ``And this one belongs to the Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Perez, Sparky Anderson, Bid McPhee and Brennaman made
Sunday a four-star gala for the Reds, all inductees along with
Carlton Fisk and Negro League legend Turkey Stearnes as 25,000
watched, about 10,000 above the usual turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Johnny Bench, one of Perez's Big Red Machine
teammates, put it perfectly when he said, ``I cried the day Perez
was traded (by the Reds) and I cried the day he was voted into the
Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no tears from Perez, though, just a full-power smile
from start to finish. He won the crowd as he spoke from his heart
in his broken English.
</P>
<P>
   Turning on the stage to Anderson, Perez said, ``My dear friend
Sparky, I think they made me wait for so long so that we could go
in together.'' Perez, short of votes nine straight years, made it
on the 10th try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a king at his coronation ever felt better than I
do today,'' said the man who spent 23 years in the major leagues
but not a day on the disabled list. ``I always played to win and I
never cared about my personal numbers. Cincinnati? It is a city
that refused to boo me, ever, even in my worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, of course, praised everybody but himself in a
25-minute speech, easily topped by an hour's worth of words from
Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of managers,'' Anderson said. ``There are
bad managers with bad players and they get fired. There are good
managers with good players who become geniuses. I was a genius
because I had good players and I stayed out of their way and they
let me stay around for 26 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson managed the Cincinnati Reds to World Series titles in
1975 and '76, then was fired by Club President Dick Wagner after
the '78 season when Anderson wouldn't fire a couple of his coaches.
Wagner was present at the induction and Anderson said, ``I loved
Dick Wagner then, I love Dick Wagner now and I'll love him when I
leave this earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also praised former Reds club president/general manager
Bob Howsam, the man who hired him in 1970 as manager, who also was
in the crowd. ``Bob Howsam gave me the job when I was 35,''
Anderson said. ``I thought he was crazy, the world thought he was
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers hired Anderson a year later and he won the
1984 World Series title, becoming the only manager to win a World
Series trophy in both leagues. His 2,194 victories are third
all-time behind Hall of Famers Connie Mack and John McGraw.
Anderson is only the 16th manager inducted into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my old coaches, George Scherger, had all the smarts,''
Anderson said. ``I had the title. George took care of all the
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, who hit the historic 12th-inning game-winning home run in
Game 6 of the 1975 World Series for the Boston Red Sox over the
Reds, told the crowd, ``You know we won that World Series, three
games to four.''
</P>
<P>
   While Fisk's famous home run is the historic landmark of the
1975 World Series, the Reds did win it, winning Game 7 with Perez
playing a huge part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were losing Game 7 and Sparky was up in the tunnel behind
the dugout pacing and grumbling,'' Perez said. ``I asked him,
`What's the matter?' He said, `It's Game 7 of the World Series, the
seventh inning and we're behind, 3-0. What do you think is the
matter?' I told him, `Relax, don't worry, I'll hit a three-run
homer this inning. The game is not over.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perez nearly delivered. He hit a two-run home run, cutting the
Boston lead to 3-2. Joe Morgan dropped a game-winning single in the
ninth to give the Reds the World Series and there was the anxious
Anderson hugging coach Scherger and saying, ``We're going to win
this again, Sugar Bear. We're going to win it again, Sugar Bear.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Perez's help in '76, they won it again. Then they
traded Perez after '76. Bench cried, the fans cried, Perez cried
and the Reds didn't win another World Series title until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Sparky, of course, injected his usual faux pas. Talking about
former President George Bush, Sparky said, ``The late George Bush .
. . well, he isn't late, he's still with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, Cuban-born and now a Puerto Rican native, played for
Cincinnati, Boston, Philadelphia and for Montreal in the
French-speaking province of Quebec. He finished his speech by
saying, ``Thank you very much, merci beaucoups, muchas gracias.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sparing the approaching Republican National
Convention a civic eyesore, bulldozers are moving in on the last of
the 957 sinking homes of the Logan triangle, a stricken
working-class swath of north Philadelphia that has festered as an
urban disaster for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city suddenly told me I had to get out,'' said Suzette
Williams, hurriedly packing a moving van after 30 years on North
11th Street. This is the epicenter of a once vital 17-block
neighborhood that is now an inner-city prairie dotted with skeletal
buildings and a score of lingering residents of Logan's last stand.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old neighborhood's collapse into its own unstable
landfill is stark evidence that the vaunted Philadelphia
renaissance that is attracting the Republican conventioneers is at
least a tale of two cities: the glittering downtown of new hotels
and trendy restaurants, and frayed old working-class neighborhoods
like Logan, five miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens in poor, predominantly black areas complain that the
city leadership has been preoccupied with attracting downtown
tourists who stay overnight, rather than stemming the working-class
flight of some 250,000 residents in the last decade from
neighborhoods freighted with neglect.
</P>
<P>
   As the city government hurries to raze the Logan hulks, and even
mow the summer weeds on the ghostly 47-acre wasteland, what
remains, church and civic leaders are emphasizing, is a gaunt but
most inviting campaign backdrop for any venturesome presidential
contender who might want to stop by during the convention and speak
firsthand to the issue of inner-city housing for the working class
and striving poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush should come here and put some meat on the bones of
his compassionate conservatism,'' said the Rev. Kermit L. Newkirk,
pastor of the Harold O. Davis Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, city officials had promised to raze all 957 buildings
and to compensate and relocate the 5,000 residents within three
years. That was in 1986, when the crumbling neighborhood first
seized the city's attention with an explosion caused by an
underground gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   The initial prescription of relocation and redevelopment that
was supposed to take three years to accomplish is now in its 15th
year, having spawned a separate quasi-government agency with its
own patronage, retirement benefits and petty scandals.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, activists in this old-line Democratic
neighborhood have been politely courting Republican state
officials, some of whom have been responsive and credible, Newkirk
said. His frustration is clear after 14 years of struggling with
successive Democratic city administrations over the houses'
cracking and sinking as their landfill of ash heaps shifted with
saturation from an underground creek and ruptured utility pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators have also found dangerous levels of lead
and are testing for other contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Activists with assorted protest causes, from the global economy
to gay rights, will soon be arriving in the city to take to the
streets for the four-day Republican convention, opening on July 31.
But only Logan is offering a vivid on-site experience and
eyewitness guides through a tortured saga of neighborhood blight,
political promises and bureaucratic nostrums.
</P>
<P>
   When the opening gavel sounds at the convention center, Logan
will have its own uptown welcoming event. Handbills and public bus
advertising downtown will offer conventioneers graphic photos of
the devastation, and pose the question ``What is the Republican
response?''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the convention preparations have spurred city
officials into faster demolition action. ``We're getting rid of
everything over in Logan; I never want to hear that name again!'' a
city official shouted from his car last week at the Rev. Mary
Laney, of St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   The church serves the surrounding neighborhoods, where, Laney
noted, property values have become depressed and housing sales have
frozen. This is because of warnings that the nearby problem with
unstable landfill and underground piping may be spreading to as
many as 4,000 additional houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trapped here,'' said Michael Brown, who owns a home just
outside the officially defined area of sinkage, which some city
officials concede was arbitrary in the first place. He watched
Williams pack for her move from North 11th Street.
</P>
<P>
   He stood in front of his own house just 30 feet away and told of
the same problems of deep foundation cracks, sewage flooding in the
basement, and tilting, cracked walls and porch. ``My house is paid
for, but no one will buy it and no one will put up a mortgage for
it,'' Brown said, sounding desperate. ``You can't give my house
away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Logan's local leaders underline the news from City Hall that
Mayor John F. Street, a Democrat, will be attending the
neighborhood welcome, nine months after he campaigned in Logan
promising fresh initiative and $37 million in additional help for
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   This would roughly double what has been spent so far. Logan
activists criticize former Mayor W. Wilson Goode for his handling
of the initial crisis and former Mayor Edward G. Rendell for
managing Philadelphia's downtown renewal far more successfully than
Logan's.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bulldozing amounts to a victory for us,'' said Ceci
Schickel, chief organizer for Philadelphia Interfaith Action, a
regional church and civic association. The group has been working
with the Industrial Areas Foundation, a nationwide organization
that is trying to make a campaign issue of housing, low wages and
other problems of the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are in denial about complicated, massive problems
like Logan,'' said Mike Kecan, a foundation organizer. ``Their talk
of faith-based solutions is tokenism.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustrations in Logan were only compounded last summer when
some homes were ruled endangered in the city's predominantly white
Wissinoming neighborhood because of unstable landfill. Residents
affected by this far smaller problem involving a dozen homes
received relocation and compensation help within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had nothing but trouble for years trying to get my
money,'' Williams said after completing her packing. ``This is
still my community,'' she said as she departed.

SIERRA CLUB ENDORSES GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, one of the nation's largest and most
influential environmental groups, will endorse Vice President Al
Gore Monday at a news conference where its president, Robert Cox,
will declare that Gore would be ``the most pro-environment''
president in modern history if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Sease, the Sierra Club's legislative director, said 12 of
the group's 15 board members voted to endorse Gore on Saturday.
Only one member wanted to endorse Ralph Nader, the Green Party
candidate. Among those voting for Gore was Michael Dorsey, a
college professor from Michigan who wrote a memorandum sharply
criticizing Gore last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sease said the board members supported Gore not only because of
his strong environmental record, but also because they viewed his
Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, as a real threat to clean
air and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has made it very clear that he plans to undo and undercut
and weaken the very provisions that have given us the environmental
progress we have had in the last several decades,'' Sease said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club has already run television advertisements
criticizing Bush in select states. Now, with its endorsement, the
organization will also try to mobilize its 600,000 members to work
toward Gore's election.
</P>
<P>
   Another major environmental group, the League of Conservation
Voters, has also endorsed Gore. The only other national
environmental group that endorses presidential candidates, Friends
of the Earth, the smallest of the three, is still weighing whether
to support Gore or Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore wrote a book on global warming titled ``Earth in
the Balance,'' he has been sharply criticized by some
environmentalists, particularly for his strong support of global
trade.

 &HT;    Fox's fall schedule falling apart
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It says something about Fox's fall schedule that
the most talked-about and best-received screening was not David E.
Kelley's ``Boston Public'' or any of the network's many dark and
creepy dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, everybody was merrily howling at ``The Tick,'' a
live-action series for midseason about a big blue superhero who
longs for truth, justice and a place to crash. Based on the
cult-fave comic book by Ben Edlund and the subsequent Saturday
morning cartoon, the new version stars Patrick Warburton, best
known for his portrayal of Elaine's boyfriend Puddy on
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Prowling the city, crashing through rooftops, the Tick is
assisted by mild-mannered accountant Arthur (David Burke), who dons
a white bodysuit with huge wings to become Moth Man; Latin lover
Bat Manuel (Nestor Carbonell), a vision in brown; and Captain
Liberty (Liz Vassey), who can't keep her hands off the hot-blooded
ladies' man.
</P>
<P>
   If the key to establishing a hit these days is standing out in
the crowd, ``The Tick'' is destined for greatness. The dialogue is
certainly distinctive. ``No offense intended,'' Arthur says to the
Tick after insulting him. ``None comprehended,'' the Tick replies.
And the sets and costumes are outrageous. The Tick wears a bright
blue Latex body suit with huge built-in muscles and
remote-controlled, motorized antennae manipulated off-screen by a
puppeteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks really cool, but it's hot and you sweat a lot,''
Warburton said of his suit. ``But the antennae are a total gift. I
don't have to do anything, and I get a big laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to a design flaw, however, Warburton needs an hour to use
the bathroom. Consequently, he refuses to drink anything while
filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tick'' is so different it may be off-putting to some
viewers, but producer Barry Sonnenfeld (``Men in Black'') is sure
it will catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dry, visual, understated humor,'' he said. ``The actors
deliver these huge lines without ever acknowledging they're funny,
and that's key. I watched it religiously when it was a cartoon. It
works for 7-year-old girls and 45-year-old Jews as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Entertainment Group for only a
few months, is presiding over a half-baked fall schedule dominated
by creepy sci-fi series that was developed under a different
regime. He's not thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to reporters last week, Grushow agreed that Fox has too
many new series and too many that are dark. In a cosmetic move, Fox
asked the producers (from ``The Blair Witch Project'') to change
the title of ``Fearsum'' to ``Freaky Links,'' which sounds sunnier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't decide to go dark, there just weren't any 'blue sky'
dramas there for us,'' Grushow said. ``The problem is we only had
seven strong returning series and a lot more holes to fill than we
imagined. The range of the material developed just wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   And deadlines aren't being met. Two shows announced for fall,
``The Michael Crichton Project'' and ``The X-Files'' spinoff ``The
Lone Gunmen,'' have been pushed back to midseason. One show, the
sitcom ``Schimmel,'' was dropped because the stand-up comic who
starred in it has cancer. And the pilot for John Goodman's new
sitcom, in which he plays a gay single father, has been retooled.
</P>
<P>
   The network is so desperate it un-canceled ``Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow promised that two shows that sagged last season, ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``The X-Files,'' will be ``creatively rejuvenated.''
``Ally'' will cut back on the wild flights of fantasy, and ``The
X-Files'' will introduce a new agent, played by ``Terminator 2''
villain Robert Patrick, to fill the 10 episodes without David
Duchovny. Major storylines will involve Scully's mysterious
pregnancy, which was revealed in the cliffhanger, and Mulder's
alien abduction _ which perhaps will explain the actor's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Duly chastised by the ``Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire''
fiasco, Grushow said he has turned down proposals for several
reality shows, including ``meanest neighbors and worst plastic
surgery nightmares.'' He said if he considers any others, he'll
hire a risk management firm to check them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take a really hard look at these things because
you're playing with fire,'' he said.

INNER VOICE ASSURES SLEUTH HE'S RIGHT ABOUT DEEP THROAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing off the record, nothing semi-deep or
shallow background,'' said Leonard Garment in a parody of this
gossip-tossed city as he leaned back in his chair to plug a book in
which he claims to have figured out who Deep Throat really is. Deep
Throat from the Watergate scandal a generation ago. Deep Throat,
the carefully veiled supersource of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein
in their book-become-movie ``All the President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Our reportorial source, Garment, spoke in a steady, low tone
eight floors above the shadowy underground garage of his law
office, with the rest of the capital city unaware of this meeting.
The old Nixon loyalist and obsessive Watergate survivor made
frequent eye contact, suggesting he was trying to seem nonevasive.
(Or perhaps he was actually nonevasive. Who can say with certainty
in such a city? Particularly since there was no second sourcing of
any of this encounter, which was quietly arranged by a book
publicist whose identity must be protected to the grave.)
</P>
<P>
   ``John Sears,'' Garment said without whisper or flinch,
identifying the man he deduces after years of amateur sleuthing to
be Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   John Sears was a political lieutenant of Richard M. Nixon's who
lost out in the early in-fighting of the Nixon White House,
remained a respected strategist with close ties to numerous
Republican figures and later served as a director of Ronald
Reagan's presidential quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no DNA identification,'' Garment conceded of his grand
surmise. He noted that even before the book was published, Sears
met with Garment to flatly deny he was Deep Throat. He threatened
to take a lie detector test and sue the author for the honor and/or
dishonor of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may well sue,'' Sears angrily declared in an interview,
denying Garment's thesis as ``absolute nonsense.'' ``I never met
anyone in alleyways,'' Sears said. ``I never knew Woodward until
well after Watergate,'' he said, treating the Garment contention as
outrageous tomfoolery.
</P>
<P>
   Guessing who Deep Throat is used to be a capital parlor game in
the years immediately after Watergate. Whether anyone still cares
that much may be one of the few questions Garment can definitively
answer with his book, ``In Search of Deep Throat'' (Basic Books).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one that fits,'' insisted Garment, a 76-year-old
mainline lawyer and former jazz musician from Brooklyn. He
described his detective ``riffing'' as an exhaustive but strangely
joyful exercise in vetting and rejecting all but one of the score
of usual Deep Throat suspects, from the humblest in his book (Noble
Mellencamp) to the hottest (Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah).
Many were old buddies from the rise and fall of President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Garment said, his search was treated as a harmless
hobby, a kind of political macrame, by his wife, Suzanne, a writer
who is studying to be a lawyer; and their children, Paul, a
classical musician; Sara, a writer; and Annie, who is about to
start Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Garment operated not from concrete evidence _ there really isn't
any _ as much as intuitive guesswork. He was a White House insider
who survived the scandal unsullied and, by his own account,
enraptured by the high-stakes anguish and petty knavery he
witnessed up close. All suspects but Sears, he finally decided,
lacked the sophisticated mastery of detail and the media-canny
opportunism embodied in Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   Sears confirmed that when he warned Garment off the idea last
April he admitted to having been one of this city's many
unidentified corollary sources in the raft of news stories, but
never such a melodramatic fount as Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Bernstein by telephone, and the only reason I did
is because I had a client,'' Sears said this week, speaking of John
Caulfield, a White House aide during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   But Garment has constructed a cat's-cradle of hints and theories
about Sears. ``I have played the game according to their rules,''
Garment said, referring to the scant details about Deep Throat's
haunting persona and omniscient walk-ons contained in the book by
Bernstein and Woodward. The two have steadfastly insisted Deep
Throat is a real individual and kept his name secret.
</P>
<P>
   Garment rejected the suspicion of some that Deep Throat was a
literary device or composite source. ``If Deep Throat is a hoax, it
would be a monumental one,'' he said. In the scandal-breaking
stories that made the two reporters celebrated in The Washington
Post, they never referred to Deep Throat. But the shadowy figure
eventually became a centerpiece as their best-selling book was
mapped out with book editors intrigued by newsroom mentions of
their Deep Throat source of last resort, the shadowy synthesizer of
fragmented leaks and clues.
</P>
<P>
   Garment bases his conclusions on nuances gleaned in repeated
readings of the works of the two reporters and in conversations and
confrontations with a rogues' gallery of Watergate figures. As much
as the cigarette-smoking, Scotch-drinking figure of Deep Throat
reminded him of Sears, even more did the Watergate book's sketch of
Deep Throat as a gifted late-night talker and analyst of the larger
forces ever scheming and self-protecting at the Nixon White House.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever refutations his book may spark, Garment says he finally
has gained ``the very particular sort of satisfaction we feel when
we have tied up one of the loose ends of the universe.'' But he is
hardly entitled to cosmic satisfaction, in the view of Sears, who
has his own intuitions about Watergate that, in contrast to his
accuser, he intends to keep private. ``I think I know who Deep
Throat was,'' Sears confidently declared in firmly declining the
distinction for himself.

SBC TO DISCLOSE SERIES OF STEPS TO RAISE PROFILE IN CYBERSPACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Texas) (Exclusive)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining the raft of big communications companies trying to
capitalize on Internet commerce, SBC Communications Inc. plans a
series of moves this week meant to enhance the company's presence
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to acquiring control of a small company that manages
Web sites for businesses, SBC intends to announce partnerships with
Commerce One Inc., the software maker, and with the consulting
firms Deloitte Consulting and Proxicom, people close to the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, the nation's second-largest regional telephone company,
also intends to announce that it is using equipment from Cisco
Systems Inc. to create a $50 million center for housing Internet
systems for business customers. SBC also plans soon to offer
software applications from Microsoft and others for use by
corporate clients _ an increasingly popular option for business
customers that want to avoid the cost and headaches of managing
their own desktop software.
</P>
<P>
   An SBC spokesman declined to comment, but one person close to
the company said the announcements could be made as soon as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year or so, many of the nation's biggest
communications carriers, including AT&AMP;T and Sprint, have begun
efforts to offer a range of complex business services far broader
than the relatively simple communications lines that have long been
the industry's mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation and the emergence of many new carriers have largely
turned the business of offering communications lines into a
commodity market, prompting carriers to seek better profit margins
through more advanced services.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, with its roughly $4 billion acquisition of Sterling
Commerce Inc. earlier this year, had already become the regional
Bell company with the biggest presence in electronic commerce.
Sterling develops systems that enable businesses to exchange
information electronically. This week's announcements would build
on the Sterling deal to allow SBC to offer a broader range of
so-called e-business services.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the cornerstone of this week's deals will be SBC's
announcement of an agreement to acquire a controlling stake in
InQuent Technologies, the corporate parent of WebHosting.com.
</P>
<P>
   WebHosting is a small company in Toronto that runs Web sites for
business customers. Full financial details were unclear late last
week, but one person close to the deal said that SBC would pay a
bit more than $100 million for a bare majority of InQuent.
</P>
<P>
   SBC already owns 20 percent of Bell Canada, which has a
marketing agreement with WebHosting.com. Late last week, the
companies were still negotiating a possible role for Bell Canada in
SBC's InQuent investment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new corporate customers that SBC would hope to sign
up as a result of the InQuent investment and the relationships with
Deloitte, part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and Proxicom could run
their Web sites from SBC's new Internet data center, to be located
in Dallas. The new center is set to open at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to operating Web sites, SBC also intends to begin
allowing corporate customers to use SBC's network and the new
Dallas center to run Microsoft's Exchange software, which allows
people in far-flung locations to collaborate electronically.
</P>
<P>
   SBC will face significant competition in its efforts to offer
more advanced business services. In fact, the big long-distance
carriers, unburdened by the regulatory constraints that have
largely prevented the Bell companies from offering long-distance
services, have generally taken the lead in that arena.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom Inc., for instance, runs the world's biggest Internet
carrier, UUnet, and is also moving to offer a more complete range
of e-commerce systems. In January, AT&AMP;T announced an initiative to
open its network to so-called ``applications service providers'' _
companies that remotely manage software applications for corporate
customers. Sprint has run Web sites for businesses since 1998, and
this spring the company began offering a broad package of
e-commerce services.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big local carriers, U S West was recently acquired by
Qwest Communications International Inc., which has built on its
advanced fiber optic network by striking a range of agreements with
software and consulting companies to run complex software
applications. Bell Atlantic recently merged with GTE, which
controlled the No. 2 Internet carrier, BBN.
</P>
<P>
   To win regulatory approval for their merger, Bell Atlantic and
GTE had to sell more than 90 percent of BBN, now named Genuity, to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the merged Bell Atlantic-GTE, now named Verizon
Communications, hopes to retake ownership of Genuity within a few
years. Genuity has moved quickly in recent years to offer corporate
customers packages of Internet access, e-commerce software and
electronic security systems.

A DUBIOUS LATE PENALTY LEAVES THE U.S. AGHAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMIE TRECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ The United States was not expected to win
this World Cup qualifying match _ but the Americans certainly did
not expect to lose it in the fashion that they did.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 28,000 people at Saprissa Stadium saw Hernan
Medford convert a controversial penalty in the 93rd minute to give
Costa Rica a 2-1 victory and 3 valuable points Sunday. That victory
will be forever tainted because the call that led to the penalty _
a hand ball charged against defender Gregg Berhalter _ was
dubious. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The result drops the Americans to the bottom of their group and
sets up a tough road for qualification. Now, the United States most
likely must win all three of its home matches to have a chance to
go to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The defeat meant
the Americans _ who have never won in Costa Rica _ also dropped
their series record with the Ticos to 7-8-3. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unable to control themselves right after the decisive call, the
American players stormed Referee Peter Prendergast of Jamaica and
had to be restrained. When they left the playing field, bottles and
other debris rained down upon the field.
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Reyna, the United States captain, appeared to bump the
referee and had to be restrained by his teammate Jason Kreis. Even
Coach Bruce Arena got into the action, and ultimately, security was
required to remove the officials from the field. But neither Reyna
nor Arena were shown cards by the referee, whose authority to issue
cautions or ejections extends even after the match.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, with the score tied, 1-1, Costa Rica appealed
for a penalty kick when Austin Berry was taken down by Frankie
Hedjuk as he cut across the top of the penalty area. The call
against Berhalter looked like a makeup to the Costa Rican fans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the hand ball call was indeed questionable: Prendergast was
behind Berhalter when the alleged offense occurred, and the
American defender said he could not have seen it. In fact, the play
itself _ a harmless cross from Medford that Berhalter seemingly
headed across the end line _ was so lackadaisical that the
Americans could have been forgiven for wondering exactly what was
going on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Arena minced no words. ``This was disgraceful,''
he said. ``I told the ref he cheated us, and I'd like to see him
walk in this locker room and explain this officiating to these
players.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No United States players were made available to the news media
after the match, but Berhalter, in a statement, said: ``I headed it
out of bounds. It did not touch my chest or hands. . . . the
referee was under pressure to make something happen and he made a
bad call.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, also in a statement said simply, ``We were robbed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until the the dying minutes of the game, there was little
remarkable about either team's performance. The United States
played poorly in first half, allowing Costa Rica to get on the
board in the 10th minute when Medford found Rolando Fonseca
unmarked on the left side of the field. Fonseca flashed the ball
past keeper Kasey Keller with a perfect header, and with that it
seemed as if the Ticos were on the path to a rout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first 45 minutes, the Americans struggled to even string
passes together, with Eddie Lewis, Reyna and Earnie Stewart all
struggling on the field. Shots were taken but went nowhere near the
goal and the one chance the United States had _ when Ante Razov
brilliantly dummied to David Regis _ went into the side net. Jafet
Soto carved up huge portions of the American defense and Harold
Wallace was allowed to roam from end to end. In fact, Lewis was
playing so poorly that Wallace _ his marker _ sometimes did not
even bother to shadow him tightly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the second half was a different story as the Americans began
to contain the speedy Costa Ricans and Keller began to make the
kind of saves he is known for.
</P>
<P>
   Stifling the Ticos almost single-handedly, Keller stopped shot
after shot from close range until his defense could get settled in
the first 20 minutes of the second half.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then, remarkably, the United States tied the match when Tony
Sanneh loped down the right side and found Razov free. Razov's
right-footed shot was saved by Alvaro Mesen, but bounced directly
to an unmarked Stewart. He shot cleanly home, and tied the game,
1-1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Costa Rican team, which had been under tremendous pressure
to win after dropping a game to lightly regarded Barbados _ in
fact, their players had been attacked on the streets by angry fans
this week _ fought back, but it seemed as if the United States
would be able to kill the game and abscond with a point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that did not happen. The Ticos had the better of the match.
``These last eight days we thought we had lost our World Cup,'' the
Costa Rican striker Paolo Wanchope said. ``This means we have it
back. Today we learned you must never quit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States players now must go home and regroup in
preparation for the next match, Aug. 16 in Foxboro, Mass., against
Barbados. It now becomes a must-win game for a team that felt
Sunday as if it had one stolen.  &QL;

MAYFIELD'S BLOWOUT ON FINAL LAP HELPS TEAMMATE WIN AT POCONO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE CALDWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Jeremy Mayfield's race car, propped on a jack,
was parked in a garage instead of in the winner's circle late
Sunday afternoon. The right front fender was charred. The right
front tire was a shredded mass of rubber. Tough, grinding Pocono
Raceway finally caught Mayfield on Sunday, then bit him.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks after he won a race here by nudging aside the
intimidating Dale Earnhardt on the last lap, Mayfield blew a tire
midway through the final lap Sunday and lost the Pennsylvania 500
to his Penske Racing teammate, Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the track owed me one,'' Mayfield said afterward,
forcing a smile. Mayfield, trying to become the fifth driver to win
both Nascar Winston Cup races in a single season at Pocono, passed
Wallace with 18 laps left in the 200-lap race and appeared to be
sailing toward a much less controversial victory than the one June
19 over Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mayfield rolled over something. Exactly what that was, no
one knew afterward. With Wallace and Jeff Burton chasing him into
Turn 2 of the tricky tri-oval, Mayfield's tire went down fast.
Wallace, as stunned as anyone, passed him for the lead and held off
Burton for his first victory since March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``His car just hung a right and went straight up to the wall,''
Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   The strange twist to this Pocono race was that Wallace caught
Mayfield because he was racing Burton for second place. Stock car
races are heavily influenced by aerodynamics. Two cars traveling
together, one in front of the other, tend to go faster than a car
running alone, even though Mayfield had a fast car and loves
running here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any place that's real hard on a driver getting set up on, he
excels at,'' said Peter Sospenzo, Mayfield's crew chief. Although
Wallace took a gamble on his last pit stop by taking only two fresh
tires instead of four, he and Burton, bumping each other all the
way, caught Mayfield. A lead of eight car lengths suddenly became
four, then two, then one.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said Robin Pemberton, his crew chief, began yelling to
Wallace over the radio: ``Keep digging! You're getting closer! You
can win this!'' Still, both Wallace and Burton said they would not
have passed Mayfield without the blown tire.
</P>
<P>
   How fitting that an equipment breakdown decided another long
afternoon at Pocono. Thirteen cars left the race because of some
kind of a breakdown, a Winston Cup season high by far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finished sixth by virtue of some other guys having
problems,'' said Bobby Labonte, who has a 53-point lead in the
Winston Cup drivers standing over Dale Jarrett. ``I still think we
were a little bit better, but we're still not as good as we need to
be. All in all, though, it was a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day because Earnhardt had another bad day here. He
was chasing Jarrett for the lead on the 145th lap when his
Chevrolet suddenly bobbled back and forth, almost as if he were
swerving to avoid hitting something. Then his right front tire
started to practically unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt was in second place in the points race entering
Sunday, 45 points behind Labonte and 23 points ahead of Jarrett. He
finished 25th Sunday, and will stand 54 points behind Jarrett and
107 points behind Labonte entering the next Winston Cup race, the
Brickyard 400 on Aug. 5 at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of our biggest worries, taking a big hit in the
points,'' Earnhardt said. ``We were running too good to have that
kind of a day.'' Jarrett led more laps than anyone else today and
finished fourth, but he became the victim of trying to play it
safe. He took four fresh tires on his last pit stop and fell from
the lead into 13th place. Four fresh tires are supposed to be much
better than two, but the tires performed poorly enough that Jarrett
was never able to catch the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `Why are they doing that?''' Wallace said.
``I've tried that one, and that didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   No strategy seems to be foolproof at Pocono. The drivers won't
have to work here again until next year, and they seemed to be in a
particular hurry late this afternoon to drive their cars up to
their trailers and join the postrace traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield never made it back to his trailer with his car.
</P>
<P>
   He walked briskly from his pit to his motor home in the Pocono
infield. He said along the way that he thought no one had a better
car than he did. Now he knows, from the other perspective, that the
best cars do not always win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the Pocono 499 and lost the Pocono 500,'' Mayfield
said. ``Sometimes you have good luck, and sometimes you don't.
Today, we didn't.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ A whistle-blower's manuscript that the government
suppressed on security grounds contains little new information, but
strongly criticizes the FBI as having mishandled the government's
investigation into whether China stole United States nuclear
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, FBI agents seized a computer hard drive from the
home of Notra Trulock, the former chief of intelligence at the
Energy Department, who wrote the manuscript. The FBI acted in what
officials described as a preliminary investigation to determine
whether the paper disclosed classified information about the
espionage case.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of the 62-page manuscript, obtained by The New York
Times, shows that while it is heavy on criticism of the FBI and
other agencies, it contains little information about the spy case
that has not already been disclosed in the news media or in
congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript, which Trulock had submitted to the Central
Intelligence Agency for possible publication in one of its internal
journals, presents Trulock's views of how the investigation into
China's possible theft of United States nuclear secrets unfolded.
In it, he attacks the FBI, as well as other officials from the
Energy Department and its Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bureau said last week that its investigation
had not come in reaction to the criticisms in the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA official who screened the manuscript decided that it was
an unauthorized release of classified material, and referred the
matter to the FBI for investigation. But Trulock said he had told
the FBI that he did not believe the manuscript contained classified
information and that he had not had access to classified documents
about the case since he left the Energy Department last August.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript contains many references to newspaper articles
and congressional testimony as source material.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock was a frequent critic of how the government handled the
investigation of possible nuclear espionage, asserting that the
investigation into China's possible theft of data from the W-88,
America's most advanced nuclear warhead, had not been pursued
aggressively within the government. He subsequently became the
target of criticism himself, as scientists and Asian-American
groups attacked the FBI and the Energy Department for making Wen Ho
Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos, the focus of the
counterintelligence investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial passages in his manuscript concern
whether the Energy Department and the FBI prematurely focused on
the Los Alamos laboratory, and Lee in particular, as the source of
the possible leak of nuclear information to China. Since news of
the spy case broke last year, the initial administrative inquiry by
the Energy Department and the FBI has drawn widespread criticism
within the government for having been too narrowly focused. The FBI
has reopened the investigation to take a broader look at ways in
which the nuclear data could have reached the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock defends the actions of his team of Energy Department and
FBI investigators who conducted an initial administrative inquiry
in the case, and says that problems came after they turned the case
over to the FBI for a full criminal investigation, code-named
``Kindred Spirit.'' His manuscript is called ``Kindred Spirit: The
DOE Nuclear Spy Follies.''
</P>
<P>
   The administrative inquiry was conducted by the Energy
Department, with FBI assistance, in late 1995 and early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative inquiry considered 70 leads, and eventually
narrowed the list to 12 possible suspects, including employees at
Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California, Trulock writes. Before paring the list, the Energy-FBI
team also visited Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico, which
was responsible for the nonnuclear firing components of the
warhead. His team considered the Energy Department's Rocky Flats
plant in Colorado and the Pantex nuclear complex in Texas, but
ruled them out after learning ``that there were no records of
foreign travel and no visits by Chinese officials'' at either
plant.
</P>
<P>
   While the inquiry did not focus exclusively on Los Alamos,
``within the overall complex the security vulnerabilities at Los
Alamos were striking,'' he writes. ``Los Alamos had largely
abandoned security measures intended to track individuals' access''
to classified documents. ``At Lawrence Livermore, we could review
records of individuals that had accessed W-88 documents and
blueprints, but no such records were maintained at Los Alamos.
Employment within Los Alamos' X Division, the laboratory
organization responsible for the W-88 design, apparently afforded
these employees unmonitored access to nuclear warhead design
information.''
</P>
<P>
   While his team focused on Energy Department facilities as
possible sources of the compromise, the FBI was supposed to check
other, non-Energy Department facilities as part of a broader
investigation. But he later learned that the FBI never did look
elsewhere, Trulock writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several unexplained and unexplored inconsistencies
in the FBI's handling'' of the case, Trulock writes.

SPORTS COLUMN: MELVIN MORA STILL STANDING AT SHORTSTOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the soccer corner of his heart, Melvin Mora is a 9,
the field number for an aggressive forward who scores goals. That's
what he was back in Venezuela, a soccer professional at 14.
</P>
<P>
   He was even investigating playing American soccer a few years
ago, possibly giving up baseball before it broke him.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about his best baseball position, Mora smiles and asks,
``You want the truth?'' In the baseball corner of his heart, Mora
is an 8, the defensive designation for a center fielder, which he
relishes because ``I like the control.'' His second best position,
he volunteers, is second base, a 4.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, and maybe for this entire tantalizing
season of brinksmanship, Melvin Mora is quite likely to be a 6. He
learned Sunday that he is still the Mets' interim shortstop, after
Barry Larkin terminally declined the challenge of a new team in a
pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Mora was at shortstop Sunday night against the Braves. The Mets
could do far worse. This is a man who has literally been kicked off
the team bus, a metaphor for his life in baseball, yet he brings a
gracious demeanor and an air of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   How confident? When he joined the Mets last September, he told
Cookie Rojas, the third-base coach, not to worry: ``I've been in
baseball 10 years and made the playoffs nine times.'' Soon
afterward it was 10 for 11.
</P>
<P>
   How confident? After losing the first three games of the
division series, the Mets were down a run in the eighth inning,
with Mora on first and Roger Cedeno on second. While the Braves
brought in a knucklehead left-hander named John Rocker, Mora
reminded Cedeno that Rocker was sloppy about holding runners on
base. It took two pitches for Mora to dare Cedeno into the
successful double steal that set up John Olerud's two-run single
that kept the Mets alive.
</P>
<P>
   How confident? Mora said he feels no pressure in the major
leagues, not after playing for Magallanes against Caracas in
Venezuelan winter ball, which he calls ``hora chiquita'' _ crunch
time.
</P>
<P>
   That is confidence. In Mora's first sport, you make something
from nothing, creating a goal from a broken play, a mistake, a
counterattack. In his second sport, he has been doing exactly that,
resurrecting a career, coming back from Taiwan, of all places, to
win a job, however tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a regular, surely not a star, Mora gives zest to one of
the most appealing Mets teams since Mookie Wilson and Hubie Brooks
were coming along in the early 80's.
</P>
<P>
   He has been filling in most of the time since Rey Ordonez went
down with a broken forearm. The club may have been second-guessing
committing $16 million for the next three years to a glittery
shortstop who cannot even bunt in an age of graceful brutes like
Jeter, Garciaparra and, dare one whisper the name, Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin would have been a major addition, and Mora would
have welcomed him, not having the status to pout. He gave up pro
soccer at 19, playing in the Houston system for six years without
ever getting to the varsity spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `All right, I'll go somewhere else,''' which turned
out to be Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They handed me $60,000 in cash,'' Mora recalled last evening.
``I never saw so much money in my life. But when I got there, it
was rough. They promised me an apartment, but when I got there they
put me in a room with other players. There was my bed, right next
to the bathroom. Bed. Bathroom. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora stayed six weeks, hit well, which made it dangerous for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of gambling in Taiwan,'' he said. ``They go
after the good hitters who do not strike out a lot. They say they
can kill you if you don't agree. I had to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The club held his passport, but he finally got back to Florida,
where he was courted by the Mets' assistant general manager, Jim
Duquette, after the intervention of Edgar Alfonzo, a fellow
Venezuelan. Alfonzo is a coach in the Mets' system and the brother
of the Mets' Edgardo.
</P>
<P>
   Mora had a great spring training with the Mets in 1999, and was
about to get on the bus when the team broke camp, when he was told
he was being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Valentine was honest with me,'' Mora said Sunday night.
``He told me I did everything they asked, but I had options. I
thanked them for putting me in play, but when I got back to the
hotel room, I cried. I knew people would ask Edgardo: `Hey, where's
Mora? Where's the little guy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Some players who are cut at the end of spring training sink like
a stone. Melvin Mora did not. When he came back, he was the Mets'
secret weapon, suddenly turned loose, running and hitting and
fielding several positions, just as he had in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his alliterative name, sweet smile, positive demeanor
and versatile skills, he has the makings of a folk hero in Queens.
There is no official baseball number for that. &QL;

FOUNDERING, RICHARDSON EXPECTS HIS POLITICAL STAR TO RISE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not long ago, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's
name was exactly where he wanted it to be, near the top of every
list of likely Democratic vice presidential nominees. A few even
guessed the nomination was his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Richardson, 52, had shrewdly zigzagged his career up
the Washington hierarchy, traveling from the House to the United
Nations, and then into President Clinton's cabinet. His affable
nature and diplomatic triumphs combined to score glowing headlines
and presidential accolades. It did not hurt his political standing
that he is Hispanic and fluent in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Then June rolled around, and a confluence of events _ the
Washington version of ``The Perfect Storm'' _ swallowed Richardson
whole. On the heels of a scandal possibly involving espionage, two
computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets went missing at Los
Alamos, gasoline prices skyrocketed, and Congress turned on the
former House member with a vengeance. In no time, two Republicans,
a senator and a House member, called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Richardson's name is no longer on any list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized this incident, this Los Alamos incident, has
probably reduced my chances to whatever is less than zero,''
Richardson said with a pained chuckle as he spoke publicly for the
first time about the tumble his career had taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I would have accepted it,'' he said, referring to an
offer for the vice presidential nomination. ``But I wasn't pining
for it. I believe in fate. I realize it's a decision based on a lot
of factors that I can't control. I saw my name on lists. I was
interviewed, but I never campaigned for it. Now that it's not going
to happen I can deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking slim, with his cowboy boots perched on the coffee table
in his office, Richardson appeared both frustrated at his fall and
determined to rise again, perhaps, one day, as governor or senator
of New Mexico. ``Certainly politics is in my blood,'' he said. ``I
have one more or two more good races in me.''
</P>
<P>
   But all of this could not have happened at a worse moment, just
as Vice President Al Gore began paring down the list and getting
serious about the search for his own vice president on the
Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   While no one but Gore will really know whether Richardson could
have been a strong candidate, others seem to think so. Even now,
Richardson is being mentioned by some Democratic delegates as their
choice for the job.
</P>
<P>
   But Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said that Richardson
``happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When nominees name their running mates, they are looking for a
lot of upside and no downside,'' Garin said. ``The last thing
presidential candidates want is controversy. They tend to be
controversy-phobic.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, advisers and his supporters agree that Richardson
would not have posed such a tantalizing target for Republicans had
he not been perceived as a political star, and possibly a vice
presidential candidate, with broad appeal, especially to Latinos.
And this year both parties have aggressively courted Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many in the other political party who would like to
see Bill Richardson taken off the political battlefield because
they know he can be a profoundly important political asset to
Democrats,'' said Steve Grossman, a former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic advocacy groups, who see Richardson as their most
powerful and popular political figure, are seething over the hits
he has taken from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see him as a potentially unifying vote-getter, and the
Latino vote is critical,'' said Rick Dovalina, president of the
League of United Latin American Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Others said Richardson's ambition and loyalty had put him out on
a limb. ``He took one appointment too many,'' said Sen. Richard
Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one moment that cemented his downturn, it was the
June afternoon he appeared before the Senate Armed Services
Committee to answer questions about the missing hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, Richardson had missed a hearing about the Los
Alamos problem, at the pinnacle of the controversy over security.
He said later that he thought he had no new information at that
point.
</P>
<P>
   An empty chair, a placecard with his name on the table, had made
the evening news, and some wondered whether Richardson had
developed a political tin ear.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sen. Richard Shelby, a conservative Alabama
Republican who chairs the committee, accused Richardson of failing
in his promise to tighten security. ``You've lost all
credibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sen. Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat and a
Senate elder, joined in the harangue, Secretary Richardson's
dressing-down moved from a partisan skirmish to far more dangerous
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have shown an extreme contempt'' for Congress, Byrd said.
``You've had a bright and brilliant career. But you will never
again receive the support of the Senate of the United States for
any office to which you might be appointed. It's gone. You've
squandered your treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   The two senators, Byrd and Shelby, had privately been stewing at
Richardson for more parochial reasons. They held Richardson
responsible for blocking their requests for money for pet projects
in their home states while he reviewed their appropriateness.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the attack shook him deeply.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Byrd's statement was disappointing and it was hurtful
because it was so unexpected,'' Richardson said. ``He and I had a
lot of good dealings before. What hurt me the most is that it hurt
my mother so much. She's 86 and she said after all my service, I
didn't deserve that. She starts crying every time she thinks of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is not a man who is used to being the target of such
hostility. He is a man who wields schmooze the way others leverage
power. In the House, where he represented New Mexico, Richardson
ascended to the position of deputy whip, a job that required him to
use a blend of empathy, backslapping and bullying.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the side, he launched a free-lance career as a
troubleshooter, visiting places like Iraq, Burma and North Korea to
negotiate the release of hostages and political prisoners.
Richardson, never one to turn his back on a television camera, saw
his image flourish.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton named him U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, where he injected a dose of informality; he sometimes wore
khakis and often made a point of chatting with diplomats who seldom
warranted more than a nod from Richardson's predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   When Richardson took the Department of Energy job in August
1998, some wondered whether he would fade from view as his
predecessors had.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he figured the job would help him fill some gaps
on the resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was eager,'' he said. ``I took this job and I knew it would
be a challenge. The extent of the challenge I was unaware of. I was
unaware of the security problems, as massive as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several months after Richardson took the job, the
controversy surrounding Wen Ho Lee and Los Alamos erupted. Lee was
fired from Los Alamos in March 1999. After his dismissal,
investigators discovered he had downloaded vast amounts of secret
nuclear data from the classified computer network and copied it
onto portable tapes, some of which are now missing.
</P>
<P>
   Since Richardson had recently started the job, he was not blamed
by Congress for the security lapses; members recognized that
problems had existed for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   But in his eagerness to assuage Congress and promote his
abilities, he made a mistake he has come to regret: he oversold
what he could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``My conscience is very clear that I've done everything I can on
security,'' Richardson said. ``What I regret is making that
statement that our nuclear secrets are safe and secure, without
recognizing that you also have to deal with a human element.
Changing a culture towards more recognition of security was a task
I didn't anticipate would be as difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson learned, he said, was: ``Don't make absolute
statements, which is not my nature. I like to take positions. I
hate to be a bureaucrat with four hands: on the one hand, on the
other hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress also wanted Richardson to create a semiautonomous
agency to oversee nuclear weapons. But Richardson initially
resisted on the theory that another fief would not help an agency
that was already too splintered. It was another squabble that
raised the ire of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said the agency, which has been approved,
would have given him cover for the missing hard drives. ``He should
have taken the advice and run with it,'' said Sen. Frank H.
Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Natural
Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When oil prices shot up, something Richardson has scant control
over, Republicans launched a fresh round of attacks. Few
congressional Democrats were going out of their way to defend him.
Word soon circulated that he had said the administration had been
caught napping on gas prices. In fact, Richardson said, his comment
related only to the unexpected transportation breakdowns in the
Northeast that had led to high heating-oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richardson cranked up pressure on OPEC to produce more
oil. For now, the crisis has abated, but there are new concerns
about natural gas reserves. He is now focusing his energies on
gasoline prices and the Los Alamos problems. Much of what has
transpired on his watch, he said, has roots in past
administrations. He said he believed that his record, and the
changes he has instituted, would buoy him in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be the fall guy for some of this,'' he said. ``It
got politicized. I think there are some who used it for partisan
reasons on the Hill. But that's politics. I understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians, analysts and observers count Richardson out of
politics altogether, calling the last few months a blip in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a couple of bruises, but I think he will come through
this,'' said John Podesta, Clinton's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   For the king of schmooze, staying quiet in an election year,
even for a short while, is no easy task. But he is already looking
ahead to a new administration, a new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that this Los Alamos incident is not a plus,'' he
said. ``I'm not trying to minimize the negative effect this has had
in the short term. But in the long term, I'm going to be a factor
in politics.''

AFTER REJECTION BY LARKIN, METS STILL SEEKING SHORTSTOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The courtship of Barry Larkin lasted 12 hours. There
was no recruiting trip to Cincinnati, no bonus given and no top
prospect sacrificed to bring the Reds' all-star shortstop to the
Mets. Larkin vetoed a proposed trade to the Mets, who have a week
to go before the non-waiver trading deadline and have added no
players through a trade this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had offered to deal their best prospect, the Class AA
outfielder Alex Escobar, plus the Class AAA reliever Eric Cammack
and the Class A starting pitcher Jason Saenz, according to a
baseball official.
</P>
<P>
   But they were unwilling to give Larkin a three-year contract
extension, offering instead a bonus to be paid if the Mets did not
re-sign him within 10 days of the end of the World Series. The
bonus _ which one official said was worth $1 million _ and the
chance to help the Mets in the pennant race were not enough to
entice the 36-year-old Larkin to leave the Reds; he is a Cincinnati
native who has played with the team since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, but we've got to just move forward,''
Steve Phillips, the Mets general manager, said. ``We've got some
other exciting things we're talking about that we'll just have to
go after.''
</P>
<P>
   They went after Larkin aggressively, offering to fly a
contingent of Mets to Cincinnati between Saturday's afternoon game
and Sunday's night game in Atlanta. Phillips received permission to
talk to Larkin and his agent, Eric Goldschmidt, at 10 a.m.
Saturday, but a little after 10 p.m., Goldschmidt told Phillips
that without a new contract, Larkin was declining the deal.
</P>
<P>
   To Phillips, Larkin had little to lose by accepting the trade.
Phillips said he thought Larkin could only strengthen his position
for his pending free agency by helping to lift a New York team to
the postseason. But despite making no progress toward a contract
extension with the Reds, Larkin said he was uncomfortable being a
hired gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy simply because it's been emotional,'' Larkin
told reporters Sunday morning. ``The reality of the Reds trying to
trade me is not easy. Still, the reality is that I won't be here
next year. New York is a place I'd like to spend some time and a
place where my family would be comfortable, but under the right
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips did not rule out another pursuit of Larkin during the
off-season. But it has never been more clear that the Mets intend
to pursue Alex Rodriguez, the Seattle shortstop who will also be a
free agent. Asked if his unwillingness to give Larkin an extension
was because he has Rey Ordonez signed for three more years or
because of his plans during the off-season, Phillips said both
played a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an appealing free-agent class this year, and it's one
that, to make all of the decisions today about what the future will
look like really wasn't something we wanted to do,'' Phillips said.
``We hoped there was a way that we could balance that with him to
make it worth his while to come here for the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he had no regrets about making the trade, despite
Larkin's refusal. Phillips said Jim Bowden, the Reds general
manager, told him that Larkin would accept a deal to the Mets
because Larkin was tired of the negativity in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said: ``The only reason I thought it was possible he
might accept it is, when I talked to Barry on July 8, he said if
the Reds don't sign him, `Just trade me so I don't have to go
through all this negativity for the rest of the year.' At no time
did he say, `Trade me, but the team that gets me has to give me
three years and $30 million.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he was hopeful that the Reds and Larkin could resume
contract negotiations. He said the Mets' deal was the only trade he
will make for Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   As for Phillips, he was not especially relieved to have held on
to the players in the trade package. ``It was a good deal for the
club, so I'm not relieved by it,'' Phillips said. ``It may open
some doors. The door closes in one place and it might open up in
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has always been willing to trade prospects; that was
how he acquired Mike Piazza, Al Leiter, Kenny Rogers and others. In
New York, he said, the goal is always to win now.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets may still trade Escobar, the 21-year-old native of
Venezuela who is considered among baseball's best prospects for his
combination of speed and power. Other teams also covet the minor
league pitchers Grant Roberts and Pat Strange and outfielder Brian
Cole.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles are willing to deal their shortstop, Mike
Bordick, and Ordonez has been mentioned in trade talks. But Ordonez
is owed $16 million over the next three years, which could be a
problem for the Orioles, who seem to prefer the idea of re-signing
Bordick this winter even if he is traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Phillies would consider trading their No. 1

   AGHJABEDI, Azerbaijan _ For the past eight years, through
relentless seasons, Ali Orudjev and his family have lived in a hole
in the ground. He and his wife, Samsiya, have watched helplessly as
two of their infants died because they could not afford medicine,
and they fear desperately for their surviving children, a tiny
5-year-old girl and a 1-year-old boy who rarely smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel ashamed because I can do nothing for my family and make
no money,'' said Orudjev, a trained veterinarian who was among
hundreds of thousands of his countrymen who fled the invasion by
neighboring Armenia into Azerbaijan's mountainous enclave of
Nagorno Karabakh in 1992. ``I'm afraid for the future of my kids. I
don't want them to grow up in a dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred refugees live here on treeless, desolate land in
south-central Azerbaijan. Their homes are, essentially, graves for
the living: pits carved by hand from the parched earth, 15 feet or
so wide, 20 feet long, 5 or 6 feet deep, covered with mud-caked
thatch and outfitted with a solitary wood platform for sleeping and
small windows for ventilation. They are neither cool in summer nor
warm in winter. Meant to be temporary, the holes have become
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The Orudjevs are among the poorest of the poor, banished to the
bottom of a population of 1 million refugees scattered throughout
40 or more camps in this former Soviet republic where promised oil
riches have yet to materialize and per capita income is less than
$2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the fighting stopped, the refugees remain victims of
a little-noticed war, insufficiently cared for by their government
and on the verge of abandonment by international aid organizations.
They live without running water, electricity or medical care in
railroad cars, tents, temporary prefabricated houses and holes in
the ground, surviving on a few dollars a month, on handouts and
heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Sipping strong tea at a roadside cafe after touring refugee
camps, Gesche Karrenbrock, an official from the Geneva headquarters
of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, explained with
professional detachment that the situation is Azerbaijan is
complicated by several factors.
</P>
<P>
   People's lives have been disrupted for so long that many have
lost the power to help themselves, she said. Job training for young
people has provided a glimmer of hope, so the United Nations and
other aid groups are shifting emphasis from food and shelter to
programs that encourage self-sufficiency. One result, Karrenbrock
said, is that the meager food for refugees will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be people left over after our efforts,'' she
said. ``Here, 200,000 may be beyond our reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Her agency's budget for the country is being reduced from $12
million last year to $4.7 million. Many private organizations have
also cut back or pulled out after eight years of little progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Azeri government, which has reached a ceasefire with Armenia
but no peace agreement that would allow at least some refugees to
return home, has not taken up the slack. Some Western diplomats and
humanitarian workers said the camps are political pawns in the
government's effort to negotiate the return of the 20 percent of
the country now occupied by ethnic Armenians. They also said some
aid is siphoned off through corruption. But even the
best-intentioned government would find an enormous burden when one
out of every eight of its citizens lives in refugee camps _ among
the highest ratios anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government raised financial assistance to the
refugees to about $5 a month each from $1.50, even the president,
Heydar Aliyev, acknowledged that their plight remains abysmal. ``It
is a horrible thing that hurts my heart,'' Aliyev said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The people were displaced in 1992 and 1993 when the war that had
erupted in 1988 between Azerbaijan and Armenia over
Nagorno-Karabakh _ a predominantly Armenian-populated enclave in
Azerbaijan _ turned decisively in Armenia's favor. After four years
of indecisive conflict and pogroms that drove ethnic Armenians from
Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, Armenian troops swept into the
mountainous, 1,700-square-mile region, emptying villages and
collective farms and driving out Azeris.
</P>
<P>
   A shaky cease-fire was established in 1994, but sporadic
negotiations have failed to end one of the most intractable
conflicts that emerged as Communism, which had squelched ethnic and
religious differences across the Soviet empire, simply collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   These refugees insist _ as do refugees almost everywhere _ that
they will never abandon hope of returning home. But a bleak
permanence has settled over their blighted lives.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On the far edge of the camp near Aghjabedi, the first people
were buried in 1994, after residents accepted that they would be
living and dying in holes in the ground far longer than they once
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Agil Dunemaliyev, 13, was silent as he gently lifted the latch
on the wire gate. Some of the 250 graves within were marked by
impressive headstones, etched with the faces of the dead and
purchased at mind-boggling sacrifice by grieving families. Others
bore only a small brick of mud and straw, and one mounded grave was
covered by a hand-made carpet, its nomadic design faded by time and
sun. Somewhere here were the graves of Ali and Samsiya Orudjev's
infants, Elvin and Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
   The camp's romantic name, Lachin Winterland, belies the living
conditions. For centuries, the seminomadic cattle breeders who
lived in the Lachin region of Nagorno-Karabakh, 100 miles away,
brought their herds here to graze in winter. When their villages
were emptied by the war in 1992, some 20,000 people came here,
where the land cannot support cattle or people year round.
</P>
<P>
   Salatin Novruzova, who looks far older than her 39 years, boiled
potatoes over a fire of dried cow manure outside the dugout where
her family of seven lives. The heat in summer and the cold in
winter, the snakes and lizards that crawl in, the mile walk for
drinking water, the absence of irrigation water _ she described it
all without emotion. Only when asked why the family stays did she
raise her head from the pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray to Allah to just lift us and move us back to the other
place,'' she said. ``People are staying because they can't move
because they don't have money. The little we get must be spent for
food. We have nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the dirt steps leading down into his home, Orudjev
told much the same story. Though he is trained as a veterinarian,
there are no jobs for him in a country where university professors
drive taxis and physicists work as waiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are healthy enough and we are strong enough to work, but
there is no work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he and his wife live with their remaining children in a place
with dirt walls, a dirt floor and a dirt roof. They share the hole
with their small flock of chickens. The latrine is 100 yards away,
drinkable water at least half a mile distant.
</P>
<P>
   To get the government-allotted food money each month, Orudjev
walks two miles to a paved road and hails a taxi to take him into
Aghjabedi, another five miles away. Sometimes the money is
inexplicably unavailable, so he must sign a note promising to pay
the taxi later. Even when he gets the money, he said, it is always
less than the allotted 20,000 manat. ``Local officials reach in,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his neighbors are more fortunate. The U.N. refugee
agency, with $2.25 million from Eni, an Italian energy company, is
building 400 limestone houses in three regions of Azerbaijan,
including Aghjabedi. They are rare bright spots on a dark
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   No houses are being built at the three camps where about 3,000
people live in abandoned railroad cars, which are scorching hot in
summer and freezing cold in winter.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the rail camps, near the town of Saatli about two
hours' drive from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, 100 rusting boxcars
sit on two parallel rail sidings. For seven years, the cars have
been home to 400 people from the farm village of Boyuk Marjanli in
the occupied territory. It is the smallest of the train camps and
it has no name, but the residents have fostered a semblance of
community.
</P>
<P>
   Old blankets strung between cars provide shade and a place to
sit and chat. A few enterprising residents have planted vegetables
in pots, but they are not thriving. About 40 men and women have
been married here over the last eight years; twice as many have
died.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, the men huddled in small groups under shade
trees a few hundred yards away, jobless and persistently idle. The
women tended the children and many people still lay under cars,
where they had slept to escape the heat.
</P>
<P>
   One stone-faced old woman kneaded bread, oblivious to the swarm
of flies around her. Another washed clothes in a blue plastic
bucket. An elderly man hobbled off to fetch water from a communal
spigot on the other side of the rail yard.
</P>
<P>
   For children younger than 7, a boxcar is the only home they have
known _ they attend school in four cars, play hide-and-seek beneath
them, live within them. Inside, the cars are neat and clean, with
sheets to partition the interiors and burlap bags suspended from
the ceilings to hide the metal.
</P>
<P>
   Nasiba Gakhramanova, 24, was married in the camp. She has had
two babies in it and watched her husband leave when he was drafted
into the army. Still, she wants nothing of permanence. What she
savors are memories of Boyuk Marjanli. What she wants is to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the land, good fertile land, that we are missing,'' she
said as her 14-month-old son played in a discarded tractor tire.
``We can't plant anything here. There is no land here that is not
hard and dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, mostly single men, have left in search of work in
Baku and other places. Everyone knows their prospects are poor and
that many are now living in squalid, abandoned buildings in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   More important, explained a knot of women simultaneously, the
ones who leave will lose out on that great day when the aging
boxcars are hitched to a locomotive and trundled back to the green
pastures of Boyuk Marjanli.
</P>
<P>
   Even the few thousand people who have returned to villages
overrun at the start of the fighting and retaken by Azeri troops
have found hope to be a scarce commodity. Homes, shops and
factories were shattered by mortars and fire. The United Nations
and other relief agencies are rebuilding houses, but progress is
slow and spotty.
</P>
<P>
   In one settlement a few miles from the buffer zone between
Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, a father pointed out live mortar
rounds on land where children like to play. In the village of
Akhmedalilar, a factory where 2,000 people once assembled heavy
machinery is a skeleton of brick and steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough for normal life,'' said Khanish
Allahverdiyev, 76, vowing in the same breath never to leave again.

SPORTS COLUMN: WANTED _ BETTER LUCK, AND BETTER PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTANDER, Spain _ John McEnroe believed that he had inherited a
sure thing, ``two of the best players that ever lived,'' for his
first go-round as the U.S. Davis Cup captain. He finished the year
here Sunday with, for all intents and purposes, an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   He can't open his wallet, like George Steinbrenner, and buy
himself a champion. There is no salary cap to finagle. Being the
big market team, or the global superpower, doesn't help when your
most potent weapons disarm themselves. If Pete Sampras and Andre
Agassi couldn't be counted on for McEnroe's debut season, there is
no reason to expect them to join him under stressful scheduling
conditions next time around.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, eight of the potential World Group opponents would
have home-soil advantage against the United States, and two others
are yet to be determined by coin flip. Good luck, getting Sampras
to Moscow, Agassi to Prague.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, what we saw here this weekend, a 5-0 semifinal
Spanish breeze for a date in December's final against Australia, is
what we've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I tell you?'' McEnroe said, after Spain swept the
meaningless reverse singles, with Juan Balcells rallying to defeat
Jan-Michael Gambill 1-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4, after Juan Carlos Ferrero
outlasted Vince Spadea, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. ``That's Davis Cup right
now. Andre wasn't here. Pete's not here. Chang doesn't want to
play. Courier retired. I'm totally spent. I'm not sure if it's
emotional or not, but I'm about to heave.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most tennis rides McEnroe has taken, Davis Cup 2000 was a
roller coaster, until it derailed and crashed in this coastal
resort city. He came into the job with a well-deserved reputation
for volatility, so, of course, his every word and move were
scrutinized, sometimes to absurdity, as when newspapers here
belabored his accidentally knocking a camera from a child's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well-behaved'' is not generally a description that fits
McEnroe, but he did avoid international incident, created no scenes
here with linesmen or umpires and made a point of congratulating
the Spanish players after every depressing match. Yet McEnroe, who
has seldom raised an issue and then conceded it had two sides, also
came to grips with an important lesson these past six months that
coaches and captains must inevitably learn.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously one of the reasons I was hired was so I would make a
difference in getting players to play,'' he said last week. ``I
clearly haven't succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, at least for this year, McEnroe was no
more empowered, or effective, than were his predecessors. He was
certainly edgier and more interesting than Tom Gullikson. His
celebrity and personality raised the team's visibility. But even
his canny knack for the well-timed sound bite may work against him.
</P>
<P>
   He straddles a dangerous line, balancing roles as a
well-received commentator and Davis Cup captain. On television,
among other places, McEnroe feels compelled to speak his mind. If
Todd Martin chokes at Wimbledon, it's McEnroe's job to say it. If
there are questions about the extent of Sampras' injury, it's
McEnroe's job to ask them.
</P>
<P>
   Subtlety, unfortunately, has never been his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sampras loses, he's hurt. When he wins, you stink,''
McEnroe wrote in his London newspaper column earlier this month. At
the same time, he was still campaigning, hoping, for Sampras to
join him here.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, not surprisingly, won Wimbledon and went home. Agassi,
not wanting to risk his U.S. Open chances, phoned in the report of
a fender bender from Las Vegas. McEnroe brought the junior varsity
and the United States was swept for the eighth time in its
distinguished Davis Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait and see next year,'' said McEnroe, who has
an out on his three-year contract but is insisting that he will not
overreact. ``I'd like to think it's bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The luck of the draw is one thing, the arbitrary nature of the
Davis Cup. McEnroe's real problem is bad timing. He has become
captain when there are no rising American stars, no highly ranked
players in their early 20s, before they become too big, too
independent to blow him off.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Woodruff, who won the fifth match that saved McEnroe from
a first-round embarrassment in Harare, Zimbabwe, last February, is
27. Spadea is 26, another journeyman. The 23-year-old Gambill, the
Wimbledon quarterfinalist, was being touted as the future, until he
coughed up the fifth match, to Balcells, the match ending in a
swirling rain and under a rumbling sky.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe could always be counted on to bring thunder to tennis
but his team succumbed meekly and he left quietly, skipping a news
conference (a fine is possible) and telephoning news of his bout
with nausea on the ride to the airport in Bilbao.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Chicago for another seniors' event, it's difficult to
know where McEnroe goes from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been disappointing, no question,'' he said earlier. ``But
you let it sink in, dwell on the positive, the wins instead of the
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line translation: He'll always have Harare.

40 PERCENT IN NEW YORK CITY ARE FOREIGN-BORN, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A human tidal wave has added 1 million immigrants to
New York City in the last decade, propelling foreign-born residents
to 40 percent of the population, an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau
figures shows.
</P>
<P>
   That level of immigration has not been equaled for nearly a
century. As recently as 1990, the figure for foreign-born residents
was 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures come not from the 2000 census, whose results
will not be known till next year. Instead, they are derived from
the recently released results of a 15,417-household survey taken in
1999 by the Census Bureau. That study is done every three years to
see if housing vacancies are below 5 percent, the legal threshold
for continuing rent regulation. Because the sample is large and the
bureau conducts the survey, the data are considered highly
reliable. They jibe with the census, which is undertaken every 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a preview of the full census,'' said Dr. Andrew A.
Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College who analyzes census
data.
</P>
<P>
   Although the surge has been evident for years, its sheer size is
stunning. ``Boy, that is some number _ wow, wow!'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, co-author of ``Beyond the Melting Pot,'' a 1963
treatise on race and ethnicity in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enriching experience for us,'' Moynihan said. ``It's
wonderful _ I mean, we have to think of it that way. If we think of
it any other way, it won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Without immigration, for example, New York's overall population
would be shrinking. Instead, the stream of people from around the
world is offsetting the loss of city residents to death and
relocation to the suburbs and other regions. The result has been a
modest net gain of about 130,000 since 1990, to an estimated total
of 7.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent immigration, we would be seeing a very different New
York, with neighborhood abandonment and depopulation,'' said Dr.
Philip Kasinitz, a sociology professor at Hunter College. Dr.
William H. Frey, a demographer at the State University of New York
at Albany, said, ``These groups are revitalizing and re-energizing
these neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar flows from abroad are bolstering the population of other
major cities across the nation, although New York has had the
largest influx. A big difference, however, is that other places
have ethnically concentrated immigration, such as the Cubans in
Miami, while the new New Yorkers are extraordinarily diverse by
race and nationality. ``This is a region that is going to continue
to be very different from any other areas of the country,'' said
Frey.
</P>
<P>
   City Planning Commission officials declined to be interviewed
about the findings. An agency spokeswoman, Jennifer Chait, voiced
caution. ``These projections are based on data that is incomplete
and inadequate for drawing significant conclusions,'' she said.
``Our expectations are that the definitive Census 2000 data will
show a substantial increase in New York City foreign-born
population but not to as nearly as high as 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beveridge said his figures were actually conservative. The
Census Bureau sample showed that 44 percent of heads of households
were foreign born. Estimating the figure for the entire city, he
reduced the percentage to adjust for factors like children of
immigrants being born here. The margin of error is 0.8 percent, he
said. He also noted that the planning agency itself had estimated
immigration at around 100,000 a year, which in 10 years adds up to
1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Further, official statistics undercount immigrants who decline
to respond because of language barriers, wariness of the government
or concern about the legality of their immigration, jobs or
housing. Immigration data also exclude native Puerto Ricans, who
are U.S. citizens, though it can be argued that by language,
culture and geography, they have much in common with immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Beveridge's findings were backed by two other experts. Dr. John
Mollenkopf, director of the Urban Research Center at the City
University of New York's Graduate Center, said: ``That's consistent
with what other sources, like the current population survey, are
showing,'' referring to yet another Census Bureau sampling. His
work on that survey indicates 54 percent of children through the
age of 18 are either foreign born or have foreign-born parents.
``Well over half the kids are not native stock,'' he said. And Dr.
Aristide R. Zolberg of New School University's International Center
for Migration, Ethnicity and Citizenship said he used a 40 percent
estimate for the immigrant population.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1910 has New York's percentage of foreign-born
residents been so high. That era of immigration, through the halls
of Ellis Island, transformed the city and sparked debates over the
role of newcomers that still echo today. To house the last wave, a
staggering 600,000 dwellings were built in the 1920s. Radicalized
newcomers enlivened local politics. And sweatshop exploitation of
immigrants, spotlighted by the fatal fire at the Triangle
Shirtwaist factory in 1911, galvanized the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   The latest tide continues unabated into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the current wave was accelerated by the enticing
economic boom and New York's refurbished image as a safer, cleaner
city. And there is the age-old tradition of new arrivals following
the footsteps of friends and relatives to ethnic enclaves
throughout the five boroughs.

   Immigration is as old as the city itself. Back in 1643, when New
York was called New Amsterdam, the 500 residents spoke 18
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Major ethnic shifts within the current immigration are changing
the city's makeup. Beveridge's estimates show that New Yorkers born
in the former Soviet Union, who numbered 81,000 in 1990, had nearly
tripled to 229,000 by 1999. Other fast-growing groups include
Mexicans, who nearly quadrupled to 133,000 in 1999 from 35,000 in
1990, and South Asians from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, who
more than doubled to 146,000 in 1999 from 67,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to climb as a major Hispanic group, Dominicans rose
more than two-thirds, to 387,000 in 1999 from 230,000 in 1990.
(Puerto Ricans born on the island dropped 21 percent to 290,000 in
1999 from 367,000 in 1990. Adding those born on the mainland,
Puerto Ricans here totaled 744,000 last year, an 11 percent drop
from 834,000 in 1990.)
</P>
<P>
   The statistics confirm the changing face of the city witnessed
on the streets every day by native New Yorkers, themselves
descended from earlier immigrants. Mexican shops are sprouting in
western Queens, Middle Eastern businesses now compete with the
Greek establishments of Astoria and very little of Italy is left in
Little Italy, where Chinese-Americans are the absolute majority and
Hispanics have been jostling for second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gateway to America,'' says the welcoming sign at Kennedy
International Airport in Queens. So many newcomers have stepped off
and made their home in that borough that its 167 nationalities and
116 languages make it the nation's most diverse county.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, said: ``I'm
continually looking for school seats and sites to build, because we
are minus 30,000 seats and growing 10 percent a year. The other
thing is there really isn't enough affordable housing, which has
led to a lot of illegal conversions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts call for a strategic plan for dealing with
immigration. ``We need to get out in front and plan and strive to
do better,'' said Michael H. Schill, a professor at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has often voiced support for immigrants.
His press office did not return calls seeking comment from him and
from the immigrant affairs office on the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration has produced tensions. The visiting baseball pitcher
John Rocker made his distaste well known. One man paid for
anti-immigration billboards, and City Councilwoman Julia Harrison
objected to Chinese and Korean business signs without English
translations.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say that immigrants are a plus for the city. While
many may be dependent when they arrive, Schill said, ``that rapidly
changes as they move up the ladder and contribute more in taxes
than they consume.'' He added, ``Immigrants tend to be very
resourceful, or they wouldn't be here in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Shulman agreed: ``They're all wonderful. For the most part
they're all working; our unemployment is under 5 percent. I go to a
lot of graduations, and they're winning a lot of valedictorians and
salutatorians and walking away with lots of good scholarships. The
vitality, the energy, the chemistry from people all over the world
is what makes New York City unique and makes New York City great.''
She named another benefit to Queens: ``Hey, listen, we have the
best restaurants in the city.''

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM TO PAY $50 BILLION FOR U.S. CELLULAR
COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash.)  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite political opposition in Washington, Germany's largest
telephone company, Deutsche Telekom, agreed Sunday night to acquire
an upstart U.S. cellular communications company, the VoiceStream
Wireless Corp., for $50.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if completed, would be the first acquisition of a
telecommunications company in the United States by a corporation in
which a foreign government holds a controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year old and still not profitable, VoiceStream, with 2.7
million subscribers, is the nation's eighth-largest wireless
company _ far smaller than the leader, Verizon Wireless, which has
25.9 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But VoiceStream's rapid growth and the geographic scope of its
network, with the potential to reach 70 percent of the U.S.
population, make it attractive to Deutsche Telekom, whose chairman,
Ron Sommer, has long sought a foothold in U.S. telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for both companies were still meeting with their
bankers and lawyers Sunday night and were not available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But people involved in the deal said Deutsche Telekom had agreed
to pay the equivalent of $195 a share _ more than double the
stock's price only two months ago. The shares, whose price has
risen in recent weeks on speculation of a takeover, closed Friday
at $149.75.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the deal is blocked by political opposition or falls
apart for other reasons, Deutsche Telekom has promised to make a $5
billion investment in VoiceStream. That investment is meant to
enable VoiceStream to aggressively bid in the auctions the Federal
Communications Commission plans to hold in September for licenses
for a new generation of mobile telephones.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger does not go through, the $5 billion would still
give Deutsche Telekom a 10 percent stake in VoiceStream, which is
based in Bellevue, Wash., and was founded by a longtime cellular
industry executive, John W. Stanton, who is the company's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger is far from a certainty. In recent weeks
lawmakers in both the Senate and House, anticipating a move by
Deutsche Telekom, introduced legislation intending to prevent the
German company from acquiring an U.S. telephone company. And last
week the chairman of the FCC, citing those concerns, said any
telecommunications deal involving a foreign government-owned
company would face heavy scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutsche Telekom-VoiceStream deal would bring the German
government's stake to less than a majority share _ to 45 percent,
compared with the current 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional opponents, who include the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., and his Democratic counterpart, Sen.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, seek to bar any transfer of wireless
licenses to any company in which a foreign government owns more
than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly members who will want to look at this
issue,'' a member of Daschle's staff, Ranit Schmelzer, said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Reed E. Hundt, a former FCC chairman who is now a consultant in
Washington with McKinsey &AMP; Co., predicted the deal would eventually
be completed _ but not unless the German government reduced its
stake in Deutsche Telekom to 25 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress and the FCC have always thought that 20 to 25 percent
was the maximum ownership,'' Hundt said. ``Beyond that level, it
didn't constitute control. But it did constitute a risk of undue
influence. No one's going to change that attitude about the
percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   If the deal was approved by regulators, a process that can take
more than a year even without congressional opposition, Deutsche
Telekom would finally realize its ambition to own a telephone
network in the United States, the world's largest
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   The price would also be the richest ever a wireless telephone
company, calculated on a per-subscriber basis of about $20,000. The
previous most expensive wireless deal by that measure was the
$8,000 per customer that France Telecom recently agreed to in a
deal to buy Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest wireless operator
for $37.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom argues that the price is not exorbitant given
the potential of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price they're paying is expensive but it's hard to put a
price on the national exposure they get with the company,'' said
Eric Melloul, a telecommunications analyst at Argus Research.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom has agreed to pay Voicestream 3.2 of its own
shares and $30 in cash for every Voicestream share. As a result of
the deal, Voicestream will control about 22 percent of Deutsche
Telekom. Deutsche Telekom will also assume about $5 billion in debt
from VoiceStream. VoiceStream's management team will stay on and
Stanton, the chief executive, will assume a seat on Deutsche
Telekom's management board. VoiceStream will eventually be rolled
into T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom's wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   If VoiceStream decides at any point to walk away from the deal,
it will have to pay Deutsche Telekom about a $1 billion break-up
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Just how did a company not many people have heard of become a
prize worth more than $50 billion to the world's second-largest
telephone company?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason has to do with VoiceStream's potential,
analysts said. Not only has it assembled a nearly nationwide
network, but it is one of the few U.S. wireless companies not
already part of a larger corporation. VoiceStream's relatively
short history began in 1995. It was then that Stanton, a former
executive at McCaw Cellular, began acquiring digital wireless
licenses for his company, Western Wireless, which he created after
Craig McCaw sold McCaw Cellular to AT&AMP;T. In May of 1999 Stanton
formed VoiceStream as a spinoff from Western Wireless focusing on
digital wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream then grew through acquisitions, buying the OmniPoint
Corp. of Bethesda, Md., for $2 billion, and Aerial Communications
of Chicago, for $3 billion. Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong and
Finland's Sonera quickly took notice, acquiring minority stakes in
VoiceStream.
</P>
<P>
   For Deutsche Telekom, the deal with Voicestream comes after
several botched attempts to expand beyond its borders. Most
recently, talks collapsed between Deutsche Telekom and Qwest
Communications International, the Denver-based telephone company.
Deutsche Telekom also failed to acquire Telecom Italia in a very
public and protracted bidding war with Olivetti last year.
</P>
<P>
   And last fall the German company was outbid by Worldcom in an
attempt to acquire the U.S. long-distance and wireless company
Sprint. The Worldcom-Sprint merger was called off in the face of
antitrust opposition in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   VoiceStream was particularly attractive to Deutsche Telekom
because it was one of the few U.S. wireless companies that
transmits using a format known as GSM _ short for globalsystem for
mobile communications.
</P>
<P>
   GSM is the a more common standard in Europe and Asia, meaning
overseas customers who traveled in the United States would have an
easier timecommunicating with a GSM phone than with phones using
standards like CDMA, for code division multiple access, or TDMA,
for time division multiple &QL; 
access, which are more common in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because GSM operates on different frequencies in the
United States and Europe, small adjustments need to be made in
networks so mobile phones can operate in an uninterrupted,
seamlessway.
</P>
<P>
   But differences in all the various standards are expected to
become less significant, as future generations of wireless networks
around the world are based on more compatible technologies.
</P>
<P>
   For Deutsche Telekom and VoiceStream, the bigger obstacle could
be political. But the companies can expect support for their deal
from the European Union. The union has countered the congressional
opposition to Deutsche Telekom, arguing that the U.S. government
would be in violation of its World Trade Organization commitment to
open and competitive markets if it decided to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional opponents draw a distinction between
foreign companies and companies in which foreign governments hold a
large stake.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., who is the chairman of
the Communication Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee,
and Sen. Ernest Hollings, the ranking Democratic member, who is the
chief sponsor of the legislation to block Deutsche Telekom, sent a
``Dear Colleague'' letter to their fellow Senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to state clearly that we are not opposed to private
foreign investment in the United States telecommunications
industry,'' said the letter, which did not mention VoiceStream by
name, but did mention Deutsche Telekom. ``Clearly, we did not
deregulate U.S. telecommunciations to permit the regulated foreign
government-owned telecommunications companies to take over the U.S.
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Such investments can reduce free competition, the letter said,
because government-owned companies ``can raise staggering amounts
of capital and the financial markets assume that their governments
will not allow them to fail.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE PRESENCE OF ROSE AT THE HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ It was a sticky day at the Baseball Hall of
Fame induction ceremonies here Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't just
the sultry weather. These events are annually filled with sweet
platitudes, generous and warm reminiscences and appreciative,
sometimes choked-up emotions regarding mom, apple pie and the high,
hard one. This year, there was something else: A possible walkout
protest by some of the Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   To be honored this year on the stage at one end of a large field
at Clark Sports Center in this lovely village were not only some
wonderful participants on the baseball diamond over the years _ the
slugger Tony Perez, the catcher Pudge Fisk, the manager Sparky
Anderson, the late Negro League center fielder Turkey Stearns and
the 19th-century second baseman Bid McPhee _ but also the
Cincinnati Reds play-by-play announcer, Marty Brennaman.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bob Feller, the former Cleveland pitching ace, word
had spread on Saturday that Brennaman, a supporter of Pete Rose for
the Hall of Fame, was going to use his acceptance speech for the
Ford C. Frick Award for the broadcasters' wing of the Hall of Fame,
to promote Rose's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does,'' Feller said, ``a bunch of us will walk out. It's
all arranged.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five members of the Hall of the Fame, a record turnout for
this event, were seated on the stage behind the podium. Rose's
banishment from baseball in 1989 for betting on games while a
manager of the Reds has caused a continuing consternation, not only
in baseball circles but beyond, as well. The fact that Rose is the
all-time hits leader in major-league baseball would certainly have
elevated him into the Hall of Fame by now. But he was taken off the
eligibility list by Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti and never put
back on.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Brennaman thanked those who were important in
his life, including members of the Reds, such as Johnny Bench and
Joe Morgan and Perez, who sat behind him, and those from the
1975-76 ``Big Red Machine'' ``who should be here _ Bob Howsam, the
general manager; Dave Concepcion, the shortstop, and yes, by God,
Peter Edward Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all. And a number of the Hall of Famers who would have
walked _ Feller, Frank Robinson and Ralph Kiner, among them _ sat.
</P>
<P>
   They sat while Sparky Anderson mentioned Rose among the great
players he managed, and they sat while Perez, said that ``among the
classy individuals I played with or against'' that he ``wished were
here'' was Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't chew on it,'' said Feller later, about Brennaman's
remarks. ``Otherwise we certainly would have walked out. Pete Rose
had his chance to make it here, and he blew it. We would have come
back for the speeches of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiner said that yes, he would have walked out, as well. ``From
what I understand,'' Kiner said, ``Rose was caught gambling on
baseball. If he didn't, he could have proved his innocence. This is
not a personal thing. It's about the rules of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morgan, a longtime friend and teammate of Rose's, is opposed
to Rose being in the Hall of Fame as long as the gambling charge
hangs over his head. ``But I wouldn't have walked out,'' he said.
``This day should not be about Pete Rose. It's about respect for
the Hall of Fame. I thought it would have been disrespectful to
Tony and Sparky and Pudge if we had walked out. This is their day,
and they earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Carlton Ernest Fisk, now a well-knit 53, had a wholly
remarkable, if not singular, career. The 11-time all-star caught
more games than anyone in major-league history _ 2,226 _ in a
career that began with the Red Sox in 1972, and ended 24 years
later with the White Sox. He not only hit a record 351 homers as a
catcher, but hit 72 of them after the age of 40, another record.
``I went 0 for 13 in my first time in the big leagues,'' Fisk said,
``and I was the No. 3 catcher. At the end of that season I was the
first unanimous choice for rookie of the year in the American
League.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about how he had five knee operations, and had his
left knee reconstructed after a collision at home plate in
Cleveland in 1974. ``Today, I can't squat anymore,'' he said. ``The
good thing is, I don't have to, except to read a putt, and then I
bend from the waist.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Fisk give credit to family and baseball instructors
and teammates, but, unusual for players who forget the struggle
against the owners, thanked Marvin Miller and Don Fehr, the former
and current executive directors of the Major League Players
Association. And he mentioned new baseball terms, like
``collusion,'' in which owners held down salaries _ one of those
owners being Bud Selig, then of the Milwaukee Brewers, and now
commissioner of baseball. At these remarks, Selig, seated nearby,
found the program in his hands particularly absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a Cuban by birth and a Puerto Rican by adopted country,
thanked people in English and in Spanish. He recalled visiting his
mother in Puerto Rico after he had made a success in the major
leagues, on his way to, among other achievements, batting in 100 or
more runs in seven seasons. She had cried when he left to play
baseball at 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now,'' Perez said, ``her eyes were wet with happiness.''
Anderson credited his success as the only manager to win a World
Series in both leagues _with Cincinnati and Detroit _ and third in
total wins to Connie Mack and John McGraw, was to treat people with
kindness and dignity. Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   ``Having smart coaches around me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, none of the Hall of Famers bolted in protest. It was
just as well. After all, it was, as Joe Morgan said, a day to honor
achievement. And one day, Pete Rose may very well make it to the
Hall of Fame. As he should. He earned it on the field. There was
never any evidence that he gambled on baseball as a player, and he
was never accused of it.
</P>
<P>
   And it's as a player, not a manager, that he would be
considered. Sleep well, Marty Brennaman. &QL;

AT BUSHES' REQUEST, CARDIAC SURGEON CONSULTS ON CHENEY'S HEALTH  
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The following story is an added starter on The New York Times
front page) 
By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A cardiac surgeon in Houston who described
himself as a longtime friend of the Bush family said Sunday that
both Gov. George W. Bush and his father, former President Bush, had
asked him on Friday to consult by telephone with one of Dick
Cheney's physicians and help determine if Cheney ``was up to a
strenuous campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Sunday, the surgeon, Denton A. Cooley,
said that after the Bushes made that request, he spoke almost
immediately with Cheney's physician. And several hours later,
Cooley said, both the governor and the former president got back in
touch with him to check his findings about Cheney, which were
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the former defense secretary and the man supervising the
process by which Gov. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, chooses a running mate, emerged over the last few days as
a leading contender for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. And one
reason many Republican officials were surprised by that development
was Cheney's health. More than a decade ago, he had three mild
heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney has apparently not had any heart trouble in recent
years, and Cooley said that he told both of the Bushes, who placed
separate calls to him, that Cheney's physician in Washington
``thought he was certainly capable and fit enough to go through a
national campaign.'' Cooley added that the governor and former
president both seemed pleased by that news.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley's actions were yet another sign of the seriousness with
which Cheney is apparently being considered to share the ticket
with Bush. On the same day that the Bushes were reaching out to
Cooley, Cheney changed his voter registration from Texas to
Wyoming, a state he represented in Congress for many years, thereby
eliminating a potential constitutional hurdle to being the
Republican vice-presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The way in which Cooley's help was solicited raised questions
about the extent of President Bush's involvement in his son's
deliberations over a running mate. The Texas governor said on
Friday that his father, in whose administration Cheney served as
the defense secretary, had mainly played the role of ``a good
listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday night about President Bush's role in the selection
process, Karen P. Hughes, the communications director for the Bush
campaign, said, ``Only the governor can answer that question, and
I'm sure he will be happy to once the process is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said she could neither confirm nor deny that Cooley had
acted on the Bushes' request to help them assess Cheney's health.
Referring to the various people whose names have been floated as
vice-presidential prospects for Bush, Hughes said, ``I think it's
important to respect the privacy of all these individuals until
such time as Governor Bush makes a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to Bush said Sunday night that the Texas governor
had not yet contacted any of his closest aides or anyone on his
list of potential vice presidents to say that he had made his
decision, which he is expected to announce sometime this week. The
comments of several of Bush's advisers indicated that Tuesday would
be the likeliest day for that announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent Sunday in the peace, quiet and seclusion of his ranch
more than 90 miles northwest of here, and he was not planning to
return to Austin, where the announcement will almost certainly be
made, until midday Monday, his aides said. Bush said on Friday that
he would spend the weekend making his final deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   One of his aides cautioned anew Sunday that despite all of the
speculation about Cheney and, to a lesser extent, about former Sen.
John C. Danforth of Missouri, with whom the Texas governor met for
several hours on Tuesday, Bush might yet have a surprise in store.
But a high-ranking Republican official said that Cheney appeared to
be the leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Danforth seemed to agree. The Associated Press reported
that as he headed into a church in St. Louis Sunday morning, he
said: ``I think it's Cheney. You know, with the registration
change, that's what I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of additional indicators that Cheney might be
Bush's pick, including reports of Cheney telling business
associates that he might be taking on a new kind of assignment. One
Republican official said that before Cooley's telephone call,
Cheney had undergone a thorough physical examination last week.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear whether the exam was performed by the
physician with whom Cooley spoke. Cooley could not recall the
physician's name, and remembered only that this physician's review
of Cheney's health had been performed sometime within the last few
weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's senior advisers and other prominent
Republicans fanned out on the morning news programs, where much of
what they said amounted to defenses of potential criticisms of
Cheney's selection and arguments for why Cheney represented a
terrific choice. They repeatedly said, however, that Bush had not
made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   On the NBC program ``Meet the Press,'' Hughes dismissed the
notion that because Cheney was an executive with an energy company
in Dallas and Bush once ran an oil company in Midland, Texas, a
Bush-Cheney ticket would get tagged as an ally and pawn of the oil
industry. She said it would simply mean that Bush and Cheney would
be better at formulating national energy policy than the Clinton
administration had been.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Karl Rove, the chief strategist for
the Bush campaign, said that Cheney's history of heart trouble was
not cause for concern. ``Those heart attacks occurred in the '70s
and '80s and he then served as secretary of defense in President
Bush's administration and presided over Desert Storm,'' Rove noted.
</P>
<P>
   The three heart attacks in 1978, 1984 and 1988 that Cheney, 59,
suffered were all mild, and he had bypass surgery in 1988, before
his high-profile assignment in the Bush administration. In addition
to being a congressman from Wyoming, Cheney had previously served
as President Ford's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said that he did not review specific test results or
medical data with Cheney's physician, but simply listened carefully
to that man's assessment of Cheney's health.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley said that what the Bushes wanted to know about Cheney was
``how fit he was, and was he up to a strenuous campaign.'' Cooley
concluded that he was.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cheney and Danforth, 63, are in many ways dissimilar,
both have decades of experience in government that stand in bold
counterpoint to Bush's five and a half years as Texas governor, the
only government office he has ever held. Some Republican
strategists said Sunday that the willingness of Bush, 54, to turn
to older political veterans suggested how confident and comfortable
he was with his own abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But others said it was a possible sign that Bush or his advisers
were acting to blunt any concerns among voters that Bush did not
have enough seasoning to lead the country.

WEBB ADDS U.S. OPEN TO HER RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL FIELDS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. _ During a day when her emotions shifted like the
wind but were steadied by a resolve that has made her the best
female golfer in the world, Karrie Webb won the title she has
coveted the most.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, recovering from a shaky start that cost her the
four-stroke lead she held at the start of Sunday's final round,
shot a 73 and took the United States Women's Open by five strokes
over Cristie Kerr and Meg Mallon. Mi Hyun Kim, whose challenge was
derailed by a double-bogey on the 16th hole, and Rosie Jones tied
for fourth place at even par.
</P>
<P>
   Webb finished 72 holes at the Merit Club outside Chicago with a
six-under-par total of 282. The victory, the first Women's Open
title for the 25-year-old Australian and her second triumph in a
major championship this year, was Webb's fifth victory of 2000 and
her 21st LPGA career victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've achieved my ultimate career goal,'' Webb said after
picking up the trophy and a $500,000 winner's check, the largest in
the event's history. ``Anything from here is a bonus, I guess. But
I can only get better and improve my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's victory, occurring on the same day that Tiger Woods won
the British Open by eight strokes, was a hard-fought
accomplishment. ``Sometimes I don't understand why I'm sitting
here,'' Webb said. ``I think I was given a gift to play golf and to
be mentally strong.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paired with Mallon in the day's final group, Webb's sluggish
beginning turned into trouble on the par-3 seventh hole. She hit a
7-iron into a water hazard fronting the green and made a
double-bogey, trimming her lead over Mallon to one shot.
</P>
<P>
   On the eighth, a 522-yard par 5, she drove in the rough and hit
a tree with her second shot. Eventually on the green in four and
putting for par from 7 feet, Webb holed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mallon birdied the ninth hole with a 30-foot putt to
tie for the lead, Webb settled down. On the 10th hole, while Mallon
was three-putting from 75 feet for a bogey, Webb seized the moment
with a 10-foot birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Karrie right there,'' Mallon said. ``When she smells
blood, she's like an animal. She knew I was going to three-putt
that hole and she made a birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb's lead was back to two strokes. Mallon's putting problems
on No. 10 foreshadowed a series of mistakes on the greens, and she
had four three-putts on the final nine holes. ``I just putted
horrendously on the back nine,'' Mallon said. ``It was a nightmare.
It's amazing what this game does to you in a matter of seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb holed a crucial 7-foot par putt on the 14th hole. When Kim,
who had pulled within two shots, hit a 7-wood into the water on the
16th hole, Webb had some breathing room, and her spirits were
lifted when she saw some spectators displaying an Australian flag
on No. 15. ``But I wasn't counting my chickens until I hit my tee
shot in the fairway on the 18th,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   The walk up the 18th fairway on the clear, sunny day was
something Webb had long dreamed about. ``This is THE tournament for
her,'' said her caddie, Evan Minster. ``The tournaments back home
are important, but when you join the LPGA, you dream of winning
this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   By winning Sunday, Webb earned 2 points in a qualification
system for entry into the Ladies Professional Golf Association Hall
of Fame. She needs to play on tour only for the 10-year minimum to
gain entry.
</P>
<P>
   Without Webb's turnaround late in the front nine, though, she
would not have enjoyed the honors she received at the conclusion,
or the comfortable cushion she had on the final holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the eighth I had a talk with myself to play smart, hang in
there,'' Webb said. ``I was still leading the golf tournament. I
had to remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-talk paid off handsomely. ``Winning golf tournaments is
what I'm out here to do,'' Webb said. ``That's my motivation.'' &QL;

TEACHERS COMPLAIN THAT NEW EXAMS ARE TOO EASY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-EXAMS-ESSAY) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marian Swerdlow and her fellow social studies
teachers at Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in Brooklyn
braced for the worst last month when their students took the new
Regents exam in global history and geography.
</P>
<P>
   After all, New York state has sharply raised academic standards
in recent years, requiring all students to pass its rigorous
Regents exams to graduate. The tests, once reserved for the state's
most ambitious students, are being revamped to match the new
standards, and many teachers have feared the failure rates would
soar.
</P>
<P>
   They have not done so. Instead, teachers are complaining that
the new exams are so easy _ and the scoring system so lenient _
that even their worst students pass easily. An astonishing 96
percent of this year's high school seniors had passed the English
Regents as of January, including thousands who took the revised
version.
</P>
<P>
   While the state has not released data on the new global history
exam, teachers at about a dozen New York City high schools said in
interviews that most of their students had passed on their first
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to be comatose to fail this new test,'' said
Swerdlow, who said that 80 percent of Roosevelt students who took
the new global history exam last month passed. ``Students who did
no work all semester, who failed tests all year, passed this exam
handily.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are equally skeptical of the new English Regents exam,
which was introduced in June 1999. The exam _ the only one that
students were required to pass for a diploma this year _ was
expanded to six hours, from three. It includes longer passages to
test reading comprehension and requires more essays, including one
based on a spoken passage.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Rawley, an English teacher at the High School for
Leadership and Public Service in Manhattan, said the test was hard
enough. But under the state's scoring system, teachers had to
assign passing grades to essays they considered ``terrible,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is legitimizing illiteracy,'' said Rawley, who said
that 91 percent of the students who took the English Regents at her
school last month passed. ``A lot of these kids are writing essays
that are barely comprehensible, yet we're telling them that they're
totally competent. They're going to get out into the real world and
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne DeFabio, an assistant state education commissioner for
testing, said that if the average scores on the essay questions
turned out to be surprisingly high, the state would reconsider its
scoring system. But she said the system had been devised with
extensive teacher input, after field testing of the new exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait and see how many people actually breezed through,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new global history exam _ which students will not be
required to pass until 2002 _ includes 50 multiple-choice
questions, which Swerdlow and other teachers said were similar in
content to the old global history Regents. But the revised exam
also asks students to read short excerpts from different texts and
answer questions about them. Teachers say that students only have
to paraphrase the excerpts to get credit for these questions, which
are worth a total of 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Students also have to write two essays, including one that uses
``evidence'' from the excerpts. Many teachers have complained that
the test spoon-feeds students the information they need to write
the essay, instead of testing what they learned during the school
year. The old Regents exam in global history required students to
use more of their own knowledge, the teachers say.
</P>
<P>
   Even more problematic, the teachers say, is the system for
scoring the essays. Teachers score them on a scale of 0 to 5. Many
said that while it was hard to earn a 5, students could still write
essays that were poorly organized, incomplete or inaccurate and get
a 2 or a 3.
</P>
<P>
   According to the scoring chart for the global history exam,
students can pass if they receive 32 out of 61 points on the
multiple-choice and short-answer questions, and 4 out of 10 points
on the two essays. It is even possible to pass without receiving
any credit for the essays, although the student would have to do
extremely well on the multiple-choice and short-answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I marked countless exams where students left out either one or
both essays, recopied the quotations or wrote virtually illiterate
essays, and still passed the exam,'' said Martin Stark, a social
studies teacher at Francis Lewis High School in Queens. About 15 of
the roughly 50 students in Stark's two global history classes
failed the course, he said. But only three failed the Regents test.
</P>
<P>
   DeFabio and Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner,
insisted in interviews that the new exam was at least as
challenging as the old one. In keeping with the new standards, they
say, it tests not only students' factual knowledge, but also their
ability to analyze information and use it to write a well-organized
essay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had history tests in the past that required
students to write full essays,'' DeFabio said. ``What we're aiming
for now is for them to synthesize information and produce a
well-constructed essay, establishing a point of view and supporting
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We think that's quite a raising of expectations.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mills said that if most students were passing the revised
Regents exams, it was only because they were working harder. But
New York's results contrast sharply with testing data from some
other states that have raised standards. Failure rates are rising
in some states, including Massachusetts and Virginia, and several
have eased their graduation requirements in the face of political
and parental pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, where Mills has pushed unremittingly for
higher standards, the stakes are high. Critics predicted that
dropout rates would sharply increase if all students, including
those in special education and those with limited English skills,
had to take the Regents exams. Schools, too, have much to lose:
Mills recently announced that they would be publicly graded _ and
rewarded or punished _ according to their test scores.
</P>
<P>
   New York lowered the passing grade on Regents exams to 55 out of
100, from 65, for the first few years that the revised tests are
given. DeFabio warned that the failure rate could rise
significantly once the passing grade is raised to 65, starting in
2004. She also said that students were taking longer to finish the
new exams _ a sign that they were more challenging _ and that both
exams had been field-tested on several thousand students around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move along and students get better at the skills being
tested, we can use more sophisticated material,'' DeFabio said,
``and ask more probing questions that require more rigorous
analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFabio defended the state's decision to focus less on testing
factual knowledge, and more on what she called ``higher-level
thinking skills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know not just whether they've memorized facts,''
she said, ``but whether they can read information from a variety of
sources, understand the differences in perspective and then do
their own analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all very well, teachers say, but the real problem is the
state's system for grading the essays.
</P>
<P>
   For an essay in the global history exam about human rights
violations, for example, the scoring key directed teachers to give
a 2 to an essay that ``provides a weak definition of the term
`human rights,''' and ``is a poorly organized essay, lacking
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   For another essay, students were asked to describe how
capitalism and communism ``attempt to meet the needs of the
people,'' and to evaluate how successful each system has been. But
a student could earn a 3 by merely repeating quotations about the
two systems given in a previous section of the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you could wipe out on the essays was if you left
the pages blank,'' said Swerdlow, the social studies teacher at
Roosevelt High School. ``I was giving 3's to essays that I
considered to have a significant number of inaccuracies, because
that's what the scoring rubric told us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who score a 3 on both essays and get all of the
short-answer questions right need to get only 15 of a possible 50
points on the multiple-choice questions to pass the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Swerdlow and other teachers said the lenient scoring on the new
exams would allow teachers and students alike to be less diligent.
Meryl Tisch, a member of the state Board of Regents, said that the
teachers complaining about the new tests might have unrealistic
expectations. She pointed out that the state permitted schools to
substitute other rigorous tests, such as the Advanced Placement
exams, if they considered the Regents tests too easy.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve, a group monitoring
the standards movement, said he would not be surprised if New York
and other states decided that their new tests and scoring systems
needed work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every state that does this needs to make some educated guesses
about where to set the bar, and it's possible that New York has
initially set it too low,'' Schwartz said. ``People are going to
have to take the view that we will need to make midcourse
corrections in almost every aspect of this work.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing off the record, nothing semi-deep or
shallow background,'' said Leonard Garment in a parody of this
gossip-tossed city as he leaned back in his chair to plug a book in
which he claims to have figured out who Deep Throat really is. Deep
Throat from the Watergate scandal a generation ago. Deep Throat,
the carefully veiled supersource of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein
in their book-become-movie ``All the President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Our reportorial source, Garment, spoke in a steady, low tone
eight floors above the shadowy underground garage of his law
office, with the rest of the capital city unaware of this meeting.
The old Nixon loyalist and obsessive Watergate survivor made
frequent eye contact, suggesting he was trying to seem nonevasive.
(Or perhaps he was actually nonevasive. Who can say with certainty
in such a city? Particularly since there was no second sourcing of
any of this encounter, which was quietly arranged by a book
publicist whose identity must be protected to the grave.)
</P>
<P>
   ``John Sears,'' Garment said without whisper or flinch,
identifying the man he deduces after years of amateur sleuthing to
be Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   John Sears was a political lieutenant of Richard M. Nixon's who
lost out in the early in-fighting of the Nixon White House,
remained a respected strategist with close ties to numerous
Republican figures and later served as a director of Ronald
Reagan's presidential quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no DNA identification,'' Garment conceded of his grand
surmise. He noted that even before the book was published, Sears
met with Garment to flatly deny he was Deep Throat. He threatened
to take a lie detector test and sue the author for the honor and/or
dishonor of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may well sue,'' Sears angrily declared in an interview,
denying Garment's thesis as ``absolute nonsense.'' ``I never met
anyone in alleyways,'' Sears said. ``I never knew Woodward until
well after Watergate,'' he said, treating the Garment contention as
outrageous tomfoolery.
</P>
<P>
   Guessing who Deep Throat is used to be a capital parlor game in
the years immediately after Watergate. Whether anyone still cares
that much may be one of the few questions Garment can definitively
answer with his book, ``In Search of Deep Throat'' (Basic Books).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one that fits,'' insisted Garment, a 76-year-old
mainline lawyer and former jazz musician from Brooklyn. He
described his detective ``riffing'' as an exhaustive but strangely
joyful exercise in vetting and rejecting all but one of the score
of usual Deep Throat suspects, from the humblest in his book (Noble
Mellencamp) to the hottest (Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah).
Many were old buddies from the rise and fall of President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Garment said, his search was treated as a harmless
hobby, a kind of political macrame, by his wife, Suzanne, a writer
who is studying to be a lawyer; and their children, Paul, a
classical musician; Sara, a writer; and Annie, who is about to
start Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Garment operated not from concrete evidence _ there really isn't
any _ as much as intuitive guesswork. He was a White House insider
who survived the scandal unsullied and, by his own account,
enraptured by the high-stakes anguish and petty knavery he
witnessed up close. All suspects but Sears, he finally decided,
lacked the sophisticated mastery of detail and the media-canny
opportunism embodied in Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   Sears confirmed that when he warned Garment off the idea last
April he admitted to having been one of this city's many
unidentified corollary sources in the raft of news stories, but
never such a melodramatic fount as Deep Throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Bernstein by telephone, and the only reason I did
is because I had a client,'' Sears said this week, speaking of John
Caulfield, a White House aide during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   But Garment has constructed a cat's-cradle of hints and theories
about Sears. ``I have played the game according to their rules,''
Garment said, referring to the scant details about Deep Throat's
haunting persona and omniscient walk-ons contained in the book by
Bernstein and Woodward. The two have steadfastly insisted Deep
Throat is a real individual and kept his name secret.
</P>
<P>
   Garment rejected the suspicion of some that Deep Throat was a
literary device or composite source. ``If Deep Throat is a hoax, it
would be a monumental one,'' he said. In the scandal-breaking
stories that made the two reporters celebrated in The Washington
Post, they never referred to Deep Throat. But the shadowy figure
eventually became a centerpiece as their best-selling book was
mapped out with book editors intrigued by newsroom mentions of
their Deep Throat source of last resort, the shadowy synthesizer of
fragmented leaks and clues.
</P>
<P>
   Garment bases his conclusions on nuances gleaned in repeated
readings of the works of the two reporters and in conversations and
confrontations with a rogues' gallery of Watergate figures. As much
as the cigarette-smoking, Scotch-drinking figure of Deep Throat
reminded him of Sears, even more did the Watergate book's sketch of
Deep Throat as a gifted late-night talker and analyst of the larger
forces ever scheming and self-protecting at the Nixon White House.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever refutations his book may spark, Garment says he finally
has gained ``the very particular sort of satisfaction we feel when
we have tied up one of the loose ends of the universe.'' But he is
hardly entitled to cosmic satisfaction, in the view of Sears, who
has his own intuitions about Watergate that, in contrast to his
accuser, he intends to keep private. ``I think I know who Deep
Throat was,'' Sears confidently declared in firmly declining the
distinction for himself.

 &HT;    A brief charge, then business as usual
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The morning broke overcast and blustery.
Whitecaps crashed furiously on the beach where the movie,
``Chariots of Fire,'' was filmed, abreast of the ancient Royal &AMP;
Ancient clubhouse. There was promise of wind and perhaps even a
spit of rain. Not only did the Scots need the moisture, but there
is always excitement at the notion of a weathery day at the British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the two leaders, Tiger Woods and David Duval,
arrived at the first tee, the sun was shining brightly and the wind
had turned shy. Duval, the son of a Senior Tour player, had the
last chance at sidetracking the Tiger Woods express.
</P>
<P>
   The British bookmakers had already done it in their own way.
They took Woods' name off the board. (Happily, I already had my
wager in with Morrison's at 5-2.)
</P>
<P>
   A few good scores had been posted earlier. Paul Azinger had
dismantled the outgoing nine, birdied six of the first seven holes,
turned in 30, but cooled on the incoming nine and settled for a 67.
Davis Love was not far behind with another 67, but much unhappy
about the greens. ``I missed two short putts because the ball
started bouncing off line. It's the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval had spoken boldly after his round of 66 Saturday. ``It
will be a circus, it will be exciting, a slugfest, whatever you
want to call it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to look Tiger in the eye. If I can swing the club and
putt the way I have the last few days, then I can show him I've got
a game going as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bold stuff, indeed. Challenging, as in the style of Hal Sutton
at The Players Championship in March. ``I can beat him,'' Sutton
said of Woods. ``I've beaten him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is much less risk in such bravado when you hold
the lead than when you're six strokes behind. Duval had a view of
Woods dimly in the mist, but say this for him: He went after him
with zest, as long as he had any zest left in his tank.
</P>
<P>
   After nine holes, Duval had cut the six-stroke margin in half.
With half the round left, he had only three strokes to make up, and
that's when the tide began to turn. Gently, at first. He stayed
within four through the 10th and 11th holes but at the 12th the gap
widened.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th hole is the shortest par-4 on the Old Course, 314 yards
to a raised green of bumps and lumps, tempting to strong hitters,
tough to make a shot stick. Woods got down in three, Duval bogeyed,
and to bogey 12 is like losing two strokes. The rest of the route
was all downhill for Duval, reaching a distressing climax on the
scene of many a disaster, the 17th, the infamous Road Hole.
</P>
<P>
   His approach found the greenside bunker, and there a dilemma. He
had no shot, and by the time he had extricated his ball, he'd used
four shots, played out the hole in a humiliating eight strokes, and
plummeted from second to a tie for 11th. Such a fate should not be
wished upon even a bitter enemy. Woods bogeyed as well, and his
winning margin would be eight strokes over Thomas Bjorn, the Dane,
and Ernie Els, of South Africa, tied at 277.
</P>
<P>
   The 129th Open Championship had come down to what seemed the
appropriate finish, the world's No. 1 and No. 2-ranked players for
the title, and that storied silver claret jug the ultimate in
prizes. Surely it will hold other wines as well, but it has always
been identified with claret for reasons unbeknownst to this
observer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early stage, it seemed Woods was playing defense until he
looked at the scoreboard and realized Duval had whittled into his
lead. From that point on, it was like sitting at the airport
watching planes take off. Pure routine. If you expected a crash,
you were at the wrong place. Woods has turned winning into pure
monotony. As one has suggested, perhaps the PGA Tour should install
handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   The regular press conference was held at the end, but without
enlightenment on what the world has witnessed. Woods did say that
he had hit bunkers every day _ ``on the practice ground.'' He also
spoke of his luck.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' luck is the residue of earnest practice and intense
desire to succeed. And sportsman that he is, he had told Duval, as
they walked off the 18th green in the twilight chill, ``You're a
true champion,'' spoken by a man who had just joined Gene Sarazen,
Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player as the only winners of all
four major world championships.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming business as usual.

   MEXICO CITY _ Maria Bernal became the talk of Mexico during a
national financial crisis in 1995, when newspapers published a
photo of her frolicking on a yacht in the arms of Raul Salinas, the
playboy brother of the former president.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation of the peso had wiped out millions of Mexicans'
life savings, and investigators had discovered that Raul Salinas
had stashed $100 million in foreign accounts during his brother's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas and Bernal quickly became protagonists in a scandal
about sex, graft and the abuse of power that fed public anger with
the political party that had ruled for seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans learned that the president's brother had committed
adultery, avarice, even murder,'' said Guadalupe Loaeza, a writer
who studies social mores. ``People were hungry, and Raul was eating
lobster on a yacht with this girl. Immorality had become
intolerable, and that photo rubbed it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernal's memoir of her tempestuous affair with Salinas hit the
bookstores last week, just when Mexicans' obsession with his
family's sins had finally begun to ease. Raul Salinas is serving a
50-year prison sentence for the murder of a rival, and former
President Carlos Salinas is living in exile in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The current president, Ernesto Zedillo, has governed as a sober
steward, and after the governing party's election defeat this
month, Mexico is awaiting the inauguration of Vicente Fox, an
opposition businessman who campaigned against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   With Bernal's book, Mexicans are pausing for a look back at the
time not so long ago when presidents ruled like kings, with powers
so vast that even presidential siblings enjoyed license to pursue
extravagant and sometimes criminal whimsies. The book's details are
likely to fuel the resentments and desire for reform that led
Mexicans to vote the governing party out.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Raul Salinas and I,'' has sold 10,000 copies in one
week, making it appear likely to become a best-seller. The author
has been interviewed interminably by newspaper reporters and radio
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   During their two-year affair, Salinas and Bernal romped together
through his prodigal world of ranches, thoroughbred horses and
beachside mansions. She became a witness to the underbelly of a
ruling political elite that was degenerating into a criminal clique
before its final defeat at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal eventually sealed Raul Salinas' fate by turning state's
witness at his murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was a twice-divorced man of 45 when he met Bernal in
1992 during a drunken binge in Spain. She was a 30-year-old clerk
in an exclusive tailor's shop, and helped Salinas buy a new suit
and shoes to replace his soiled clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Mexico, Salinas began courting her long-distance,
cabling flowers and eventually flying her to meet him at the Summer
Olympics in Spain. Salinas was accompanied by an entourage of army
officers, secretaries and other retainers who careered about
Barcelona in a convoy of armored Mercedes-Benzes, Bernal wrote in
her memoir.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every moment, Raul displayed his enormous fortune, and some
exotic desire had only to occur to him for it to be turned into
reality,'' Bernal wrote. ``He had people to satisfy every whim. The
least important factor was cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He flew Bernal to Mexico, setting her up in a penthouse
apartment and ferrying her about in a private helicopter or plane.
They partied at his half-dozen homes in Mexico City, his beach
mansion in Acapulco, his various properties in Monterrey, his home
in La Jolla, Calif., and his hacienda in Puebla State, in the
shadow of two magnificent volcanoes east of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The Puebla property was his favorite, with extensive gardens, a
colonial chapel, a bull ring, a staff of 100 peons and walls hung
with costly paintings, including one by El Greco.
</P>
<P>
   In a closet there, Bernal discovered that Salinas had an Imelda
Marcos-like fetish: He owned more than 70 charro suits, the
silver-buckled outfits and matching sombrero, boots and spurs worn
by mariachi singers.
</P>
<P>
   On the hacienda's wooded property there was an enclosure stocked
with deer, moose, coyotes and other animals that Salinas would kill
when he felt like shooting. He fancied himself a big-game hunter.
During their affair, Salinas traveled to Zimbabwe, Bernal wrote,
``where he wanted to have some new fun shooting elephants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that to kill one of those enormous animals gave him
indescribable pleasure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their famous tryst on the yacht in Acapulco harbor came on
Bernal's second day in Mexico. It was there, she recalls, that
Salinas grabbed her in a tight embrace and first consummated their
love affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first time was not what I had expected,'' she wrote.
``Raul was very nervous, and the subtlety of the courtship gave way
to clumsy movements. I tried to calm him, but all the security he
projected in his personal life disappeared in that intimate
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks after Bernal arrived in Mexico, Salinas proposed
marriage and she accepted, she wrote. But he aspired to become a
state governor, she wrote, and months later informed her abruptly
that because his political career demanded a native wife, he would
be marrying a Mexican socialite instead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he begged Bernal not to leave him, and she agreed. She
attended his wedding to her rival, and days later he moved her into
his new wife's former home, where he continued to visit her.
</P>
<P>
   But during 1994, the tumultuous final year of Carlos Salinas'
presidency, Raul Salinas became increasingly mysterious, distant
and manipulative, Bernal wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She describes in some detail the moment in which she asserts
that Raul Salinas confessed to her his involvement in a plot to
murder Francisco Ruiz Massieu, his former brother-in-law, who was
the No. 2 official in the governing party. One month before the
September 1994 murder, Bernal wrote, Raul Salinas arrived at her
home drunk and in a rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wretch finally showed his face to me,'' Salinas told
Bernal, she wrote. ``The ex-husband of my sister _ that guy is
going to die soon. Everything's ready. He's done me a lot of dirty
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Salinas left office in December 1994, Raul
was arrested and charged with Ruiz Massieu's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have never fully established the origin of the
fortune Salinas accumulated during his brother's rule. The Swiss
authorities sought to prove that the funds were the profits of drug
trafficking, but their efforts ended inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas has acknowledged he engineered huge profits from insider
deals during the sell-off of government-owned enterprises. Bernal
notes that for months during 1994 and 1995, Salinas' staff worked
feverishly to shred documents.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, Bernal began cooperating with prosecutors,
and in the course of his trial, she became involved in a bizarre
plot by prosecutors to seal Salinas' conviction by planting a
skeleton on one of his ranches. She was charged with perjury and
served eight months in prison, where she began writing her
manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   She portrays her book as a discourse on love and its lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with Raul's way of being,'' she said in the
interview. ``He was an attractive man, very refined. Later it was
different, because you learned it was all deceit, and at the end,
there was nothing but threats and blackmail. I felt more like I was
in prison when I was with Raul than when I was in the
penitentiary.''

A CLOSER LOOK AT THE NEW TEST

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Teachers say New York state's scoring system for the
new Regents test is too lenient because it allows students to pass
even if they do extremely poorly on the essay section. The student
whose essay on the Global History and Geography exam is printed
below, for example, received no credit for it, but still managed to
pass the test with a 57. Instead of following the instructions, the
student wrote lyrics from a punk rock song.
</P>
<P>
   The Question
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, the human rights of certain groups of people
have been violated. Efforts have been made to address these
violations. Define the term ``human rights.'' Identify two examples
of human rights violations that have occurred in a specific time
and place. Describe the causes of these human rights violations.
For one of the violations identified, discuss one specific effort
that was made or is being made to deal with the violation.
</P>
<P>
   The Answer
</P>
<P>
   Perfect Government
</P>
<P>
   Even if it's easy to be free, what's your definition of freedom?
And who the ((expletive)) are you, anyway, who the ((expletive))
are they, who the ((expletive)) am I to say, what the ((expletive))
is really going on? How did the cat get so fat? Why do the families
die? Do you care why? Because there hasn't been a sign of anything
getting better in the ghetto, people are fed up, but when they get
up you point your little finger, you racist, you bigot, but that's
not your problem now, is it? You love to watch the war from the
White House, and I wonder _ how can they sleep at night?
</P>
<P>
   U$A
</P>
<P>
   Amerikkka
</P>
<P>
   Baby, they would sooner plate your chains with gold, encrust
your shackles with diamonds, and drape your cage with a velvet
curtain before they could tell you that you are free with a
straight face.

   Harris lives dream as Cowboy
</P>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Jackie Harris never would have admitted it when
he was in Green Bay. He had bigger problems to worry about when he
was in Tampa Bay. And it was something he couldn't give much
thought to when he was signed by Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But the veteran tight end who grew up in Arkansas always wanted
to be a Cowboy. So when he became a free agent this past offseason,
the 10-year NFL veteran made sure Dallas knew he was interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting an opportunity to play for the Cowboys was something I
would never have admitted, but my whole career, I knew that if the
opportunity presented itself, I'd take a chance and go for it,''
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   That was before he realized the Cowboys intended to change up
their offense. Once they made that announcement, it was as if the
job had his name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chan Gailey the last two years, the Cowboys rarely threw
to the tight end, using the position mainly for blocking. David
LaFleur, at 6-7, 272 pounds, seemed well-suited.
</P>
<P>
   However, under new coach Dave Campo, the tight end will become
another prime target for quarterback Troy Aikman, which is the role
the 6-4, 240-pound Harris plans to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the starter; he's the bigger body,'' said Harris, who
said he doesn't mind playing behind LaFleur. ``I've trimmed up a
little bit to become more of a movement guy. From here, I've just
got to find a way to make the coach decide that he needs to get me
in the game as often as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that will depend on Aikman's comfort level. Aikman and
tight end Jay Novacek were a successful tandem during the Cowboys'
three Super Bowl runs of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   However, since Novacek retired in 1996, Aikman hasn't found that
same ease getting the ball to the tight end, although last year
LaFleur caught 35 passes for 620 yards and seven touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, too, wants to make an impact as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go out and try to be a guy that Troy can really
depend on when he's in trouble or when we need a first down,''
Harris said. ``I don't want him to have any hesitation getting the
ball to me.''
</P>
<P>
   If Harris gets open, Aikman likely will utilize him, which has
been the case during workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in some offenses where you get open and the guy
doesn't see you,'' Harris said. ``But I was running down the
sidelines at one of the minicamp practices, and all of a sudden the
ball was right on top of me. The guy sees the field so well, if you
get open, you better be prepared to catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris had his best season with Tampa Bay in 1995, catching 62
passes for 751 yards and one touchdown. For his career, he has 339
catches for 3,880 yards and 18 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about Jackie Harris,'' Campo said. ``We
feel like we have a special guy there who can do some special
things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those things is providing leadership. When the receivers
were dropping too many passes during their first couple of
practices, Harris drew on his experience elsewhere, devising a
system of fines.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks donate $10 for every interception. Receivers add $1
for a drop. Practices have been noticeably cleaner, and the fund
has grown at a slower pace as camp has progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has accepted the leadership role, and he has the respect of
people,'' Campo said. ``Jackie has been in the league for 10
seasons, and he exudes that quality.''
</P>
<P>
   It's another reason he and Aikman seem to be clicking already.
Or maybe it's simply the number on his back. Harris, who wore No.
88 in Tennessee, was able to retain his old number since it was
recently vacated by Michael Irvin. If Aikman sees No. 88 and throws
there out of habit, Harris says that's fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it helps,'' Harris said. ``I'll put a bull's-eye on
there if I need to.''

ALL HAIL CESAR _ FORGET FAILINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Julio Cesar Chavez prepares to get his head
beat in Saturday in Phoenix by Kostya Tszyu and walk away from
boxing a bloody shell of what he once was, it's appropriate to look
back upon his remarkable career.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, he's one of the greatest fighters of our time -
probably any time - in spite of his deterioration in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And he had such style, such a way with people that fans both in
Mexico and the United States grew to idolize him. At the same time,
he had more than his share of slip-ups, which rendered him every
bit as human as the masses who clamored for him.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are so many things to remember - and forget - from
his 20-year career. Here are just a few:
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember him as a magnificent fighting machine, one that
plowed relentlessly forward until he crushed opponent after
opponent in methodically devastating fashion. Let's forget that he
didn't have a big punch and had difficulty with particularly
quick-handed opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember his marvelous chin, perhaps the best of his era.
Let's forget the punishment he took as a result (particularly in
later years) and not think about what toll this might take later in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember body punches so devastating that they were
painful to watch. Let's forget what Chavez did to his own body by
not taking care of it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember the fact Chavez fought 90 bouts before losing.
Let's forget that 58 of them took place in Mexico against mostly
mediocre opposition and that one loss - a first-round
disqualification against Miguel Ruiz in Chavez's 12th fight - was
later expunged for some reason by official record keepers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember that he beat fine fighters such as Ruben
Castillo, Roger Mayweather, Juan Laporte, Edwin Rosario, Bazooka
Limon, Jose Ramirez, Hector Camacho and Meldrick Taylor. Let's
forget that he avoided defeat several times amid controversy - for
example, everyone knows Pernell Whitaker beat him in their 1993
draw.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember the fact he won his first title at the Olympic
Auditorium, defeating Mario Martinez for the WBC junior lightweight
championship before a wild crowd in 1984 and fought many more times
in the Los Angeles area. Let's forget his last fight in town, at
the Pond, in which he pounded an overmatched Joey Gamache over
eight rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember that amazing last-second knockout of Taylor in a
fight Chavez was losing in 1990. Let's forget that referee Richard
Steele should never have stopped it with two seconds remaining even
though Taylor was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember his incredible career record going into
Saturday's fight - 103-4-2, with 86 knockouts. Let's forget that he
was 14-4-1 in his last 19 fights over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember the electric day he beat up loud-mouthed Greg
Haugen before an estimated 120,000 deafening fans at Estadio Azteca
in Mexico City. Let's forget that it was a mismatch from the start,
that Haugen was never in Chavez's league.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember the entranced crowd that gathered at an Olvera
Street news conference before his first bout with Oscar De La Hoya,
at which hundreds of fans chanted over and over, ``Chavez! Chavez!
Chavez!'' in De La Hoya's own town. Let's forget what happened in
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember the courage he displayed in his second bout with
De La Hoya, in which he stood toe to toe with one of the game's
young lions but was stopped in the eighth round. Let's forget that
he quit on his stool, evidence that his greatness was well behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember the hold he had on his people, who followed him
through the streets wherever he went like the Pied Piper. He
somehow was a superstar and just one of the people at the same
time. Let's forget that such reverence is fleeting as a star fades.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember that he also was the focus of constant media
attention, particularly among Mexican journalists, who covered him
as if he were King of Mexico. Let's forget a recent news conference
to promote a card on which he wasn't the main attraction: He sat
alone in the back of the room as reporters hovered over other
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember the proud, dignified Chavez, who entered the ring
each time he fought wearing a Native American headdress and his
head held oh so high. Let's forget the Chavez that stumbled around
drunk at casinos and other public places.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember the immense national pride he brought to his
people, who have so few international heroes. Let's forget
indiscretions in recent years - including the excessive drinking,
tax evasion and accusations of wife beating - that marred his
image.
</P>
<P>
   And let's remember the young Chavez, the Chavez who captured the
hearts of his countrymen like no one before him and six world
championships with phenomenal skill, courage and toughness. Let's
forget what we're about to see on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointing day: David Tua did what was expected of him on
Friday night in Las Vegas, knocking out Robert Daniels in three
less-than-competitive rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Whitaker? Well, David Dixon never gave him a chance in
another heavyweight bout on the same card.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, with whom Whitaker exchanged trash talk before the fight,
avoided fighting by landing several low blows and being
disqualified in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, a San Fernando Valley resident, was disappointed
because he was eager to show his progress since returning from knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't fight for two people,'' Whitaker said.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Mosley: If they're smart, De La Hoya and promoter Bob
Arum will find a way to get Shane Mosley the $10.1 million he was
guaranteed for a rematch of their July 17 bout at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who has lost two of his past three fights, must turn
things around quickly if he hopes to remain atop the boxing world.
And the best way to do it - the only way? - would be to exact
revenge against Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple: He beats Mosley, he's back where he was.
</P>
<P>
   And who else is there to fight? Junior middleweights Felix
Trinidad and Fernando Vargas aren't in De La Hoya's near future.
Only Mosley has a name big enough to jump-start De La Hoya's
career.
</P>
<P>
   One perspective opponent, Arturo Gatti, certainly won't give De
La Hoya the lift he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's he going to fight? Trinidad? Vargas? Ike Quartey?,''
said Jack Mosley, Shane's father/manager. ``If he does, everyone is
going to say he's running from Shane.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Mosley might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: IBF junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas
of Oxnard is a father again.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend, Martha Lopez, has given birth to their second
child, Amado Vargas. He weighed 7 pounds, 15 ounces, which means
he's almost a flyweight.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has a 3-year-old son, Fernando Jr....
</P>
<P>
   The Vargas-Ross Thompson fight will go to purse bid - in which
promoters bid for the right to stage a marquee matchup - on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is expected to take place on Aug. 26 if Main Events,
Vargas' promoter, wins the card. Welterweight contender Vernon
Forrest will face Raul Frank on the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' representatives are negotiating to fight Felix Trinidad
in December. Trinidad stopped Mamadao Thiam in three rounds on
Saturday night in Miami to set up the winter showdown....
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ayala faces Yory Boy Campas on Friday in San Antonio on
ESPN2, by far the most significant test of Ayala's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, 37, has resumed his career after spending 16 years in
prison for rape. He remains undefeated but has yet to face a
meaningful challenge in his comeback....
</P>
<P>
   Former junior lightweight champ Robert Garcia will fight Sandro
Marcos in on the Tszyu-Chavez undercard.

NEAGLE, LEFT-HANDED PRANKSTER, FITS IN WITH YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Denny Neagle was quietly pulling on his uniform
Sunday when a piece of fruit glanced off him. The new Yankee and
eternal prankster turned and only saw reporters, so he resumed
getting dressed. But Neagle was plunked by another slab of fruit a
few seconds later and it baffled him. Who was toying with him on
the only day when he is serious?
</P>
<P>
   It was 90 minutes before Neagle tossed his first pitch in a
scintillating 5-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, but he was
suddenly interested in flying fruit. Finally, someone informed
Neagle that Mariano Rivera had whipped a couple of fruit fastballs
at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very nice,'' said Neagle, a smile creasing his thick face.
``Very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   From a pregame target to a game-time dominator to a postgame
enthusiast, it has quickly become obvious that Neagle is
comfortable with the Yankees and that the Yankees are comfortable
with him. Neagle acted as if Yankee Stadium was his playground by
pitching a complete-game four-hitter to win his second start as a
Yankee and also win his 100th career game.
</P>
<P>
   With his father, his wife and his 6-month-old son among the
45,528 fans, Neagle pleased the Yankees and frustrated the Devil
Rays by mixing in fastballs, sliders and changeups. Neagle asked
David Cone to remind him to save Sunday's game ball, but, after
catcher Jorge Posada squeezed Jose Canseco's pop-up to end the
game, Neagle pumped his fist and remembered to tuck the ball in his
glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get your 100th win no matter where you get it,
but this is going to make it a little more special,'' said Neagle,
whose career record is 100-62. ``To be able to look back and say
that my 100th win was a complete game in front of a packed house at
Yankee Stadium is special.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle is an intriguing character. He loves to do imitations,
play jokes and pitch. He has also exhibited excellent control and
poise since the Yankees obtained him from the Reds 12 days ago.
With an earned run average of 1.06 since then, Neagle might be the
Yankees' best starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing exactly what we hoped he would do,'' General
Manager Brian Cashman said. ``Our scouts saw him as a tremendous
pitcher. Everything they said was right.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cashman spoke with reporters about imminent negotiations with
Neagle for a multiyear deal, which would probably be in the
four-year, $36 million range, Neagle shouted, ``Brian, you want to
bang it out right now?''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman quickly said, ``Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre and the Yankees have raved about playing
behind Neagle, who rests his left foot on the extreme right side of
the rubber and barely moves. He works quickly and effectively; he
even waved to the fans in the right-field bleachers when they
chanted his name in the first inning. Cone and the former Yankee
David Wells are the only other starters who have ever acknowledged
the bleacher creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Clay Bellinger, and he said they've probably
read about how goofy I am,'' Neagle said. ``So I figured I should
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Rekar throttled Chuck Knoblauch (0 for 12) and Derek Jeter
(0 for 11) before Sunday, but they started the Yankees' first rally
in the fourth inning. Knoblauch singled to left and Jeter smashed a
run-scoring double to left-center. One out later, Bernie Williams
ripped another run-scoring double to make the score 2-0. The
Yankees added three more runs in the fifth when they were helped by
Rekar's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   With a 5-0 lead, Neagle cruised. Tampa Bay's Greg Vaughn doubled
to open the seventh, but Fred McGriff's double merely sent him to
third. It was the best chance the Devils Rays had, but Neagle kept
the damage to one run by notching two grounders and striking out
Mike DiFelice. Neagle struck out eight, walked one and retired the
side in order six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems like he gets ahead of everybody,'' Posada said.
``With any pitch and in any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Neagle showered, he was back to being a prankster.
He was amused that Rivera felt comfortable enough to toss fruit at
him, but Neagle was plotting revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are getting to know me,'' Neagle said. ``I don't
like to even be touched before I pitch. But the good thing is he
doesn't know that I know he did it. Maybe I'll leave him one of
those 6 a.m. room service breakfast orders.'' &QL;

   DEUTSCHE TELEKOM IN DEAL FOR VOICESTREAM WIRELESS
</P>
<P>
   Despite the likelihood of regulatory hurdles, Germany's largest
telephone company, Deutsche Telekom, is expected to announce Monday
that it has agreed to acquire VoiceStream Wireless for $50.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition represents the first time a company that is
controlled by a foreign government has tried to buy a U.S. phone
operator. It will be closely watched as a test case for whether the
government will allow other such deals in the future.
</P>
<P>
   RADIO HOST SEEKS TO KEEP SPONSORS
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative radio host who has been
the target of a nationwide protest by gay groups, has begun a
counteroffensive intended to retain her advertisers. The show has
lost 12 brands, or nearly 10 percent of its national advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   CLARK SWITCHES STANCE ON MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   Jim Clark, the founder of Netscape Communications, surprised a
group of Internet executives last week when he said that he had
bought a million shares of Microsoft stock and opposed the
government's plan to break up the company. Clark, of course, played
a role in convincing the Justice Department to bring the antitrust
suit in the first place. What Clark did not tell the executives was
where he got the money to buy the Microsoft shares: Earlier this
year, he sold the America Online stock that he had received when
that company bought Netscape last year. AOL's subsequent deal to
buy Time Warner turned him off, he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN PRIVACY AND VOYEURISM COLLIDE
</P>
<P>
   The public cares about electronic privacy, so the government
sued to try to stop Toysmart.com from selling customer data; civil
liberties and privacy rights groups oppose an FBI e-mail
surveillance technology; and people have been flocking to the Web
version of CBS' voyeuristic show ``Big Brother.'' Online, it seems,
privacy is in the eye of the beholder. That's why the debate over
electronic privacy can get so confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives for CBS and Fox, expressing concern about the
risks of putting contestants with uncertain backgrounds on
prime-time ``reality'' shows, said they were considering changes in
the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   COORDINATING CUSTOMER SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   When buying goods, customers naturally think that whether they
give their credit-card numbers to a store clerk, a catalog
representative or a Web site, they are dealing with the same
company. And they expect to be able to get help from any of those
sources, no matter where they made a purchase. Some companies have
recently begun synchronizing their catalog, Web and retail
operations, which they hope will yield not only better customer
service but higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. SIMPSON APPEARANCE CANCELED
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters has canceled an appearance by O.J. Simpson
scheduled for Wednesday on ``The View,'' a syndicated daytime
discussion program, after being deluged with protests from viewers
and members of the program's staff. Simpson has scheduled a number
of TV appearances in conjunction with the start of a Web site that

   Fisk catches emotional tone for Hall inductees
</P>
<P>
   By RICHARD JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Carlton Fisk put the appropriate final touch
on a day of emotion and triumph as he choked back tears while
thanking an array of family members, teammates, managers, coaches
and others who assisted him during a remarkable 24-year career with
the Red Sox and White Sox that earned him induction into the
Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest temptation in life is to settle for a little less
of yourself,'' Fisk told the estimated 25,000 fans who gathered in
the lush countryside on the outskirts of Cooperstown for the 2000
ceremonies. ``I feel I stayed true to my passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk could have been speaking for Sunday's other four inductees
as well. With 45 of the 57 living Hall of Famers joining in this
weekend's festivities, Fisk became just the 12th catcher inducted
into the Hall. He was joined by a pair of former members of
Cincinnati's Big Red Machine: first baseman Tony Perez and manager
Sparky Anderson. Two others _ former Negro League star Turkey
Stearnes and 19th-century second baseman Bid McPhee _ were inducted
posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the only manager to win a World Series in both
leagues, won 2,194 games during 26 seasons with Cincinnati and
Detroit. Only Connie Mack and John McGraw won more games as a
manager, and Anderson remains the only man to lead two franchises
in victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness. How can a guy from Bridgewater, South Dakota, get
to this mike as the third-winningest manager in history?'' Anderson
said. ``Well, get it straight. Players earn (a place in the Hall of
Fame) with their skills. Managers come here on their back. I was
smart enough to know the players are the ones doing the work. I
could never thank them enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Perez, who was voted in on his ninth year of eligibility,
he pleaded that former teammates Pete Rose and Davey Concepcion
someday be inducted into the Hall of Fame. His mention of Rose drew
cheers from hundreds of Cincinnati fans who also booed commissioner
Bud Selig for his refusal to end Rose's lifetime ban for gambling
on games in which he managed.
</P>
<P>
   If the long wait made the day bittersweet for Perez, who drove
in at least 90 runs in 11 consecutive seasons, he expressed no
unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a feeling,'' he told the cheering crowd. ``It's hard to
describe the emotions I have. It took me some time, but I'm lucky
and blessed. I doubt that a king at his coronation feels better
than I feel today. I came from a poor family that was rich in love
and respect. It wasn't easy, but here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Fisk who stole the show with a halting 37-minute
speech that was more than twice as long as any other inductee's.
Fisk stopped frequently to compose himself as he spoke of a life
that began in tiny Charlestown, N.H., about his early dream of
playing for the Boston Celtics, and how he rose from an unnoticed
third-string catcher to someone who established himself as one of
the toughest and most determined competitors ever.
</P>
<P>
   He's best remembered for the home run that won Game 6 of the
1975 World Series, but some in the game recall him as the guy who
chastised Deion Sanders for not running hard on a ground ball or
for the thousands of hours he spent perfecting his craft in weight
rooms and batting cages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that it's not what you achieve _ it's what you
overcome,'' Fisk said.
</P>
<P>
   He overcame plenty. A 1974 knee injury almost ended his career,
but before he was done he'd caught more games (2,229) than any
player in history. He hit 376 home runs, including a record 351 as
a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a destination; it's a journey,'' Fisk said. ``We're
all on it. It's so far been spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   He cried as he attempted to discuss his former hitting coach,
Walt Hriniak, saying: ``He's the single most important person in my
baseball life. He taught me an awful lot about maintaining my focus
and desire.''
</P>
<P>
   He thanked his mother, Leona, for her ``warmth and comfort and
love'' and affectionately chastised his father who ``contributed
the most to me being stubborn and tough.''
</P>
<P>
   He cried when he discussed his family members, especially wife
Linda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the most special
person in my life,'' he said. ``Linda, thank you. I've known her
since I was 17. She's been through all the good times and the bad.
She's my friend, lover and the mother of my children. And I love
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk also could have been speaking for Perez and Anderson when
he spoke of how much he has missed the game since his 1993
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss this,'' he said, gesturing toward the cheering fans.
``I miss being at the ballpark on a warm summer evening. I miss the
smell of hot dogs and brats and the energy that overflows. What I
miss most is that feeling that you're part of something special. I
was part of something special in Boston and in Chicago. Most of
all, I'm part of something special here today.''

   A weekly column featuring readers' reports on life in the Big
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I still look at computers with awe and trepidation and had asked
a computer-whiz friend to help me install some software on the one
I had at home. He wasn't sure if the problem in installing it was
in my computer or in the installation disk, and needed to test the
disk on another computer.
</P>
<P>
   I live in a large Manhattan apartment building, and although I
have a nodding acquaintance with my neighbors, I don't really know
most of them. However, I was desperate to have the software
installed and started knocking on doors on my floor, hoping someone
with a computer would be willing to let us test the disk.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, a young woman whom I knew vaguely from the
elevator, said she would be willing to help but her computer had
been infected by the Love Bug virus. Then, amazingly, she handed me
her laptop computer and said I could borrow it to test the disk. I
was astonished that she would lend her expensive laptop to a
relative stranger, thanked her and commented that it was a sign of

   I was returning from Brooklyn on an afternoon subway to catch my

two-person seat with my business luggage.
</P>
<P>
   A stop or two later, a somewhat bedraggled fellow entered
carrying several overstuffed pieces of luggage and wheeling a full
laundry cart topped with a television set. I motioned toward him,
indicating my second seat. He demurred and remained in the center
aisle, but as the car began filling, his position became more
precarious.
</P>
<P>
   I arose and told him that I'd be getting off soon and that my
seat would better accommodate him, and we changed positions. He
said he was moving from Brooklyn to an apartment in the Bronx. He
had started at 6 a.m., and this was his seventh and, thankfully,
last trip.

   Normally we don't go upstairs to the sanctuary, but news of a

the body and I considered saying no, but an hour before the

displayed a woman in her Sunday best.
</P>
<P>
   The children were simultaneously spooked and intrigued. It was
fascinating to watch as they hung back and then crept closer, one
even bravely resting his hand on hers. From the dates listed on the
coffin, the children figured out she was 88. (I was relieved we'd
turned it into an educational pursuit.)

   Then they started giving her messages to take to all the people

   It was a rainy Sunday night, and Judith Stix and her husband,
Ernest, of St. Louis, were huddling in a doorway on 45th Street two
blocks from their hotel. A cab stopped in front of them and, Judith
Stix reports, ``A first! _ he tried to hail us!'' She indicated
that they weren't interested and shook her head, laughing. ``What a
cheap guy,'' the cabby yelled before driving away. ``Get yourself a
rich boyfriend.''

   Nan M. Sussman was driving home through Brooklyn, listening to a
National Public Radio analysis of the relationship between members

   Andrew Arkin was late and rushing, but between appointments he
had to settle some last-minute details in a shop on 75th Street. He
reached into his pocket, paid his cab fare and jumped out. He ran
into the store, had a short discussion, ran out, hailed a cab and
jumped in. He noticed a dollar bill and a driver's license on the
floor and was astonished to find that the license had his picture
on it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same cab, stuck for several traffic lights just a few
feet from where he had left it. When he paid his fare, he had
dropped a dollar bill and his license. Happy? Of course _ with one

<P>
   I was on a propeller commuter flight into a New York airport,
seated across the aisle from an interesting-looking man in a
T-shirt, faded overalls and work boots, quite different from a
cabin of briefcase- and laptop-toting business travelers.

<P>
   Our skinny bus with wings hit a bump or two and everyone
tightened seat belts. ``I had a rough one this morning,'' my
neighbor announced. ``We were cruising down the runway when the
pilot slammed on the brakes, and when I inquired what the problem
was, the pilot turned and said, `Coyotes.'''
</P>
<P>
   I asked where this took place and he replied, ``Manhattan.'' I
wasn't aware of any airstrips in Manhattan, nor had I ever heard of
coyotes there. ``Let me get this straight,'' I said. ``You were in
Manhattan this morning in a plane and the pilot had to stop because
there were coyotes on the runway?'' ``Yes, sir,'' he replied.
``Manhattan, Kansas.''

GROUP OF 8 PLEDGES TO HELP POOR COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change description of the eight nations in lede.)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ The leaders of eight industrial nations concluded
their annual economic summit meeting in this island resort Sunday
with a broad commitment to help poor countries reduce their debt
burden and increase their access to better education, health care
and information technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique issued at the end of a three-day meeting in
Okinawa, Japan's southernmost island, the leaders of the Group of 8
promised action on a wide variety of issues, most notably to
curtail extreme poverty and the spread of infectious diseases like
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan, this year's host, said
that wealthy nations have an obligation to break the ``vicious
cycle'' of poverty and disease faced by poor countries. In addition
to Mori, the leaders of the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy,
France, Germany and Russia participated in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We commit ourselves to the agreed international development
goals, including the overarching objective of reducing the share of
the world's population living in extreme poverty to half its 1990
levels by 2015,'' the leaders said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to bridge the so-called digital divide, a technological
gap that separates the world's haves from the have-nots, the
leaders agreed to establish a task force to help developing
countries reap the benefits offered by new information
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's final 15-page communique, drafts of which had
been circulating for days, contained few new initiatives and
provided few details on how the leading industrialized nations
would achieve their lofty goals, bringing criticism from some human
rights groups and nongovernmental organizations that the summit
meeting had lacked substance.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did, however, mention the need for joint attention
to a number of issues, including the safety of genetically modified
foods, research into the human genome, cross-border criminal
organizations, the aging of populations in many developed countries
and environmental issues like global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders promised to speed up efforts to achieve debt relief
for 20 of the most heavily indebted poor countries. A similar
pledge was made a year ago at the group's summit meeting in
Cologne, Germany, but so far only nine of those impoverished
countries have received some relief.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders at the meeting also pledged to jump-start the
multilateral trade talks under the World Trade Organization before
the end of the year. Last December, the trade organization's policy
meeting in Seattle collapsed when officials failed to reach an
agreement on the agenda and street demonstrations against
globalization turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meetings are a chance for world leaders to make an
impression, and in Okinawa President Vladimir Putin of Russia stole
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Okinawa, Putin visited the North Korean leader,
Kim Jong Il, and there was widespread interest at the summit
meeting in his trip.
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing Sunday, Putin said he believed Kim was a man
with whom the world could do business and urged more contacts with
him to help to defuse tensions in the region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were widespread fears that, as in Seattle, there would be
disruptive demonstrations around the Okinawa meeting after Okinawan
police officers arrested a U.S. Marine accused of sexually
molesting a 14-year-old island girl. The episode did lead to huge
demonstrations by Okinawans, who have long demanded the removal of
the many U.S. military bases on the island.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests, which were held at military bases and at
hotels and conference centers used for the meeting, remained
orderly, and the police reported no violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a private meeting with Mori, President Clinton apologized for
a series of crimes, including sex attacks, committed here in recent
years by U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government came under sharp criticism, though, for
spending more than $750 million to hold this event.
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental organizations said that Japan's record
expenditure was nearly 100 times higher than the amounts spent at
the meeting in Cologne or an earlier one in Birmingham, England,
and that the money could have been used to relieve the debt of the
world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000, a protest group that seeks to reduce the debt of
developing countries, said the amount that Japan spent on the
meeting could have been used to erase the debt of Gambia or
Equatorial Guinea. ``The world's leaders have retreated to this
remote island of Okinawa and have turned their backs on the poor,''
the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government said that the $750 million included the
cost of staging the three-day meeting in Okinawa and earlier
meetings of finance ministers and foreign ministers in Fukuoka and
Miyazaki. About $300 million of the $750 million was spent on
security, which included 22,000 police officers drafted from across
the country to work at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly a quarter-century since the first summit
meeting of the world's major industrialized countries was held _ in
Rambouillet, France, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings were initially intended as informal gatherings
where the leaders of the world's richest countries could resolve
problems of common concern, like inflation, economic growth and
currency crises. The premise was that they could do more together
than separately.
</P>
<P>
   But the conferences have evolved in recent years to include
discussions of broader political and social significance, including
armed conflicts, technology, hunger, health care and other issues
affecting the developing world, and to include Russia, which,
despite its ailing economy, is a central figure on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   In his press briefing Sunday, Putin also said he would continue
lobbying Washington to abandon plans to build an antimissile
defense shield against possible attack from hostile countries like
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin conducted himself like a true statesman, unlike his
predecessor, Yeltsin, who acted erratic and was probably drunk at
previous summits,'' said George von Furstenberg, a professor in
economic and financial policy at Fordham University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin didn't come here looking sad with his hand out begging
for loans,'' the professor said. ``He was confident and mature and
had a bag of North Korean goodies to share with the group.''

ANALYSIS: AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPENS UP IN EUROPE, A MOVE TOWARD
BARRIERS HERE
</HEADLINE>
  (With DEUTSCHE-TELECOM)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through much of the 1990s, the United States led the world in
opening the telecommunications industry to competition.
</P>
<P>
   But as Deutsche Telekom attempts to buy a fast-growing U.S.
company, the VoiceStream Wireless Corp., congressional leaders
sound as if they have not been paying much attention to Europe for
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the Senate is now weighing
legislation that would block the German company from buying
VoiceStream or almost any other U.S. telecommunications company,
because Deutsche Telekom's majority owner is the German government.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, responding to a letter from Hollings and 29 other
lawmakers, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, William
Kennard, said an acquisition of a U.S. telephone company by
Deutsche Telekom would face heavy regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But blocking a Deutsche Telekom deal could invite retaliation
against U.S. communications companies active in Germany and
elsewhere in Europe, and might also run afoul of U.S. commitments
to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under current U.S. policy, foreign companies are allowed to
acquire U.S. communications companies if the buyer is based in a
country that is a member of the WTO _ as are Germany and all other
members of the European Union. Hollings' proposal would block the
FCC from transferring, for at least a year, a radio license to a
company in which a government owns a significant stake, even if it
is less than 50 percent. Separate legislation supported by Sen.
Trent Lott, the majority leader, would effectively block
acquisitions by such companies on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the reasoning of the Hollings camp seems
straightforward: the German government still owns about 57 percent
of Deutsche Telekom, and Hollings argues that the government could
subsidize unfair competition or use its regulatory power to favor
Deutsche Telekom in Germany over foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The fears are not entirely misplaced. Germany, along with most
other European countries, has a history of impeding competition. As
recently as three years ago, Deutsche Telekom was an arrogant,
bloated and overpriced company that depended on regulatory
protection.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are over. In the last four years, the German
government has been selling off shares in Telekom about as fast as
the market could absorb them. In three separate offerings, the
government has sold nearly $30 billion worth of shares, and
officials have said repeatedly that they intend to continue that
process until the government's stake is at or near zero.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the German government has drastically
deregulated the country's communications market, savaging Deutsche
Telekom's core telephone business.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, when the European Union ordered all member countries
to open the telephone markets to competition, the German company
has lost about 30 percent of its long distance market to domestic
and foreign carriers and has been forced to slash some of its rates
as much as 70 percent to keep from losing even more.
</P>
<P>
   The process has hardly been perfect. Deutsche Telekom has tried
to block rivals by charging them high fees to connect to its
network and charging customers huge fees for changing telephone
companies. But German regulators have slapped down most of those
efforts, with the result that rivals have made big inroads into its
revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Deutsche Telekom's revenues for wired telephone
service declined as a result of price cuts and customers who
changed carriers, although the company largely compensated for the
shortfall through booming growth in its mobile telephone business.
But in wireless, too, the company faces an extraordinary array of
foreign and domestic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, Vodafone AirTouch of Britain
acquired the German company Mannesmann, which is equal to Deutsche
Telekom in the wireless business and is a strong second-place
competitor in wired telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom recently acquired MobilCom, a growing German
provider of local, long distance and wireless services. France
Telecom is also part of a group that will bid in auctions for new
German licenses to offer advanced, or so-called third-generation,
wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. communications company BellSouth and the Dutch carrier
Royal KPN jointly acquired a wireless network, E-Plus, in Germany
recently. And British Telecommunications, Britain's dominant
telephone company, owns part of a fourth wireless network in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. companies like WorldCom are building fiber optic
networks across Germany and the rest of Europe. Scores of new
companies, many backed by U.S. investors, are building their own
fiber optic networks in Europe to offer high-speed Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a heavy-handed ally of Deutsche Telekom, German
regulators have more often than not supported its rivals, like
Mannesmann, on crucial pricing issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, the antitrust regulators for the European Union's
European Commission have added to the pressure. Trying to force
more competition in local telephone service, they demanded that
Deutsche Telekom sell off its nationwide cable television network.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Deutsche Telekom has tried to retain as many of its
old privileges as possible. In selling off the cable network, it
insisted on breaking up the nationwide system into nine regions,
with the clear intention of preventing rivals from creating a
nationwide competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the German company is not only selling majority
stakes in the cable systems but selling them to U.S. companies.
Callahan Associates International, a Denver-based company founded
by a former executive of the regional Bell company U S West,
Richard Callahan, is buying two of Deutsche Telekom's biggest cable
systems for more than $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan's plan is to upgrade the cable systems to also offer
telephone and high-speed Internet service. Certainly he has
experience: While at U S West, he helped start the British cable
company Telewest, one of the first cable systems in the world to
offer both telephone service and cable television over the same
network.
</P>
<P>
   Given the raucous competition in German telecommunications, the
talk of a congressional blockade of Deutsche Telekom in the United
States has already set off an alarm at the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the German government's majority ownership of
Deutsche Telekom could turn out to be moot. In its bid to acquire
VoiceStream for $50.7 billion in stock and cash, the company's
executives say the government's stake would be diluted from 58
percent to 45 percent as a result of issuing new shares to pay for
the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Wilfried Schneider, a spokesman for the European Union in
Washington, said that a congressional effort to block the Deutsche
Telekom-VoiceStream deal would violate the 1997 World Trade
Organization agreement to open telecommunications markets to
private and publicly owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Congress should prevent this proposal from becoming a
law,'' Schneider said. ``It sets a bad example because it looks
like some kind of protectionist move.''

A FAMILY THAT RUNS TOGETHER, THE CLARKS RULE THE WOMEN'S 800 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The women's 800 meters produced a rare
family affair Sunday at the U.S. Olympic trials as Hazel Clark
finished first in 1 minute 58.97 seconds, her sister-in-law Jearl
Miles-Clark took second in 1:59.12 and her half-sister Joetta Clark
slipped into third by a hundredth of a second in 1:59.49.
</P>
<P>
   This apparently unprecedented achievement by one family
overshadowed a world record of 15 feet 2\ inches by Stacy Dragila
in the women's pole vault, an American record of 12.33 seconds by
Gail Devers in the 100 hurdles and the quiet dominance of Marion
Jones in the women's 200. She won in 21.94 seconds, the fastest
time in the world this year, struggling in the final meters but
finishing ahead of the world champion, Inger Miller (22.09), and
Nanceen Perry (22.38).
</P>
<P>
   All three members of the Clark family are coached by J.J. Clark,
Miles-Clark's husband and the brother of Hazel and Joetta. The
family is from Maplewood, N.J., although Hazel and Jearl now train
in Gainesville, Fla. Joetta flies down from New Jersey two weeks a
month to train with the group. The family patriarch is Joe Clark,
the disciplinarian high school principal depicted in the movie
``Lean on Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Clark, a former figure skater, took a slight lead on the
inside at 400 meters in 58.93. Miles-Clark, a three-time United
States outdoor champion at 400 meters and a two-time champion at
800 meters, moved in front down the backstretch and held the margin
through 600 meters in 1:29.2. She remained ahead down the
homestretch but began tightening up, and Hazel Clark passed her.
</P>
<P>
   Joetta Clark, meanwhile, hung near the rear for 500 meters, then
surged to make her fourth Olympic team at age 37, dipping inside of
Meredith Rainey-Valmon with her final stride. Overcome by her
exertion, Miles-Clark was carried off the track into a trainers
area.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila set the only world record at the trials. The women's
pole vault will be contested for the first time at the Olympics in
September at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. Dragila,
whose previous record was 15-1}, will now be the clear favorite for
a gold medal. She has actually jumped higher, clearing 15-5 at a
beach competition earlier this season, but the mark was not
ratified for a world record because the runway did not meet
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila, who trains in Pocatello, Idaho, attempted 15-5 Sunday
and nearly cleared it on her second attempt as the bar wobbled and
appeared to stay in place before falling into the pit. Fearing that
she would not clear a height before the competition began, she had
practiced visualization and relaxation techniques, lying alone in a
dark room, imagining the perfect vault and standing on the podium
with a gold medal around her neck. Sunday, things happened just as
she imagined they would.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has not lost a race in three years. She got a brilliant
start Sunday and led comfortably off the curve. Miller made a
charge from Lane 7 and closed within a stride, but she could not
overtake Jones, who was perhaps fatigued after dominating the 100
(10.88) and the long jump (23-{) last weekend. She has put herself
in encouraging position to become the first female track and field
athlete to challenge for five gold medals in one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1999 world championships in Seville, Spain, Jones
withdrew with back spasms during the semifinals of the 200. Miller
won in 21.77, faster than Jones had run all season. Jones won
Sunday but was not dominant, leaving a bit of intrigue for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' primary concern heading toward Sydney is refining her
long-jumping, which has been improving but erratic. The American
women will be favored in the 4x100-meter relay, but the 4x400 could
be problematic. Russia and Germany have beaten the Americans in
recent years, and since running 49.59 seconds at the Mount Sac
Relays in May, Jones has not been training specifically for the
400. After winning the 100 and 200 at the 1988 Summer Games in
Seoul, South Korea, Florence Griffith Joyner took the baton for the
anchor leg of the 4x400 three strides behind a Russian
quarter-miler and made up two strides, but she could never pull
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 800, Mark Everett made his fourth Olympic team,
winning Sunday in 1:45.67. Devers, the two-time Olympic champion at
100 meters and the three-time world champion in the hurdles, has
been slowed by repeated injuries since the Atlanta Olympics.
Sunday, however, she shattered her own American record of 12.37
seconds. In the men's 110 hurdles, the Olympic champion Allen
Johnson won in 12.97, the fastest time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Austin, the defending Olympic champion in the high jump,
won the trials Sunday at 7-7\, ahead of Kenny Evans and Nathan
Leeper, who both jumped 7-5\. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ A generation after it helped install Ed Koch in
Gracie Mansion, The New York Post has become a conservative fixture
in city politics. However straightforward its news articles, its
headlines and columnists tend to goad, gloat and cheer.
</P>
<P>
   So for political and media watchers last week, The Post was
doing what came naturally when it became the first newspaper to
publish the accusation that Hillary Rodham Clinton, first lady and
New York's Democratic candidate for Senate, had used an
anti-Semitic slur against a campaign aide 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the people at The Post,'' Koch said. ``But they hate
Hillary. It wouldn't matter if she turned into Mother Teresa;
they'd hate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political aides, frequently put on the defensive by
The Post in this media-saturated Senate race, might agree. And they
could even cite evidence for the Post-hates-Hillary theory, such as
the Page 1 headline ``SHAME ON HILLARY'' headline after the first
lady's embrace of Suha Arafat, the wife of the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   But hate is too simple a word for what drives The Post. Former
Post staffers, and some members of the Clinton campaign and that of
her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, see a more complex dynamic at work.
Though some may say the newspaper flaunts an ideology, it also has
a ferocious appetite for scoops and an ever-broadening base of
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Partisanship will always have a place in a news outlet
controlled by Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The Post's parent
company, the News Corp. Still, the paper's day-to-day coverage is
the product of journalistic adrenaline _ the desire to be quicker,
sharper, better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one of the papers get a scoop on something, they are
voracious on following it up,'' said Dan McLagan, communications
director for the Lazio campaign. ``That's true of The Post, The
Daily News and The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, conservative critics have long defended The Post as an
ideological counterweight in this city, saying its news coverage
seems biased only to those whom they consider to have a built-in
liberal frame of reference _ editors and reporters at The New York
Times, for example.
</P>
<P>
   George Arzt, a public relations consultant and former City Hall
bureau chief of The Post, said that the paper's first rule is ``not
to be beaten'' to a story. The second, ``To make sure your paper
sells.'' And then, ``to make sure your paper is interesting _ that
it has buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ideology, he added: ``If a story fits, perfect. If it
doesn't fit, they have to examine it. If it doesn't fit and it's
going to sell papers, they go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   By his measure, the allegations about an anti-Semitic slur fit
nicely. By the measure of The Post's editor, Xana Antunes _ and her
counterparts at The Daily News _ they were simply a good news
story. Antunes said she first learned about mid-day on July 14, a
Friday, that the Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge had posted
the item on his web site. On Saturday, The Post ran four articles
about the allegation, with the front-page headline ``HILLARY BOOK
BROUHAHA.''
</P>
<P>
   As The Post noted, the book was published by HarperCollins,
another Murdoch property. Antunes said: ``We've bent over backwards
to ascertain the facts, to be fair to all parties. As the week
rolled out we devoted a substantial amount of space to analyzing
the varying versions, the inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News waited one edition before it published its
account of the accusation against Clinton. But both newspapers made
the same point: that while the allegation might be false, it
brought back memories of Clinton's embrace of Suha Arafat last year
and might hurt her with Jewish voters. Then The News published an
editorial on Sunday attacking Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And so the story was off and running.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quickly called a press conference at which she angrily
denied the accusation. President Clinton called Mortimer Zuckerman,
the publisher of The News, to do the same. The denials, in turn,
put the issue into general circulation in all news outlets,
including The New York Times, Newsday, The Buffalo News and The
Times Union of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   On the Fox News cable channel, another Murdoch property, the
disputed slur was the top item of discussion on Fox shows like
``Hannity and Colmes'' and ``The O'Reilly Factor.'' But it was also
fodder for the public affairs shows of its rivals, CNN and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   John Moody, the vice president for news at Fox News Channel,
angrily disputes the notion that the various News Corp. outlets
coordinate coverage or carry out ideological directives. The Daily
News and local television news, he pointed out, were just as
interested in the slur story as The Post.
</P>
<P>
   But The Post was first. By week's end, The Post had written more
about the incident than any other newspaper; news stories
questioning the credibility of her accusers and featuring the
defense of her one-time rival in the Senate race, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, and commentaries skewering her.
</P>
<P>
   What drives it all? David Seifman, The Post's City Hall bureau
chief, said: ``Every time people think there's some sort of
political agenda at work to place a story of cover a story, they're
generally wrong. Almost always. The agenda at work is to beat the
competition and to get a better story and to get it first.''
</P>
<P>
   The past year has provided evidence to support the views of
Seifman and Arzt. After years of backing Giuliani, The Post was
unflinching in covering the furor when the mayor released the
juvenile criminal record of Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed man
fatally shot by the police. Then in May, when Giuliani announced
before television cameras that his marriage was over, The Post's
front page featured a grief-stricken image of Giuliani's wife,
Donna Hanover, under the headline ``Bitter Tears.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves pitcher whose xenophobic remarks
in a magazine interview offended a broad swath of New Yorkers, has
been tagged by The Post as everything from a ``Hothead Hurler'' to
the ``Ku Klux Kloser'' _ even though conservative columnists have
championed him as a victim of repressive liberal orthodoxies.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of ideology, The Post, a circulation underdog in a
city barely able to support two populist tabloids, continually
tries to broaden its appeal. It has a daily circulation of about
436,000 copies; 90 percent of its customers buy it from newsstands
or vending boxes. (About 80 percent of the Daily News's circulation
of 730,000 comes from street sales. For The New York Times, street
sales represent 40 percent of a circulation of 1.1 million.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since April, six events have dominated The Post's front page:
the New York Senate race; the New York Knicks' fate in the NBA
playoffs; Rocker's return to town; the death of Cardinal John
O'Connor and the installation of his successor; and Giuliani's
decision to abandon his marriage and the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, only the death and funeral of Cardinal O'Connor caused
a noticeable uptick in circulation, according to Joseph Gilkey, The
Post's circulation director.
</P>
<P>
   So The Post's core readers come back to the newstands day after
day not for politics, particularly, but for a reading diet heavy on
sports, business, crime and politics. Don Forst, editor of The
Village Voice, said that The Post's genius was its ability to build
``hot button'' personalities into its coverage: Rocker, the Rev. Al
Sharpton or Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. And Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you think of anyone who is more newsworthy?'' said
Antunes, The Post's editor, asked on Friday about the depth of
coverage of Clinton. ``To have the president's wife running for a
seat _ I can't imagine someone who deserves to be mentioned more.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates, perhaps. Last October, a similarly
explosive, uncertain and distant allegation _ almost immediately
discredited _ surfaced in a new book about George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential front-runner. The Post's initial coverage
was limited to a single article on Page 2. A few days later, The
Post reported that the author was a convicted felon.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking at the back issues of The Post for the past six
months would find Clinton's name _ frequently cut to ``Hill'' for
headline purposes _ more than once a week under the bylines of its
news commentators Steve Dunleavy and Andrea Peyser, often linked
with Sharpton and Suha Arafat _ two other hot-button figures for
Post readers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with The Post's trademark gossip column, Page Six and its
editorial page, the two commentators mention Clinton once a week,
on average. (The most liberal news commentator, Jack Newfield, has
been least likely to mention Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   In one April column, Peyser wrote, ``the time is at hand to set
aside our petty hatreds and visceral fears, and to make an
objective, dispassionate examination of the Yankee-loving, Suha
Arafat-kissing, Al Sharpton-pandering woman from Chappaqua.'' More
recently, another column was published under the headline: ``JUST
WHAT IS IT ABOUT A PHONY LIKE HILLARY THAT MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL?''
</P>
<P>
   Which, then, is the core of Post coverage? Partisanship or a
competitive journalistic spirit, coupled with a respect for
fairness?
</P>
<P>
   Ken Sunshine, a public relations consultant who was once an aide
to Mayor David Dinkins, said he would vote for partisanship. The
Post, he said, ``sets a certain style. When the networks come to
town, The Post is always quoted. Part of it is their headlines.
Part of it is the outrageousness with which they sometimes cover
stories.'' He said he believes ideology is the driving force at the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But for The Post's editor, Antunes, things are much simpler than
that. The news coverage of the slur accusations, she pointed out,
included prominently displayed articles in which Koch and Giuliani
dismissed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You report the news, gather the facts, print what's going to
sell the newspaper the next day,'' she said.

CLINTON RETURNS TO MIDEAST TALKS AS THEY REACH MAKE-OR-BREAK
POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add graf at end of 1st take.)  
 By JANE PERLEZ

<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ With stakes mounting as the Camp David summit
nears its third week, President Clinton returned to negotiations
Sunday evening and American officials suggested that the talks, now
centered on the future of Jerusalem, could break apart in the next
day or solidify into a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a new aura of gravity to the discussion over Jerusalem,
the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, traveled to Saudi Arabia to
ensure Saudi support for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, as
he weighs an American proposal on the contested holy city.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomacy by Mubarak, who enjoys the best relations with
Arafat of any Arab leader, was seen by the Israelis and the
Americans as an effort to fashion a wall of Arab solidarity behind
the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans made it plain through the State Department
spokesman, Richard Boucher, that the summit would not go on
indefinitely and could reach a make-or-break point as soon as
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here for an unlimited period of time,'' Boucher
said. The president would be given an immediate assessment and this
would be ``very important'' in how the talks moved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, American officials suggested that if progress was not
made by Monday, it would be difficult to keep going. If the talks
moved toward midweek, they added, that would be a sign that things
were going well.
</P>
<P>
   At his summer palace outside Rome, Pope John Paul II entered the
Camp David debate, exhorting the summit leaders in his weekly
Sunday address to adopt a long-held Vatican position that a special
international status be extended to the holy sites in the old city
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As important figures on the outside tried to nudge the
conference toward an agreement, Clinton left behind the relative
calm of an uncontentious economic summit in Japan, and entered what
appeared to be, from several accounts, a razor-edge atmosphere
among the Israelis and Palestinians at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve the tensions, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak,
visited the Civil War battlefields at Gettysburg Sunday with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Arafat relaxed at Albright's
Virginia farm where she served him lunch Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But these outings were mere interludes in a process that is
inexorably building toward a climax, one way or the other. The
conference went into its 13th day Sunday, the entire duration of
the first Middle East peace conference at Camp David under the
auspices of President Carter in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have been publicly stating over the last few days
that Barak was willing to make concessions on Jerusalem, though it
was far from clear that they would be enough for Arafat. Gadi
Baltiansky, Barak's spokesman, suggested that the Israelis believed
the summit had entered its critical phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't take a lot of time,'' Baltiansky said. ``President
Clinton will return to Camp David and then we will see if there is
any point in staying here, and going on with the talks, or to pack
the luggage and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's absence, the stakes grew in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter he wrote to Clinton before the summit was pronounced
dead and then swiftly revived last Wednesday night, Barak stated,
according to leaks in the Israeli press, that if the summit ended
with no overall accord, he would walk away from even those points
to which he had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have suggested that they may be facing an
all-or-nothing outcome and a situation at the very end in which
Clinton will be trying to rescue partial progress from the rubble
of a blow up over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   One way of looking at the negotiations as they unfold in the
next day or so, according to this scenario, is as a rock being
pushed up a hill. If a full agreement formally bringing an end to
the 52-year conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is not
achieved, then the progress on some of the less explosive issues,
like the territorial shape of a new Palestinian state and the fate
of Palestinian refugees, could be wiped out as the rock rolled back
down the slope.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton left for Japan, he and his negotiators, according
to Israeli and Palestinian reports, presented some compromise
solutions for Jerusalem. These centered on degrees of sovereignty
in East Jerusalem for the Palestinians, who claim all of East
Jerusalem as the capital of their new Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The principle of the American compromise appears to be virtually
full sovereignty for the Palestinians over Palestinian villages in
East Jerusalem and what one analyst called a ``sense of
sovereignty'' over the Muslim religious sites in the center of Old
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals reportedly envision some form of ``shared
sovereignty'' over parts of East Jerusalem adjacent to the eastern
part of the old city.
</P>
<P>
   The reports in Israel say that these are ideas that Barak has
agreed to and that they are concessions that go far beyond what any
other Israeli leader has made.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Israeli accounts of the American proposal _ which is
believed to have been worked on and amended in Clinton's absence _
report that a final decision on the status of the old city, site of
monuments considered most holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians,
would be deferred.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian reports say that these ideas are not sufficient
for Arafat to do a deal. Officials who have been in touch with the
Palestinian delegation report that Arafat is unimpressed by the
American proposals. Given the news blackout covering all aspects of
the negotiations, it is impossible to know how much these
descriptions of a defiant Arafat are for home consumption or how
much they reflect a true picture.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Palestinian negotiators, Abu Mazen, who had left the
talks to return home, came back Sunday saying that Arafat would not
accept a deal that did not include satisfaction on Jerusalem. A
partial agreement was not in the cards, Mazen said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, was downbeat
in a speech Sunday night at the Egyptian consulate in Gaza. ``The
Palestinian delegation has achieved no progress in the important
issues of the negotiations, such as Jerusalem, settlements, the
return of refugees and borders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's visit to King Fahd in Saudi Arabia also raised the
stakes because the Saudi royal family are the protectors of Mecca
and Medina, the two holiest Islamic sites, and have a huge interest
in the Islamic site in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Egyptian and Jordanian foreign ministers met to
discuss the Camp David negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has often contended that he did not have a mandate from
the Arab and Muslim world to make decisions that would permanently
cede sovereignty to Israel in East Jerusalem, in particular over
the Muslim and Christian religious sites in the old city.
</P>
<P>
   The Haram al-Sharif, or noble sanctuary, in East Jerusalem is
the third- holiest Muslim site, consisting of the Al-Aqsa Mosque
and the Dome of the Rock. The complex was in the custody of the
Jordanian royal family until the 1967 war when the Israelis pushed
the Jordanians out of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As Arafat considered what to do about East Jerusalem, he got
pressure from another quarter Sunday. The leader of the militant
Hamas movement, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said in Gaza that he would be
willing to declare a truce with Israel only if Israel agreed to
withdraw completely to the 1967 borders from the West Bank, Gaza
strip and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's appeal was based on a longstanding view of the Roman
Catholic church that the Israeli conquest of East Jerusalem and its
annexation to Israel was an act of occupation. In February, the
Vatican signed an accord with the Palestinians calling for freedom
of worship in all the holy sites of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In his address at his summer retreat, Castel Gandolfo, the pope
said: ``The Holy See continues to maintain that only a special
statute internationally guaranteed can effectively preserve the
most sacred areas of the Holy City.''
</P>
<P>
   Such international safeguards would ``assure freedom of religion
and of worship for all the faithful who, in the region and the
entire world, look to Jerusalem as a crossroads of peace and of
coexistence,'' John Paul said, invoking the city's ``holy places
and the three monotheistic religions that surround them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Japan for Washington, Clinton praised the two
sides for making a ``sort of systematic effort'' on a lot of
issues. But he was cautious about an outcome: ``Whatever happens,''
he said, ``I think they have continued to make headway.''

JOHNSON AND GREENE PAINFULLY END THEIR DUEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It was the great fear of Maurice Greene's
coach that he and Michael Johnson would get injured at the U.S.
Olympic trials, rather than save their legs and egos for the 2000
Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to know when to pick your fights,'' said John
Smith, who coaches Greene, the world record-holder at 100 meters.
``The race to lay it all out is the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's apprehension last month was prescient in anticipation of
the most eagerly awaited sprint in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start in the 200 meters Sunday at these trials,
Johnson pulled up in the middle of the curve, stumbled, grabbed his
left hamstring and fell to the track, to be carried off on a
stretcher. Coming out of the curve in sixth place, Greene also
began limping, ran gingerly to keep from falling over before
stopping. He later had ice applied to his left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   John Capel, a former wide receiver and the 1999 collegiate
champion at 200 meters, won the race in 19.85 seconds, a personal
best, as the 34-year-old Floyd Heard took second in 19.88 and Coby
Miller finished third in 19.96. But these achievements will be fast
overlooked in sprinting history.
</P>
<P>
   What will be remembered are the stunning injuries and the fact
that the United States faced the Olympic 200 without Johnson, the
world record-holder at 19.32, and Greene, the defending world
champion with a personal best of 19.86.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the pulled hamstrings will hinder
Johnson's attempt to defend his Olympic title at 400 meters and to
win another gold in the 4x400-meter relay, and whether Greene can
win gold medals at 100 meters and in the 4x100-meter relay.
Johnson's injury conjured images of his withdrawal from a 1997
match race over 150 meters against Donovan Bailey of Canada, the
1996 Olympic champion at 100 meters. Despite Johnson's unsurpassed
speed and endurance in the long sprints, Sunday's events will lead
to questions _ however undeserved _ about Johnson's toughness and
brittleness.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's 200-meter preliminaries, Johnson felt a cramp in
his right thigh, but won the heats in 19.89. When he woke up
Sunday, he had swelling in the thigh. His coach, Clyde Hart, said
Johnson's chances of running did not look good for running in the
semifinals. But Johnson went to the warm-up track at Cal State
Sacramento, and for two hours he warmed up and got massages from
his physical therapist, Dale Smith, under a shade tree. After the
final warm-up, in which Johnson put on spikes and sprinted from a
set of blocks, it became clear that the pessimism had abated with
the tightness in his thigh muscle.
</P>
<P>
   For the semifinal, Greene drew Lane 4, with Johnson in Lane 5.
Johnson had a false start, and in the restart, Greene made up the
stagger early, gaining a slight lead coming out of the curve.
Johnson, however, blew past him on the homestretch, shut down with
15 meters remaining and looked left toward Greene, conceding the
heat to Capel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice is underestimating what Michael's finishing 100 is,''
said Ato Boldon of Trinidad, who finished third to Johnson in the
200 at the Atlanta Olympics and who trains daily with Greene.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson warmed up for the semifinal, his agent, Brad Hunt,
said that the sprinter's main concern was not his leg but how he
would be portrayed by the news media. He has been sensitive about
remarks from other sprinters and track insiders, who have accused
him of lacking toughness since he dropped out of the match race
against Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Douglas, the manager of Carl Lewis, who won nine Olympic
gold medals and had a frosty relationship with Johnson, predicted
Saturday that Johnson would not complete Sunday's final. ``One guy
will drop out and make excuses,'' Douglas said. ``He's done it in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the race against Bailey, who called Johnson
chicken and accused him of faking an injury to his left thigh after
their aborted match race. After Johnson dropped out of the 200
meters at the 1999 national championships, citing a thigh injury,
Greene accused Johnson of ducking him.
</P>
<P>
   While a withdrawal at the trials might have prevented further
risk to a strained muscle, it would not have prevented an injury to
Johnson's reputation among track insiders, Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general public will think,'' Boldon said, `` `This guy's
run 19.32, he's the world record-holder. He pulled up, so what,
it's not a big deal.' People in track and field know Maurice has
accused Michael of ducking him. They don't care if Michael's
legitimately hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt bristled at Boldon's remarks while Johnson finished his
warm-ups before Sunday's semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope for the sake of Ato Boldon and Maurice Greene that
they have the opportunity for the track community to give a damn
about what they're doing at age 33,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's primary concern is maintaining his form as he gets
older, not other sprinters, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His opponent is the aging process,'' Hunt said, adding, ``He's
trying to do in his 33rd year things that have never been done
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the race, while he vowed not to get
caught up in a war of words with Greene, Johnson did exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a newspaper column a week ago, criticizing the athletes
in Greene's training group, then appeared defensive when other
columnists pointed out the contradiction between Johnson's
aloofness and his trenchant remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has cost Michael more,'' Boldon said. ``The
Michael Johnson of old would not have had anything to say. I don't
know if it's old age or what, but Michael's been lured into this
war of words. Maurice got him to play his game. You're not going to
outtalk Maurice.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing would be a more serious disappointment for Johnson than
for Greene, Boldon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have sensed that Maurice is trying to rile Michael, who
legitimately feels he has no heir to his throne. Because Michael is
more elitist, it would make it a lot more serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Johnson could not defeat Greene. He could not even
finish the race. Neither could Greene.
</P>
<P>
   With the Olympics less than two months away, the sprinting
dominance of the American men that once seemed assured is now has
now limped startlingly along into uncertainty. &QL;

GIULIANI SAYS HELICOPTERS WILL BE ADDED TO THE WAR AGAINST THE WEST
NILE VIRUS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J.)  By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's war on the West Nile virus is
intensifying, with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announcing Sunday that
the city planned to add helicopters to its attack against
mosquitoes and would expand its ground-based pesticide campaign to
include parts of Brooklyn as well as Staten Island and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating effort in New York City echoes steps being taken
by local and state governments throughout the New York metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which killed seven people and seriously sickened 55
others last year, has not been detected in people this year. But at
least 40 infected birds and three pools of infected mosquitoes have
been found in New York City and eight neighboring counties in New
York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the authorities said. At the end
of last month, the virus had been confirmed in only a few birds in
Bergen and Rockland Counties.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani Sunday added two birds in Queens to the count of West
Nile cases: an infected dead crow found this month in Richmond Hill
and a dead merlin in Woodhaven, near the Brooklyn border.
</P>
<P>
   To try to prevent the mosquito-borne virus from spreading to
people, the city plans to extend its ground spraying Tuesday to a
two-mile radius around the spots where the birds were found. This
treatment, using sprayers mounted on trucks, is intended to kill
adult mosquitoes and would follow ground spraying Monday night in
northeastern Queens and in part of Staten Island, areas where
several infected birds have been found.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying began last week in the Rossville and Westerleigh
sections of Staten Island, after the virus was confirmed in two
dead crows on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration also announced Sunday that the city
was seeking state permission to turn to aerial spraying for the
first time this year. Helicopters would be used only in the
wetlands of Staten Island to spread a bacterial larvicide, a
substance considered nonhazardous to humans and most wildlife,
except for mosquito larvae.
</P>
<P>
   New York City started to place larvicide in city storm drains
and other artificial waterways in the early spring, to try to kill
as many larvae as possible before they became adult mosquitoes. But
the marshy areas where mosquitoes thrive are difficult to reach,
and applying larvicide poses a particular problem in Staten Island,
which is 20 percent wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial spraying last year covered much of New York City and a
more toxic pesticide was used.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said a dispute the city had on Friday with federal and
state environmental officials had been resolved, with regulators
allowing the city to spread pesticides on land closer to marshes in
Staten Island, particularly around the Gateway National Recreation
area. Spraying had been prohibited in those areas because of
concern about the effect on aquatic creatures and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, West Nile-related spraying is set to start around 8
p.m. Sunday night in Stamford, Darien and New Canaan, Conn., after
officials announced on Saturday that infected mosquitoes had been
found in Stamford. It was the first confirmed case of an infected
bird or mosquito in Connecticut this year.
</P>
<P>
   In northern New Jersey, where infected crows have been found in
Bergen, Hudson and Middlesex Counties, health officials are
starting weekly checks on local hospitals, to increase monitoring
for any possible human cases. Hudson County also plans to do aerial
spraying of a mosquito larvicide Tuesday, the fourth such treatment
since May.
</P>
<P>
   And in Suffolk, Rockland and Westchester counties in New York,
spraying is set for Monday night and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony B. Iton, the director of the Stamford Department of
Health and Social Services, said that because most mosquitoes do
not fly far from where they are born, area residents have a clear
incentive to help prevent the spread of the disease. They can clean
out clogged roof drains, chlorinate pools and clear yards of old
tires, plastic containers and other items that might collect water
and serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most likely, a mosquito that bites you in your backyard was
born and bred in your property,'' Iton said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The old adage that age is a state of mind is a bunch
of bunk, said Reggie Jones, who, at the age of 73, may be the
oldest lifeguard in the Western Hemisphere. Age, in the opinion of
Jones, is a state of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't beat the Reaper, but you can put him off,'' he said,
and to prove his point, Jones pulled an old photograph of himself
from a chest of drawers inside Lifeguard Shack 5 at Jones Beach
State Park on Long Island. It was an old black-and-white of a young
Reggie Jones dated 1944 _ his first year on the beach _ and he
looked something like a muscular Sal Mineo.
</P>
<P>
   The beach was not named after Jones, he would like you to know.
(It was named after Maj. Thomas Jones, an 18th-century whaler and
part-time pirate.) Reggie Jones is, in fact, two years older than
the park that Robert Moses built. He is also older than the dark,
cake-shaped shack that he works from. The shack has no plumbing or
glass windows and it houses a half-dozen men like Jones who have
been on the job over 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is affectionately called Jurassic Park by the other
lifeguards at Jones Beach. And these old men with the boyish faces
think Ponce de Leon was a fool. Instead of traipsing around the
Everglades in search of the fountain of youth, they believe the
explorer should have known he was sailing on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spend a life staring at shells and sand and salt and
swells, it does something good to you,'' said Jay O'Neill, 66, a
retired insurance broker who is working his 48th year on the big
white chair. ``It is the best job I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It is halfway through the summer and, on many beaches, lifeguard
jobs still go wanting. From Westchester to New York City to the
Jersey Shore, it seems young people no longer find the clean,
glamorous job appealing. Not even for $10 an hour. It's gotten so
bad that Ocean City, N.J., is digging through its personnel files
and asking the old-timers to fill the empty observation chairs.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Long Island waters there is a surfeit of young
candidates who want to work. The problem here is that the young
bulls must wait for the aging pachyderms to ramble off to the tar
pits. This season, 120 applicants tried out, 80 qualified and 50
were hired. The job on Long Island is popular.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are many, the lifeguards say. State parks pay more
than others, from $11 an hour for a beginner to $20 for a captain.
The state park lifeguards have a union, and they are paid for
inclement days. And then there is a certain esprit de corps that
comes from working on one of the world's most famous beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather watch the tomatoes walk by than watch them grow in
the back yard,'' said Jones, who has the old habit of pardoning
himself before he curses or says something risque, as he does in a
complimentary fashion when beautiful women pass by. ``Jeez, I'm a
terrible character.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the guards can coast on their reputations. Each year,
the applicants _ new and old _ must swim 100 yards in 75 seconds to
requalify, and every year Jones has done it. ``I go ocean swimming
in the winter,'' he said. ``It's my physical. If I don't drop dead
from a heart attack, I'm back for another year.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Stern, New York City's parks commissioner, who has had
trouble over the last few summers attracting enough qualified
people to guard his beaches, was flabbergasted to learn that a man
of Jones' age was still employed as a lifeguard. ``How's his
vision?'' the commissioner asked.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' said Stern, who is 65. ``I've got to find something to
do after I retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 240 lifeguards at Jones Beach, one _ Jones _ started in
the 1940s, nine in the 1950s, 36 in the 1960s, 58 in the 1970s, 74
in the 1980s and 62 in the 1990s. They performed 2,079 rescues at
Jones Beach last year, and no one drowned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As far as anybody knows, Reggie's the dinosaur of the ocean,''
said Joe Scalise, the water safety director for the state beaches
on Long Island. ``He keeps himself in phenomenal shape. He outdoes
a lot of the young people.''
</P>
<P>
   His skin is clear and cancer-free, his mind is sharp. He
maintains a rigorous training regime throughout the year that
includes running, swimming and weight lifting.
</P>
<P>
   With a youthful body, the leathered neck of a turtle, sea-kelp
eyebrows, and an old hat with a button that reads ``older than
dirt'' and a grimy sea-gull feather, Reggie Jones is hard to miss
from his perch atop the lifeguard stand. He reckons he has made
more than a thousand rescues in his career, including saving a
swimmer's toupee and a few sets of dentures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest rescue was the fat man who floated out to sea,
with me holding onto him,'' Jones said. ``It was '47, in the middle
of a fog bank. He had to be 300 pounds. I got him, though. I never
lost anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones met his wife near the Jones Beach concession stands 50
years ago. He is still happily married, still thick-chested, but
carries an extra 10 pounds and has lost half his hair since then.
</P>
<P>
   Other things have changed in half a century, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dress, for instance. People used to wear full-body woolens.
``Now they wear dental floss,'' Jones said. ``The first bikini
walked on the beach around 1952. She nearly caused a riot and the
police took her away.''
</P>
<P>
   There are now swimmers from minority groups at the beach. The
overpasses on the parkways to Jones Beach were deliberately built
too low to allow buses to fit under them. ``City people got cars
now,'' Jones observed, which has broadened the beach's
accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the crowds seem to be half the size they once were, he
said. ``There were no malls then. No air conditioning. No backyard
pools. Everything was closed on Sunday. The beach was the only game
in town.''
</P>
<P>
   The most egregious change? ``The suits got smaller and the
people got bigger,'' he bitterly complained. ``America is fat.''

EDITORIAL: THE CAMPAIGN AT MIDSUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 24:
</P>
<P>
   Already it has become the campaign that people like to complain
about. Why isn't Vice President Al Gore less leaden and more
popular within his own party? What does Gov. George W. Bush really
mean by compassionate conservatism, and does he know enough to be
president? Whoever wins, about half of the American people will
blame the news media either for giving Gore a free ride on his
campaign fund-raising past or for not quizzing Bush hard enough
about foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the whinging about the available choices is a habit that
became deeply embedded in late-20th-century politics. Candidates
were either too much a part of the Washington crowd (Richard Nixon,
Walter Mondale) or too provincial and untested (Jimmy Carter,
Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton). And part of this year's complaining
has to do with the dynastic resumes of the two candidates and the
striking, almost archetypal contrast between their personalities
This election is destined to be remembered as a contest between an
aspiring student-body president and an amiable slacker, to
paraphrase an incisive description by The New York Times' Maureen
Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   These contrasting images are firmly fixed in the public
perception, and they point us toward some reasons that with the
convening of the Republican convention on July 31, we are going to
see an even harsher campaign than anyone expected. The crowning
reason for this is that the race is much more competitive than it
appeared a few weeks ago. Even though Gore has been struggling, the
national polls last week closed to within a couple of points. And
as Richard Berke and Adam Clymer showed in an electoral-vote
analysis in The New York Times on Friday, the contest looks even
closer when viewed as a showdown for a handful of swing states
including Michigan, Missouri, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania. Slim margins in a few crucial states produce mean
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only part of the story. The personalities of the
candidates and their strategic imperatives also play a role. The
Bush campaign has to sell a candidate whom people like but view as
untested and too much a product of easy street. The Gore campaign
has to promote a candidate with plenty of baggage and a
considerable ability to irritate people, even within his party's
core constituencies. If likability and baggage are allowed to
remain key issues, Gore suffers. If experience and policy expertise
come to the fore, Bush gets in trouble, a key reason for Gore's
renewed assault on the governor's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If a contest becomes focused on pocketbook concerns, social
issues and ideology, voters tend to scurry back to their home
parties. Suburban Republicans really do like tax cuts. Pro-choice
women really do have to worry about what a Bush victory would do to
the Supreme Court. Gore needs a big Democratic homecoming, since
vice presidents running to keep their parties in power have a hard
time attracting crossover voters. In practical terms, that means
Gore needs to have his current poll number, around 41 percent, up
to 47 to 49 percent by Election Day. Political professionals will
be watching Bush's post-convention polls to assess the bounce he
gets from his television time and his carefully orchestrated
vice-presidential search. In the run-up to the election, the most
striking point of agreement between strategists in both parties is
that the winner will have a very narrow margin. The outcome may
depend on whether the fervent Gore or the more laid-back Bush is
better at making voters comfortable with personal images that are
firmly and probably unalterably fixed in the public consciousness.

EDITORIAL: TONY BLAIR'S TRAVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 24:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, has been a remarkably
sure-footed politician. But a recent succession of miscues has
dented his popularity and thrown his government onto the defensive.
To recover before next year's likely election, he will have to show
his government can deliver effective policies as well as carefully
crafted imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Blair brought his Labor Party back to power in 1997 by ditching
traditional leftist positions and appealing to centrists, the same
way Bill Clinton recaptured the White House for the Democrats in
1992. Since then, Blair has enjoyed some of the highest popularity
ratings of any postwar prime minister. But his extended honeymoon
seems to have come to an end. Polls show Labor's consistent
20-point lead over the opposition Conservatives has dropped to
single digits.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Blair government suffered acute embarrassment
through the leak of two internal memos. One, written by Blair in
April, complained that the government was seen as losing touch with
the general public on social issues like crime, the family and
patriotism. He called for a series of ``eye-catching initiatives''
personally associating himself with these issues. The second,
drafted by the government's pollster, Philip Gould, portrayed Labor
as adrift, its focus and strength ebbing monthly. The disclosure of
these two memos left the impression of a government obsessed with
its own image and short-term publicity gimmicks rather than
long-term policies.
</P>
<P>
   The unfavorable publicity came just as Labor was announcing a
$65 billion three-year spending package to repair Britain's frayed
social services and infrastructure. The fiscal conservatism of
Labor's first three years produced a sizable surplus that the
government now plans to spend on better education, transportation
and policing. A big boost in health care spending was announced
earlier this year. There are also increases for university
scientific research and foreign aid. The package identifies most of
the right priorities and finances them generously.
</P>
<P>
   Labor still has a good chance of winning the next elections. But
for that to happen, Blair needs to shift his attention from image
management to making sure his government spends the new money
wisely and effectively. &QL;

LEO HOEGH, 92, CIVIL DEFENSE CHIEF FOR EISENHOWER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Colo.)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo A. Hoegh, a governor of Iowa and later civil defense chief
for President Dwight Eisenhower, died on July 15 in Colorado
Springs, where he retired 15 years ago. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Hoegh (pronounced hoyg) was elected governor as an Eisenhower
Republican in 1954. Defeated in his run for re-election two years
later, he was called to Washington by the president in 1957 to
become civil defense administrator. His agency was merged into a
new Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization a year later, and
Hoegh became its first administrator, filling a Cabinet-level post
he held until the end of Eisenhower's second term, in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Washington at the age of 49, Hoegh, who had been an
Army officer during World War II, stood out with his military
demeanor and hallmark crew cut, sprinkled with gray. The Cold War
was at its chilliest, and among his new tasks was to coordinate
civil defense drills and the designation of bomb shelters _
typically those places in office and apartment buildings that were
considered safest _ that people were to use in case of nuclear
attack by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not anticipating or expecting a war,'' he said at the
time, ``but the enemy could make a mistake or a miscalculation, and
the American people must be prepared.'' Such a war, he said, would
be won by the nation best able to withstand an initial nuclear
blow.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Arthur Hoegh was born on a farm near Elk Horn in
southwestern Iowa. He graduated from the University of Iowa in 1929
and its law school in 1932 and went into practice as a small-town
lawyer in Chariton, south of Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the Iowa House in 1936 and was re-elected
twice before being called up for duty as a junior officer in the
National Guard. In World War II, he earned a battlefield promotion
to lieutenant colonel as his Army division, the 104th, fought its
way across Europe. He also won three battlefield citations and the
French Legion of Honor. It was during those months that he first
came to the attention of General Eisenhower, the supreme allied
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Hoegh's wife, Mary Louise Foster Hoegh, to whom he was married
for 64 years, died five weeks ago. He is survived by two daughters,
Kristin Hoegh Marsh of Aspen, Colo., and Janis Hoegh of Boulder,
Colo.; and one granddaughter.

ALEXANDRE BARBOSA LIMA, 103, JOURNALIST IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexandre Barbosa Lima Sobrinho, a prolific journalist and
politician whose career was intertwined with the development of
Brazil for much of the 20th century, died on July 16 in a clinic in
Rio de Janeiro. He was 103.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that endured more than 80 years, until his final
newspaper column the week before he died, Barbosa Lima personified
the nationalist fervor of Brazil's news media as the country
underwent a transformation from a commodities producer on the
margins of the world economy to an industrialized regional power.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote more than 50 books along with about 5,000 articles for
the newspaper Jornal do Brasil.
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima, a member of a middle-class, traditional family,
began writing for several small newspapers in Recife, in
northeastern Brazil, where he was born in 1897.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after graduating from law school in Recife in 1917,
Barbosa Lima moved to Rio de Janeiro, then the capital, to work for
the Jornal do Brasil. At 26, he became the newspaper's editor in
chief, a position that put him in contact with leading political
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Although he opposed the Revolution of 1930, a movement that
thrust Getulio Vargas, a strongman politician from the country's
south, into power, Barbosa Lima later supported Vargas in his
establishment of a dictatorship in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   A socialist, Barbosa Lima based his decision on Vargas' creation
of legislation supporting a minimum wage, a social security system
and state-controlled enterprises in the steel and mining
industries. It was during Vargas' tenure that Barbosa Lima made a
foray into politics, as director of the government's sugar
institute.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Barbosa Lima was elected governor in his native state
of Pernambuco. But his term was made difficult as opponents
criticized his left-wing ideas and refusal to support the removal
of communist legislators from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took all the attitudes that I should have taken at every
time in my life,'' Barbosa Lima said in a 1997 interview with the
newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to Congress three times and ran unsuccessfully in
1973 for vice president on a ticket with Ulysses Guimaraes, the
presidential candidate, against the military government's
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But it was as a nationalistic journalist that Barbosa Lima is
widely remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a fantastic subject who spent his entire life defending
the country,'' Oscar Niemeyer, Brazil's foremost architect and
another prominent leftist, said after Barbosa Lima's death.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Brazilian Press Association, a position he
held for more than 25 years, Barbosa Lima came out in favor of
impeaching President Fernando Collor de Mello, who was accused of
corruption. Collor resigned in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
   After Fernando Henrique Cardoso was elected president in 1994
and began a wide range of reforms to modernize Brazil's economy,
Barbosa Lima emerged as a fierce critic of the government's
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   In his column, Barbosa Lima often lamented the far-reaching
transfer of state enterprises to foreign concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Barbosa Lima is survived by his wife of 67 years, Maria Jose
Pereira Barbosa Lima, three children, seven grandchildren and four
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Bespectacled and conservatively dressed, Barbosa Lima seemed
like a throwback to a more genteel time when journalists and
statesmen debated political ideas as vociferously as Internet
tycoons and foreign-educated economists discuss economics in the
Brazil of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could provide any advice, I would recommend not living
longer than 100 years,'' Barbosa Lima was quoted as saying earlier
this year. ``It is a cause of suffering to see all we could not do
and all that we would still like to do.''

ERNST JANDL, 74, VIENNESE POET OF MANY MOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernst Jandl, an internationally known Viennese lyric poet whose
work could be lighthearted or despairing, died on June 9 in Vienna.
He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a cardiac disorder, Franz-Leo Popp, a member of an
Austrian authors' organization, told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Jandl was named one of the 10 most important
German-language poets of the 20th century by a jury of more than 50
writers, scholars and critics established by the German-language
journal Das Gedicht (The Poem).
</P>
<P>
   After Jandl's death, the German literary critic Marcel
Reich-Ranicki, writing in the German newspaper Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, called him ``German literature's fanciest
wag.''

   ``Capriciously and tirelessly he told us in his verses what we
already knew,'' Dr. Reich-Ranicki added. ``But Jandl said it
differently from the lyric poets of our epoch, he said it more
concisely, and more originally and thereby more suggestively.''
</P>
<P>
   Jandl was strongly anti-Nazi, and his 1962 poem ``Heldenplatz''
bitterly criticized the way Austria coped with its history under
Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   In one late poem, ``Kommentar,'' which means commentary, the
mood is especially dark, and he says:
</P>
<P>
   that never
</P>
<P>
   would he write
</P>
<P>
   his autobiography
</P>
<P>
   because his life
</P>
<P>
   seemed to him
</P>
<P>
   just so much filth
</P>
<P>
   that only a few
</P>
<P>
   points, bloody ones
</P>
<P>
   he still remembers
</P>
<P>
   but that he would
</P>
<P>
   never hesitate
</P>
<P>
   to reach into the filth
</P>
<P>
   to pull out
</P>
<P>
   what perhaps
</P>
<P>
   could serve as stuff
</P>
<P>
   for poetry
</P>
<P>
   his disgusting
</P>
<P>
   purpose in life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he wrote raffishly in English in his last book of poetry:
</P>
<P>
   When born again
</P>
<P>
   I want to be
</P>
<P>
   a tenor saxophone
</P>
<P>
   if it's up to me,
</P>
<P>
   theres gonna be
</P>
<P>
   total promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   His trademark techniques of interchanging and cutting up words
and omitting letters and syllables received mixed reviews. On that
subject the poet said that he wanted to ``open as many paths as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jandl's work received praise in the United States. As the Modern
Poetry Association's journal Poetry put it in 1998, he ``was known
as a master of experimental poetry for his acoustic and visual
performance pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, The American Record Guide called him ``a
master of inspired nonsense mixed with social criticism.'' And in
1985 Peter Demetz, a teacher of German and comparative literature
at Yale, writing in The New York Times Book Review about Austrian
poetry, said he was ``among the best of the experimentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Jandl was born in Vienna, grew up there, was drafted into
the German Army and was briefly a prisoner of war of the Americans
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he studied German philology and English language
and literature at the University of Vienna and received his
doctorate in 1950. He was a secondary school teacher in Vienna for
many years, with frequent leaves of absence for his work as a poet.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote plays and radio plays, and he won a number of
major European awards.

WOODS COMPLETES CAREER GRAND SLAM
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS 3rd graf to revise that record is for all major
championships, not just British Open; ADDS date for PGA
Championship in 3rd graf from end.)  
By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ For the second time in two months, Tiger
Woods rewrote the record book and reaffirmed his place in golf
history.
</P>
<P>
   With an eight-stroke victory at the 129th British Open, Woods,
24, became the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam,
winning all four major championships. Woods has also won the 1997
Masters, the 1999 PGA Championship, and this year's U.S. Open,
which he won by 15 strokes, the largest victory margin in major
championship history.
</P>
<P>
   Only five players have captured the career Grand Slam _ Woods,
Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus. But nobody
has done it more quickly, or more decisively than Woods. Sunday's
winning score of 19 under 269 set a major championships record in
relation to par, surpassing Nick Faldo's winning score of 18 under
in 1990. Woods now holds three major championship scoring records,
the Masters (18 under), the U.S. Open (12 under) and Sunday's
record, which was accomplished at a symbolic setting, the Old
Course at St. Andrews, where golf has been played for centuries,
but where no one has played it quite like Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the world's best players, Woods cruised to victory
ahead of Ernie Els and Thomas Bjorn, who tied for second place at
11 under. It was another performance that left Woods in a familiar
place, in a class by himself. At an age when most people are
starting careers, Woods has become a legend in his career. After
hoisting and kissing the claret jug, the trophy awarded to the
winner of golf's oldest major championship, Woods admitted he had
captured the career Grand Slam even faster than he had anticipated
when he turned professional in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I've had a wonderful young career, and hopefully I can
continue to have success,'' said Woods, who won $759,150, and
became the first player to win two consecutive majors since Nick
Price won the British Open and the PGA Championship in 1994.
``There's no substitute for understanding what it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to put into words the emotions and feelings
going through me. To complete the Slam at St. Andrews, where golf
all started, makes it even more special.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the final round with a six-stroke lead, Woods never led
by less than three strokes in the final round. He pulled away by
making birdies on three of his first five holes on the back nine,
showing the consistency that has been his trademark at recent major
championships. Woods made just one bogey Sunday, on No. 17, the
famous Road Hole, one of the world's hardest par 4s.
</P>
<P>
   How controlled was Woods' game? There are 112 bunkers on the Old
Course, but Woods avoided all of them for 72 holes. And by making
his final six-foot putt at No. 18, Woods completed his fourth
consecutive round in the 60s (67, 66, 67, 69), something he had
never done at a major.
</P>
<P>
   At this point Woods' peers are wondering what it will take to
beat him, acknowledging that he is the world's best player, by a
wide margin that appears to be growing. Woods has won 13 of his
last 23 starts on the PGA Tour, and he already has 21 career
victories. The record that Woods most covets belongs to Nicklaus,
who won an unprecedented 18 professional majors. But with four
majors already, and winning at a faster pace than Nicklaus did, no
record in golf appears to be out of Woods' grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago that I said there would not be another
Jack Nicklaus, but in fact we are looking at one,'' said Mark
Calcavecchia, winner of the 1989 British Open who tied for 26th
place Sunday. ``He is the chosen one. He is the best player who has
played the game right now, and he is only 24. Jack Nicklaus was the
greatest of all time, and when all is said and done, he still might
have the greatest record. But if Jack was in his prime today, I
don't think he could keep up with Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the world's No. 2 ranked player, could not keep up
with Woods Sunday. Woods and Duval were paired together in the last
group, the first time they had ever played together in the final
round of a major. The showdown started well for Duval, who birdied
four of the first seven holes, despite missing an 18-inch putt at
No. 5, and closing his deficit to three strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But a huge turning point came at the par 4, 379-yard No. 10.
Woods reached the green on his drive, then left his putt for eagle
10 feet short. Then after Duval left a 15-foot putt for birdie just
short, Woods made a 14-footer for birdie to take a four-stroke
lead. Then at the par 4, 314-yard No. 12, Woods extended his lead
back to six strokes, when he birdied and Duval bogeyed. Woods drove
the green again, then two-putted. Meanwhile, Duval's drive was
short of the green, he left a poor chip still 50 feet short of the
cup, and from there, he three-putted.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was six strokes ahead with six holes left to play, and
Duval knew it was Woods' day. But at the Road Hole, the day took a
cruel turn for Duval, who made a quadruple bogey after hitting his
third shot into the Road Hole bunker. It took Duval four attempts
to escape the bunker, which is about six feet high. His first two
tries hit the wall of the bunker and came back. Then Duval was
forced to take a back-hand swipe at the ball in the sand, giving
him enough room to finally hit the ball just over the bunker's top
lip. That regrettable episode tumbled Duval into a tie for 11th
place at 7 under. But there was no doubt in Duval's mind, or anyone
else's, about who was No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a spectacular performance, to say the least,'' Duval
said. ``He simply did not make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Woods walked down the 18th fairway, he was saluted with
applause from fans in the grandstands, and from the crowded gallery
beside the green, which included his mother, Tida, and his
girlfriend, Joanna Jagoda.
</P>
<P>
   Another milestone had been reached, another challenge had been
met. Meanwhile, there was increased anticipation for the year's
final major, the PGA Championship in Louisville, Ky., Aug. 17-20,
where Woods will attempt to become the first player to win three
majors in one year since 1953, when Hogan won the Masters, the U.S.
Open and the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday evening, Woods was content to savor a week that had
ended the way he had hoped, with the claret jug in his hands and
with more goals in sight. Asked how he felt, Woods smiled, and gave
a three-word response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too bad.''  &QL;

COMMENTARY: HOW SLAVERY FUELED BUSINESS IN THE NORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The German Parliament hoped to discourage a wave of lawsuits _
and close the door on an ugly past _ when it voted to support a
fund through which corporations will compensate people who worked
as slave laborers in Germany during World War II. But by agreeing
to pay reparations, corporations like DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche
Bank, Siemens and Volkswagen are tacitly admitting that German
corporate wealth rests at least partly on slave labor extracted
from Jews during the commission of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a big year for institutional contrition, with the
Vatican apologizing for misdeeds of the past _ extending back to
the Inquisition _ and Swiss banks seeking atonement for
appropriating the accounts of Holocaust victims. But in the U.S.
Congress, a bill that would bring about a similar reckoning with
regard to two and a half centuries of slavery may never see the
light of day. Legislation sponsored by Rep. John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan calling for a study of reparations has failed to reach the
House floor, even after being submitted to Congress every year for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Congress to take this bill seriously reflects the
sense among Americans as a whole that slavery has no economic
bearing on the nation as it exists today. But if a 34-year-old
lawyer named Deadria Farmer-Paellmann has her way, a broader debate
about reparations and the links between modern corporations and the
slave economy may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   A part-time musician and amateur historian, Farmer-Paellmann
attended law school solely to develop a legal argument for
reparations. After scouring corporate archives, she has turned up
connections between modern corporations and predecessor companies
that seem clearly to have profited from the slave trade, in some
cases obliquely but often quite directly.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the German case, Farmer-Paellmann is planning to sue
a dozen corporations for ``unjustly enriching'' themselves and has
already begun distributing archival records that provide
provocative examples of corporate involvement in the trade. The
planned lawsuits are novel. But the news articles about her first
few discoveries have already broadened public awareness of the
extent to which the United States depended on slaves to build the
national as well as the Southern economy.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ogletree, a Harvard Law School professor, is among those
paying attention. He says he is considering both litigation and
legislation and is helping to plan a conference scheduled this fall
on the reparations issue.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day Northerners tend to view slavery as confined to the
Confederacy, thinking of the Northeast as made up of ``free
states.'' Americans are for the most part unaware that slavery
covered all of the original colonies and their successor states and
began to loosen its grip in the North only in the early 1800s, when
personal liberty laws went into effect. New York City was a capital
of human bondage, with more slaves than any other city with the
possible exception of Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   New England survives in the history books as the hotbed of
abolitionism and the home of the crusading anti-slavery novelist
Harriet Beecher Stowe. But Farmer-Paellmann has turned up documents
revealing a different New England, one in which corporate founders
and respected businessmen trafficked in slaves, even after aspects
of the slave trade were made illegal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most serious offenders was the Rhode Island
businessman John Brown, who founded Providence Bank, an early
predecessor of the modern FleetBoston Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet corporate history portrays Brown as a ``respected
merchant.'' But Farmer-Paellmann has unearthed records showing that
Brown owned ships that embarked on several slaving voyages and that
he was prosecuted in federal court for participating in the
international slave trade after it had become illegal under federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Providence Bank lent substantial sums to
Brown, and Farmer-Paellmann suspects that the bank both financed
and profited from the founder's illegal slave trading. For its
part, FleetBoston contends that incomplete records make a
conclusion impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing document to emerge so far reveals that Aetna
Insurance Co. of Hartford actually insured slave owners against the
loss of their human chattel. That Aetna knew the horrors of slave
life is evident in a rider through which the company declined to
pay the premium for slaves who were lynched, worked to death or who
committed suicide. Aetna says that incomplete records forbid its
knowing how many such policies were written.
</P>
<P>
   After the policy came to light, the company apologized for
having been involved in the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer-Paellmann claims to have found similar documents
concerning more than a dozen corporations still doing business in
the United States and has promised to file several lawsuits
charging these companies with unjustly enriching themselves at the
expense of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the lawsuits succeed is almost beside the point.
This exercise will have done its job if it reveals to the public
the role of slavery in shaping American life. More than a few
modern fortunes rest on the suffering of human beings who once
accounted for a large portion of American wealth and lived in
chains here for 250 years.

PRESIDENT RESUMES HIS MIDEAST PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Following an 85-hour trip to Japan, President
Clinton rushed back Sunday to the Camp David summit between the
Israelis and the Palestinians with the fate of the historic talks
hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   For all parties, the moment appeared critical. The sense from
all sides was that Clinton's return would either trigger a breakup
of negotiations in the next day or two, or begin a final push in
creatinga document that ends 52 years of enmity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, returning early from a Group of Eight summit in Japan,
spent about three hours at the White House before taking a
helicopter with his daughter, Chelsea, to the presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   American negotiators briefed him, after which the president went
into one-on-one meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Clinton would
decide what direction to take the talks following his discussions
with the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole variety of things that could happen now,''
Boucher said. ``One of which is we might reach a deal and the other
of which is we might not, definitively.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself hinted at the possibility of failure, speaking
about the negotiators before he left Japan. ``Whether we get an
agreement or not, they have tried. They have really been out there
working.''
</P>
<P>
   The major divisive issue remained Jerusalem, and specifically
the fate of the traditionally Arab part of the city, which includes
the walled Old City, the 1 square kilometer of home to holy shrines
of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says that Jerusalem will not be divided and will stay
under its control, while the Palestinians say there can be no deal
without gaining sovereignty of all of East Jerusalem, which Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks reopened on Jerusalem inside Camp David, other
voices spoke up on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In Vatican City, Pope John Paul II urged creation of a special
international status for the holy sites of Jerusalem, urging
negotiators ``not to overlook the importance of the spiritual
dimension'' of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with King
Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah, while in Jerusalem, Israeli Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin declared the problem solvable. ``It is much
more of a symbolic problem than anything else,'' said Beilin, an
architect of the Oslo peace framework.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in Japan that since he left Camp David Thursday
``there has been a lot more sort of systematic effort with the
groups on a lot of the issues. So whatever happens, I think they
have continued to make headway.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues include creation of a Palestinian state, borders,
Jewish settlements, and the right of return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But for the leaders, the weekend also provided a break from
negotiations. Barak, for instance, spent many hours by himself in
his Dogwood Cabin at Camp David, even taking dinner there alone.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright also separately took
both leaders out of Camp David, Barak Sunday to tour the Gettysburg
battlefield, and Arafat for lunch Saturday at her Virginia farm.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the sides were still at Camp David was
attributable to Clinton's persuasive powers.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, on the ninth day of talks, US officials said the
summit had ended in failure, only to announce soon afterward that
both Barak and Arafat had agreed to stay until Clinton's return, at
the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned on the 13th day of the talks. The Camp David
summit in 1978 that led to the Israeli-Egyptian peace deal took 13
days.
</P>
<P>
   In that first summit and again last week when Clinton prepared
to leave for the G-8 talks, the American team used a deadline to
exert pressure for a settlement. Now, though, there's no deadline
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here for an unlimited period of time,'' Boucher of
the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were anxious for Clinton's return.
</P>
<P>
   When the president begins the meetings, ``then we will see if
there's any point in staying here and going on with the talks or to
pack the luggage and return home,'' Gadi Baltiansky, spokesman for
Barak, told Israel's Army Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Baltiansky told the Globe that Barak ``is neither optimistic nor
pessimistic. He is realistic in evaluating the situation. We are
talking about a very serious moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the drama of the moment, the Israeli spokesman said
the outcome was anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not prophets,'' he said. ``We have no idea what will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, the PLO representative in Washington, said
in an interview that little progress had been made since Clinton
left early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are where they were when Clinton left,'' Rahman said.
``I don't think anything of substance has changed. The Israelis are
still intransigent on the issue of Jerusalem and territory and
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jerusalem, he said, ``there is east and west. We are ready to
accept Israel's sovereignty in West Jerusalem, and we must have
East Jerusalem. Then we will have an open city and find a formula
for access, movement, and cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   But a US diplomat specializing in Middle Eastern issues,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the talks have already
yielded some progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a process that is nine years removed from the
Madrid talks, seven years from the Oslo agreement, and here we've
had the first serious talks ever on Jerusalem,'' the diplomat said.
``Even if there's no deal, there's utility in sticking your toes in
the water.''

SUSSMAN VOLK, RESTAURATEUR AND INVENTOR, 80, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sussman Volk, who owned a Manhattan restaurant that became a
garment district social center in Manhattan for decades, opened and
quickly closed what was said to be New York City's first
frozen-food store, and invented questionable necessities that
included the Cigarette Lighter That Lights From Either End, died
July 14 in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was acute leukemia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Volk, who was known as Cecil, as were three cousins with the
same first name, was a true New York character. He meticulously
cataloged tens of thousands of jokes, some funny, all of which he
yearned to crack at what he considered the perfect moment. He tore
around on a motorcycle, wearing lots of black leather, until
shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been the occasional misstep. The pioneering
Greenwich Village frozen-food store, Penguin Food, was founded on
the fatally incorrect premise that people would go to a separate
store to buy the new wonder of frozen goods. When Volk thought he
had invented the four-color retractable pen-and-pencil set, his
partner and financial backer filed for the patent, somehow
forgetting to include Volk's name.
</P>
<P>
   Was it his fault that nobody grasped the utter necessity of the
Double-Sided Garbage Can Washing Machine? It could wash two cans at
once!
</P>
<P>
   Volk's supreme achievement was Morgen's Restaurant at 141 West
38th Street, which he ran from 1947 until 1985, when he sold it. It
was a beehive of designers, fashion tycoons, models and hangers-on
who waited with showy impatience behind a red velvet rope until a
table was open. His wife, Audrey, attired in the latest Bill Blass
_ never, but never, bought for list price _ acted as an elegant
ringmaster.
</P>
<P>
   The menu was immense and printed each day. Its audacity was
apparent in its characterization of chicken soup: ``essence of
young fowl with matzo balls.'' Offerings ranged from duckling
Montmorency, half a duck served with cherry sauce and sweet potato
pudding, to Gedampfte rinderbrust, a staggering slab of boiled
meat.
</P>
<P>
   Volk came from a glorious background, at least from the view
point of those in love with New York legends, however embellished.
His grandfather, Sussman Volk, claimed to have introduced pastrami
to the New World at his Delancey Street delicatessen. His father,
Jacob, claimed to have won his home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in a
card game with Mayor James J. (Jimmy) Walker. Jacob Volk also
claimed to have invented the wrecking ball, prompting James Thurber
to call him ``a house wrecker of herculean mythology'' in The New
Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Sussman Volk was born in the Bensonhurst house on Sept. 5, 1919.
His father died when he was 9, and when he was 12, his vivid life
blossomed magically when he was sent out West for a year to a ranch
to learn cowboy skills, which he would never again use.
</P>
<P>
   Volk met his wife, Audrey Morgen, after she read a letter he had
written to his sister, who also lived in her Manhattan apartment
building. At the time, he was studying business at the University
of West Virginia, where he was 1939 shag dancing champion, but
still eventually graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Morgen had never read such a poetic, completely
no-nonsense letter from a young man. ``I knew enough to know that
this was somebody who could make life very, very important,'' she
said. ``He never had a chance of escaping.''
</P>
<P>
   She traded an introduction to one of her cousins for an
introduction to Sussman Volk. She and their daughters, Patricia
Volk Blitzer of Manhattan and JoAnn Lederman of Miami; five
grandchildren and three great-grandsons survive him.
</P>
<P>
   Volk went to work in his father-in-law's restaurant business
that included three restaurants, all named Morgen's.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants were all sold after World War II, and left to
his own devices, Volk turned to invention, including the
Illuminated Fender Guide. It looked like a knitting needle and
lighted up at the push of a button, allowing a motorist to gauge
distances when parking a car in the dark. He actually made some
money on this one, his daughter, Patricia, said.
</P>
<P>
   The war years saw the frozen-food store , and Volk also started
a bakery, among other things. He got a job doing advertising for
the General Refrigeration Co. as a result of his frozen food
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Volk and Robert Morgen, Volk's brother-in-law,
returned to the restaurant business. Morgen eventually operated
Morgen's East on the East Side of Manhattan, while Volk ran
Morgen's West in the garment district. After Morgen's East closed,
Morgen's West became simply Morgen's.
</P>
<P>
   Volk never stopped inventing things, including a device to keep
adjacent washers and dryers from rattling, which was used only in
his own home. He made metal sculptures in a studio he shared with
the actor Zero Mostel, who also painted.
</P>
<P>
   Volk made a career of the New York knack known as schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seemed to think he was their best friend,'' Volk
said. ``Anybody he touched was very happy. It's a known fact.''

   Montoya edges Andretti in Michigan 500
</P>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Seeing who was in the lead between Juan
Montoya and Michael Andretti for the final 15 laps of the Michigan
500 depended on when you blinked.
</P>
<P>
   An amazing back-and-forth battle for the lead came down to a
side-by-side sprint to the checkered flag off the final turn Sunday
as Montoya edged Andretti by .04 seconds, which was less than half
a car length.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third-closest finish in CART history and the first
time a Toyota-powered car won a 500-mile event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race ended the same way it started, with me playing with
Mike because he races very clean,'' Montoya said. ``He would pass
me, and I would pass him back, and it just kept going like that. It
was all about timing and who could cross the (finish) line first.''
</P>
<P>
   Official lead changes only come at the start-finish line, but
Montoya and Andretti traded the front spot 20 times in the last 15
laps, including three times on the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti edged ahead of Montoya at the start of the last lap
before Montoya moved back to the front in turn 2. Andretti used the
draft to slingshot past Montoya in turn 3, but Montoya moved
outside and made it a side-by-side duel into turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   The two cars almost touched wheels as they headed for the line,
but Montoya was quickly catching up to the lapped car of Tarso
Marques directly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Marques) up there,'' Montoya said. ``I told myself,
`I'm not going to lift. If I have to hit the guy, I will hit
him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The draft from Marques' car was just enough to pull Montoya
slightly ahead of Andretti as they crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't put a piece of paper between our wheels on that
last turn,'' Andretti said. ``We just kept leapfrogging out there,
and it was a shootout at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to who got lucky with Marques and who got behind
him. Marques stayed high, and Juan got a suction from him. That was
the difference. We had a perfect day, except for the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Dario Franchitti finished third, Patrick Carpentier was fourth,
and Helio Castroneves finished fifth. Sixth-place Adrian Fernandez
and seventh-place Paul Tracy were the other two drivers who
finished on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the second CART win of the season for Montoya in the
Target Toyota/Lola. The defending CART FedEx champion moved up to
fifth in the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go to a lot races to see a finish like that one,''
said Target team owner Chip Ganassi. ``I have no fingernails left.
It was really something to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti's runner-up finish in the Texaco Ford/Lola moved him to
the lead in the points race, placing him 14 points ahead of Roberto
Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 45,000 saw 52 lead changes among 11 drivers on the
2-mile oval. But the unofficial lead changes were a record 162
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya has won both 500-mile events in American open-wheel
racing this season, including his victory in the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended early for defending champion Tony Kanaan, who had
problems with the engine cooling system in the Hollywood
Mercedes/Reynard and was the first car to leave the event after 70
laps. Kanaan was returning after missing four races with a broken
arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some technical problems, and the water temperature was
too high,'' Kanaan said. ``We didn't want to risk anything. I could
have hurt myself and hurt the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad to be back. I had a dream (Saturday night) that
we would win this race, but right now my arm is much better than my
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brack, who led for 18 laps early in the race, was the
victim of the first accident of the day on lap 98. Brack was
running third and had a run on Christian Fittipaldi going outside
as he exited turn 2.
</P>
<P>
   But Fittipaldi drifted up the track and pinched Brack's car
against the wall, sending pieces of Brack's Shell Ford/Reynard
flying across the track.
</P>
<P>
   Brack was not injured, but he was furious when he left the
infield care center and took a few minutes to compose himself
before talking about the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a place like this, you run side-by-side and can't get away
from each other,'' Brack said. ``It's very important to leave room
for other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went outside, and (Fittipaldi) didn't leave room for me. I
don't know if he didn't see me. Maybe his mirror fell off or his
spotters didn't tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittipaldi's day ended with 29 laps to go when he spun on the
backstretch after bumping teammate Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno entered the race as the CART FedEx points leader, but he
parked his Visteon Ford/Reynard in the garage on lap 104 and
finished 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a handling problem today,'' Moreno said. ``Racing is
like this with ups and downs. But we'll back and still contending
for the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie driver Alex Tagliani was leading the race on lap 158 when
he spun coming out of turn 4 and slammed into the wall with the
rear of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a bump on the track that I didn't know was there,''
Tagliani said. ``I'm very sorry for the entire team, because we had
a great car today, and we could have won.''

   They can put a man on the moon, but they couldn't figure out how
to cool the new Challenger Learning Center in Peoria during its
grand opening Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the staff alluded to the heat caused by keeping the doors
open to accommodate more than 8,000 visitors who passed through the
center, the 43rd and largest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CO2 levels in here are rising in here, so please keep
moving,'' said Ann Urich, a flight director, referring to the
carbon dioxide coming from the crowd's breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors fanned themselves with brochures and drank water
bottles provided by Cox Communications, a sponsor of the center
that honors the seven astronauts who died in the shuttle explosion
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, not everyone seemed bothered by the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Venable, 6, of Phoenix, was too focused on the portrait
of himself being drawn by NASA space artist Bob McCall, a Paradise
Valley resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves to draw and he wants to go to the moon someday,''
mother Dawna Venable explained.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors were treated to a day of activities, including robot
demonstrations, Hubble Telescope photographs, and talks by a former
astronaut and family members of the Challenger crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very proud that this is a legacy to my daughter,''
said Grace Corrigan, mother of Christa McAuliffe, a junior high
school history teacher who planned to broadcast lessons from space.
Lines formed to use or tour the remote-controlled land rover, space
modules and mission control room.

A'S STOP ANGELS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND -- It was a summertime re-run for the Angels Sunday
afternoon, their 5-0 loss to the Oakland A's not much different
than their loss to the A's on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   What made the two losses similar was the way the Angels were
beaten -- by a young, left-handed starter that kept the Angel
hitters off balance and frustrated them into swinging at pitchers'
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it was 22-year-old Barry Zito who shut the Angels down
for five innings in a 10-3 A's win. Sunday, 22-year-old Mark Mulder
threw 7 2/3 shutout innings before 19,456 at the Oakland Coliseum
as the A's took two of three in the series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time the Angels have been shut out this season,
all three coming on the road (Tampa Bay, Seattle, Oakland).
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Angels lost a series was June 27-29, when the
Mariners took two of three in Seattle. The win Sunday moved the A's
ahead of the Angels by a game in the wild-card race and four games
behind first-place Seattle in the A.L. West. The Angels fell five
games out.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could not get anything going against Mulder (6-6), as
only one baserunner even reached third base. When the Angels did
have a runner in scoring position, they were 0 for 5. In the last
two games, the Angels are 2 for 13 with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really need is getting guys attacking the ball with
runners in scoring position,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.
``It comes in spurts. We're a very good offensive team. With the
expectations you have, you have to know there are going to be times
when you don't hit. That's why you talk about playing little
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are now 12-14 in games when facing a left-handed
starter, and they're set to face three more lefties in the upcoming
series against the Rangers (Kenny Rogers, Darren Oliver and Matt
Perisho).
</P>
<P>
   No Angel hitter is struggling against lefties more than
right-handed hitting Tim Salmon. Salmon went 1 for 4 against Mulder
Sunday to raise his average vs. lefties to .174 (16 for 92).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's seven lefties in eight days,'' Salmon correctly
noted. ``It shouldn't be a concern but ... Those were two pretty
good lefties. They both had a good curveball, a good fastball.
They're all good in their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know by the record it looks like we have trouble against
lefties,'' Scioscia said. ``But our (left-handed hitters)
historically hit them well. We feel confident lining up against
anybody. For some reason, lefties have given us trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's didn't have any trouble with Angels starter Ken Hill
(5-6). Ex-Angel Randy Velarde hit a two-run homer on a hanging
split-finger in the first inning. Miguel Tejada hit a pitch out of
the strikezone for an RBI single in the third inning. Jason Giambi
had a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning, and he homered off Al
Levine in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, he pitched behind in the count too much,'' Scioscia
said of Hill. ``His pitch count was very high and that's something
we haven't seen from Kenny in his last three or four outings.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill made 101 pitches and lasted only 4 1/3 innings while giving
up four runs and 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just battling every inning,'' Hill said. ``But most of
the balls they hit weren't strikes. They know I'm going to be
around the plate.''

WASHBURN GOES ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND -- The Angels found a spot in the starting rotation for
Scott Schoeneweis, but it came at the expense of Jarrod Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, who is 6-2 with a 3.87 ERA in 13 starts, was placed on
the 15-day disabled list Sunday with a strained left biceps muscle.
The Angels called up reserve infielder Justin Baughman to replace
Washburn on the roster, but Schoeneweis will be activated from the
DL to start Wednesday's game in Washburn's spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``His start Friday, there was a little question if he could make
it,'' manager Mike Scioscia said of Washburn. ``He felt it
yesterday and again today. He'll miss a start but we'll see after
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn has a history of strained muscles. He missed seven
weeks last season with a strained oblique muscle and injured it
again during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's mechanics are perfect,'' Scioscia said. ``But he has
to be better with his mechanics on a consistent basis. He has a
tendency not to finish (his follow-through). When you get out of
sync the stress has to go somewhere. Usually it's the arm. He's on
a constant maintainance program with (pitching coach) Buddy
(Black).''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia would have liked to get one more rehab start out of
Schoeneweis, who went on the DL June 17 with a strained rib-cage
muscle. But he pitched well in his last rehab start, throwing only
79 pitches over seven innings and allowing one unearned run and two
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Angel second baseman Randy Velarde went 8 for 14 in the
three-game series against the Angels during the weekend. He's
hitting .351 (13 for 37) against them this season, and is hitting
.368 (18 for 49) against them since the trade last July 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to expect any ex-Angel player to come back and haunt
us,'' Tim Salmon said. ``It's not a reflection on anything or
anybody, but for whatever reason they feel comfortable against us.
He seemed to come up with some big hits against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon is hitting .262 overall this season, 29 points below his
.291 lifetime average entering the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking every day for something to get me locked in,'' he
said. ``I thought I had a good day Friday (3 for 4) and two at-bats
(Saturday), then all of a sudden I lost it. Personally, I'm looking
for something to get me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said Troy Glaus will not take Salmon's spot as the
cleanup hitter, though Scioscia and his coaches have thought about
flip-flopping No. 3 hitter Mo Vaughn and Salmon.

HALL ADDS THREE FROM '75 SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. - Tony Perez remembered never seeing Sparky
Anderson so worried after following his manager down the dugout
runway late in Game 7 of the 1975 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds were devastated from the night before when
catcher Carlton Fisk kept the series alive with a dramatic home run
and in this game trailed the Boston Red Sox 3-0 in the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me what was wrong,'' Anderson said. ``I said, 'Did
you notice we lost last night and are losing again?' He just looked
at me and said, 'The game is still young.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the beauty for the 40,000 fans who assembled here
on a sunny Sunday afternoon to see Fisk, Perez and Anderson
inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame. They know the game is still
young no matter how old the players get. In one striking moment a
quarter-century before, Perez came up, and like Fisk the night
before, hit a home run that turned around what most believe was the
greatest Series ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Even on Sunday's momentous occasion, Fisk looked haunted when
asked why he called for a blooper pitch by Bill Lee. All those
years had passed, but Fisk said quietly, ``We had gotten a lot of
guys out with that pitch. As great as I felt the night before, I
was that down after Tony's home run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds went on to win and the lives of Fisk, Perez and
Anderson were changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's home run made him a hero in his native New England even
though he played 20 more years and caught more games than any
catcher in history. The Red Sox have not won a World Series since
1918.
</P>
<P>
   After two earlier tries in the '70s, Anderson had brought
Cincinnati its first title since 1940. He actually was fired four
seasons later and managed 17 years with the Detroit Tigers,
finishing with three championships and the third most victories by
a manager (2,194).
</P>
<P>
   Although Perez drove in 90 runs seven consecutive seasons and is
18th all-time with 1,652 RBI, that home run truly was historic,
shifting the momentum back to the Reds, who won in the ninth inning
on an RBI single by Joe Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   If Cincinnati had lost that series, there might never have been
a Big Red Machine. Free agency was looming and rather than give
Perez a contract extension, the Reds traded him to Montreal three
months after repeating in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's induction also included Reds broadcaster Marty
Brennaman, who drew the biggest cheer when he said he wished
baseball would one day admit banished banished Pete Rose into the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of Negro League star Turkey Stearnes said she hoped
the game would not overlook the forgotten players of her husband's
generation who played before baseball was integrated.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, this induction was about Fisk, Perez and
Anderson. A record 45 Hall of Famers, including former Dodgers
manager Tom Lasorda, attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance speeches varied greatly - Fisk's long and
reflective, Perez's short and upbeat, Sparky's off the cuff like a
midsummer visit to the manager's office. All agreed the 1975 World
Series is the moment people have remembered most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there anything better than that?'' said Fisk, who was
introduced last and spoke for a record 47 minutes. ``Yeah, this. It
has been so overwhelming, better than I could have imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston fans, who often booed ``Pudge'' Fisk for bolting to the
Chicago White Sox in 1980, taking advantage of a technicality in
his contract, helped him through several emotional spots in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk talked about his father, Cecil, who was in the crowd, ``and
how good was never good enough.'' Fisk paused and the words hung in
the air until a fan broke the silence by yelling, ``We love you,
Pudge.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson quickly ditched his prepared comments, saying, ``When I
use notes, I can't speak.'' He thanked former Reds general manager
Bob Howsam for ``giving a 35-year-old coach of the San Diego Padres
a chance.''
</P>

RADIO STATION ABANDONS AIRWAVES FOR INTERNET'S WIDER REACH &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ San Fernando Valley listeners heard equal parts
static and ``world class rock'' when they tuned into KACD out of
Santa Monica, on the other side of the mountains that divide Los
Angeles, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Now the station, known as Channel 103.1, is crystal clear from
Canoga Park to Katmandu. It's becoming the first broadcaster in
history to leave the airwaves to become an Internet-only outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only disappointing aspect of it is, people won't be able
to hear us in their cars,'' said Program Director Nicole Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 103.1 will lose its FM signal sometime in the next month
or two, a casualty of a corporate merger and FCC regulations. But
Friday afternoon, Channel1031.com and WorldClassRock.com began
offering unlimited feeds with the same audio that's going out over
the airwaves, with the station's Adult Album Alternative format
that includes Van Morrison, Bonnie Raitt, Bob Marley and Lyle
Lovett.
</P>
<P>
   Since it went on the air in October 1998, the station has always
had a weak signal, but a strong following. The ratings were low,
but the listeners were exactly the type advertisers crave. And
Clear Channel Communications, KACD's parent company, didn't want to
lose them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience of this station is pretty upscale,'' the kind
receptive to advertising by Mercedes Benz, airlines and brokerage
firms, said Charlie Rahilly, Clear Channel's vice president of
sales in Los Angeles. ``It's a pretty highly wired crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the station reaches about 400,000 listeners a week, 80
percent of whom also use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a great chance to see if we could forward some
of those 400,000 people to the Web,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But now instead of the audience listening in cars, the staff
hopes to get them tuning in _ or, more precisely, dialing up _ the
station at home or the office. The Dave Matthews Band can play in
the background while they're doing other work on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But drive-time enjoyment of the station's signature sound may be
back soon, on wireless Internet car radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you're really going to have pervasive wireless
Internet, and in that environment, radio is really the killer
app,'' Rahilly said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Association of Broadcasters, a
Washington- based industry group with 7,500 member stations, no
other station has gone directly from the airwaves to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And Clear Channel hopes to spread the popularity of the niche
station around the country, if not the world. Clear Channel owns
850 radio stations nationwide, and will promote Channel 103.1 on
those, and also owns Eller Media, one of the nation's largest
billboard companies, Sandler said. In addition, it has an interest
in XM Radio, a satellite radio company that plans to begin beaming
100 channels of music to subscribers' cars by next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we imagined some crazy notion, Let's back
ourselves into a corner with something that's never coming,'' said
Andy Chanley, KACD's morning disc jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it will be harder to have us on your alarm clock so
you can wake to music. Clearly it will be hard to have your
personal computer in your shower,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though listeners may find it inconvenient right now to listen to
the station on their home computers, Sandler said, ``we'll be here
when the technology catches up. The alternative is to go away
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The KACD studio bulletin board features ads for companies
offering wireless Internet radio hardware. On one Sandler scrawled,
``See _ it's coming!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have a new life, and it's exciting. The timing just
happens to be right,'' she said. ``A year ago, this would've been
way too early.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Clear Channel merged with another huge radio
chain, AMFM. But that gave Clear Channel three more stations in the
Los Angeles market than the maximum of eight the Federal
Communications Commission allows.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel sold KACD and its sister station at the same
frequency, KBCD, for $85million to Entravision, a Spanish-language
broadcast company. When those plans are finalized in the next few
weeks, ``Brown-Eyed Girl'' will be replaced by ``Besame Mucho.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel is also selling KXMX-FM (95.90) and KEZY-AM
(1190), both in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time down this path for Sandler, but this time
the road has a twist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 she was program director at KSCA, an Adult Album
Alternative station that was owned by Gene Autry. To the chagrin of
the station's loyal fans, the singing cowboy sold it to a company
that changed the format to Latino music.
</P>
<P>
   WorldClassRock.com will help KSCA live on, though. Soon the Web
site will feature an archive of ``Studio C'' sessions, live
performances at KACD by more than 100 performers including Sting,
Melissa Etheridge, Randy Newman, Tori Amos and Warren Zevon. And
Sandler said they hope soon to also offer archives of ``Music
Hall'' _ similar performances at KSCA.
</P>
<P>
   Chanley noted another benefit of going Internet-only _ ``You
don't have to do the Emergency Broadcast System anymore. I hate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The KACD staff may be unsure what the Internet afterlife will
offer, but previous L.A. stations have died and found heaven on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   KNAC was a hard-core heavy metal station located in Long Beach
at 105.5 on the FM dial, until _ there seems to be a trend here _ a
company bought it and turned it into a Spanish-language station.
KNAC went off the air in 1995, and reappeared three years later as
KNAC.com, ``The loudest dot-com on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we're much bigger than we ever were as an FM
station. It's mathematics,'' said KNAC.com founder Rob Jones. ``It
gives us the ability to broadcast to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   GrooveRadio.com is carrying on the format of techno and house
dance music that once played on KACD, before Clear Channel bought
it.
</P>
<P>
   Upon launching the broadcast site in January, Swedish Egil,
founder and disc jockey of GrooveRadio.com, said, ``I thought maybe
at first it would be a bummer, sort of stepping down. But it's been
exactly the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Egil said his site offers lists of songs that have been played
and when, links to rate or buy the records, a chat room that he
compared with ``listening to 20 request lines at once,'' cameras
showing live shots of the DJs, news about artists, and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   KNAC and Groove Radio were off the air for years before
reappearing on the Web. With an uninterrupted transition to the
Internet and the marketing muscle of a huge company behind them,
KACD staff members said they can replicate those pioneers' success,
and expand on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``More power to them,'' Jones said. ``It works for us, and I
certainly hope it works for them.''

AUSTRALIAN WINS SURFING EVENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. _ For decades Australian and American
surfers have been fierce competitors with the two sides critical of
styles and approach. But in recent years, the intensity of such
talk has waned.
</P>
<P>
   That is until Sunday when Australian Michael ``Mick'' Campbell
and American Sunny Garcia created a rivalry revival.
</P>
<P>
   After belittling American surfers as pathetic in an Australian
surfing magazine, Campbell won the top American surfing event, the
Bluetorch Pro, by beating the top American surfer, Sunny Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   With 40,000 fans sitting on the sand and lining Huntington Beach
Pier, the only thing missing was good waves. Campbell and Garcia
made their own waves after the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say what you want in this world, freedom of speech,
and people are going to take it (differently),'' Campbell said of
his comments in the surf magazine. ``There's nothing like a bit of
a healthy rivalry and if people can't handle it, they shouldn't be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia almost made Campbell eat his words, losing 19.60 to
19.00. Garcia even had a final ride as the horn sounded, needing a
4.86 to win. But the wave wasn't big enough to get the last word as
the judges gave Garcia a 3.75.
</P>
<P>
   So Garcia made his statement after the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take that straight to heart,'' said Garcia of Campbell's
label of American surfers. ``For him to say all Americans are
pathetic, that's saying that I'm pathetic. I saw him at the
Pipeline and that's pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're all pathetic I would hate to see what he sees in the
morning when he looks in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   With the win, Campbell earned $15,000 and moved up to fourth
place from sixth in the overall standings on the World Championship
Tour. Campbell dedicated his win to Andrew Murphy, a longtime
friend who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the top-ranked surfer on the tour, extended his overall
tour lead. The 14-year veteran is trying to win his first tour
title. While Garcia won $7,000 less, the final was more about
bragging rights between two very different surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, at 5-foot-9 and 150 pounds, is a flamboyant,
devil-may-care-type with long blond hair. Garcia, at 5-10 190
pounds, is a firey, hard-driver with short black hair.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell downplayed his comments saying that they were just a
way to get an edge on his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stirring the pot, a big old stir get's them all worked up and
they hate me,'' Campbell said. ``When they go out and surf against
me, they can't surf because they hate me so much. I'm out there
cruising and they are falling off stressing about me. It's reverse
psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who had been surfing well heading into the finals, did
have his problems in the final heat. He lost his balance and fell
in the middle of one ride that could have won him the contest.
</P>
<P>
   When he needed to make up ground in the final moments, the waves
weren't big enough to produce a good score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a couple of mistakes,'' Garcia said. ``I fell on a
couple of waves. I felt like I was the better surfer, in fact I
know that I was the better surfer. I just came up a little bit
short.''
</P>
<P>
   The two surfers couldn't see each other during the final because
they tried to catch waves in different locations. Garcia spent his
time just south of the pier while Campbell was about 100 yards
further south.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, from Hawaii, was clearly the crowd favorite, receiving
cheers for most of his runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me,'' Campbell of facing the highly regarded
Garcia in front a home crowd. ``I've got a lot of respect for
Sunny. I don't know if he has a lot of respect for me but what goes
around comes around.''

   Tribute to Haley
</P>
<P>
   Part of Sunday's events was the Jack Haley Memorial Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Haley was a local surfing legend who died of cancer on
March 25. Haley was the first champion of a an open event at
Huntington Beach in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing in the heat were David Nuuhwia, L.J. Richards, Tom
Hermstad and Don Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Nuuhwia, credited with revolutionizing surfing in the late 1960s
and 1970s by using smaller boards. He hasn't surfed in a year but
looked right at home riding the waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes back,'' said Nuuhwia who celebrated his 52nd
birthday on Sunday. ``You never forget after surfing for 45
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Huntington Beach was much different when Nuuhwia first came on
the scene in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huntington was just a little town,'' Nuuhwia said. ``There
were 20 guys that surfed.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years ago as Nuuhwia was starting, Haley was already a
surfing icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a legend here in Huntington Beach before I came here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richards won the U.S. Open in 1963. The biggest difference in
surfing today for him is the money involved and the ``high- tech''
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, who grew up surfing in Oceanside, still tries to surf
every other day in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started when I was 13,'' said Richards, 60. ``It was the
heart and soul of my whole existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards lives in Carlsbad. He is a retired lifeguard and still
works for the Encinitas Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Nuuhwia now lives in Garden Grove and works for Greyhound Expo,
a convention planning company that is helping to set up the
Democratic National Convention at the Los Angeles Convention
Center.
