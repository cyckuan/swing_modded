<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Weapons Sold to Greece, Turkey Transferred to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States sold weapons
to Greece and Turkey, and they in turn transferred them to their
respective allies on Cyprus in an effort to outpower each other on
the divided island, the State Department admitted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Both Greece and Turkey sent U.S.-origin military items to
Cyprus in contravention of the commitments they made to the United
States," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he was unable to identify the types of weaponry
involved.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has had to make an investigation
into the matter since May 1998 and submitted a classified report
to Congress last Friday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the investigation, "we have asked Greece and
Turkey to withdraw certain U.S.-origin equipment from Cyprus,"
Rubin said. "Both governments agreed to do so and have informed us
that the items of concern have been removed."
</P>
<P>
The United States often sold weaponry to feuding countries to
make big profit.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Fires 120 Cops for Taking Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian police force
has fired over 120 policemen since January 1998 for taking bribes,
a senior police officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Closing a three-month training course at the a police college
in Zanzibar, Adadi Rajabu, director of Criminal Investigation,
said the policemen's inappropriate behavior of soliciting and
receiving bribes has tarnished the image of Tanzanian police
force.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu, who attended the ceremony on behalf of Tanzania's
General Inspector of Police Omari Mahita, promoted 115 police
constables to the rank of corporal as they have successfully
completed the course, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Although the police force has been mentioned by the 1997
Warioba Corruption Report as one of the bribery taking state
organs, Rajabu said, police should work hard to win people's
trust.
</P>
<P>
Apart from dismissing these 120 policemen, the police has also
transferred 132 officers from one section to another within the
police force, including 89 from the highly criticized traffic
section and the rest from the Criminal Investigation Department.
</P>
<P>
Recently the Tanzania police force has severely punished eight
officers involved in corruption scandals, including demoting four
of them and suspending the rest from duty, said Rajabu.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rajabu praised policemen for their dedication
despite difficult working conditions, promising that excellent
police officers who stick to code of conduct and regulations will
be awarded.

<HEADLINE> Barak Prefers Shas to Likud in Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- In a most noticeable
announcement since he started forming a new government, Israeli
Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak said on Monday he prefers the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party to the right-wing Likud as a coalition
partner.
</P>
<P>
After making the announcement at a meeting with representatives
of the left-wing Meretz, which has signed a coalition agreement
with Barak's Labor-led One Israel alliance, Barak informed interim
Likud leader Ariel Sharon of his preference, according to Israeli
television reports.
</P>
<P>
The Likud and Shas are the second and the third largest party
in the 120-member parliament after the Labor-led One Israel. In
the May elections, Likud plunged from 32 seats to 19, while Shas
jumped from 10 to 17.
</P>
<P>
With a view to materializing his promise to build a government
as broad-based as possible in order to move forward the peace
process and heal the internal rift in the country, Barak has been
courting various parties in the parliament with a record number of
15 factions.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Shas, a religious party of Jews with Middle
East backgrounds, might agree to join Barak's coalition although
it is unhappy that Barak has granted the portfolio of the interior
ministry to the Russian immigrants' party Yisrael Ba'aliya.
</P>
<P>
Shas has controlled the interior ministry for almost 15 years,
a key position which has helped it develop religious schools and
welfare networks, which in return brought wide support to the
party from low-income Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael b'Aliya was among the first parties that have signed
coalition agreements with Barak. The other two are the National
Religious Party, champion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
and Meretz.
</P>
<P>
But Meretz has to decide if it stays in the coalition after
Barak picked Shas as a ruling partner. The party has been strongly
opposed to sitting in the same government with Shas, which it
accuses of ignoring the rule of law and attempting to control the
country's public life.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected party Shinui, a secular movement with a
platform of objecting to what it calls religious-coercion, will
stay definitely out of the coalition if Shas is included.
</P>
<P>
The Center Party, led by former defense minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, and the United Torah Judaism, an ultra-Orthodox party
of European Jews, are both close to joining the government.
</P>
<P>
If Shas finally joins the government and Meretz stays, then
Barak will have a coalition of more than 75 seats.
</P>
<P>
Even if Meretz chooses to stay out, it will continue to
support the government from the outside, Meretz leader Yossi Sarid
promised to Barak.
</P>
<P>
Suffering a humiliating loss in the parliamentary election last
month, Likud members have been at odds over whether to join the
government. Sharon has become more and more isolated for his
position in favor of joining the government.
</P>
<P>
Also, there has been strong opposition inside the One Israel to
the inclusion of the hard-line Likud, saying the Likud will stand
in the way of the Middle East peace process that Barak has pledged
to revive.

<HEADLINE> Angola Starts Self-Help Program to Fend Off Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Angola's central Huambo province
which witnessed the most fierce fight in the war-ravaged country
has started a self-help program to fend off the grim food crisis
since humanitarian relief from outside the country has become
increasingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Cassoma, governor of Huambo, has announced an emergency
agricultural production program to alleviate food supply to the
province.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angola News Agency, the program, estimated to
cost 1.8 million U.S. dollars, is aimed to mobilize local
residents to plant potatoes on about 74,500 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war renewed in December of last year, over
170,000 refugees have swarmed to the province, putting much
pressure to the relief work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, constant shellings by the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has halted international
humanitarian relief efforts in the area.
</P>
<P>
At present, the food reserve in the province has dried up,
giving rise to rampant mal-nutrition.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that in Ukama, in Huambo province, some
18,000 hungry refugees are forced to turn to rats and wild fruits
for a living, as they have run out of food supply after UNITA
forces cut off roads to the town.

<HEADLINE> S.African Minister Defends Labor Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Labour market regulations
introduced over recent years did not inhibit job creation, South
African Labor Minister Membathisi Mdladlana said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a debate on President Thabo Mbeki's
state-of-the- nation address, Mdladlana said he also remained
unconvinced that increased deregulation or wage flexibility would
create more employment in the South African economy.
</P>
<P>
"There is sufficient evidence to show that sub-wage depression
and the removal of regulations will not solve the problem of
unemployment that we face," he said, quoted by South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that significant sectors of the economy no
longer lend themselves to labor intensive methods.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing the ability to hire or fire workers or driving down
wages in such sections will not necessarily create jobs,"
Mdladlana said.
</P>
<P>
It would rather tend to create a more adversarial climate not
conducive to productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
A recent study showed that in Western economies there was no
clear link between employment protection laws and increased jobs.
</P>
<P>
Instead it argued that tight regulation ensured more stable
jobs, less labor turnover and few unemployed.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of the working population in South Africa
are unemployed, and youths unemployment remained unacceptably
high, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
Mdladlana said he intended to release a 15-point labor plan
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will seek to put in place a labor market dispensation that
will encourage youth employment while minimizing the displacement
effects."
</P>
<P>
Turning to the small business sector as an important area of
employment growth, the minister said he would continue to seek
ways of facilitating the needs of small businesses and ensure they
could continue to generate employment while simultaneously
protecting the rights of the workers they employed.
</P>
<P>
One of the main causes of South Africa's economic woes was the
low level of skills in an environment that was increasingly
experiencing major change in the workplace and a reliance on
methods requiring more skills.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 percent of the economically active population was
skilled or highly skilled and the country's skills profile
compared poorly with other middle income countries.
</P>
<P>
An active skills formation strategy was essential for raising
productivity, increasing the output of goods and services,
reducing unit labour costs, raising profits and employment.
</P>
<P>
"My department is committed to ensure that in the next five
years, firstly the skills of the work force are upgraded to meet
the challenges of globalization and changes in the nature of
production.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, that skills are provided which can facilitate
infrastructural delivery and the development of micro, small and
medium scale enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly that the level of investment in education and training
is increased and there is an improved return on this investment
and fourthly, that as a result the employment prospects of youth,
rural women and other vulnerable sectors of the community are
enhanced," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Peaceful Solution to Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
Monday called for a peaceful solution to the Kashmir dispute
between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal during his meeting with Pakistani Minister
of Kashmir Affairs Abdul Majeed Malik, who was on a three-day
visit to Amman as a special envoy of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said measures must be taken to prevent the situation
from further exacerbation, which he said will pose a threat to the
peace and stability of the region and the world as well.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Malik conveyed a letter from Sharif to
Abdullah on the latest development of the Kashmir crisis and to
explain Pakistan's position on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Malik stressed the need for a
peaceful solution to the Kashmir crisis, but said his country
will not give up its rights of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the use of nuclear weapons will not be
adopted or even considered by Pakistan over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to directly rule out the possibilities of a
major conventional war between India and Pakistan if Indian
troops crossed the border.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing crisis started after Indian troops launched
campaigns to expel what New Delhi called Pakistan-backed intruders
out of the India-held part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Troops from both sides have been exchanging fire in Kashmir
over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan denied that it is militarily supporting those
guerrillas, saying it only gives moral support to those "freedom
fighters."
</P>
<P>
India has so far rejected Pakistan's proposals to hold talks,
saying no talks are possible before it expels all the intruders
out of its part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan, both of which exploded their first nuclear
weapons last year, fought three wars in the past half a century,
two over Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Scotland Racist, Anti-English </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Half of all people in Scotland
believe it is a racist nation and two-thirds say the biggest
problem is anti-English racism, according to a poll published on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey for the Daily Record tabloid found that 66 percent
of some 800 people questioned agreed that many people in Scotland
are anti-English.
</P>
<P>
Half of those questioned said they thought Scotland had an
overall racism problem. This is weeks after Scotland's top law
official said the nation's legal system suffered from
"institutional racism" against ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Scotland has normally viewed itself as a more tolerant society
than England, where there have been recent high-profile cases of
racism, most notably the 1993 racially-motivated murder of black
teenager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of whites, a Reuters report
said.
</P>
<P>
But comedian Connolly said over the weekend that Scots were
less tolerant than they thought, and blamed what he said was
growing anti-English feeling on the Scottish National Party (SNP),
which regularly polls about 30 percent in elections.
</P>
<P>
"It's entirely their fault, this new racism in Scotland, this
anti-Englishness," Connolly, known for his foul-mouthed stand-up
routines and more recently for film roles like Queen Victoria's
servant in "Mrs Brown" and a loan shark turned artist in "The Debt
Collector", was quoted as telling the Sunday Herald.
</P>
<P>
Advocates for ethnic minorities in Scotland responded to the
survey by saying that while anti-English feeling may exist, it is
the minorities who bear the brunt of real racism.

<HEADLINE> British, Irish PMs in Last-Ditch Fight to Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern fought on Monday to pull
Northern Ireland's troubled peace accord out of a persistent
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The two prime minister held talks again with the British
province's bitterly divided political parties, who were still
deadlocked over the issue of guerrilla disarmament and stalled
plans for a provincial government that Blair says must be in place
by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A row over plans by the pro-British Orange Order to hold a July
4 parade from the village of Drumcree through a Roman Catholic
enclave in the flashpoint town of Portadown has cast a cloud over
efforts to break the deadlock, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The parade is expected to take place a week before the climax
of the turbulent "marching season" when Protestants mark historic
battlefield victories over the Catholic Irish.
</P>
<P>
Blair intervened by meeting Orange Order organisers and Roman
Catholic objectors after breaking off from the peace talks at
around midday. But the prospects looked bleak.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, the province's first minister and a key
pro-British Unionist leader, said earlier that he thought "fair
and reasonable" proposals were being struck over Drumcree. But Mac
Cionnaith's comments dimmed hopes of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the British and Irish leaders heralds a fateful
three days for the province, marking the resumption of talks begun
last Friday when they won backing from the feuding parties for key
principles they hope will break the logjam.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army (IRA), told reporters: "We should
not, any of us, underestimate the seriousness of this last
critical stage of the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Unionist parties refuse to sit with Sinn Fein in the assembly
until the IRA hands over its weapons, despite Sinn Fein's
statement that it is striving for disarmament but cannot coerce
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Trimble wanted a straight answer from the Republicans, saying
"what we want to hear from them clearly, unequivocally with no ifs
and no buts is that the Republican movement, not just Sinn Fein,
accept they have an obligation to (disarm) and that they are going
to do so within the timescale set out in the agreement."
</P>
<P>
"If they do not accept this principle, then clearly there is
nothing to talk about," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair has put forward a formula that could pave the way for
Sinn Fein to enter government before the IRA disarms. But he says
the guerrillas must pledge to hand in arms by May 2000 or else the
cabinet would cease to exist.

<HEADLINE> France Concerned About U.S. Congress Report on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The French government is concerned
about a recent U.S. Congress report on religious cults in Europe,
which criticized European countries for persecuting illegal
religious cults, said the daily Le Monde on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United States Secretary of State Madelein Albright raised
the issue of ``persecution of religious cults'' with the French
government during her stay in Paris earlier this month, said Le
Monde.
</P>
<P>
The move by Albright has caused great concern of the French
Foreign Ministry, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department published recently a report by a U.S.
Congress commission on ``religious freedom'' abroad, which
fingerpointed France several times for launching investigations
against cult groups.
</P>
<P>
The French parliament has established a commission specializing
in investigating illegal cults in France.
</P>
<P>
The commission, created by the U.S. Congress in 1997, has asked
the U.S. government to exert pressure through diplomatic channel
on foreign countries, including the allies of the United States,
over what it called ``problems of religious freedom.''
</P>
<P>
The recommendations came out after the U.S. Congress adopted a
law on international religious freedom on October 27, 1998, which
threatens to impose sanctions by the U.S. against the countries
which Washington judges have violated religious freedom.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Call for Release of Arrested Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has rejected recent call of western countries and
international organizations for release of 13 Iranian Jews
arrested on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
"At present they are only suspects and no verdict has been
issued about them, therefore, any call for their release before
completion of judicial proceedings will not at all be acceptable
or justifiable," the Islamic Republic News Agency Monday quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks in letters to his counterparts of
several countries, the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) Azeddine Laraki and the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights Mary Robinson.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the arrest, the World Bank recently refused to
grant a 200-million-U.S.-dollar loan to two Iranian development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said the call for the suspects' release amounts to an
intervention to Iran's sovereignty but he assured a fair trial of
the suspects, who were accused of passing secret and military
information to the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and Israel denied any links between their
intelligence services and the arrested Iranian Jews and charged
that the arrest was politically motivated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reopens Embassies in Africa except One in Madagascar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States reopened five
of six embassies in Africa, but extended the temporary closure of
its embassy in Madagascar, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Of the six embassies closed last week, five -- Gambia, Togo,
Liberia, Namibia and Senegal -- all reopened today," one of the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to return to normal business in the five embassies
was made over the weekend after consultations among various U.S.
agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he would not give any specific reason as to the extension
of the closure of the embassy in Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
Another official said the government "just wants to make sure
the security measures that have been taken (to protect the embassy
in Madagascar) are adequate."
</P>
<P>
The closure of the six embassies was announced late last
Thursday as U.S. intelligence has got informations that Osama bin
Laden, an exiled Saudi millionaire suspected of bombing two U.S.
embassies in Africa last year, was in final stage of planning new
attacks against U.S. embassies in the continent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Strengthen Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
vowed Monday to strengthen Social Security and Medicare as the White
House projected that budget surpluses will be more than one
trillion dollars bigger over the next 15 years than were expected
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed setting aside an additional 543 billion
dollars for Social Security over the next 15 years, which he said
would assure the program's solvency until 2053.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed setting aside 794 billion dollars to
strengthen Medicare, including providing new prescription drug
benefits for the elderly. That is 108 billion dollars more than he
proposed in February, when he released his fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have a chance to do even more to use the fruits of our
prosperity today to strengthen our prospects for tomorrow,"
Clinton told reporters before he left for political fund-raisers
in New York and Conneticut.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan included no dramatic increases in the targeted
tax cuts he proposed earlier this year, but he did not rule out
considering deeper tax reductions in discussions with
congressional Republicans later this year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposal was expected to add new fuel to his budget
fight with Republicans lawmakers as the Congressional Budget
Office is planning to unveil its own projections.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration wants to use surpluses on Social
Security and Medicare while the Republican congressmen try to
return the money to tax-payers by cutting tax.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton also proposed to pay off the total national
debt of 5.7 trillion dollars by 2015.
</P>
<P>
"By 2015, this country can be entirely out of debt," Clinton
said, "if we do not squander the surplus by choosing short-term
gain over long-term national goals."
</P>
<P>
For the current fiscal year, Clinton government expects an
overall budget surplus of 99 billion dollars, the biggest ever
and 20 billion dollars more than it projected in February.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income Up While Spending Even Greater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal spending rose
even greater than their income's increase in May, according to the
Commerce Department's report Monday.
</P>
<P>
Personal income -- which includes wages, interest and
government benefits -- rose 0.4 percent last month while their
spending picked up 0.6 percent, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
Since consumer spending has repeatedly outpaced incomes, the
nation's savings rate has set a string of record lows this year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the savings rate fell to a minus 1.2 percent, even
worse than the previous record of minus 1.0 percent in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
Strong consumer spending propelled the nation's economic
growth, which increased at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the
first three months of this year. Consumer confidence, meanwhile,
is at a record high, despite the prospects that the Federal
Reserve will begin to raise short-term interest rates at its
meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
The 0.6 percent gain in spending in May followed gains of 0.5
percent in April, 0.6 percent in March, 0.9 percent in February
and 0.5 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods jumped 2.2 in May. That followed two
months of declines.
</P>
<P>
Spending on nondurable products, such as food and fuel, also
increased 0.5 percent while spending on services rose 0.3 percent
in May.
</P>
<P>
High demand for labor -- with labor shortages in some regions
and industries -- helped to boost wages. In May, wages rose 0.5
percent, following a 0.6 percent increase the previous month.
However, wages for farm proprietors dropped 13.8 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that one of the major reasons why
U.S.people have let their savings rate fall into negative
territory is because the stock market is at record highs, boosting
people's net worth and making them feel more comfortable about
dipping into savings to fund their spending spree.
</P>
<P>
The robust consumer spending has been the major factor pushing
up economic growth this year. With unemployment at the lowest
level in three decades, the Fed has begun to worry that tight
labor markets will soon increase wage pressures and lead to higher
inflation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Given Report on Health System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Review Commission into
the Health Sector presented its report Monday to President Robert
Mugabe after 18 months of research into the country's ailing
health delivery system.
</P>
<P>
Commission chairman Eleuther Tarimo said his team examined four
major areas of the health sector which included problems faced by
health services, human resources, organization and accountability
of services and the financing of the health services.
</P>
<P>
He said staff shortages and poor working conditions, shortages
of essential drugs and the general harsh economic environment had
crippled the country's health delivery system.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government was going to look at report
seriously so as to see how it could implement some of the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The president said the inadequacy of resources limited the
government's ability to implement all the recommendations that
were contained in the report.
</P>
<P>
It was important, he said, to have one generation after the
other adopting a health delivery system that could sustain
society.
</P>
<P>
New challenges came in the form of new diseases, new
circumstances, re- occurences of some diseases, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
"We have to try as much as possible to develop a health
delivery system that can sustain healthy families in our society,"
he said, adding that public health education was needed so that
inputs into the sector could have a greater effect.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member commission set up in January 1998 comprised of
officials from various health sectors.

<HEADLINE> FA Criticized over United Exemption Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Football Association chiefs came
under fire on Monday after offering holders Manchester United the
chance to pull out of next season's F.A. Cup to play in the new
World Team Cup.
</P>
<P>
United suggested they could skip the inaugural World Team Cup
in Brazil next January if their fixture commitments were not eased.
</P>
<P>
The F.A. responded on Sunday night by offering them exemption
from the F.A. Cup for one season. If United do not play, their
place in Brazil would go to the beaten European Cup finalists from
Germany, who are England's rivals to stage the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
But the offer angered the players' union, supporters' groups
and bookmakers who say the decision cheapens the 127-year-old F.A.
Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers'
Association, said United's exemption could prove "very damaging to
the status of the F.A. Cup, the world's premier knock-out cup
competition".
</P>
<P>
Andy Walsh, chairman of the Independent Manchester United
Supporters' Association, said: "This is more to do with world
football politics and pandering to Sepp Blatter."
</P>
<P>
Britain's largest bookmakers, William Hill, were infuriated by
the decision. Spokesman Graham Sharpe said: "This announcement has
thrown betting on the F.A. Cup -- one of the most popular of all
betting competitions -- into disarray.
</P>
<P>
But F.A. executive director David Davies countered: "We had an
unprecedented situation which demanded an unprecedented solution.
</P>
<P>
He added that United's closest rivals in the league last season,
Arsenal and Chelsea, had backed the F.A.'s stance.
</P>
<P>
United, who beat Bayern Munich in the European Cup final last
season following a domestic double of Cup and League triumphs, had
indicated they wanted a bye to the fourth round of the F.A. Cup
next season to ease fixture congestion.
</P>
<P>
They have yet to respond to the F.A.'s offer of complete
exemption but a spokesman said a statement was likely to be issued
by the club on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eight teams, which will include the champions of the seven FIFA
confederations and the Brazilian champions, are invited to take
part in the new competition which runs from January 5 to 14.

BANGKOK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is reinforcing its
efforts to push for a comprehensive land bridge project linking
Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, a senior Transport and Communication
Ministry official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Advisor to Transport and Communication Minister Vitoon Nambutr

The project, including a second bridge over the Mekong river,
will benefit not only the three countries but also other ASEAN
members, Vitoon said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are increasing signs that the project could
be implemented, as Thailand was steadily recovering from the
current economic crisis while international creditors, including
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), had offered
loans to support the project.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese International Cooperation Agency had also offered
a grant to support detailed survey and design of the project, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Denies Secret Deal With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said on Monday that his government was not making
any "secret deal" with Pakistan on ending the current conflict in
Kargil sector of Kashmir while Indian air force continued its
round-the-clock bombing on positions occupied by Pakistan
"intruders."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told an all party meeting here to discuss the Kagil
crisis that "nothing but complete and unconditional withdrawal of
intruders will satisfy our requirements."
</P>
<P>
He maintained that there would be no further dialogue so long
as the "incursion" continued, adding that "no proposals or
mediation by third parties will be accepted" by India.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry confirmed
Monday that Vajpayee and his Pakistan counterpart Nawaz Sharif had
exchanged messages on the Kargil situation earlier.
</P>
<P>
"These messages were in continuation of their telephonic
discussions of the past few weeks in this context," the spokesman
said at the daily briefing on the on-going conflict between the
two neighbors in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The official spokesman also confirmed that former Pakistan
foreign secretary Niaz Naik had visited New Delhi as special envoy
of Nawaz Sharif over the weekend during which he met Vajpayee and
hid principal secretary Brajesh Mishra, but He refused to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
But reports reaching here said Pakistan Foreign Office
maintained that Naik's tour was "a private visit and it has
nothing to do with Pakistan's foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee reiterated that the on-going military action in Kargil
would not be stopped or scaled down until the "intruders" were
driven away.
</P>
<P>
He told the leaders of all parties that Pakistan action this
time
posed the danger of interdicting India's lines of communication
both to Leh and to Siachen, both are strategic posts hold by
India.
</P>
<P>
He accused Pakistan of seeking to alter the line of control
(LOC) and hoping that, by escalating the ground situation, they
would succeed either in forcing international attention on the
issue, or they would compel India to accept the altered status
quo.
</P>
<P>
As Vajpayee briefed the leaders of all major parities, reports
from Kashmir said Indian troops had foiled a Pakistan attempt to
capture a vital ridge line in southern Siachen Glacier, killing at
least 15 Pakistani soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Starting Dialogue Across The Taiwan Straits (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) says it hopes to promote a
dialogue across the Taiwan Straits by holding a non-governmental
forum in August or September in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from ARATS Deputy Secretary General Li Yafei
who met with Jan Jih-horng, the deputy secretary general of Taiwan
's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Li said that ARATS would like to invite SEF's head or its
deputy secretary-general to the forum and that if SEF accepts the
invitation, they could decide which scholars or other personnel in
Taiwan would participate. The two organizations could also discuss
the time and place of the forum, the number of participants, and
other specific matters, he said.
</P>
<P>
ARATS believes that forums or seminars on cross-straits
relations are a way to fulfill the terms of the 4-point agreement
reached by ARATS President Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-
fu last October in Shanghai. The first point was to arrange a
cross-straits dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Li said that if SEF did not agree, it could make its own
proposal. Arranging a cross-straits dialogue is an essential part
of preparations for Wang's Taiwan visit this fall.

<HEADLINE> Starting Dialogue Across The Taiwan Straits (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARATS and SEF are both NGOs and forums or seminars they hold
should be authorized dialogues and should be differentiated from
other non-governmental academic symposiums in their significance,
and function.
</P>
<P>
Forums they hold should be hosted by the two organizations and
participants are to be selected by the two organizations, which
have invited scholars and personnel from various fields to discuss
matters. For example, some Taiwanese scholars did accompany Koo
when he visited the mainland last year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the idea that SEF's functions could be weakened or
difficult to put into practice is impossible, said Li.
</P>
<P>
ARATS has considered the differences of the two organizations
and has suggested that no theme to be set for the forum and that
participants be allowed to speak freely. Taiwanese can discuss
issues that concern them and participants can look for common
points while reserving their differences at the same time.
</P>
<P>
If common points are found, they could help preparations for
the Wang-Koo dialogue, procedural discussions about political
negotiations across the Straits, and the reopening of negotiations
on economic and other issues.

<HEADLINE> Derivatives Key to Future of UK Financial Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 28 (Xinhua) - Derivatives will play a key role in
helping London maintain its position as major international
financial center, a report released by British Invisibles (BI)
Monday said.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, turnover in the OTC market in London
has more than doubled. The exchanges estimate that international
fees and commissions on exchange contracts alone totalled 1.4bn
pounds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The UK's share of world turnover rose from 27% to 36% between
1995 and 1998. Nearly a half of the rise in world turnover was
attributable to the growth in activity in London.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of BI's Derivatives Steering Committee, Roy Leighton
said: "Derivatives are at the cutting edge of financial
innovation. Properly used they contribute to financial stability
and prudent enterprise management."
</P>
<P>
A range of innovative products developed for clients in
finance, industry and government around the world. All the main
types of OTC products including interest rates, foreign currency,
equities and commodities are available.
</P>
<P>
The development of electronic platforms, including LIFFE
CONNECTtm. The UK is now able to access foreign derivatives
exchanges and undertake remote clearing.
</P>
<P>
It is believed today's derivatives industry in the UK has its
roots in the 16th century forward trading of commodities in order
to hedge against price risk.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Anthony Belchambers, the Futures and
Options Association's Chief Executive, said: "This report shows
the unprecedented growth that has since taken place in this
industry which has put it at the forefront of the world's
financial markets and made it a significant contributor to the
UK's economy."

<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze on Monday blamed "individual Russian military
commanders" for an alleged violation of its air space, the

He was referring to an incident occurred on June 18 when
Russian fighter jets allegedly violated Georgian air space. Moscow

"We have warned and we warn again that violations of the
Georgian air space by Russian aircraft is impermissible," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry lodged a note of protest with the
Russian Foreign Ministry shortly after the incident, but the
Russian Air Force Press Service in Moscow said Russian planes had
not violated the air space of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"None of the MiG-29 fighters or any other aircraft of the
Russian air force had carried out flight missions at the indicated
time near the borders of the named Transcaucasian republic," Tass

newly-elected board of directors of the Western Returned Students'
Association, China's largest non-governmental organization for
students returning from study overseas, today that the Chinese
government will continue to encourage and support more students to
return to help the motherland.
</P>
<P>

studying abroad to return home after finishing their studies and
said that it has made a great contribution to social and economic
development of China since it was founded about 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He also said he hopes it will be able to make a further
contribution to the strategy of revitalizing the country through
science and technology and help China face up to challenges and
opportunities in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that all three generations of the Communist Party of
China's leaders have paid great attention to sending Chinese
students to study abroad and more than 300,000 have been sent
abroad and nearly 100,000 have returned since 1979, when China
began its reforms and opening-up and many have made a great

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Foreign Ministers to Meet in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministers of Greece and
Turkey will on Wednesday meet in New York to discuss a series of
issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after talks with visiting U.N.
Secretary-General's Special Emissary Carl Bildt, Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou said that his proposal for a private
meeting with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem in New York had
been accepted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Papandreou and Cem will take place on the
sidelines of a meeting on Kosovo organized by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the acceptance by Cem of a meeting in New York as "a
first positive step," Papandreou said that dialogue with
neighboring Turkey had been a sore point for some years now.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that he did not want nor could he prejudge
the outcome of this dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Cem last week, Papandreou proposed a dialogue
on issues including organized crime, drug trafficking and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey's proposal for dialogue on terrorism, he said
that Greece was not afraid to discuss with any country about the
issue, on the conditions that such a discussion was held within
the framework of international conventions which bind the country
and take into account principles which had become established in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of signing an agreement
with its rival on combating terrorism, but only said that it was
too early and nothing had been decided.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds over
decades for their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Turkey also accuses Greece of assisting the
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in its terrorist activities against
its neighbor, but Greece has firmly denied such charges.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Speaks About Macao Garrison Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Law on Stationing Troops in
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) is an important
legal foundation for stationing troops in Macao, according to a
Central Military Commission official in charge of legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that the law follows the guidance of the basic
principle of "one country, two systems" and is in accordance with
the Constitution and the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The 10th session of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) passed the law today, the second
one the Committee has passed for the Macao SAR following the Basic
Law of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that the armed forces are a pillar of
the country and that stationing troops in Macao is a symbol of
China's sovereignty over Macao and an effective way for the
Central Government to control defense in Macao. It is also
conducive to maintaining social stability and economic development
there.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to guarantee that the troops stationed in
Macao will do their duty in accordance with the law and safeguard
state sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and the safety of
Macao, the law is necessary.

<P>
He said that the law is significant in four ways: First, it
meets the need to station troops in Macao. The law makes clear the
principles and system of stationing troops in Macao and the rules
governing the activities of the troops, and is the legal
foundation for stationing troops in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Second, it meets the need of guaranteeing that the Central
Government exercises effective administration of defense matters
in the Macao SAR by clarifying the jurisdiction and obligations of
the Central Government and the Government of the Macao SAR on
defense matters and stationing troops. It also sets the basic
Central Government policies on stationing troops in Macao, thus
helping relevant legislation and law enforcement of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Third, the law meets the need to guarantee that troops
stationed in Macao will fulfill their obligations in accordance
with the law by stating their obligations and jurisdiction in the
defense of Macao, the relations between troops and the government
of the Macao SAR and the duties of military personnel in a
capitalist system that is totally different from that of the
mainland.

<P>
Since Macao is an international city, good social security and
order are necessary conditions for social and economic development.
The law makes clear that the stationed troops will guard the
safety of Macao and will not intervene in local affairs, but if it
becomes necessary, the Macao SAR Government can ask the Central
Government to let the troops help maintain security and do
disaster work and exercise relevant law enforcement as appropriate
to their tasks as stated in relevant Macao SAR laws.
</P>
<P>
The law contains 30 articles in six sections and clearly states
the defense duties of the troops, including resisting aggression,
guarding the safety of the Macao SAR, and administering military
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In order to properly handle the relations between the troops
and the Government of the Macao SAR, the law states the specific
duties of the troops and the Government of the Macao SAR in
defense and stationing troops and makes clear the procedures and
rights of the troops in assisting the government of the Macao SAR
in maintaining security and in disaster work.

The law says that military personnel must obey the laws of the
Macao SAR and the national laws.
</P>
<P>
The Macao garrison law has had extensive reference to the
similar Hong Kong law, which has had a good effect in the two
years it has been applied. The real conditions of Macao show that
the main stipulations of the Hong Kong garrison law will be
applicable in Macao, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Macao has its own characteristics in politics,
the law, geography, and society, and for the practical needs of
stationing troops in Macao, the law has a number of stipulations
that show the characteristics of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the stipulations are: One, to fully demonstrate
the basic principles of stationing troops in Macao; two, to make
clear the legal guarantees for the troops to perform their
obligations.

Because the original laws of Macao do not say anything about
guaranteeing that troops will fulfill their obligations and
protect military facilities, the law has special stipulations that
the Macao SAR will guarantee by law the rights of the troops when
they fulfill their obligations and that the government of the
Macao SAR is to stop any organizations or individuals from
sabotaging or damaging military facilities.
</P>
<P>
These stipulations say that the Macao SAR is to help the troops
fulfill their obligations and protect military facilities through
legislation, law enforcement, and administrative work.
</P>
<P>
They make it clear that the land the troops use is to be
provided by the government of the Macao SAR free of charge.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the law will play an important role
in the smooth return of Macao to the motherland and in the troops'
fulfilling their obligations and guarding the stability and
development of Macao.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tanzania's Economic Reforms Start to Bear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Prolonged droughts and heavy
floods have conspired to hit Tanzania over the past three years,
but failed to prevent the country's economy from forging ahead.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998/99 fiscal year ending June 30, Tanzania's
economic growth rate registered at four percent, compared with 4.2
percent in 1996 and 3.3 percent in 1997. Statistics indicate that
the rates for the three years all stood above Africa's average
level.
</P>
<P>
The positive growth momentum is an indication that after more
than 10 years of reform the country's economy has stabilized and
the reform has started bearing fruits, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Despite its fragile economy, the macro-economic situation in
Tanzania has improved significantly. By the end of April this
year, inflation has dropped to 8.9 percent, compared with 36
percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has been able to control its budget
by matching expenditure to revenue collection and by avoiding bank
borrowing, said Finance Minister Daniel Yona while presenting a
budget speech at the parliament earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves have increased and now cover nearly
four months of imports. Also, the value of Tanzanian shilling is
in real terms stable, Yona said.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, foreign grants, investments and confidence in the
economy and government are continuously increasing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Like many other African countries, Tanzania went through a
smooth period of development after independence. Its economy,
however, worsened in the mid-1970s due to droughts in cycle and
pitfalls in domestic policies. In 1980s, commodities were in
acute shortage and production got bogged down.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the government accepted plans of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and launched a comprehensive
Economic Recovery Program, which has turned Tanzania from a
centrally planned economy into open markets.
</P>
<P>
Control over foreign exchange has been abolished, local and
foreign banks have been allowed to operate alongside
government-owned banks, and investment regulations were amended
twice to attract private investment from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Tanzania has approved some 1,200
projects worth more than three billion U.S. dollars, most of which
coming from foreign investors. The sum made Tanzania one of the
best foreign investment destinations in sub-Sahara Africa.

<HEADLINE> UK Labour Refocuses on Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labour government
launched a new drive on Monday outlining a week of key policy
announcements to help the disadvantaged help themselves.
</P>
<P>
The blizzard of initiatives includes a new one-stop shop to
help the jobless claim their benefits but also look for work,
detailed plans for stakeholder pensions designed to help people of
all incomes save for their old age, plans to stop parts of British
towns becoming ghettos, and a new scheme for training
over-16-year-olds for the new-hitech world.
</P>
<P>
Social Security Secretary Alistair Darling told reporters the
week would show government units working together in an "across
the board assault on poverty and the causes of poverty".
</P>
<P>
The ruling Labour refocused its sights after a stunning defeat
in European parliament elections earlier this month. Its new
strategy rests on a conviction it will win the next election on
domestic ground if it not only delivers but is seen to deliver.
</P>
<P>
Welfare reform is a touchy issue for the Labour Government but
it remains committed to it.
</P>
<P>
Also, policy details will be announced to parliament through
the week but Monday's launch of "One" -- a unified system to deal
with the unemployed -- encapsulates Labour's approach perfectly.
</P>
<P>
"People have the right to expect the government to help them
back into work. But in return, they have the responsibility to
take advantage of that," A Reuters report quoted Darling as
saying.

NEW DELHI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- India Monday expelled a staff
member of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi for "spying."
</P>
<P>
Dil Fayyaz, who Islamabad had claimed "missing" since Sunday
evening, was asked to leave India by July 5, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Fayyaz was detained by Uttar Pradesh
police in the neighboring district of Ghaziabad for violating the
official secrets act.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Deputy High Commissioners Akbar Zeb was summoned to
the External Affairs Ministry Monday evening and told about the
government's decision to expel Fayyaz on the ground that "he was
indulging in activities incompatible with his official status."
</P>
<P>
A source from the police said Fayyaz was apprehended by Uttar
Pradesh police and was brought here Monday and handed over to the
Pakistan High Commission officials around 18:40 local time Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the daily news briefing here this afternoon, a spokesman of
the External Affairs Ministry denied any knowledge of Fayyaz's
"missing."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs reportedly conveyed a
demarche to the Indian High Commission in Islamabad expressing
utmost concern over the "mysterious" disappearance of Fayyaz.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tanzanian Economic Reforms Start to Bear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
... investment destinations in sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
To revamp the industrial sector, Tanzania has divested more
than 200 state-owned enterprises, making the sector grow at an
average rate of 6.2 percent annually from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, liberalization of the market has boosted
circulation of grain and cash crops.
</P>
<P>
By opening up the tourism sector, tourist arrivals has risen to
480,000 with earnings climbing up to 570 million U.S. dollars this
year, compared with 85,000 visitors and 10.3 million U.S. dollars
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The country's mining sector is expected to attract 500 million
U.S. dollars by the year 2000 after the government provided
legislation and mining incentives in developing gold, diamond and
other mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the bed is not all red roses and Tanzania still has
a lot of drawbacks to address.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit has enlarged to a deficit of 588 million U.S.
dollars because of unfavorable weather conditions and fluctuation
of the international market in recent years.
</P>
<P>
External debt hovers around eight billion U.S. dollars, making
the government unable to improve poor education and health
services. Population growth rate stands at 2.8 percent, believed
to be too high.
</P>
<P>
Above all, an average per capita income of 210 U.S. dollars
keeps the country in the ranks of world's least developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, Tanzania has basically found a good
reform path as its overall macro-economic situation is sound, said
World Bank Managing Director and Corporate Secretary Zhang
Shengman, who paid a visit to the country earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanians have gained confidence from the economic reforms.
As Zhang put it, "The morale of the private entrepreneurs has
improved a lot."
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, Tanzania will continue to push its
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Major challenges will come from the privatization of
telecommunication, harbor, water supply, power and other
infrastructure utilities, said Minister of State Nassor Malocho
while addressing the parliament this month.
</P>
<P>
The government will amend its tax structure, fight corruption
and intensify international cooperation so as to create an even
better investment environment, Malocho said.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is a higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate
of eight and ten percent annually," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Gov't Refutes Bomb Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan security authorities have
refuted a newspaper report which said a bomb was found at a public
rally which was being addressed by President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday by the security authorities said the
bomb detonated in the southwestern district of Mbarara was at
least four kilometers away from the public rally.
</P>
<P>
It called for journalists to get confirmation from local
officials and not to make sensational reports before publicizing
anything.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor daily reported last Saturday that a bomb was found
at the venue where Museveni held a public rally three days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The explosive, which was later described as a hand grenade, was
 reportedly discovered by an unidentified security personnel.
</P>
<P>
The report said the detonation sent town people scampering at
around 5: 00 p.m. near the premises of the resident district
commissioner.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia launched a
45.4-million-U.S. dollar small-scale irrigation and agricultural
development project in four of Ethiopia's nine states in the
coming year, Ethiopia's ministry of water resources announced here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gulilat Berhane, head of planning and supervision team of the

<HEADLINE> United Nations Works to Set Up Judiciary in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Monday
announced its first steps to reestablish the non-existent judicial
system and began to deploy the first team of international police
to the field.
</P>
<P>
The steps are among the world body's continuous efforts to
defuse tensions between ethnic Serb and Albanian communities in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General's acting Special Representative in
Kosovo, Sergio Vieira de Mello, Monday named six legal experts
who will meet Tuesday to select a panel of judges which will
immediately begin addressing the issue of detainees arrested and
held by the peacekeeping force, known as KFOR, throughout the
province.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the United Nations was going to create a "U.N. court"
to adjudicate in Kosovo, the spokesman explained that it would be
using the criminal code of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
except where it might contradict the European Commission's
standards on human rights and any other international standards.
</P>
<P>
"But we need judges," he said, "Right now, as KFOR arrests
people, according to European standards they can only hold them
for 48 hours if they're not brought before a judge. And there are
no judges, so unfortunately they've been arresting people and then
releasing them." He said that it was hoped that the judges would
be appointed this week.
</P>
<P>
De Mello, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian
affairs, had received agreement on the setting up of a sectoral
commission on the appointment of judges during a meeting of the
embryonic political consultative council he held with the Kosovo
Albanian leadership on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is on an non-official
visit to Britain, said Monday that he would appoint a civil
administrator for Kosovo by the end of this week. However, he
declined to comment on press reports that the appointee would a
European and would be chosen from a list of up to 10 candidates.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: France, Algeria Expected to Improve Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- After years of tense and sometimes
tempestuous relations, there are growing signs that France and
Algeria are in the process of returning to a normal bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French television channel France 3 on
Sunday, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika invited French
President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, National
Assembly Chairman Laurent Fabius and Senate President Christian
Poncelet to visit Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The invitation, still unanswered by the French leaders, came
after a visit to Algeria last week by French Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the first visit to Algiers by a French
government minister in two years.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, France and Algeria have disputed
over the military crackdown by the Algerian government against
Islamists.
</P>
<P>
Algeria regards France's criticism of its domestic policy as an
interference into its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
But with the improvement of domestic security situation in
Algeria, and the election of President Bouteflika on April 15,
Algeria and France have been relaxing their relations.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's television interview, Bouteflika said that his hand
"is more than extended" toward France.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was "astonished" that Chirac cannot spend a
half day in Algiers while he has visited the capitals of all other
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian president also sent a message to President Chirac
on Sunday, expressing his readiness to re-establish "privileged
relations" with Paris on the basis of "mutual respect, friendship
and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
For its part, France is considering resuming the flights of Air
France to Algiers, suspended since December 1994 after a terrorist
attack on an Airbus passenger plane of the air company.
</P>
<P>
France also plans to increase the number of visas to be issued
to Algerians to 150,000 this year, against 85,000 in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- German police have been placed on
alert for possible outbreaks of violence by Kurdish groups in
Germany after Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan
is sentenced Tuesday in Ankara, Media here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
But German Interior Minister Otto Schily said security
specialists expected no recurrence of the violence after Ocalan's
arrest, which caused waves of demonstrations by Kurds in the
capital cities of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was abducted in Kenya on February 15 by Turkish
agents in February, might be sentenced to death if convicted on
charges of treason.

<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets posted mixed
performances Monday as a strong start on Wall Street was undercut
by sour sentiment ahead of a looming decision on U.S. interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
French and German shares closed one percent higher
respectively, while British shares finished down 0.46 percent on
thin volume of 744 million shares.
</P>
<P>
London shares capped an uncertain session as merger talk in the
financial sector and a brewing takeover battle in the pub industry
failed to lure buyers off the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 finished down 29.7 points, at 6405.7. Decliners
led advancers by a six-to-one margin as investors refrained from
big moves ahead of a two-day Fed meeting.
</P>
<P>
Germany's electronically traded Xetra Dax index closed at
5356.95, a gain of 55.74 points, pulled higher by a solid start on
Wall Street and a strong performance by index Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
Telekom on Sunday priced its 285.9m new shares sold in a
secondary share offering at 39.50 euros per share - the stock's
Friday closing price after it tumbled 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, blue chips on the CAC 40 ended just over one percent
higher at 4456.23, a session high. Total volume on the CAC 40 was

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Holds Talks with U.S. Officials on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Monday held talks with U.S. officials on the prospect
of the Middle East peace under a new Israeli leader.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, on his first visit to the United States in more than
two years, met National Security Adviser Sandy Berger at Blair
House, government guesthouse for visiting dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
"They had a good discussion, which focused mostly on the
current state of the Middle East peace process," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has for years played an active role in promoting peace
between Israel and its neighbors -- the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon. But it put its efforts on hold for most of this year,
in the hope that Israeli voters would turn against Benjamin
Netanyahu, the outgoing prime minister, widely seen as an
obstacle to progress towards the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Israelis elected Ehud Barak as prime minister in May and a
new coalition dominated by the left is in the making.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also had meeting on Monday with CIA Director George
Tenet, Commerce Secretary William Daley, leaders of American
Jewish community, Defense Secretary William Cohen and World Bank
President James Wolfensohn. His meeting with President Bill
Clinton will be on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Get UNDP Help in Locating Minefields in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Teams of mine experts,
medical personnel and mine-sniffing dogs will arrive in Sri Lanka
in July to help locate minefields that pose a grave human security
threat in the northest region of the Jaffna Peninula, long under
the control by rebel fighters in the past, a U.N. agency said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The expert teams will help conduct minefield surveys now being
planned with support from the Mine Action Program in Sri Lanka
under the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The program, with a budget of 4 million U.S. dollars, is
helping plan the establishment of a mine action center and is
supporting other activities, such as the minefield surveys, to
reduce the danger of landmines in the region.
</P>
<P>
Landmines, left over from years of fighting between Tamil
rebels and government forces, are impeding the resettlement
efforts after severely injuring more than 2,000 Sri Lankans, UNDP
said.
</P>
<P>
The landmine presence, while estimated to affect only one to
two percent of the area's land, has kept people from returning to
communities they fled due to the fighting, UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
The surveys will result in a detailed database that pinpoints
the locations of the minefields. Once identified, the minefield
boundaries will be designated and marked off. Local people are
being trained to participate in the surveys and to beware of
high-risk areas identified, UNDP said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The first Latin
American-European Union summit meeting was opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Present at the summit are heads of state and of government, as
well as the representatives of the 48 countries --33 Latin
American and 15 members of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
At the start of this big event, the host President, Francisco

EU would be the focus at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Both the blocs pay great importance to the current summit, the
first between the two continents.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide E-Commerce to Top $1 Trillion by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Explosive growth of the
Internet is expected to push purchases over the World Wide Web to
top one trillion U.S. dollars by 2003, according to a report
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increase in the number of people who make
purchases over the Web, said U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC), the growth of the average
transaction size, and the adoption of the Web as a viable vehicle
for business procurement, Internet commerce will grow
substantially.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the number of users who make purchases over
the Web will jump from 31 million in 1998 to more than 183 million
in 2003 worldwide. Furthermore, there is ample opportunity to
expand the 183 million as it will represent only 36 percent of all
Web users.
</P>
<P>
Internet commerce is currently U.S.-centric. In 1998, IDC said,
non-U.S. Internet commerce accounted for only 26 percent of
worldwide spending, although 56 percent of Web users resided
outside the United States. By 2003, IDC estimates 65 percent of
Web users will be international, and the United States will
account for less than half worldwide Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
As for reasons for the U.S. focus today, IDC cited higher home
PC penetration and the percentage of business PCs that access the
Internet in the United States than foreign countries. "But this is
changing as Europe and other regions quickly accept the Web," IDC
said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Debates Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Monday began discussing the Iraq issue after U.N. weapons
inspectors left Baghdad over 6 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The core issue is how to overcome the differences among Council
members over lifting sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S. and U.K. air strikes on Iraq, the
Council has been divided on policy towards Baghdad, with Britain
recently proposing that the oil embargo against Iraq be suspended
after a new disarmament agency declares that Iraq has met
obligations on weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Britain's draft resolution for the Security Council,
co-sponsored by the Netherlands and backed by the United Sates,
has been rejected by Iraq which has insisted that the sanctions
should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Russia, China and France say U.N. sanctions should be lifted
with the disarmament issue becoming a job of the on-going
monitoring verification instead of resuming arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Sources said each of the Council members reiterated its own
position and the next meeting of the series of informal
discussions is expected to take place next month.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospect of a compromise, Russia's U.N.
ambassador Sergei Lavrov said he "doesn't think the issue is ready
for discussion".

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves ESAF Loan for Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Monday approved a three-year loan of 78.5 million U.S.
dollars for Mozambique under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF) to support the government's 1999-2002 economic
reform program.
</P>
<P>
The loan also will be used to help the government of Mozambique
to reach the completion point the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative, which aims to reduce to sustainable levels the
external debt burden of HIPC countries that pursue IMF and World
Bank-supported adjustment and reform program.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF and the World Bank boards are expected to consider the
HIPC issue shortly," the IMF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government of Mozambique projected the GDP will grow by
about 10 percent in 1999 and 7 percent annually during 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
The national poverty assessment of 1998 found that about 70
percent of the population still lives below the poverty line, and
social indicators for Mozambique are less favorable than
corresponding averages in other sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
members that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Foreign Minister Visits India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Namibia expressed its
understanding Tuesday of India's stand on the current conflict
with Pakistan in Kashmir, according to an official of the External
Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian view was conveyed here Tuesday by visiting Foreign
Minister Theo Ben Gurirab during his meeting with Indian caretaker
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Singh briefed Gurirab on the developments in the Kargil sector
of Kashmir and in South Asia, and the two ministers also discussed
other international developments including the Kosovo crisis and
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab, who arrived here on Sunday on a five-day official
visit, called on Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan
Tuesday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the 30-minute meeting, Narayanan and Gurirab discussed
the role of the Non-Aligned Movement in prevailing international
scenario and steps to strengthen it specially in the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Namibia is currently a non-permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council and Gurirab has been endorsed by the African
group of countries as the candidate for the next president of the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
India was among the first to recognize the ruling of the South
West African People's Organization (SWAPO) as the sole
representative of the Namibian people and allowed it to open an
office in New Delhi with full diplomatic privileges and status.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee paid an official visit to Namibia last August, during
which a protocol was signed on foreign office consultations
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Pak Confirms Sending Special Envoy to New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Highly-placed government sources
Tuesday confirmed news reports that Pakistan had sent a special
envoy to New Delhi a day after the Foreign Office's denial of such
a secret mission, the News Network International (NNI) reported.
</P>
<P>
NNI quoted the sources as saying that Niaz A. Niak was sent to
New Delhi as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's emissary. Niak held
meetings with India's caretaker Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and his Principal Secretary R.K. Mishra.
</P>
<P>
Niak's visit to New Delhi took place after Mishra's visit to
Pakistan 11 days later, the sources said, adding that Mishra met
Sharif and Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Mishra had brought a message of Vajpayee
for Sharif to call back the so-called infiltrators sent by
Pakistan from the Kargil sector on the Line of Control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Mishra stayed in Lahore for about seven hours and met Sharif at
his Lahore residence, said the official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Niak did not carry any written message
from Sharif for his Indian counterpart. The substance of his oral
message was that both sides should sit together and "search for a
diplomatic solution" to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Niak's visit took place in the context of the messages and
phone calls exchanged between the prime ministers of Pakistan and
India over the last few weeks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In these exchanges, Sharif had emphasized that India must stop
heavy shelling along the Line of Control. He also conveyed
Pakistan's continuing interest in resuming the dialogue process
under the spirit of the Lahore Declaration, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Acting spokesman of Pakistan's Foreign Office Monday also
confirmed Niak's visit, but called it a "private" trip which had
nothing to do with the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, admitted that Niak traveled recently to
Indonesia and some other South East Asian countries to garner
support over the Kargil crisis.

BELGRADE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 exhibitors, including 50
from abroad, displayed their know-how and equipment at the 25th
International Fair of Architecture and Civil Engineering, which
opened here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fair was of great importance as the Balkan country has just
started post-war reconstruction and re-building of its
infrastructure, economic, housing and other facilities that had
been demolished during the 11-week NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Slobodan Pavlovic, deputy construction minister of the Serbian
Republic said at the opening of the fair that the Yugoslav people
are now living in hard times after their country was exposed to
unprecedented destruction following the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
Momir Pavlicevic, president of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce,
described Yugoslavia as a large construction site now.
</P>
<P>
At least 120 bridges across the country were destroyed in NATO'
s air strikes.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday welcomed the
decision by the European Union (EU) to base its agency for the
Balkan reconstruction in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision on Monday had proved that Greece could play a
role in economic and peaceful development in the Balkan region,
Greek government spokesman Yiannis Nikolaou said at a press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, central Macedonia regional Secretary-General
Haralambos Sofianos also hailed the decision, saying that the
decision would give impetus to local agencies to show that
Thessaloniki deserved to be a center for developing the Balkan and
Black Sea countries.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders made the decision on the sidelines of the EU and
Latin American summit which began on Monday in Rio De Janeiro,
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the war in Yugoslavia triggered by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Greece has tried hard to play
a major role in regional reconstruction, and suggested that
Thessaloniki be chosen as a center for EU services for
reconstruction in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Pak Denies Indian Allegation on Kidnapping Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday promptly
rejected the Indian allegation that an Islamabad-based Indian
diplomat had been kidnapped and beaten by Pakistani intelligence
agencies.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan
strongly dismissed the Indian allegation as a "totally baseless
and malicious charge."
</P>
<P>
Such allegations are part of the propaganda campaign launched
by the Indian government, especially since their military
escalation of the situation along the LoC, in an attempt to malign
Pakistan, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commission to Pakistan earlier Tuesday issued a
statement which accused the Pakistani intelligence agencies of
"abducting and keeping in illegal detention" one of its staff
member.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Indian High Commission said that N. R.
Doraiswamy was kidnapped by 8 to 10 persons when he was on his way
to the embassy at 7:45 a.m. local time (02:45 GMT) and he was
severely beaten in custody for several hours.
</P>
<P>
The latest Indian charge is obviously designed to cover up the
fact that a Pakistani High Commission official in Delhi was
abducted on June 27, said the Pakistani spokesman.
</P>
<P>
India Monday expelled Dil Fayyaz, a staff member of the
Pakistani High Commission to India, with the accusation of his
engagement in what is called "spying" activities.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, who on Monday had said Fayyaz was "mysteriously
disappeared," Tuesday denied the Indian accusation and alleged
that the Indian intelligence agencies "abducted" the diplomat and
kept him in illegal custody for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
India's action, which was "in violation of the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Code of Conduct for
Treatment of Diplomatic Personal in Pakistan and India," can only
serve to vitiate the already tense prevailing atmosphere, said a
Pakistani official statement earlier Tuesday.

BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights of
diplomatic news released by Xinhua today:
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Leaders Meet Pakistani Prime Minister
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in a meeting with Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today, voiced the hope that Pakistan
and India would jointly ease the current tense situation in
Kashmir and settle the existing problems through dialogue and
talks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that "China and Pakistan are close and friendly
neighbors and our bilateral friendship has stood the test of time
and has been proven to be vigorous."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, told Sharif today that China, as a neighboring country
of South Asia, hopes that stability and economic development can
be maintained in the region.
</P>
<P>
Li added that "China firmly maintains that both the nuclear
weapons and missiles race in South Asia and the tensions in
Kashmir are not in the interest of the people there."
</P>
<P>
 FM Spokeswoman Denies Milosevic Seeking Asylum in China
</P>
<P>
China denied today the report that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic has sought political asylum in China. A Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman described the report as groundless.
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity Be Respected
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always held that the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Lebanon be respected, Zhang Qiyue,
spokeswoman of the Foreign Ministry, said this afternoon while
commenting on Israel's bombardment of Lebanon last week.
</P>
<P>
She said that "Israel should implement the UN Security Council
Resolution 425 without preconditions and withdraw its troops from
southern Lebanon, so as to help resolve the remaining issues
between the two countries through peaceful negotiation."
</P>
<P>
 Tightening Sensitive Technology Export to HK Unreasonable
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate bill to impose controls on the exports of "
sensitive US technology" to Hong Kong is totally unreasonable and
will bring negative impact on the economic development of Hong
Kong, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressional allegation that sensitive US technology
was being transferred from Hong Kong to China's mainland is
totally groundless, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
India, Pakistan Urged to Keep Restraint and Calm
</P>
<P>
China sincerely hopes that India and Pakistan can resolve their
dispute by peaceful means in order to safeguard stability in South
Asia and it urges the two countries to maintain restraint and
calmness, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's China
visit, Zhang said she believes that the visit will further promote
the existing Sino-Pakistani friendly and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Nansha Islands Sovereignty Indisputable
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said today that
Chinese sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and adjacent waters is
indisputable.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remarks at a press conference in response to a
question about recent reports that Malaysia has built facilities
on the Yuya Shoal and Boji Reef in China's Nansha Islands.
</P>
<P>
FM Spokeswoman on US-Japan Missile Accord
</P>
<P>
China is concerned about the possible signing of the Memorandum
of Understanding between the United States and Japan on the
development of the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, according
to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue.
</P>
<P>
"China has several times made clear its position on the joint
development of TMD between U.S. and Japan," she said at a regular
press conference this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> British Sports Minister Disunited With PFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- British Sports Minister Tony Banks
and players' bosses found themselves in opposition over how
Manchester United should react to the Football Association's offer
of a "one-off" exemption from next season's FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Banks told the House of Commons how important it was to allow
the Treble winners to pull out of the competition so they could
take part in FIFA's inaugural World Team Championship in January
next year.
</P>
<P>
If they do not compete, United would be replaced by Bayern
Munich- who come from World Cup 2006 rival hosts Germany - as
Europe's champion representatives in Brazil, Banks warned. But the
Professional Footballers' Association insisted any exemption for
United could prove very damaging to the 127-year-old competition.
</P>
<P>
PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor believes the ideal solution
to the problem would have been a 'bye' into a later round - it
would have to be the fifth round to avoid a clash.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said United's exemption would be "very damaging to the
status of the FA Cup, the world's premier knockout cup competition
".
</P>
<P>
He added: "I would have thought we could think about allowing
any team that won the European Champions League to be seeded to
enter the FA Cup at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
"We can see no reason why there shouldn't be a new rule to give
a club a bye into a later round in the FA Cup in these
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"Manchester United should enter the (World Team) tournament for
the prestige it would bring English football."
</P>
<P>
For Banks, such a compromise is not on the agenda. He told MPs:
"Manchester United's exemption from next season's FA Cup is a one-
off exceptional proposal for exceptional circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"There are two reasons for it. First of all, England has an
unenviable reputation for looking down on new major tournaments.
We refused to enter the World Cup when it was first organized. We
refused to enter the European Cup when it was first begun."

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs to Resume Meeting Next Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states will resume their 71st session in
the Saudi Red Sea port city of Jeddah next Saturday, diplomatic
sources in Riyadh said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are yet to complete the agenda of the proposed
two-day meeting in a bid to close ranks, the sources were quoted
by the Kuwait News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The GCC top diplomats met in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on
June 12 on a number of issues topped by the GCC-Iranian
rapprochement and its possible impact on the territorial dispute
between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE claims sovereignty over the three Gulf islands of Abu
Moussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are controlled by
Iran. Abu Dhabi fears that the warming up of ties between some GCC
states, especially the Gulf heavyweight Saudi Arabia, and Iran
will relinquish GCC's support to the UAE in the islands dispute.
</P>
<P>
But the GCC ministerial session was suspended with the absence
of a final communique due to differences among members over the
issues discussed and the wording of the communique.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Saudi Arabia later agreed after a Qatari mediation
on the resumption of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, earlier
this month, went to both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi in an effort to
bridge the differences between the two GCC countries.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance established
in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE.

<HEADLINE> WB Gives Aid to Zimbabwe's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, said
Tuesday it has committed more than 42 million U.S. dollars to
Zimbabwean private companies during the financial year ending June
30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The assistance comprised equity subscriptions of more than
three million dollars and term loans of more than 39 million
dollars, said Michael Tiller, IFC regional representative.
</P>
<P>
"The IFC will have invested in seven Zimbabwean companies
during that time, in support of projects with a total value of 113
million U.S. dollars, " Tiller said. "Given the risk of further
devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, most of IFC's business
partners come from sectors with a substantial export orientation."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the successful rate of companies assisted in the
past three to five years, Tiller said most of the Zimbabwean
companies in IFC's investment portfolio had been successful
commercially.
</P>
<P>
However, a few that depended exclusively on domestic markets
had experienced considerable stress, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector must be the engine for Zimbabwe's
economic recovery and growth.
</P>
<P>
"It is the private sector that creates value, which expands the
tax base and which provides productive jobs with good salaries and
wages," he was quoted by the Zimbabwe News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Small and medium scale enterprises have a crucial role to play
in this effect," he added.
</P>
<P>
On what could be done to improve the country's investment
climate, Tiller said the single greatest boost to Zimbabwe's
investment climate would come from strict discipline on the
government budget to bring down deficit, reduce the interest
burden and free capital for investment in productive enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The IFC fosters economic growth in the developing world by
financing private sector investments, mobilizing capital in
international financial markets and providing technical assistance
and advice to governments and businesses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese National Conference on Political Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China's
second national conference on its political education drive was
held in Beijing June 28 and 29.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party committees in various areas are being asked to
study President Jiang Zemin's speech for the 78th anniversary of
the CPC earnestly and to continue the education drive, which deals
with the study of theory, political awareness, and good conduct.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and other CPC and
government leaders met with participants at the conference, which
was the idea of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Participants discussed the essence of Jiang's speech and
reviewed developments and experiences from the education drive
over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was chaired by Zeng Qinghong, an alternate
member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and a
member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Head of
its Organization Department.
</P>
<P>
The first national conference on the education drive was held
in March, when 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities and 70 CPC and government offices kicked it off.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Quanjing, who is in charge of coordinating the education
drive nationally, has given the seal of approval to the education
drive of the past few months and has drawn up a plan for
developing it.

He said that, based on experience gained from the previous
education drive, the study of theory should be a pre-condition and
the basis for it and that attention must be given to solving
certain problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that the results of the previous education drive should
not be over-valued and that some government departments have made
progress to varying degrees but some institutes are lagging behind.
The education drive needs to rely on the masses, he said, and to
use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and lead to real
work improvement.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, some institutes failed to make adequate
progress in awareness of the significance of the drive and of self-
analysis, mobilization of the masses, and the review of clean
government conduct.
</P>
<P>
For the next stage of the education drive, Zhang asked all
officials to earnestly carry out the spirit of President Jiang
Zemin's speech and the CPC Central Committee's important
instructions. Zhang added that the education drive will continue
from top to bottom and will focus on one group and one level of
officials at each step.
</P>
<P>
He said that the next stage will focus on the second group of
provincial and county level officials.
</P>
<P>
The second group of government institutions to participate in
the education drive in early July are in 12 provinces,
municipalities, and autonomous regions and in 60 ministerial-level
organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday met in a closed-door session to discuss a new report on
the situation of Western Sahara, presented by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 15-nation Security Council, Annan said
that both parties in the region have been cooperating with the
identification of votes in preparation for a referendum on the
territory's future.
</P>
<P>
In May, Morocco and the POLISARIO accepted a U.N.-brokered
package of measures to allow preparations for the referendum to go
ahead. The identification process resumed on June 15.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed the importance of the parties staying the course
leading up to July 15 -- the date when the first part of the
provisional voters' list will be published and the appeals process
will begin.
</P>
<P>
Also in his report, Annan said that more than 2,300 people have
been interviewed since June 15, bringing the total number
identified since the process began in August 1994 to nearly
150,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.n. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is
preparing to repatriate refugees to the Territory in accordance
with the Settlement Plan, hammered out in August 1988.
Pre-registration has begun to determine their willingness to
return and their final destination in the Territory.
</P>
<P>
Under the Settlement Plan, the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) was established to monitor
a ceasefire and identify and register qualified voters for the
referendum on whether the former Spanish colony will gain full
independence or become a part of Morocco.

<HEADLINE> Kurds in Cyprus Demonstrate Against Ocalan's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Kurds living in
Cyprus Tuesday demonstrated outside the United States embassy in
Nicosia to protest against the death sentence of Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The protesters hurled stones at the embassy when hearing the
death verdict of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) leader, who was
found guilty of treason by a Turkish court in the day.
</P>
<P>
The protesters pinned a letter, signed by "the Kurdish
community of Cyprus", to U.S. President Bill Clinton on the barbed
wire outside the heavily-guarded embassy, calling on him to
pressure Turkey into altering the verdict.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed PKK has been fighting a guerrilla war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey since
1984. Conflicts between the Turkish security forces and the PKK
militants have claimed 37,000 lives ever since.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authority has been holding Ocalan, who was arrested
by Turkish special agents in Kenya in February, responsible for
the casualties.

<HEADLINE> hke062969 -Malaysian Economy on Recovery: Economic Action Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's real gross
domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 3.9 percent this
year, according to a statement released by the National Economic
Action Council (NEAC) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Capital controls have been a net
positive, primarily because the authorities have used the window
of opportunity to speedily address bank restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Monetary restraint and credible laws on bankruptcy and
foreclosure have facilitated an effective bank workout, thus
clearing the way for a genuine easing of monetary policy, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Tempered by a still-wide output gap, the Producer Price Index
(PPI) inflation is already deeply negative and this is creating
room for a further decline in interest rates with the Base Lending
Rate (BLR) expected to fall to six percent (a 13-year low) by the
year end, it said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on exports, it said Malaysia's export performance has
been the most impressive in Asia (after the Philippines) over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
"We expect a considerable acceleration in export growth over
the next five months aided by a low-base effect, as Malaysian
exporters continue to benefit from the stable and competitive
ringgit," it added.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that exports will receive a further fillip from
the strength of new U.S. orders for electronic components.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both the trade and current accounts have continued
to rise year-on-year and are likely to continue doing so through
the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Only a massive fiscal stimulus coupled with monetary
accommodation can cause import growth to exceed export growth in
the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"For the whole year, we expect exports to grow 7.8 percent and
imports to rise 6.7 percent," it added.
</P>
<P>
It was also noted that the central bank liquidity support for
the banking system had declined dramatically over the past 15
months from 12.5 percent of GDP in February 1998 to 0.7 percent of
GDP in May 1999, which was even lower than the 1.6 percent figure
at end 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the effective carve-out of non-performing loans
(NPLs) and bank recapitalization are expected to be completed by
the third quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The rise in asset prices in the interim would be also expected
to bolster the confidence of banks along with the value of loan
collateral.
</P>
<P>
For next year, it said the real GDP is expected to grow five
percent, with the CPI inflation accelerating to 3.1 percent from
this year's expected average of 2.4 percent as the current account
surplus declines to 9 percent of GDP.

A Turkish Court Tuesday sentenced Ocalan to death on charges of
treason for leading a 15-year fight for Kurdish autonomy. Although

<HEADLINE> Man United Could Delay Decision on FA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United may delay making
a decision about their involvement in the FA Cup until Wednesday--
following concerns made by their sponsors, AXA.
</P>
<P>
Members of the United board met on Monday to discuss the FA's
proposal that the FA Cup holders relinquish hopes of defending the
competition to play in the World Team Championship in Brazil next
January.
</P>
<P>
It had been intended that Man United make a statement on
Tuesday, but the picture has become clouded with AXA suggesting
that the non-appearance of Sir Alex Ferguson's side in next season
's competition will affect them too.
</P>
<P>
United chairman Martin Edwards said: "We had a meeting of some
of the board last night and it was not a full board meeting.
Dialogue is going on all the time, but I don't know when we will
be able to make a statement."
</P>
<P>
The FA are anxious for United to take part in the World Team
Championship to help England's 2006 World Cup bid and have offered
them exemption from the FA Cup as a concession to ease their
fixture congestion.
</P>
<P>
But Edwards claims this has put United in a "no-win situation"
and that is why the club are not rushing into a decision.
</P>
<P>
He realizes that they will be criticized whatever they decide
to do. They will come under fire if they ditch the FA Cup, but
they will also be attacked if they jeopardize England's World Cup
bid by snubbing FIFA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FA Cup sponsors AXA claim they will want talks with
the FA if United opt out of defending the trophy they won last
month at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
AXA spokesman Phil Hickley claimed they would like to discuss
the implications if United did pull out.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially it is a matter for the FA," he said. "It's only
right and proper that decisions about football in this country are
taken by the FA.
</P>
<P>
"They have the expertise in football terms, while we are but a
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
"But as sponsors, if Manchester United do pull out we would
want to have talks with the FA about the implications for this
year's competition and the implications for future years.
</P>
<P>
"This would move the goalposts a little bit."
</P>
<P>
AXA have completed one year of a four-year deal to sponsor the
world's most famous knock-out competition.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls for Strengthening of U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Tuesday that Moscow will be pressing for the
consolidation of the United Nations, the international
organization that bears the responsibility for the maintenance of
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
At a time when world processes are assuming a global scale and
a multipolar structure is forming in the world, no other
organization can meet demands of the times, Ivanov told a
gathering marking the 90th birthday of Andrei Gromyko, who served
as Soviet foreign minister from 1957 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
"The events in Yugoslavia and regarding Iraq showed that some
countries still wish to act bypassing resolutions of the U.N.
Security Council," Ivanov said, noting that "Russia condemns any
violation of human rights and violations of international
humanitarian law."
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow's relations with the United States and NATO were
strained by the events in Yugoslavia and regarding Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia suspended its relations with NATO after the military
bloc launched an air campaign against Yugoslavia on March 24.
Limited contacts resumed Monday when a group of Russian officials
went to Brussels to discuss cooperation in peacekeeping operations
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the military operations against Yugoslavia have
stopped, we shall consider what should be done next," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's objection to NATO's eastward expansion
and described it as "a major political error undermining our
relations."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov stressed that Russia would be guided by its own
interests when dealing with NATO member countries.

<HEADLINE> Pak Confirms Sending Special Envoy to New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Highly-placed government sources
Tuesday confirmed news reports that Pakistan had sent a special
envoy to New Delhi a day after the Foreign Office's denial of such
a secret mission, the News Network International (NNI) reported.
</P>
<P>
NNI quoted the sources as saying that Niaz A. Niak was sent to
New Delhi as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's emissary. Niak held
meetings with India's caretaker Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and his Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra.
</P>
<P>
Niak's visit to New Delhi took place after Mishra's visit to
Pakistan 11 days later, the sources said, adding that Mishra met
Sharif and Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Mishra had brought a message of Vajpayee
for Sharif to call back the so-called infiltrators sent by
Pakistan from the Kargil sector on the Line of Control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Mishra stayed in Lahore for about seven hours and met Sharif at
his Lahore residence, said the official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Niak did not carry any written message
from Sharif for his Indian counterpart. The substance of his oral
message was that both sides should sit together and "search for a
diplomatic solution" to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Niak's visit took place in the context of the messages and
phone calls exchanged between the prime ministers of Pakistan and
India over the last few weeks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In these exchanges, Sharif had emphasized that India must stop
heavy shelling along the Line of Control. He also conveyed
Pakistan's continuing interest in resuming the dialogue process
under the spirit of the Lahore Declaration, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Acting spokesman of Pakistan's Foreign Office Monday also
confirmed Niak's visit, but called it a "private" trip which had
nothing to do with the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, admitted that Niak traveled recently to
Indonesia and some other South East Asian countries to garner
support over the Kargil crisis.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Urged Not to Delay Congo (K) Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Ministers attending the talks for
peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) here have been
cautioned against any delays in resolving issues over the proposed
cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Tuesday at the meeting of defense and foreign affairs
ministers, Zambian Presidential Affairs Minister Eric Silwamba
said that "we should concentrate on resolving issues at hand."
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said there is need to move forward and appealed to all
parties to respect each other and not to cause delays in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"We should not enter into long debates and bitter exchanges
which will only set to delay the attainments of which we all
cherish and for which we are assembled here in Lusaka," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a negotiated document is always a result of
compromise guided by the spirit of give and take.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC cannot afford it nor can Africa, I have no doubt that
the meeting here is a merited group of eminent African ministers
whose collective wisdom and attitude is more than equal to the
task before us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, started on Monday morning, was attended by
ministers from 14 member states of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
It adjourned the same day after heated bargains over the draft
cease- fire document produced by a technical committee.
</P>
<P>
If the ministers approve the document, the heads of state will
meet in Zambia to endorse the signature of the agreement,
observers here say.

<HEADLINE> Preparing For Possible Summer Flooding In Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The rainy season has started and
the flood season on the Yangtze River is approaching and the
Province of Jiangxi, which had a lot of damage in last summer's
floods, is taking no chances in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
According to the meteorology and flood control department there,
the northern and central parts of the Jiangxi, especially those
along the Yangtze, have had frequent rainfall or heavy rainstorms
since the 23rd of this month.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Jiujiang, where the Yangtze went over the dyke
last year, the river's water level has been rising these days,
authorities say. According to a Jiujiang government official, the
city has 115 emergency flood-fighting squads with more than 20,000
people to patrol the river dyke in the Jiujiang area. The squads
are equipped with nearly a million straw bags, 2.6 million plastic
bags, and more than 2 million cubic meters of stones.
</P>
<P>
Armed police stationed in Jiujiang and the local public
security personnel recently held a joint flood-fighting and
emergency rescue maneuver that dealt with rescuing people from
floodwaters, building temporary dykes, and filling dam breaches.
The provincial government has also sent 4 inspection teams to
check on flood preparations in Jiujiang and other cities and
regions.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Flood Control Office's Internet Center has also
opened a special website to provide up-to-date weather, water, and
other information across the province.
</P>
<P>
The entire Yangtze River basin was hit by the worst floods in
decades last summer that killed more than 3,000 people and caused
200 billion yuan (about 25 billion U.S. dollars) worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
Summer rains cause extensive flooding and often deaths in China.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Turkey to Reverse Death Sentence on Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- France has called on Turkey to
reverse its death sentence on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan,
who was convicted of separatism and terrorism by a three-judge
court early on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This verdict is not definitive yet. Turkey has not executed
anyone on death sentence since 1984. We hope that this situation
will continue," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that France will link this with Turkey's long-time
efforts to enter the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"Opposition to death penalty is a matter of principle for
France and its European partners," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the spokeswoman reaffirmed France's
determination to condemn and combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has a number
of channels of appeal open to him. The death sentence goes
automatically to the appellate court. The court could either rule
for a re-trial, or uphold the sentence.
</P>
<P>
If upheld, the case is passed on to the Turkish Parliament and
President Suleyman Demirel for further approval. If Ocalan finally
has to mount the gallows, the appealing process may take at least
six months, possibly as long as 18.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Kosovo Not Precedent for Future Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Monday that NATO's bombing against
Yugoslavia should not be interpreted as a signal that the alliance
will intervene in future conflicts elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"Some hope, and others fear, that Kosovo will be a precedent
for similar interventions around the globe," Albright told the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I would caution against any such sweeping conclusions,"
Albright was quoted by an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
The statement reflects a "subtle change" of the Clinton
administration's policy on NATO's future role, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Before the Kosovo crisis, the administration had pressed NATO
members to consider expanding the defensive alliance's reach
beyond Europe as a way of maintaining an important post-Cold War
role in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Every circumstance is unique," Albright said, adding that NATO
is not a global institution, but a European and Atlantic one. Any
decision to use force against other countries should be made by
the president after weighing a host of factors, she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kosovo's future, Albright said she understood the
ethnic Albanian desire for Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, Kosovars will have something they have never
had, which is genuine self-government," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright expressed hope for the future of Kosovo,
citing strong commitments by the U.S. and Europe to rebuild the
province.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
paid a visit to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) and watched
its operations Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who arrived here Tuesday morning for the celebrations of
the second anniversary of the Special Administrative Region, was
accompanied on the trip by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
SEHK Chairman Lee Hon Chiu told Hu that the SEHK has 563
members and its market capitalization totaled 3,192.89 billion HK
dollars (409.34 billion U.S. dollars) as of May 31 this year, up
26 percent over the same time of last year.
</P>
<P>
To the applause of the brokers, Hu walked through the trading
hall and stopped by counters from time to time to inquire about
the quotes of some listed companies and the performance of the
Hang Seng Index.
</P>
<P>
The exchange, which was formed in 1980 by the unification of
four separate exchanges and commenced trading in April 1986, ranks
11th in the world and second in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Records of securities trading in Hong Kong date back to 1866
but the first formal stock market, the Association of Stockbrokers
in Hong Kong, was established in 1891. It was renamed the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange in 1914.
</P>
<P>
In 1921, a second exchange was incorporated - the Hong Kong
Stockbrokers' Association. The two exchanges merged to form the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the Hong Kong economy led to the
establishment of three other exchanges in the late 1960s and early
1970s, including the Far East Exchange (1969), the Kam Ngan Stock
Exchange (1971) and the Kowloon Stock Exchange (1972).
</P>
<P>
The unified exchange, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, was
incorporated on July 7, 1980. A new era began with the
commencement of trading via a computerized system on the unified
exchange on April 2, 1986.
</P>
<P>
By May 31, 1999, a total of 685 companies had been listed on
the exchange, with 41 China-incorporated enterprises and 14
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index (HSI), a barometer of the Hong Kong stock
market, was published for the first time on November 24, 1969. The
index reached its peak on August 7, 1997 at 16,673 points and
declined to 6,666 points on August 13, 1998 due to the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
With the ease of the Asian financial crisis, the HSI broke the
14,000-point mark on June 22, 1999 and has been up and down around
this level lately.

</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting here this afternoon

<P>
China, a neighbor of South Asia, is much concerned with the

particular part of it.
</P>
<P>
"China and Pakistan are close and friendly neighbors and our
bilateral friendship has stood the test of time and has been
proven to be vigorous," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "all-weather friendship" and "all-round
cooperation" are the main ingredients of the current Sino-
Pakistani relationship.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government considers its Sino-Pakistani
relationship very important as it is in the fundamental interests
of the two peoples, and also serves the peace and stability in
Asia and the world at large," Jiang added.

</P>
<P>
Trades cannot be made until August 1, so the Raptors would have
to select players on the Rockets' behalf during Wednesday's 1999
NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
Houston would acquire the Raptors fifth and the 12th pick in
the first round selection. The Raptors also would send former
Rockets center-forward Kevin Willis and swingman Doug Christie to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets, who have the No. 22 pick in the first round, have
been looking to move up in the draft. The No. 5 pick would be the
team's highest since they chose Olajuwon first overall in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The deal also could affect Houston forward Charles Barkley, who
is considering retirement and said he wanted to return only if he
thought the Rockets were title contenders.

MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado has vowed to strengthen the coordination among
government and private agencies in reducing the harsh effects of
natural disasters, Philippine News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said systematic coordination and disaster preparedness
have been fast tracked following a survey that showed the
Philippines is a country in the world suffering most heavily from
disasters like typhoons, volcanic eruption and floods from the
year 1990 through 1998.

becomes disastrous as a payback of our environmental degradation."

governments to declare disaster or Calamity areas within their
jurisdictions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A Giant Panda protection
foundation was established today by the China Wildlife Protection
Association and the Japanese Future Generations Alliance
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the "Friends of the Giant Panda" Foundation is
to protect the panda and other wildlife and to maintain harmony
between human and nature.
</P>
<P>
Ma Fu, the vice-director of China's State Forestry
Administration, said during an opening ceremony here today that
over 95 percent of the wild pandas have been given some form of
protection in 25 nature reserves on 10,726 square kilometers of
ground since a panda protection project was begun in China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, protecting the Giant Panda and other forms of wildlife
requires a joint effort of all of society. The foundation sets a
good example for cooperation between China and large enterprises
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Its major tasks include supporting scientific research on
protecting the panda and other forms of wildlife and their
habitats and providing awards for those who make an outstanding
contribution to this work.
</P>
<P>
So far, 2.1 million yuan (about 253,000 U.S. dollars) has been
raised for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is unique to China and only about 1,000 now
live in the wild and an estimated 100 in captivity.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Launches New Program in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) announced Tuesday that it has signed a
42-billion-shilling (30 million U.S. dollars) country program with
the Ugandan government to run parallel with its current relief and
recovery operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new five-year development package aims to provide Uganda's
rural poor with productive assets and incomes in order to
strengthen their ability to cope with recurring man-made and
natural calamities, according to a press release issued by the WFP
in Ugandan capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The program focuses on agricultural production and marketing,
primary education, and vocational training of orphans and street
children, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Although over 80 percent of Ugandans are employed in
agriculture, the majority of them lack access to markets, with
many producing fewer crops or selling subsistence food to meet
their minimal cash requirements.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, civil wars in neighboring countries,
repeated natural disasters and rebel incursions have forced half a
million people to remain dependent on food aid.
</P>
<P>
"Like all humanitarian agencies, the WFP wants to work itself
out of a job," said Michael Jones, WFP's deputy country director
in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to achieve this is to help people harness the
skills they have developed for their day-to-day survival," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The planned program will target the poorest of the poor while
concentrating resources on the most impoverished areas of northern
and western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the WFP will place priority on food
security, education and training, the press release said, adding
that particular attention will be paid to women, teenage girls who
trail far behind males in virtually all objective indicators of
human welfare.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda since 1971, the WFP has completed 62 development
projects and relief operations at a total cost of 262 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The organization's current relief and recovery operations in
the country are valued at 54 million dollars per year.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Confirms Receiving Resignation Letters From SAP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
confirmed Tuesday afternoon that he has received resignation
letters from two ministers from the Social Action Party (SAP).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Government House after the weekly cabinet
meeting, Chuan said he had informed the cabinet meeting about the
resignations of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Science,
Technology and Environment Suvit Khunkitti and Deputy Science
Minister Ravee Hiranchote.
</P>
<P>
So far, the prime minister has received no resignation letter
from the last SAP minister, Suriya Chuengrungruangkit, who holds
the deputy industry minister's post.
</P>
<P>
Chuan avoided to answer the question about whether the
resignations of Suvit, the former SAP leader, and Ravee mean the
SAP's quitting from the coalition government, saying only, "It was
hard to say."
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the rift within the SAP is an internal affair of the
party only though it has certain influence on the government.
Parties within the coalition are cooperating closely, he said.
</P>
<P>
Different factions in the SAP are struggling for cabinet seats
and  Suvit had been asked to hand in his science portfolio.
</P>
<P>
They also wanted Ravee, who is in Suvit's camp, to vacant his
post as deputy science minister.
</P>
<P>
Suvit refused to give up the science minister post but offered
deputy prime ministership instead. He also fought back by
resigning as party leader, forcing an executive election on July
2, which he is confident of winning.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices rose on Singapore
Stock Market Tuesday after two days of slump as strong overnight
close on Wall Street buoyed the market.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) ran up by 17.42 points
to close at 2,181.08.
</P>
<P>
Total volume exceeded 2.19 billion shares valued at almost 2.12
billion Singapore dollars (about 1.25 billion U.S. dollars).
Gainers led losers by 270 to 88 with 88 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
IPC continued to top the volume list as it registered a
turnover of 146.37 million shares. It was followed by Frt Links
that had 106.17 million units done. Goldtrn was the next with
70.23 million counters changing hands.

the fear of a much higher interest rate by the U.S. Federal

points after its meeting on Wednesday.

<P>
MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank approved
Tuesday a 300 million U.S. dollar loan to China for improving
water quality and flood control in the heavily polluted Suzhou
Creek which flows through the heart of Shanghai in China.
</P>
<P>
ADB said in a news release that the Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation
Project will improve the environment, living conditions and public
health standards of about 3 million people living in the project
area.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Creek is severely polluted with large discharge of
untreated agricultural, industrial and municipal wastewater and
solid waste, ADB said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, the aim of the project is to restore
water quality of the creek by 2004 and relocate nightsoil and
solid waste collection wharves along the creek's banks.
</P>
<P>
The project will also facilitate interceptor sewers, pumping
stations, a wastewater treatment plant and flow control structures
on tributaries besides building greenbelts along both banks of the
creek, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan will come from its ordinary capital resources at
the bank's pool-based variable lending rate for U.S. dollar loans,
with a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
The bank's loan, accounting for about one-third of the total

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Genocide Suspect's Case Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The extradition case
concerning Bernard Ntuyahaga, a former army officer wanted by both
Rwanda and Belgium for his role in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, has
been adjourned to July 14.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was brought before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's
Court in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam on Tuesday morning, but a
Belgian lawyer demanded by him did not appear.
</P>
<P>
Major Ntuyahaga, former head of logistics at Kigali military
camp in Rwanda, allegedly murdered former Rwandan Prime Minister
Agathe Uwiningiyimana and 10 Belgium U.N. peace-keepers escorting
her.
</P>
<P>
At present, he is defended by Tanzanian lawyer, Dr. Jwain
Mwaikusa, a teacher at the Law Department of the University of Dar
es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
However, the accused alleged that he has language problems and
needs another counsel, Luc de Temmerman of Belgium, to assist Dr.
Mwaikusa.
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, Mwaikusa told the court that he has
communicated with Temmerman by E-mail, asking for Belgian lawyer's
curriculum vitae (CV).
</P>
<P>
The lawyer's resume was mailed to the university and did not
reach Dr. Mwaikusa's hand until Monday, and essential documents
like professional certificates and a letter of reference were
missing, Dr. Mwaikusa said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Principal Resident Magistrate Projestus Rugazia
that he has just sent a message to Temmerman to get those
documents and fax to him as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The documents are supposed to be handed over to Tanzania's High
Court, which will consider whether or not to allow Temmerman to
act as Ntuyahaga's counsel.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's case has been adjourned several times since it was
opened on May 12.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old man fell into the hand of the Tanzanian
government in March this year after the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), based in Arusha in north Tanzania,
dropped charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against
him and released him.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga was re-arrested by the Tanzanian police and wanted by
both Rwanda and Belgium for extradition and trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Tuesday accused
India of abducting its official in New Delhi, saying it is "a
clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Foreign Office said that Dil Fayyaz, an
official of the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi, who was
missing since Sunday evening, had been abducted by the Indian
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
Fayyaz was "kept in their illegal custody for more than 24
hours under false charges while also being physically manhandled,"
said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry and its High Commissioner in New
Delhi have rejected the allegations leveled by the Indian side
against Fayyaz.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Press Trust of India (PTI), India
Monday expelled Fayyaz for "spying." Fayyaz was detained by Uttar
Pradesh police in the neighboring district of Ghaziabad for
violating the official secrets act.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted a police source as saying that Fayyaz was
apprehended by Uttar Pradesh police and was brought in New Delhi
Monday and handed over to the Pakistani High Commission the same
day.
</P>
<P>
The press release by Pakistan's Foreign Office said that "under
no circumstances can the official's abduction and detention be
justified or condoned."
</P>
<P>
"Such actions in violation of existing agreements and norms can
only serve to vitiate the already tense prevailing atmosphere," it
said.

TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami

interests of any country, but aimed at establishing security and
stability in the two countries, the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Greek Defense Minister Akis

language of culture and logic, but through war, discrimination
and exploitation.

<P>
The results have been the breakout of two world wars, regional
clashes and numerous misunderstandings, the Islamic Republic News
Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president stressed that the mankind has to take
lessons from the calamities it has suffered in this century.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ancient relations between the two countries
and the mutual impact of their cultures, he said that the ties
have been beneficial not merely to the two countries but the
mankind in general.
</P>
<P>
Iran favors peace for the mankind, he said, adding that
the mutual cultural and political ties move in the direction
of understanding, security and peace.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed hope that expansion of bilateral ties
including the defense relations will bring security for the two
nations and the world population.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister, who arrived here Monday, termed
Athens-Tehran ties as long-standing, and said both Iran and
Greece were considered to be among important factors for regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his country's interest in cooperation with Iran
to create peace and security.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government ordered
its embassies and consulates around the world to beef up security
Tuesday after Turkey sentenced Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan to death for treason.
</P>
<P>
The measures were taken as precautions for possible outbreaks
of violence by Kurdish groups. Ocalan's Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) has warned of bloodshed if its leader was sentenced to
death, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Four Kurds were killed by Israeli security guards in Berlin
when the Israeli consulate was stormed by Kurdish demonstrators
on February 17, two days after Ocalan was captured by Turkish
agents in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has vehemently denied reports that
Israel's spy agency Mossad has played a role in the capture of the
PKK leader, who has led a 15-year war for Kurdish autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted by Israel Radio as
reiterating Tuesday that Israel has never been involved in the
case.
</P>
<P>
A PKK spokesman in Brussels also told Israel Radio Tuesday
that his group "has nothing against Israel," but expected an
apology from the Israeli government for the killing of the four
Kurdish protesters.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Lands Department of the Hong
Kong government sold three residential lots Tuesday for a total of
779 million HK dollars (about 100 million U.S. dollars) amid an
upturn of the property market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The three lots, with one located in the Hong Kong Island and
the other two in the "New Territories," were all sold at prices
well above those at the bid opening.
</P>
<P>
Rare among a limited supply of luxury residential plots in Hong
Kong, the site at the Hong Kong Island's Peak was sold for 265
million HK dollars, 90 million HK dollars more than the 175
million HK dollars at the opening of the bidding.
</P>
<P>
Land lots at Kwai Chung and Tai Po in the "New Territories"
were sold respectively for 470 million HK dollars and 44 million
HK dollars, as against the 275 million HK dollars and 16.8 million
HK dollars at the opening.
</P>
<P>
Property market analysts called the land auction promising and
noted bidders, mainly small and medium developers, showed great
interest and confidence in the market potential of the luxury
residential lots.
</P>
<P>
Stricken by the Asian financial crisis, the price of luxury
residential sites in Hong Kong once dropped dramatically, but it
began to rise again with the recovery of the local economy, said
Charles Lai, a property strategy consultant with the Surpass
Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some plots were sold at higher prices than the market
expectation and the site at Kwai Chung, for instance, was sold for
a price some 20 percent above the estimated 350 million-400
million HK dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The land sales, a traditional major source of government
revenue, was suspended at the end of last June. The government
resumed the land auction this year and raised nearly 1.49 billion
HK dollars from the April 20 land sales.
</P>
<P>
A government official with the Lands Department expressed
satisfaction with the results of the land auction and said the
sales were successful.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministers From Social Action Party Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Science Minister Suvit Khunkitti and his science deputy Ravee
Hiranchote, both from the Social Action Party (SAP), resigned
Tuesday pending a government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Suvit said his resignation is aimed at paving the way for the
government reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
However, local political analysts said his resignation is the
latest result of the struggle within the Social Action Party over
the cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
Factions led by party advisor Rakkiat Sukthana and
Secretary-General Somsak Thepsuthin had demanded that Suvit, who
was the party's leader, hand in his science minister portfolio and
keep only the deputy prime minister's post.
</P>
<P>
They also wanted Ravee, who is in Suvit's camp, to vacant his
seat.
</P>
<P>
However, Suvit refused to yield the science post to Somsak,
offering only his deputy prime ministership instead.
</P>
<P>
When the Rakkiat and Somsak factions, which control nine of the
party's 20 seats in the lower house, threatened to pull out of the
government, Suvit resigned last week from the SAP leadership to
force a new administrative committee election on July 2, which he
is confident of winning.
</P>
<P>
Montri Pongpanich, who once held an iron grip on the SAP and is
now in semi-retirement, was thought to be the only person who
could stop the party from breaking up and thus was invited to mend
the rift. But his mediation ended in failure when Suvit rejected
his resolution.
</P>
<P>
The seven-party coalition government enjoys a 257 majority in
the 393-strong House of Representatives.

<HEADLINE> Vice-President Hu Reaffirms China's Policy, Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
said here Tuesday that everything can be properly handled in Hong
Kong as long as the "one country, two systems" policy and the
Basic Law are upheld.
</P>
<P>
Hu, arriving here Tuesday morning from Shenzhen to attend the
celebrations of the second anniversary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), made the remarks Tuesday afternoon
when he met with local public figures including Hong Kong deputies
to the National People's Congress (NPC) and members of the
National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
"As long as we proceed from upholding the 'one country, two
systems' policy and the Basic Law, from maintaining the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and from safeguarding the
fundamental interests of Hong Kong compatriots, we can reach the
broadest possible consensus and handle everything well in Hong
Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that, with the support of the central
government, the policies of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy have
been fully implemented since the establishment of the SAR two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Neither has Hong Kong's social and economic system changed, nor
has its way of living, and the laws in Hong Kong remain basically
intact, Hu commented.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, he said, the SAR government has adopted a series
of effective measures to cope with the shocks of the Asian
financial crisis and has successfully maintained the linked
exchange rate and stabilized the financial market.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that Hong Kong's economic and financial system is
sound and healthy, that the administration of the SAR government
led by Mr. Tung Chee Hwa is effective, and that Hong Kong people
are capable of managing Hong Kong," Hu commented.
</P>
<P>
Practice also "proves the correctness of the great concept of '
one country, two systems'," he added.
</P>
<P>
The pursuance of the "one country, two systems" policy and the
maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, Hu said, are
in the fundamental interests of China and Hong Kong and also in
the interests of those countries and regions having trade and
economic activities in Hong Kong and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president praised the Hong Kong NPC deputies and CPPCC
members and other public figures for their contributions to Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability as well as to the cause of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Hu also briefed those at the meeting on the economic situation
in China's mainland areas.
</P>
<P>
On hand were Fok Ying Tung, vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the CPPCC, Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, and Liao Hui, director of the
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.

<P>
LAGOS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo is seeking to give extensive powers to an anti-corruption

defend Hong Kong against the criticism in the Cox Report."
</P>
<P>
"I have personally met with Mr. Cox and I have invited him to
Hong Kong to see for himself our export control regime. He
acknowledged himself that we have a first grade export control
regime," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said her impression is that "there remains considerable
support for and good will toward Hong Kong," which demands that
the Special Administrative Region government continue to work hard
to earn that degree of support and respect.
</P>
<P>
"As our two largest trading partners, clearly any tension in
the relationship between America and China does have a direct
impact on Hong Kong. And I very much hope that it will be possible
within a very short period of time for that relationship, that
constructive engagement to be put on track," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this will be beneficial not only to the two
nations involved, but also will be beneficial to Hong Kong and to
the world at large," she said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Vote Counting Needs More Time, Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Indonesian
Election Committee (PPI) Jacob Tobing Tuesday said the General
Election Commission (KPU) might not finish its national vote
counting before July 8.
</P>
<P>
"The time will not be sufficient if there is no extension for
vote counting," Tobing said before a plenary session of the KPU.
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that the commission will discuss the
possibility of extending the time limit as it is still trying to
find a way to finish the counting on schedule, Tobing said.
</P>
<P>
The KPU is expected to finish the national ballot counting for
the elections of the House of Representatives (DPR) as well as
municipal and provincial-level houses (DPRD II and DPRD I) before
July 8.
</P>
<P>
Tobing said the PPI's counting has reached some 75 percent of
the total 117.8 million votes throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KPU Chairman Rudini said the commission is still
trying to find the best solution for regions which have yet to
send in the vote counting results.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a way so those data can be sent (to Jakarta)
soon," Rudini said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 327 municipalities in Indonesia, only 127 of them
have reported the results of the ballot counting.
</P>
<P>
The slow entry of data is not because of a failure in the
system, but it is merely a problem of data entry, Rudini added.
</P>
<P>
Official data collected by the KPU, based on votes counted till
Tuesday morning, showed the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) in the lead with 22.96 million votes, followed by
Golkar Party with 12.1 million), National Awakening Party (PKB)
11.1 million, United Development Party (PPP) 6.35 million and
National Mandate Party (PAN) 4.34 million.
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial results collected by the official
Antara News Agency from the provincial chapters of PPI, until
Tuesday morning, PDI-P remained in the lead with 33.97 million
votes or 34.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party followed with 22 million votes (22.29 percent),
PKB 12.93 million votes (12.98 percent), PPP 10.5 million votes
(10.57 percent) and PAN 6.88 million votes (6.92 percent).
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties took part in the election on June
7 to compete for 462 of the 500 seats in the DPR. The remaining 38
seats are reserved for the military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
KPU officials stressed that the results of the election will be
determined by the official data issued by the KPU, and other data
are unofficial.

<P>
NANNING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign loans are to be used in
the battle to treat urban pollution in China with Liuzhou City in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region the first city
to take advantage of the scheme.

Liuzhou is one of China's four worst areas in terms of acid
rain pollution. The excessive amount of sulfur dioxide discharge
into the air is generally considered to be the main cause and the
city suffers from three times the national second-degree standard
of such pollution.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be used in six sub-projects, which include
replacing residential use of coal with coal gas and treating
residential and industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
The treatment is expected to annually reduce sulfur discharges
by 36,200 tons, soot by 7,700 tons and the city's industrial
sewage by 2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
International procurement and land requisition for the projects
have already started.

<HEADLINE> India's Software Exports Increase by 68 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- India's software exports grew by
68 percent in terms of rupee value during the financial year of
1998-99, touching 109.4 billion rupees (2.65 billion U.S.
dollars), out of a total revenue of 158.9 billion rupees (3.84
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to an annual survey of the National Association of
Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), the results of which
were released on Monday, the industry recorded an overall growth
of 58 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of information technology (IT) in the national
agenda led to the announcement of their own IT policies by 14 of
the country's 26 state governments, thus strengthening the
software industry considerably, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
At the present growth pace, Nasscom President Dewang Mehta
predicted, the export of software and services would account for
25 percent of the country's total trade in the next five years
from the current 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Y2K (year 2000) solution products accounted for 20 percent of
the software exports, Mehta said, adding that more than 90 percent
of the companies doing Y2K work have already started retraining
their staff and re-focusing on e-commerce, IT-enabled services and
interactive integration solutions.
</P>
<P>
Mehta said research and development spending of software
companies went up to 3.2 percent of their total expenditure from
2.5 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the share of offshore software
development increased to 41 percent of the total exports.
</P>
<P>
It said the current market capitalization of the software
industry has exceeded 1 trillion rupees (approximately 23.8
billion dollars), or about 10 percent of India's gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
Five Indian companies -- Motorola India, Wipro, Satyam, ICIL
and TCS -- have obtained the highly-coveted quality certification
standard, the SEI-COMM Level 5, this year. Only five other
companies in the world have this distinction.

<HEADLINE> China Stressing Economical Exploitation of Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a series of
preferential policies to encourage the use of new and advanced
technologies in its exploitation of mineral resources, according
to an official with China's Ministry of Land and Resources.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology will become an essential part of how
China protects and develops its natural resources, Vice-Minister
Jiang Chengsong said here recently.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that China is currently facing the rapid
depletion of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Some 168 minerals thus far discovered in the country fulfill
demand for the nation's industrial development, but 16 of the 45
strategic minerals required to ensure smooth national economic
development will be subject to depletion prior to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The total number of adequate resources is expected to drop to
23 minerals by 2010 and fall even further to six in 2020,
according to other sources.
</P>
<P>
To change the current situation, the ministry has decided to
halt its approval of any new projects on the exploitation of rare
earth, wolfram, tin and stibium from now until the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the ministry will also stop issuing
licenses to any new small or medium-sized miners of coal,
molybdenum, barite and fluorite.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Central Bank to Keep Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Israel has decided
to leave interest rates unchanged in July for the third month in a
row, saying it is necessary to achieve the annual inflation
target of 4 percent, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel to keep
the central bank's key lending rate at 12 percent came amid strong
calls from the business circle for a lower rate in order to
stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel has expressed hope that the incoming government of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak will maintain the inflation target of 4
percent and the deficit target of 2 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) set by the outgoing government of Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Defeating Netanyahu in the May elections, Barak has reached
home stretch in his process to form a coalition government. He
has not set specific economic guidelines and appointed finance
minister yet.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI) has experienced negative growth
in the first three months before rising by 0.3 percent in April,
the lowest gain in the past 35 years for the month of April.
</P>
<P>
But Frenkel said the deflation of the first four months was
only a partial correction of the unusually high CPI increases of 3
percent last fall, sparked by the international financial
turmoil, rather than a permanent new trend.
</P>
<P>
Various economic forecasts in the first few months still
predict inflation of over 4 percent this year, Frenkel said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the new government to cut expenditures and taxes,
lower deficit, conduct structural reform and invest in
infrastructure, human capital and research and development, in
order to achieve a sustainable growth.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Striving to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
has been working hard to maintain its position as the country's No.
1 exporter by encouraging local large companies to start up more
processing businesses abroad and sell their products overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to a local foreign trade official, the enterprises
will get much needed support in terms of capital, hard currencies
and approval procedures for going abroad if they will establish
processing workshops abroad where domestically supplied raw
materials and semi-finished products will be used in the
production.
</P>
<P>
By now, 36 large conglomerates in Guangdong have established
such overseas businesses and the products they produce are sold
abroad, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province remained the country's largest exporter last
year, but the export volume of the province dropped 17.8 percent
in the first four months of this year, though the fall off is
slowing down month by month.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Plans to List Tourism-Oriented Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the Philippine
Stock Exchange (PSE) and the Department of Tourism (DOT) met
Tuesday to discuss the possibility of listing tourism-oriented
businesses nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The meeting could probably lead to the forging of an agreement
to  enhance the local capital market industry in the country, the
Philippine News Agency quoted Jose Alcantara, PSE vice president,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Once a private company is listed with the PSE, it becomes the
property of shareholders who vote for and decide the company's
operations and direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
The idea came about after the PSE board identified
tourism-related businesses as one big potential source of capital
to boost the development of infrastructure in areas where tourism
activities are taking place, he said.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader Sentenced to Death in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to death for treason
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Ankara State Security Court gave Ocalan the death
penalty as he "betrayed the country."
</P>
<P>
In the 9th court session of the trial, Ocalan said in his final
statement that he did not accept the accusation of treason.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I believe that I struggled for the unity of the
country and for a free life. I believe that I struggled for a
democratic republic, not against republic."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the problem, which was getting bigger by
historical mistakes, will be solved," said Ocalan, adding that "I
want this trial to contribute to this."
</P>
<P>
The PKK leader added that "I reiterate my determined words and
call for a just and honorable peace and brotherhood in the axis of
a democratic republic."
</P>
<P>
"I am calling on the humanity, state and all social powers to
undertake their responsibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "I believe that future of the country
depends on peace, not the war. I am hailing everybody."
</P>
<P>
The court said that it decided to sentence Ocalan to capital
punishment under Article 125 of Turkish Penal Code.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and detained on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near
western Turkey's province of Bursa for trials on charges of
treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts
between the Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have
claimed over 37,000 lives and the government held Ocalan
responsible for the deaths.

from legal pursuit" of all the Islamists who are not involved in
crimes of killing and rape.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects British-Dutch Proposal on Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz dismissed a draft resolution by Britain and the Netherlands
to the U.N. Security Council on the Iraqi issue as "dubious."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel Monday
evening, Aziz said the proposal was intended to reforge the
Security Council resolutions in a manner worse than previous
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Netherlands recently proposed to the Security
Council that the U.N. sanctions on Iraq be suspended after Iraq
fully cooperates with an enlarged body of weapons inspectors, which
will replace the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and carry out
more intrusive inspections on Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The purpose behind such a draft resolution is to set the stage
for a legitimate stand in the Security Council justifying a
forthcoming aggression on Iraq and putting new restrictions on Iraq
which Iraq can not abide by, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a kind of ill-fated legitimacy to launch a fresh
aggression on Iraq will emerge on the grounds that Iraq fails to
implement Security Council resolutions, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Iraq's cooperation with the Security Council on
disarmament, Aziz said that all requirements of disarmament under
U.N. resolution 687 have been fully implemented in essence and
detail.
</P>
<P>
On Iraq's delivery of document on its armaments program, Aziz
said there was an opinion prevailing in the Security Council that
since 1995 Iraq has fulfilled the essential objectives in
disarmament issues.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed Iraq's legitimate right to demand the lifting of
U.N. sanctions imposed on the country following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Aziz lashed out against the UNSCOM in
charge of disarming Iraq, saying it aimed to keep embargo in place
and fabricate pretexts for spying on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made it clear that Iraq did not expel UNSCOM, whose
weapons inspectors left Iraq last December before the U.S. and
Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification (for the UNSCOM) to come back after
they committed an aggression on Iraq and chairman of the
commission (Richard) Butler himself was colluding with the
aggressors and knew well that the aggression would take place,"
said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the recent detente in Iranian-Gulf
relations mainly with Saudi Arabia, Aziz said "We wish that the
relations among all the region's countries to be normal based on
international law and good neighborly relations."
</P>
<P>
On the country's current situation, Aziz said there is no
option for Iraq rather than steadfastness and adherence to
national and patriotic principles and values whatsoever the
sacrifices are.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will remain steadfast and will never surrender despite
blackmail practiced against it through hatching conspiracies and
embargo," he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO -- Chile will seek a solution to the Pinochet
case with every effort and means, Chile's President Eduardo Frei
told Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar here Monday.
</P>
<P>
8Frei said that his country "will search for every solution, be
it political, juridical or humanitarian."
</P>
<P>
Frei has tried to obtain Pinochet's freedom, arguing that
Garzon's request violates Chile's sovereignty because foreign
courts have no jurisdiction over its ex-leaders.
</P>
<P>
But Aznar accepted a court ruling that the request is legal. (

<P>
QINGDAO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hai'er Group, a major
electrical appliances producer based in Qingdao, a coastal city in
east China's Shandong Province, plans to establish an industrial
robot manufacturing center.
</P>
<P>
The project has already passed feasibility studies by a group
of experts organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology (
MST).
</P>
<P>
Li Jian, director of the MST's science and technology
department, said that China has put the manufacturing of
industrial robots high on its development agenda and that the Hai'
er project represents a major practical step forward.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, China has made much progress in the research
and development of robot technology over the past two decades or
so.
</P>
<P>
Hai'er set up its own robot research and development center
last year, laying a foundation for the manufacture of robots.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing center, scheduled to be operational by the
end of 2000, will concentrate on the development and production of
various types of industrial robots, such as those able to carry
cargo or conduct welding and other tasks.
</P>
<P>
Hai'er President Zhang Ruimin said that the project is aimed at
helping form a robotic industry in the country.

<HEADLINE> China Grows High-Yield Paddy Rice on Desert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agronomists have developed
a new technique which promotes the growth of high-yield paddy rice
on boundless stretches of desert.
</P>
<P>
The new technique was introduced to a 4,000-ha experimental
zone on the Badain Jaran Desert which borders on north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Gansu Province in the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
The technique involves lining 20-centimeter deep furrows with
plastic film for preserving both water and nutrient. Rice
seedlings are then planted on a 20-30 centimeter mounds of sand
filling the furrows.
</P>
<P>
The agronomists have also developed specialized seed breeding,
planting and field management techniques in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In this way, farmers have harvested 15 tons of rice from each
hectare of the land at Badain Jaran Desert, the third largest of
its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
"Growing crops on plastic film can save 60-80 percent of
available desert water and the per hectare yield there is anything
between 1,500 and 3,000 kg more than in ordinary farmland,"
according to Xiao Honglang, a research fellow with the Lanzhou
Desert Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Foreign desert specialists describe the method as "an
innovative approach for desert reclamation".
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has praised China
's desert development efforts and presented China with the "Best
Practices Award" on the World Desertification and Drought
Prevention Day which fell on June 17.
</P>
<P>
Japanese agronomists of the Tokyo University of Agriculture are
preparing to introduce the method to a desert cultivation base in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said the fact that desert farming requires substantially
more inputs than traditional agriculture is offset by greater
profits. He also noted a 1:5 cost-profit ratio for cash crops.
</P>
<P>
Higher initial investment cost of an average 15,000 yuan per
hectare is offset by the fact that the plastic sheeting can be
used for five years and irrigation cost can be reduced by between
33-66 percent.

<P>
He also noted such rice is not contaminated due to pollution-
free environment and there are few cases of harmful insects in
desert areas.
</P>
<P>
Deserts currently cover approximately 16 percent of China's
total territory.
</P>
<P>
Wang Gang, a professor with the Dry-Land Farming Laboratory
attached to Lanzhou University, described the technique as "a
nutrient box" for the paddy rice seedlings. "Promoting the
technique in China's vast desert areas will prove highly
beneficial," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The technique has been introduced to 30,000 ha of desert in
north China's Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest. Approximately
half of the desert area has paid off economically in various ways.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the technique can be used on condition of having
water sources, either surface or underground water.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Desert Institute has trained 200 technicians and
currently developing a more extensive training program as the
application of water in such desert areas calls for management
expertise.

<HEADLINE> Multilateral Forum on Mideast Peace Expected Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A multilateral forum is expected to
open next week in Cairo in a bid to seek ways of reviving the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli delegations will meet in the
three-day event, to be opened by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, the English-language paper said.
</P>
<P>
Former Egyptian Prime Minister Mustapha Khalil will chair the
forum.
</P>
<P>
Invited to the opening ceremony are Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
The gathering is expected to send a message to Israeli Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak, calling on him to step up efforts aimed
at pushing the peace drive forward, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks made little progress in the past
three years due to the intransigent policies of Barak's hardline
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Barak's victory in the May 17 elections has raised hopes for
the revival of the peace process as he pledged to embrace a
moderate stand on the negotiations with Israel's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Before and after his election, Barak promised to advance the
peacemaking with the Palestinians and resume the negotiations with
Syria and Lebanon which have been in a stalemate since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries that have sealed
peace treaties with the Jewish state, are key mediators in the
peace drive, along with the U.S., one of the co-sponsors of the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader Ocalan Sentenced to Death in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Ankara State Security
Court Tuesday sentenced Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), to death for treason.
</P>
<P>
The court gave Ocalan the death penalty as he "betrayed the
country."
</P>
<P>
The court said that it decided to sentence Ocalan to capital
punishment under Article 125 of Turkish Penal Code.
</P>
<P>
The article says that "the person who commits an act to bring a
part or whole of the state's territories under the hegemony of a
foreign state, or to subtract from the independence of the state,
or to disrupt the unity, or to separate some part of the
territories under the sovereignty of the state, will be punished
with death sentence."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and detained on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near
western Turkey's province of Bursa for trials on charges of
treason and separatism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts
between the the government troops and PKK rebels have claimed
over 37,000 lives and the government held Ocalan responsible for
the deaths.

GENEVA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Chamber of
Commerce (ICC) has called on the World Trade Organization (WTO)
members to launch a new round of negotiations on trade
liberalization and to finish the talks within three years.
</P>
<P>
In a press release Tuesday, the Paris-based ICC said that the
timing is right for a decision on the new round to be made at the
WTO ministerial conference scheduled in Seattle at the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
The ICC believed that a new broad-based round of talks would "
make a significant contribution to restoring confidence in the
prospects for the recovery of the world economy in the wake of the
emerging markets crisis."
</P>
<P>
It proposed that WTO members set up interim deadlines and
regular progress reviews to ensure that the talks would be
concluded relatively quickly, in about three years, so as to avoid
the delays that characterized the previous Uruguay Round.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tightening Sensitive Technology Export to HK Unreasonable: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate bill to impose
controls on the exports of "sensitive US technology" to Hong Kong
is totally unreasonable and will bring negative impact on the
economic development of Hong Kong, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressional allegation that sensitive US technology
was being transferred from Hong Kong to China's mainland is
totally groundless, the spokeswoman said at a regular press
conference.
</P>
<P>
China asked the U.S. Congress to immediately stop such actions
destructive to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the policy of "one country, two systems," "
Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong," and a high degree of
autonomy have been strictly implemented after Hong Kong returned
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Central Government and central departments
stationed in Hong Kong, including the PLA garrison forces, have
also strictly abided by the basic law and other laws of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), and that is the fact
known to all, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR Government has always imposed strict
restrictions and effective supervision on the import and export of
strategic goods, and has maintained good record, the spokeswoman
pointed out.

<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Explanation of the related
articles of the Hong Kong Basic Law by the Chinese National People
's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee conforms to China's
constitution and to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR itself,
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue stated at a press
conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the statement of a spokesman of the U.S.
Department of State that NPC's explanation would produce potential
impact on the judicial independence in Hong Kong, Zhang said that
the explanation is "necessary and appropriate".
</P>
<P>
She added that the explanation conforms to the original purpose
of the legislation, serves the comprehensive interest of Hong Kong
and the aspiration of Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman emphasized that the explanation would not
affect the independence of the legal and judicial systems there,
and in fact better serve the implementation of the principles of
the "One country, two systems", Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong and a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, as well as
safeguard and promote the long-term prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong affair is entirely China's internal affair,
which brooks no foreign interference," Zhang stressed.

development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has strictly implemented the principle
of 'one country, two systems' and the policy of 'high degree of
autonomy', giving the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
HKSAR) Government a free hand to handle Hong Kong's internal
affairs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong economy has been seriously affected by the Asian
financial turmoil in the past two years. Luckily, the Central
Government has kept the exchange rate of the Chinese currency (
Renminbi) unchanged and prevented it from devaluating, thus
greatly alleviating the pressure upon Hong Kong's economy.
Moreover, as Hong Kong is now vigorously developing itself into a
knowledge-based metropolis for facing up to the challenges of the
upcoming new millennium, the mainland has given it a strong
support in respect of scientific research and science and
technology personnel.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply convinced that in the new millennium, the world
people will all the more endorse the success of the 'one country,
two systems' principle and approve Chinese leaders' far-
sightedness. I am even more convinced that both Hong Kong and
Macao will develop better under the principle of 'one country, two
systems'," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his interview with Xinhua, professor Li Kwok Cheung, vice-
chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and also an
influential figure in Hong Kong's educational circles, said that
people may ask whether education and academic freedom are
guaranteed in Hong Kong two years after its return to China. "As a
member of the educational circles, my answer is definitely yes,"
he stated.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, after the return, university education in Hong Kong
has developed more comprehensively, and academic exchanges with
the inland areas, in particular, have become more frequent," he
said, adding that "academic research freedom is still respected
and all academic views can be aired freely."
</P>
<P>
We can likewise say that 'one country, two systems' principle
has also been well implemented in regard to education and academic
freedom, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong has given it a good opportunity to
disseminate the Chinese culture to the rest of the world, enabling
Hong Kong to more positively develop the Chinese culture by making
a direct use of its features and advantages and further promote
China's opening and the exchanges between Chinese and foreign
cultures. As time goes on, such a role of Hong Kong will become
even more clear, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Successful in HK (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The success of the principle of
'one country, two systems' is also manifested in the spheres of
freedom, rule of law and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Member of Hong Kong's Executive Council and Legislative Council
Tan Yiu Chung told Xinhua that due to protection by the Basic Law,
no restrictions have been imposed on these aspects and the
atmosphere in these spheres has become even more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true in the freedom of press, he said,
adding that there are no differences whatsoever between now and
the pre-return period. There are even some cases in which press
freedom has been somewhat abused. However the HKSAR Government has
never interfered, leaving it for the press circles to solve all by
itself through self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
Lawful mass parades and gatherings are never subject to any
restrictions. Citizens can sue the government in court whenever
they have complaints and such cases are numerous since the return
and the court has dealt with the cases all independently.
</P>
<P>
Apart from his routine work, he said, he usually takes two or
three nights out of his schedule every week going down to the
grass-roots levels and the people there are all happy to air their
opinions and he can reflect their views in good time at the
Executive Council meetings.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Yok Sing, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong and member of the Legislative Council,
said that the majority of Hong Kong people and foreigners in Hong
Kong agree that the basic rights of Hong Kong people, their
freedom and the rule of law have been guaranteed since the return
of Hong Kong to China. Some people had held the pessimistic view
that there would be no human rights and rule of law after the
return.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown that such a view does not hold any water
because it is groundless," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"In fact Hong Kong people are now enjoying more rights than
some people had predicted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of democracy, Tsang cited the election of HKSAR's
first Legislative Council last year as an example, saying that it
was conducted throughout in accordance with the methods stipulated
by the Basic Law and that the voters' turnout rate was higher than
any such elections before Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The process of examining and discussing the large number of
bills and government policies has also fully manifested the spirit
of democracy, he said, quoting from his personal experience. Some
powers which were concentrated in the hands of the government
during British colonial rule are now being gradually deregulated.
For instance, while the former Hong Kong British governments were
always free from some rules and regulations, the HKSAR Government,
following the changes after the return, has conscientiously
subjected itself to the rule of law in all its performances and
the Central Government's organs stationed in Hong Kong also do the
same, he commented.
</P>
<P>
That the principle of 'one country, two systems' and the policy
of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong have been well implemented
was a point particularly emphasized by Fung Kwok King, chairman of
Hong Kong Trade Development Council, in a recent interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only seen by Hong Kong people themselves, but also
approved by chambers of commerce of various countries in Hong Kong
and the business circles the world over," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who are familiar with Hong Kong still hope to do
business here. What is more, since Hong Kong is part of China,
they continue to regard Hong Kong as a base for furthering their
relations with China and pay even more attention to this base, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has therefore kept its competitive edges in the past
two years since its return to China," he stated.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
arrived here from Shenzhen Tuesday morning to attend an unveiling
ceremony of the Reunification Monument scheduled for July 1.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Hong Kong by the Chinese vice-
president since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR)two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hu told reporters upon arrival that he is "happy to join the
celebrations of the second anniversary of Hong Kong's return to
the motherland" and asked the media to convey his best wishes to
the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
Hu said he expects to exchange views with Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa on issues related to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Those who greeted Hu at Lok Ma Chau checkpoint included Tung,
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan, Acting Financial Secretary
Rafael Hui, and Justice Secretary Elsie Leung.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the vice-president on the visit are Liao Hui,
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council, and Chen Fujin, deputy director of the General Office of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, President Jiang Zemin led a Chinese government

SAR. Today, Hu is here to attend the ceremony to unveil the
Reunification Monument.

<HEADLINE> Major China Car Manufacturer Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Automotive Xiali Co.
Ltd. on Monday made an initial offering of 218 million A shares on
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, one of the only two bourses in China.
</P>
<P>
The company's stock was priced at 6 yuan per share yesterday.
The issue is expected to accumulate 1.28 billion yuan for the
company's expansion and technological upgrading program.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, all of China's five major car producers have become
listed. The two exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen have registered
24 automobile producers. Insiders announced that the capital
market has played a more important role in upgrading China's
automobile products.
</P>
<P>
The Xiali company, based in the north China city of Tianjin,
has grabbed 20 percent of the domestic car market, in which 510,
000 China-made cars were sold last year. It produced 100,000 cars
and sold 99,800 of them in 1998. Some 40 percent of taxis in China
are Xiali-branded cars.
</P>
<P>
The board of the company yesterday disclosed its forecast for
this year's revenue at 703 million yuan, up 5 percent on last year.
It also expects to sell 150,000 cars next year, which will mean 25
percent of the market at that time.
</P>
<P>
According to stock experts, China's car industry is
experiencing fiercer competition with last year's capacity
reaching 850,000 units. Meanwhile, car imports have brought even
heavier pressures on the market, which has been attributed to the
dropping of tariffs on finished car imports.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Donate Money for Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 29 (Xinhua) -- After Israel launched its bloodiest
air strike on Lebanon since 1996, Lebanon's all walks of life
donated money to help the cash-strapped government rebuild the
damages caused in the blitz.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading bank Byblos Bank has donated 1 million
U.S. dollars to the government for the reconstruction efforts, the
Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This donation is designed to help rebuild the power stations
and road networks that were hit by the Israeli planes," the bank
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Byblos said that the attack was aimed at destroying Lebanon's
national economy at a time when Lebanon is experiencing financial
hardships and recession.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Israel launched the biggest onslaught on
Lebanon since the 1996 "Grapes of Wrath" operations, killing
eight people and wounding 64.
</P>
<P>
The country's two power stations, three bridges linking the
capital to its south and a telephone relay station were also
destroyed in the attack which followed a cross-border Katyusha
barrage by guerrillas of Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that its attack served as a retaliation for
Hezbollah's offensive which killed two Israelis while the
Iranian-backed group argued it fired rockets into northern Israel
to avenge the wounding of six Lebanese civilians in Israel's
shelling.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's central bank has opened a special account to receive
local and foreign assistance in the wake of the Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
The four semi-finalists in this year's Lebanese Basketball
Championship have donated 36,000 dollars which are their earnings
from the competition to help the reconstruction cause.
</P>
<P>
Billionaire Saudi Prince Walid bin Talal, whose mother is a
Lebanese, has offered to foot the bill of rebuilding the power
stations estimated at 30 million dollars.

HARBIN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A mandarin duck and her seven
ducklings have suddenly appeared in a park in Harbin, northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, which is quite rare, said
zoologists.
</P>
<P>
Park staff found the ducks by accident several days ago. And Xu
Qing, zoologist in the Northeast China Forestry University,
explained that mandarin duck is a wild species which mostly lives
in valleys and near brooks.
</P>
<P>
Normally they will travel to the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze River to spend the cold winter and return to the
northeast of China in spring for breeding. Ornithologists believe
the ducks visit this very noisy park for the clean water and the
nice environment.
</P>
<P>
The province is abundant with wild creatures and natural
resources with statistics from 1998 indicating that there are 374
species of birds, 87 sorts of wild animals and 25 kinds of
reptiles and amphibians.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Sets Up FBI-style Cops to Fight Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has formed a new high-priority crimes investigation unit, similar
to the United States' FBI, as a cornerstone of the government's
coordinated approach to fighting crime, the Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint, unveiled in Parliament Monday, includes:
</P>
<P>
-- A new multidisciplinary national unit to investigate
priority crimes, improvement of police skills, tough measures to
deal with police killers and a new law to control illegal
firearms.
</P>
<P>
-- Involving civil society and the South African National
Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
-- Ongoing clean-up activities in a number of flashpoints.
These include roadblocks and cordon-and-search operations.
</P>
<P>
-- A call from National Director of Public Prosecutions
Bulelani Nguka for an urgent revamp of criminal-justice
legislation which will compel defense teams to disclose their
strategy in criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
-- Formal fortnightly meetings for safety and Security Minister
Steve Tshwete, Justice Minister Penuell Maduna and Correctional
Services Minister Ben Skosana to co-ordinate the anti-crime fight.
</P>
<P>
"The new structure will focus -- with the backup of highly
skilled personnel, effective equipment and adequate resources-- on
crime- intelligence gathering and the investigation and
prosecution of individuals and groups involved in priority
crimes," Tshwete said in Parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident he and other ministers involved would
be ready to brief President Thabo Mbeki before the end of next
week.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister Trevor Manuel was also being included in
the multidisciplinary approach and the recent two-day cabinet
meeting had unanimously agreed that something had to be done to
empower the police, Tshwete said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been haunted by a wave of rising crimes
involving gangs and firearms. Crimes have prompted an outflow of
foreign capital, and economists warn that if crimes are not
checked, the country's economy will be further affected.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Fully Privatize Telecom Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Government has
appointed a nine- member transitional management committee to help
wind up the delayed privatization process of state-owned giant
Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC).
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Transport and Communication Minister William Ntimama
said in the latest issue of the Kenya Gazette that the committee
would assist the corporation's board in the privatization process
and remain in office until completion, according to Tuesday's East
African Standard.
</P>
<P>
Privatization of KPTC is one of the preconditions for the
resumption of talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
over its 205 million U.S. dollars loan suspended in July 1997. A
team from the IMF arrived in Kenya on June 26 for a two-week
visit.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, KPTC will be split into three
entities: Telkom Kenya Limited, Kenya Postal Corporation and the
regulatory body Communications of Kenya by June 30.
</P>
<P>
Ntimama also said that the Kenya Communications Act and the
Postal Corporation of Kenya Act, which were recently publicized,
would come into effect on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government requested this month the World Bank for a
 partial extension of a 22.3 million dollars loan to finance the
privatization of KPTC, such as providing money to the redundant
workers.

<HEADLINE> Fish Losing Environment Struggles on Upper Reaches of Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Rare fish, including the Chinese
paddlefish and mullet, are under threat as a result of the
deteriorating water environment on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
A recent study, conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Hydrobiology, indicated that the population of
paddlefish and mullet has decreased rapidly in recent years. And
Chinese sturgeon has now disappeared on the upper reaches of the
river.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the variety of fish in general has decreased from
over 50 in the mid-1960's to 20 odd today, said Zhang Guohua, a
doctor with the institute.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons are attributed to over-fishing, water
pollution, and water facility construction.
</P>
<P>
The habitat of the fish should be preserved in order to
protect the rare fish, experts agree. However, it is unrealistic
to ban the construction of water facilities, for the river has
electricity generation, water transportation and other important
functions, the said.
</P>
<P>
"But we can choose one or two tributaries of the river to build
nature reserves for the rare fish," said Cao Wenxuan, chairman of
the executive council of the China Fish Society, and an
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Cao, after long studies, has suggested that the Chishui River,
a tributary of Yangtze, be very suitable for such reserves,
because it's natural environment is well preserved.
</P>
<P>
Some 109 kinds of fish, including 26 species which only live on
the upper reaches of Yangtze River, have been found there.

<HEADLINE> No Serious Flooding in Bangladesh This Year: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Experts here predict no serious
flooding in Bangladesh this monsoon although flash floods have hit
the country's southeastern greater Chittagong region following
several days of downpour.
</P>
<P>
"If anything abnormal doesn't happen...if everything goes as
predicted both in Bangladesh and India, we can hope that we won't
have to face another calamity (as that of last year),"
Meteorological Department Director Ershad Hossain said, The
Financial Express reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Similar views were expressed by Dr. Anwar Ali, chairman of the
Bangladesh Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization. He said
the current spell of downpour that caused flash floods mainly in
the hill districts it would continue hardly for one or two days.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC)
said all the rivers in the Southeastern hill basin marked fall and
were flowing below the danger levels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But water levels of most rivers covering the major districts
hit by the century's worst floods last year marked rise on Monday.
Sharif M. Rafiqul Islam, executive engineer at the Water
Development Board who is in charge of the FFWC, said there was no
need to be worried as next week's predictions didn't have
indication of floods.
</P>
<P>
"Water levels in the Ganges basin are still far below the
danger levels. Rivers in the Brahmaputra basin may cross the
danger levels only at one or two points which is not uncommon at
this moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
About the floods in the Chittagong region, he said flash floods
in the hills were a common phenomenon and the areas this season
already experienced one. "So, another flood in the three hill
districts is not being apprehended," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was badly hit by a prolonged flood last year, which
lasted from July to September, affecting two-thirds of the country
and inflicting an estimated loss of 4.3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thai Steel Giants to Merge to Cut Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's four major producers of
iron and steel for construction are expected to sign a memorandum
of understanding to merge their operation in order to cut costs,
the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The four companies, namely Siam Cement Plc, Nakornthai Stripped
Mill (NTS), Bangkok Steel Industry Plc (BSI) and Nam Heang Group,
collectively control more than half of the local market.
</P>
<P>
The plan, proposed by U.S.-based consultant McDonald Investment
and Securities, is aimed at ensuring the survival of the
companies, which are ridden with debts totaling between 2 billion
and 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, by cutting their production costs to
cope with a 40-percent slump in demand over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline in the construction sector means that the
companies are operating at only 30 percent of iron and steel
production capacity, well below viable economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
Against a combined capacity of 8 million tons, the four managed
to produce only 3 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Siam Cement will be the largest shareholder of the combined
entity since its two steel rod makers will be merged with the
three steel rod units of NTS, BSI and Nam Heang.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post quoted local industry experts as saying that
the merger is not intended to create a domestic monopoly or a
national cartel to compete with foreign countries, but to survive
the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
By working together, the producers would have stronger
negotiating power with supplies of raw materials and customers
abroad, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Lift Ban on Belgian Foodstuff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Thailand's
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative Ministry have been
instructed to consider lifting the ban on imported foodstuff from
Belgium, The Nation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move was the result of a meeting between Agriculture
Minister Pongpol Adireksarn and Belgian Ambassador Christina
Funes-Noppen on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai minister, Belgium has given an assurance
that ingredients of animal feed imported by Thailand after June
12, are not dioxin-contaminated.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian side confirmed that feed ingredients imported after
June 12 have been tested and proved to contain no dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Those which were imported prior to that date will be checked
and certified as safe if proved to be free from the chemical.
</P>
<P>
Another reason which makes the Thai minister issue an order to
departments concerned to consider lifting the ban is the mounting
fear among local businessmen that the ban may affect foreign
investment in the country and Thai workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Croatia continued their
protest Monday, demanding that the government stop importing
agricultural products and protect their interests, local press
reports said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 farmers placed road blocks in more than 30
places in northern Croatia and Slavonija as well as several border
paths leading to Slovenia, Hungary and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
As many as 12,000-15,000 farmers, who started their protests
last Saturday, blocked the roads with tractors and trucks in seven
out of 21 prefectures and asked to hold a dialogue with the
government.
</P>
<P>
They demand that the government ban import of agricultural
products until surplus domestic products are purchased. Besides
they demand that government pay back the money owned to them and
increase the wheat price from 1.1 kuna to 1.32 kuna per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the farmers' union held a talk with the government,
but the two sides did not reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa said that the farmers'
protest was illegal, causing the government great difficulties to
carry out its functions.
</P>
<P>
However, Matesa said, the government would not use force to
forbid the farmers from protesting.
</P>
<P>
Following the failure in the talks, union leaders said they
would organize protests on a larger scale, the reports said.

There is a total of 61,236 hectares of poppy cultivation area
in the country with an annual opium production of 665.28 tons

</P>
<P>
In its opium eradication efforts, Myanmar has been carrying out
cultivation of poppy-substitute crops in areas where poppy was
planted.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the cultivation area of the poppy substitute crops
such as sugarcane, jute, rubber and buckwheat stood at 5,898
hectares and it has planned to cultivate 4,916 hectares of such
crops in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Due to the expanded cultivation area of these substitute crops,
the production of drug and its supply are dropping.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the Myanmar government has been
implementing a 15-year plan for total opium eradication following
the declaration of Mongla region in eastern Shan state as an
"Opium-Free Zone" in April 1997, and the plan implementation has
been started in the priority areas of 51 townships under the

<HEADLINE> Land Trading to Go Public in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Provincial government recently instructed every county and city in
the province to replace the existing land-use transfer and lease
practices with public trading by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Zheng, director of the Guangdong Land Resource Department,
explained that the new market mechanism will help avoid "under-the-
table" land-use transfers.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, a pioneer in China's reform in land use, had either
leased or transferred land-use rights to over 40.9 percent of its
total available land by the end of last year. The province also
witnessed the emergence of small land-use trade markets in various
cities.
</P>
<P>
However, Yuan pointed out ineffective regulation of the markets
has led to complaints and lawsuits involving illegal land deals,
as well as tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
"The market, instead of the government, will control land-use
transfers in the future," according to Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The local government expects the new land-use markets to
promote the effective use of idle land resources.

JAKARTA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- With only five weeks to go till
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam, the
Indonesian Basketball Association (Perbasi) is yet to name its
main squad, The Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Three players, who were eliminated from the team last week,
appear likely to be asked to rejoin the training program.
</P>
<P>
Team manager Danny Kosasih said the association would recall
the players if the 12 members of the team failed to improve their
performances within the remaining training period.
</P>
<P>
"The three players joined the training before. They understood
our play and strategy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Basketball players will leave for a tryout in the
Philippines on June 30 and will return to Jakarta on July 8.

<P>
Danny said his players had to improve their defense skills and
break a psychological barrier of being afraid to lose.
</P>
<P>
He said some players needed to improve their movements on court,
particularly when surrounded by their opponents.
</P>
<P>
Danny still hoped his players could grab a silver in the
biennial event, which will take place from August 7 to 15.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks in Tianjin Show Strong Performance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Branch of China's
central bank, has recently released statistics showing that 13 of
25 foreign financial institutions in the northern port city makes
a profit.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) release shows that profits
for related institutions grew by 27 percent to 15.72 million US
dollars in 1998 in spite of the adverse impact of the Asian
Financial Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for May show total net profits for all foreign banks
in Tianjin hit 7.35 million U.S. dollars, up 46.4 percent on April.
</P>
<P>
The volume of foreign funds flowing into the major financial
center in north China over the past few years has prompted a
number of financial institutions from the United States, Japan,
the Republic of Korea (ROK), Britain, France, Singapore and Hong
Kong to expand operations. Total assets for related institutions
have grown 20-fold on 1993 to over 2.4 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Investment Confidence Returns to Emerging Markets: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Corporations around the world
are increasing their foreign direct investment as they acknowledge
more stable global economic conditions, according to a report
released Monday by a U.S. consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
Confidence in the global investment environment has risen over
the past six months, said the semi-annual survey of top executives
of Global 1000 companies conducted by A.T. Kearney, one of the
world's largest management consulting firms. The firm's foreign
direct investment index compares the relative likelihood of direct
investment in 60 countries over the next one to three years.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the firm said, 33 percent of senior executives
surveyed indicate a more positive outlook than six months ago and
75 percent plan to maintain or slightly increase their investments
abroad. In particular, Japanese corporate investors are more
likely to invest abroad today than they were six months ago.
</P>
<P>
After two years of instability in emerging markets, Brazil's
decision to devalue its currency early this year did not lead to
further system-wide breakdown. As a result, the report said, fears
that the emerging market crisis inexorably would become global
have subsided.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in last December, when the greatest concern for
executives was the future of emerging markets, the report said,
the focus now has shifted to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Today, 87 percent of respondents say their greatest concern is
whether U.S. economic growth will remain robust enough to continue
fueling global recovery and driving the investment outlook
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The United States remains the most attractive investment
destination, with 40 percent of corporations surveyed saying that
they are highly likely to invest in this market.
</P>
<P>
Investors continue to be cautious about Japan, as 85 percent of
the executives worldwide say that Japanese recession is adversely
affecting their investment plans.
</P>
<P>
While corporate confidence in Europe and Latin America has
waned over the past six months, Asia as a whole is relatively more
attractive than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
China is now second only to the United States as the most
preferred investment destination, taking the number two ranking
previously held by Brazil. But according to the survey, although
China is also ranked as the most attractive emerging market
worldwide, China's overall attractiveness to investors has
deteriorated. Twenty-seven percent of executives surveyed consider
China's outlook more negative than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, 51 percent of senior executives investing Asia
indicate that the Asian crisis has created acquisition
opportunities for their firms. South Korea appears to be the main
beneficiary of this trend.

<P>
Foreign financial institutions manage their business affairs in
accordance with international practices and quickly recognize
potentially profitable areas. They have abandoned the former
practice of focusing solely on enterprises from their own country
and have substantially increased loans to China's state-owned
enterprises, with the total loan volume for 1998 hitting 165
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Managers of foreign banks note that efficient supervision and
administration in China has not only helped foreign financial
institutions reduce risk, but has also created a good environment
for earning profits.
</P>
<P>
China's financial departments have not only issued explicit
regulations and laws, but also conducts regular audits of foreign-
funded financial organization to prevent any potential dangers and
problems.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that foreign-funded financial organizations have a
bright future in China and will benefit from the nation's
sustainable development and economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
PBOC statistics show that 89 foreign financial institutions
from 21 countries and regions had established 178 branches in
various cities in China by the end of 1998, with an additional 164
foreign banks from 38 countries and regions opening representative
offices.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial institutions were previously allowed to
operate in only 23 cities and Hainan Province, However, the PBOC's
decisions in January this year allowing them to conduct business
activities in all major cities throughout the nation and conduct
Renminbi transactions on a trial basis have encouraged further
development of China's financial market.

<HEADLINE> IOC Denies Tax Fraud Allegations by Swiss Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic Committee
denied on Monday in Lausanne it had been involved in any form of
tax fraud and falsification of documents.
</P>
<P>
"It's not true," IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said,
referring to the allegations made last week by a Swiss magazine. "
It's as simple as that."
</P>
<P>
The Lausanne weekly L'Hebdo printed what it said was a secret
Swiss government memorandum describing the alleged IOC misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The magazine claimed that Swiss authorities had not taken
action because the Swiss town Sion had been campaigning for the
2006 Winter Games then. The IOC finally chose Italy's Turin.
</P>
<P>
Servan-Schreiber said the IOC had an unwritten agreement with
local Vaud state authorities, dating back to 1971, that exempted
foreign workers from tax on 30 percent of earnings and Swiss
employees from tax on 15 percent of earnings.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Some European Firms Do Well Than Others in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that most
European companies in China are doing well and believe that their
performance will improve significantly within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Fiducia Co. Ltd. under the
sponsorship of the Delegation of the European Commission in
Beijing, looks into the situation of European investment in China
and the reasons why some companies are more successful than others,
according to Tuesday's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 percent of the companies surveyed felt unsatisfied, and
among the rest of the well-doing ones the joint ventures turned
out to be more successful than wholly owned ones, the survey
indicates.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that those successful companies in China
provide the domestic market with products of the same quality as
in Europe, and that they use local raw materials and semi-finished
products to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, successful companies have also spent more time
visiting China before establishing a business, conducted more
market tests than unsuccessful companies, and made good use of
market surveys, especially those concerning potential demand and
competition.

<HEADLINE> Economic Policy Should Focus on Better Livelihood: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The central government's policy of
expanding domestic demand should aim at not only preventing
economic recession but, more importantly, improving people's
living standards, a leading Chinese economist says.
</P>
<P>
Among all the development goals, job creation should top the
agenda of both the central and local governments, Hu Angang, a
researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says.
</P>
<P>
Hu makes the suggestion in an article published in today's
China Daily, which calls for "fundamental changes" in orientation
of economic policies.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, China's employment situation has failed to keep
up with the country's rapid economic growth, Hu says.
</P>
<P>
China's workforce amounts to 26.3 percent of the world's total,
but its capital resources is just 3.4 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, China's economic growth should help
create more jobs, he says, adding that in the short term, it
should try to keep the unemployment rate to be between five and
six percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, reform of the social welfare system, including
workers' pension insurance, unemployment insurance and medical
insurance, should precede the reform of state-owned enterprises,
because the success of the latter to a large extent hinges on the
former, he says.
</P>
<P>
He suggests that the state make bold reforms in areas
applicable to the general populace in fields such as
telecommunications and higher education.
</P>
<P>
While boosting efficiency-oriented economic growth, the
government should also adhere to the principle of fairness in
providing public services such as elementary education, public
health, family planning and, with special reference to rural areas,
ensuring the supply of clean drinking water and making power more
affordable, he says.
</P>
<P>
Due to insufficient funds, unemployment support payments are
very low and differ greatly among regions, Hu says, noting that
some enterprises are already in arrears in paying pensions and
salaries.
</P>
<P>
These deficiencies constitute a serious threat to the country's
social stability, Hu says.
</P>
<P>
To further expand domestic demand, a vital task is to increase
income and consumption among low-income residents, he says.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Helping Relocation of Enterprises in Three Gorges Dam Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC), one of China's four state banks, will help the
relocation of industrial enterprises in the Three Gorges Dam
region with a new fund.
</P>
<P>
The relocation fund for the dam project was managed by the
China Construction Bank until the State Council decided to entrust
part of the fund to ICBC's provincial branches in July this year.
</P>
<P>
"The move is to facilitate transfer of the funds to industrial
enterprises since more than 600 of the 1,000 or so enterprises in
the region have accounts at ICBC," Xie Duyang, vice president of
ICBC, was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
ICBC has asked all its branches to manage the account in a
separate manner in a bid to guard against any diversion, Xie said,
adding that the bank will also support the readjustment of the
financial structure in the region by granting loans to enterprises
or projects showing high profitability or receiving State priority.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding loans to enterprises in the region from ICBC had
exceeded that of other banks, hitting seven billion yuan (843
million U.S. dollars) by the end of 1998, and a number of large
and medium-sized state enterprises had successfully completed
their relocation with the loans, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, the bank had extended a total of 4.3 billion
yuan (518 million U.S. dollars) and 78 million U.S. dollars in
loan to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam as well as
related projects including an airport and several highways.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Appeals for WB Loans to Clear Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Croatia on Monday urged the World
Bank to provide it with loans for the clearance of more than one
million landmines deployed in the country during the civil war in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Jaranka Kosor, deputy speaker of the Croatian Parliament, made
the appeal in a speech to an international meeting on landmines
which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kosor said Croatia needs some two billion dollars to clear all
landmines used in the civil war which erupted following the
disintegration of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
She said that Croatia, a signatory to the international
convention forbidding the use, production, transport and storage
of landmines, has asked the World Bank to grant it loans for the
clearance of landmines laid in an area of 6,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, which has received 1.5 million dollars in aid from
Canada and the United States for the removal of landmines,
destroyed 3,500 landmines on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The international meeting was attended by representatives from
10 European countries, Canada and Chile.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Booming in Batam, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital investment in
Indonesia's Batam island has amounted 13.5 million U.S. dollars
since the beginning of this year, boosted by the June 7 general
election.
</P>
<P>
"In this month of June four foreign companies have invested 1.5
million dollars, bringing the total number of foreign investment
companies in Batam in the January-June period to 18," Batam
authority's capital investment division chief Bachrudin Amir said
in Batam Monday.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that by the end of 1999 another 50 investors from
Singapore, the United States, Switzerland, Malaysia, Britain,
Canada, Norway, Japan and other countries are expected to invest
in Batam.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the situation in the previous year, now foreign
investors consider Batam as a safe place for investment thanks to
the low inflation rate and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar,"
Antara News Agency Tuesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
As an industrial zone, Batam has a competitive edge because of
its close proximity to Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Investment in Batam up till now and including 1998 stood at 7
billion dollars from 350 companies, 77 percent of which are
private investment, and 23 percent government investment.
</P>
<P>
During that period there had been 56 additional projects worth
a total of 108 million dollars. The keen interest of foreign
investors in doing business in Batam, Bachrudin said, was not only
due to the fact that it is a relatively safe place but also
because of its numerous facilities, which make it highly
competitive against Vietnam and other countries.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is God's gift to place Batam in such a strategic
location compared to its competitors in Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Not only are wages relatively low in Batam, the authorities
also exempt machinery and raw materials from import duties and
provide sales tax exemption and tax holidays for pioneer
industries.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Chief of the Batam Authority Ismeth Abdullah said
no foreign investor had left Batam after the onset of the economic
crisis in the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
To date there are 350 foreign companies operating in Batam,
employing about 160,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
Batam is also one of Indonesia's main tourist destinations
besides Jakarta and Bali, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, more than 1.2 million foreign tourists visited Batam,
up by 4.8 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> China to conduct national check-up on petroleum product quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) The State Administration of Petroleum
and Chemical Industries has recently issued a notice regarding the
national inspection of the quality of petroleum products processed
by small refineries.
</P>
<P>
The notice required all small refineries, scaled at a capacity
below 1 million tons/year, granted with national crude allocation
in 1998 and able to produce unleaded gasoline with an octane
number exceeding 90, to submit applications to their local
superiors before July 10 for product quality inspection.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau for Quality and Technical Supervision (SBQTS)
is responsible for the product survey which is scheduled to be
conducted in the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
If these refineries fail to submit an application before July
10, the notice said, SBQTS will not conduct any product surveys on
them and they will be considered unable to produce unleaded
gasoline numbered over 90.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had had 156 small refineries,
each with an annual capacity of one million tons, accounting for
75% of the total number of refineries in the country.
</P>
<P>
The notice also asked small refineries producing mainly asphalt
to deliver detailed reports on their production to their immediate
superiors before July 10.

<HEADLINE> Dokic Keeps Dream Alive at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian qualifier Jelena Dokic
kept her dream alive in Grand Slam with a straight set victory
over Mary Pierce of France on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ranked 129th and competing in only her third Grand Slam, Dokic,
at 16, sent her second top seed packing by defeating the ninth
seed rival 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Only five matches of the scheduled 16 were completed before
play was called off at 1830 GMT as rain swept across the All
England Club.
</P>
<P>
The women's quarter-finals were due to take place on Tuesday
but only 16-year-old qualifier Jelena Dokic, third seed Lindsay
Davenport and defending champion Jana Novotna have sealed their
places in the last eight. Organisers face a problem trying to fit
the 11 remaining fourth round games into the programme.
</P>
<P>
Dokic, the Australian sensation who toppled women's top seed
Martina Hingis in the first round, now plays either Lisa Raymond
or her compatriot Alexandra Stevenson, also a qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Only two other qualifiers have reached the women's quarter-
finals before at Wimbledon, the last being Molly van Nostrand of
the U.S.in 1985, and a semifinal place is now firmly in Dokic's
sights.
</P>
<P>
Novotna used her wealth of grass court experience to outplay
Nathalie Dechy of France 6-3, 7-5 on Monday and book a match with
Davenport, but it was a struggle all the way.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, the third seed, had the rain to thank as she
dispatched 14th seed Barbara Schett 7-6, 6-1. The match was
stopped for 70 minutes with the American 3-5, 0-30 down, and after
the break the Austrian lost her momentum.
</P>
<P>
Davenport saved six set points in the first set before taking
the tiebreak 9-7.
</P>
<P>
In the men's draw, fourth seed Andre Agassi of the United
States faced a serious test before he defeated Australian
qualifier Wayne Arthurs 6-7, 7-6, 6-1, 6-4 and earn a place in the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Agassi now plays Gustavo Kuerten, the Brazilian 11th seed who
had never won a match on grass before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten beat Swiss qualifier Lorenzo Manta of Switzerland, a
man who had not won a match on the senior men's tour before
Wimbledon '99, 7-5, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
When the play was suspended, second women's seed Steffi Graf
was a set and 4-2 up against Belgian qualifier Kim Clijsters while
local hero and sixth seed Tim Henman was leading American Jim
Courier by two sets to one and 4-3.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia's Karol Kucera was two sets to one down against French
Cedric Pioline, the losing men's finalist in 1997.

</P>
<P>
Leanne Carey told a tabloid newspaper Keane, who is also
captain of the Republic of Ireland's team, had kicked her in the
thigh after pouring a pint of beer over her friend.
</P>
<P>
But a rival newspaper later reported that Keane had been "
minding his own business" when a group of women approached and
threw a glass at him.
</P>
<P>
Keane was out with United team-mates David Beckham, Gary
Neville, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole celebrating United's
Premiership title win 48 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: "Following a full
investigation, a file of evidence in relation to this matter was
submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service on 23 June.
</P>
<P>
"The written advice has now been received from the CPS and
following full consideration of all the facts, no further action
will be taken by Greater Manchester Police relating to the
aforementioned incident."
</P>
<P>
Keane's lawyer, Mike Kennedy, said: "We are happy with the
decision, it is the right decision."
</P>
<P>
Keane has worked hard in recent seasons to curb his notoriously
hot temper on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
He is hero worshipped by many Manchester United fans and his
absence, through injury, from most of the 1997/8 season is widely
considered to be the reason United lost out to Arsenal in both the
Championship and FA Cup.

<HEADLINE> Chile Seeks Solution to Pinochet Case in Rio Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chile will seek a solution
to the Pinochet case with every effort and means, Chile's
President Eduardo Frei told Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chilean officials said that the two leaders held a meeting
prior to the inauguration of the Latin America-EU summit attended
by 48 Latin American and European leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two discussed issues of common interest,
especially the case of former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Frei said that his country "will search for every solution, be
it political, juridical or humanitarian."
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in October in London at the request of
Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants to try him for the human
rights violations during his 1973-1990 term.
</P>
<P>
Frei has tried to obtain Pinochet's freedom, arguing that
Garzon's request violates Chile's sovereignty because foreign
courts have no jurisdiction over its ex-leaders.
</P>
<P>
But Aznar accepted a court ruling that the request is legal.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Ruling Center-left Coalition Wins Local </HEADLINE>

<P>
ROME, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Ruling Center-left coalition
won the Italy's local administrative elections which were held in
66 provinces and 28 provincial capitals in two rounds last Sunday
and June 13, but conceding the traditional bastion of the left,
Italian central city of Bologna, and Italian north province of
Milan to the opposing Center-right.
</P>
<P>
According to the final result unveiled by Italian news agency
of ANSA Monday, among the 66 provinces up for renewal in the
contests opening June 13, 46 went to the Center-left and 20 to the
Center-right, a line-up which compares to 55 held by the
Center-left before the vote, seven by the Center-right and four by
the North League.
</P>
<P>
In the 28 provincial capitals, 19 wound up in Center-left hands
and nine with the Center-right, compared to 24 in the Center-left
camp on the eve of the elections and four held by the
Center-right.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema recognized Monday in Rio
de Janeiro of Brazil that the Center-left's defeat in Bologna
after more than fifty years of left-wing or center-left rule was
"grave and painful".
</P>
<P>
But, talking to reporters before the opening of the summit of
EU and Latin American leaders there, he pointed out that, despite
the Center-left losses in provincial and city elections,
Center-left administrations remain "prevalent by a large margin"
in local government.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved
higher Monday as investors were convinced that the Federal
Reserve would raise interest rates by only a quarter
percentage point at its meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 102.59 at
10,655.15. The index lost 303 points last week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 16.04 at 1,331.35 and the technology
heavy Nasdaq index rose 49.79 at 2,602.44.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve was widely expected to raise interest
rates by 0.25 percent to cool off the U.S. economy at its Open
Market Committee meeting on June 29-30. The expectation relieved
investors' worries about more increases in interest rates that
would hit the economy.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 5.55 at 628.89 and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.08 at 774.10.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.50 at 448.61.

<HEADLINE> IMF Augments Bosnia and Herzegovina's Stand-By Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Monday approved an augmentation of 23 million U.S.
dollars and an extension to end-April 2000 of Bosnia and
Herzegovina's stand-by credit that was approved in May, 1998, in
an amount of 81 million dollars, bringing total financial support
to 104 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Today's decision was made in conjunction with completion of
the first review, and makes an amount equivalent to 39 million
dollars available immediately," the IMF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Directors commended the authorities for the solid
macroeconomic performance in 1998, particularly as regards the
continued decline in inflation. They considered that this success
stemmed from strict adherence to currency board rules, together
with prudent fiscal policies," said Stanley Fischer, the IMF's
Deputy Managing Director.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also praised the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina
for persevering with its stabilization and reform efforts despite
the challenges posed by the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Directors considered that further strengthening of government
finances was critical, and urged the authorities, particularly
those at BiH state level, to improve the timeliness of reporting
budget execution," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to accelerate structural reforms
and improve governance in order to foster sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia and Herzegovina has made important progress toward a
sustainable market economy, and economic developments have been
broadly in line with program expectations, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The country's output expanded by approximately 20 percent in
1998, although it remains at one-third of its level before the
1992-1995 war, and economic recovery remains weak and largely aid
driven, said the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Studies on China's Internet Market Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ENGELES, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Internet user base will
exceed 33 million by 2003, growing at an annual rate of nearly 60
percent over the next five years, a U.S. market research firm reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Chinese Internet users will climb from 2.1 million last
year to more than 6.7 million, according to the Strategis Group, which
has recently conducted a study jointly with BDA (China) Limited, the
leading Internet and telecom market strategy firm in China.
</P>
<P>
The two firms suggest that China is already the fastest growing
Internet market in Asia and will become one of the world's leading
markets in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
With more than 33 million users by 2003, according to the joint
study, each new user that comes online creates new opportunities for
Internet-related business, enabling companies to leverage their
technology, service or capital in "one of the world's most exciting
Internet markets."
</P>
<P>
China's market for Internet service providers (ISP) is experiencing
"survival of the fattest," the Strategis Group said. Those ISPs,
typically owned or funded by China Telecom, with access to the fattest
pipes such as dial-up lines, leased lines and Internet bandwidth, have
emerged on top. Nevertheless, opportunities are growing for new
players, including cable TV operators, to tap revenues in the ISP
market, which are forecast to exceed 4 billion U.S. dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
China also presents a burgeoning market opportunity for Internet
equipment, software and service. This sector is expected to exceed 160
million U.S. dollars in 1999. Foreign vendors currently dominate
China's Internet infrastructure market, but domestic players are
expanding their efforts to serve this growing market, said the
Strategis Group.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released early this year by China Internet
Network Information Center (CINIC), the number of Internet users in
China has been growing at an annual rate of over 100 percent. The
center's more conservative estimation is that the users will surpass
six million by 2000.
