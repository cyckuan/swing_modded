<HEADLINE> Pak Conscious of Its Responsibility on Nuclear Issue: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Wednesday stated that Islamabad will
discharge its responsibility on the nuclear issue sincerely,
stressing that all its nuclear assets are under "an excellent
command and control arrangement."
</P>
<P>
Receiving live interview at CNN, Musharraf said Pakistan's
nuclear capability is purely for self-defense and the country has
no aspirations for world power status.
</P>
<P>
"Our nuclear capability is aimed at minimum deterrence - we
have no aspirations of world status - our capability is purely for
our own self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he underlined, is fully conscious of its
responsibility on the nuclear question.
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge responsibility on our shoulders and let me
assure the world that we will discharge our responsibility
sincerely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said his government is conscious of the world concern
on the question of signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's signing the CTBT requires national consensus and
CTBT's coming into effect is not being held by Pakistan's not
signing it - therefore, I fail to understand pressures on Pakistan
for signing the treaty without national consensus."
</P>
<P>
On the relations with India, Musharraf reiterated dialogue
offer to India but called for a third party mediation as bilateral
talks between the two sides have failed to resolve the core issue
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Time has come for mediation. Mediation is essential. But I am
open to dialogue with India if it suits India," said the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his readiness to talk to India anywhere, anytime,
saying that it was his commitment. "And, I mean it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf also called for international engagement of the
Afghan Taliban militia for progress on the issues of terrorism,
Osama bin Laden and peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said the Taliban are running their country
and the "issue of Osama bin Laden is between the Taliban,
Afghanistan and the United States and anyone who thinks that Osama
is involved in terrorist activities".
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the issue of Afghanistan can be resolved in
its entirety and complexity if all these issues are addressed.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Greek City Discovered in Mediterranean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A French-Egyptian archaeological
mission has discovered an ancient city dating back to the Greek era
in the water near Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency reported on Thursday that led by
French adventurer Franc Godeo, the mission found the lost city of
Herculum six meters deep in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The location was four kilometers off the Abu Qir Bay to the
northeast of Alexandria, the news agency said, without giving the
date of the discovery.
</P>
<P>
Herculum is the second Greek city found in the sea near
Alexandria. The first was the city of Menotus discovered in 1934.
</P>
<P>
Six cities built in the ancient Greek era around 320 BC sank
into the sea off the northern coast of Egypt when a major
earthquake rocked the area in the ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of Herculum helped unravel a mystery about Abu
Qir, which was originally known as Canub dedicated to the worship
of God Osiris, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the mission found more than 100
statues in various sizes and shapes belonging to the Greek,
Ptolemaic (305 BC to 30 BC) and Roman (30 BC to 395 AD) eras, it
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and British warplanes
Thursday dropped incendiary bombs on farms in northern Iraq, a
military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 1015 local time (0615 GMT), nine
formations of U.S. and British warplanes from the airspace of
Turkey carried out 18 armed sorties over northern Iraqi provinces
of Dohuk, Neiveva and Erbil, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came amid Iraq's upcoming harvest season, aiming to
inflict more damage on the country's economy, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman affirmed Iraqi air defenses fired at the invading
planes, forcing them to flee to their bases in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Thursday's attacks brought to 21,521
the total number of armed sorties from Turkey, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait since December 1998, when the U.S. and Britain launched the
four-night air strikes codenamed Operation Desert Fox air against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British planes have been patrolling the two no-fly
zones in the north and south of Iraq, set up after the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the zones, which are not covered by any
U.N. resolution.

BEIRUT, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Middle East Envoy Roed Larsen
Thursday held talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime
Minister Salim Hoss on the Israeli-Lebanese border division.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Larsen told reporters the two sides aired their
views on the border issue and decided to dispatch experts to
conduct an on-the-spot survey later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the U.N. and Lebanon will hold a meeting on the issue
on the basis of the results of the survey, the National News Agency

Larsen is holding shuttle talks among Israel, Lebanon and Syria
on verifying Israel's withdrawal.

The Lebanese government has refused repeatedly to deploy troops
in south Lebanon after the Israeli pullout on May 24 from the
region, where the resistance group Hezbollah and Amal movement are

<HEADLINE> Iraq Voices Readiness to Develop Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government and Iraq's
ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party are willing to develop ties with
China, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan made the remarks while meeting Su Rong, an alternative
member of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee who arrived
here on Sunday for an official visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramadan reviewed the diplomatic, trade and
economic developments that have been achieved through the long-term
exchanges and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It conforms to the interests of the Iraqi government as well as
the Arab Baath Socialist Party to develop relations with China,
Ramadan said.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan condemned the United States and Britain for continuing
patrolling and bombing the so-called no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq since December 1998, when the United States and
Britain launched the four-night air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council and the international
community shoulder the responsibility of halting the aggressive
acts of the U.S. and Britain, the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Su Rong, who is heading a Chinese Communist Party
delegation, reiterated China's stand that the Iraqi issue should be
reasonably resolved within the framework of relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the friendly relations between the
two governments and the two ruling parties will be further
expanded.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by Chinese Ambassador to Iraq Zhang Weiqiu
and Iraqi officials, followed Su Rong's talks with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Yemen's Foreign Exchange Reserve Hits 2 Billion U. S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The foreign exchange reserve at the
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) has exceeded two billion U.S. dollars,
the highest level in the history of the Yemeni economy.
</P>
<P>
The rise is attributed to the economic, fiscal and monetary
reforms adopted by the Yemeni government since 1995 under a request
from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
Yemeni News Agency (YNA) reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reserve represents a 33 percent increase since early this
year, thus placing the national economy on a secure position.
</P>
<P>
YNA also attributed the increase to the improvement of oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's income from oil exports, the main source of foreign
exchange in the country, went up from 1.4 billion U.S. dollars last
year to 1.8 billion U.S. dollars early May and exceeded two billion
at present.
</P>
<P>
Oil products account for 95 percent of Yemen's exports and their
value hit 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Yemen started exporting oil in 1988 when its total revenues
stood at 397 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Europe Needs Strong Energy Market, Says Greek Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek Development Minister Nikos
Christodoulakis said here Thursday that Europe needed a strong
energy market that would respect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day European energy conference, which began
Thursday, Christodoulakis said that creating a European energy
market needed a regulatory framework to regulate private and state
behavior and motives to implement the necessary energy
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
As for the efforts made by Greece to liberalize its energy
market, he described the forthcoming floatation of the state-run
Public Power Corporation (PPC), the completion of a tender to
supply household electricity in northern Greece and the creation
of an energy futures market as important steps.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that an agreement between Greece and
Turkey to draft a feasibility study on new energy transport routes
from the Caspian Sea to Europe and a Greek-Italian cooperation in
the energy sector were of great importance.
</P>
<P>
The energy conference, which was organized by the European
Union (EU) and Greece's Development Ministry, aims to promote
cooperation  between the EU, the Black Sea and Mediterranean
countries in major energy issues.

<HEADLINE> Police Storms Day-Care Center to Save Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Police Thursday launched an armed
assault on the day-care center where an armed man had held more
than two dozens of children hostage for 28 hours.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports said that police forces stormed the
nursery school at Wasserbillig near the Luxembourg-Germany border
and the hostage taker was reportedly shot by a police sniper.
</P>
<P>
But there was no report on any casualty on the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the 39-year-old man, armed with a pistol,
a hand grenade and a knife, held 25 children and three female
adults hostage in the nursery school from Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, the man, who had been demanding to be
flown out to Libya with around 20 million francs (220,000 U.S.
dollars released four children including one aged just over two.
</P>
<P>
The youngest child held captive was believed to be only 22
months old.
</P>
<P>
The police from both Luxembourg and Germany launched an armed
assault though Luxembourg Interior Minister Michel Wolter
instructed earlier that no violence should occur in the solution
of the hostage taking crisis.
</P>
<P>
The gunman was said to be from Tunisia originally and settled
down in Luxembourg in 1982 and had a history of mental problems.
</P>
<P>
He had released 10 children late on Wednesday after he was
allowed to speak to his psychiatrist.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals Court Denies Asylum Hearing for Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal appeals court
Thursday ruled in favor of the father of Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez,
saying the boy is not entitled to a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta said the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
decision that only a parent can act for his 6-year-old child in
immigration matters "comes within the range of reasonable choices.
"
</P>
<P>
It said the principle held true even if the parent was in
another country and the child was in the United States, affirming
a March U.S. district court ruling that Elian's father, who wants
to take his son back to Cuba, has the rights to speak for Elian.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's new power-sharing
government met at the parliament building in Stormont, Belfast for
the first time in three months.
</P>
<P>
Only 10 of the 12 ministers attended with the Democratic
Unionist Party's Peter Robinson and Nigel Dodds staying away.
</P>
<P>
The DUP said it would rotate its ministers in the power-sharing
executive if the party does not get support for its motion to
exclude Sinn Fein from government.
</P>
<P>
But Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble and Deputy
First Minister Seamus Mallon have reacted angrily to the plan.
</P>
<P>
They summoned the DUP ministers to a meeting on Monday to
explain how the plan will affect the government departments.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who leads the Ulster Unionist Party, said the
executive planned to assess the impact of the rotation plan on
services and "consider appropriate action".
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier on Thursday, regional development minister
Peter Robinson denied that his party's rotation plan was designed
to disrupt the executive.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the DUP would rotate ministers, its
policies would remain the same.
</P>
<P>
Among the other issues discussed at Thursday's three-hour
meeting was the flying of the Union flag over government buildings.
</P>
<P>
Ministers put off any decision, agreeing to "monitor the
situation and try to get an agreement".

<HEADLINE> Cuba Reacted with Caution after Legal Verdict on Boy Elian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 1 (Xinhua) --Cuban authorities reacted Thursday
with caution following U.S. Court of Appeals of Atlanta
announcement refusing right of political asylum to boy Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
An official item disclosed by all Cuban media said it isn't
clear if the boy will be able to go back right away to Cuba, or on
the contrary will be retained in United States for an indefinite
time.
</P>
<P>
The text notified that distant relatives of the boy's lawyers
and anti-Cuban groups backing them have announced they are ready
to appeal..
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Gonzalez family are living in a Rosedale
residence, Washington, from where they hope to return to their
island after the Atlanta Court verdict regarding political
asylum resources put in by distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
Elian Gonzalez isn't entitled to an asylum hearing, a court
ruled Thursday, in a victory for the Cuban boy's father, who wants
him to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Under the Atlanta court's ruling, Elian must remain in the
United States for 14 days to give his Miami relatives a chance to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton was pleased with the ruling, saying
the father is best suited to speak for the Cuban boy. "This is a
case about the importance of family and the bond between a father
and son," Clinton said in a statement from Berlin, where he was on
a weeklong European tour.
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel of the Atlanta court said the Immigration
and Naturalization Service's decision that only a parent can act
for his 6-year-old child in immigration matters "was within the
outside border of reasonable choices." It said that principle held
even if the parent was in another country and the child was in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the relatives said Thursday that they have not
decided whether they will request a rehearing. Lawyer Kendall
Coffey called the decision "very painful," but he said the 11th
Circuit judges "have been very fair."

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Group Denies Press Claim on Obsolete Pesticide Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican environmental group,
Livaningo, has denied a claim in a Maputo newspaper "Correio de
Manha" that it wanted to export the obsolete pesticides currently
stored in Matola to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A Livaningo press release said on Thursday that Livaningo had
never been involved in any discussions on this matter, and had
merely suggested to the Environment Ministry some possible
destinations for the pesticides.
</P>
<P>
These destinations were Holland, Britain and Denmark -- all
European countries with the facilities for destroying such toxic
waste safely.
</P>
<P>
Livaningo, based in Matola, 10 kilometers from Maputo,
suggested that the story in "Correio de Manha" had been planted by
somebody in the government in order to discredit the environmental
group, which is opposed to the government's plan to incinerate
some of 850 tons waste pesticides in the furnaces of the Matola
cement factory.
</P>
<P>
Livaningo had no difficulty in proving that it never advocated
dumping Mozambique's obsolete pesticides in the lap of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Livaningo argued that last month's report from a Danish mission
review team showed that Livaningo's concerns are legitimate.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, which funds the pesticide disposal project, is
beginning to lose their initial enthusiasm for incineration, and
the May report suggested that two "experimental incinerations"
would be needed before giving the green light to burning hundreds
of tons of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Those experiments are needed to indicate whether incineration
releases into the atmosphere dangerous levels of poisons, and to
prove that at least 99.9 percent of the pesticides are in fact
destroyed by the furnace.
</P>
<P>
"After analyzing this document, we are more convinced than ever
that our reservations and doubts about undertaking any kind of
incineration safely in the cement factory are well grounded,"
declared Livaningo.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Welcomes S. Africa's Support for Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has welcomed efforts by his South African counterpart Thabo Mbeki
to raise funds for Zimbabwe's land reform program.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told the Zimbabwe News Agency on Thursday that South
Africa's initiative, which has so far yielded about 15 million
U.S. dollars from donors, would reinvigorate the country's program
to redistribute white- owned farmland to thousands of landless
blacks.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome their independent effort to secure funding for our
land reform program. The funds are useful to us in reinforcing
our efforts to resettle our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has reportedly persuaded Saudi Arabia and some Nordic
countries to put up 15 million U.S. dollars to buy white-owned
farms in Zimbabwe for redistribution to blacks.
</P>
<P>
"We have not got any message from them but we are aware of
their efforts, " Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
According to Director-General in Mbeki's office Frank Chikane,
the Zimbabwean government would use the money to buy 118 farms
from white owners who were willing to sell their land.
</P>
<P>
The land issue has in the last few months come to the fore in
the southern African nation of 12.5 million people as war veterans
of the 1970s liberation struggle occupied more than 1,000
white-owned commercial farms to demand speedy land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
This had led to an international outcry as clashes between the
war veterans and white farmers resulted in deaths and damage of
property worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial master, has promised to
provide fund for the resettlement program on condition that the
farm invasion must end first.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Thursday said the government will proceed to acquire 841
designated farms to resettle thousands of landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
He said this while addressing his party's supporters who had
earlier marched to the British High Commission protesting against
Britain's refusal to honor its obligation to fund land reform in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe reiterated that his government would never buy land to
resettle landless peasants.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to take back our land," he said, adding, "This is
our land. What is British is for the British. But here land is
ours and it is our heritage."
</P>
<P>
He criticized Britain for calling on other countries to impose
 sanctions on Zimbabwe and for supporting the opposition Movement
for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
"This is no longer Rhodesia," he said. "They must know that we
are ruling this country."
</P>
<P>
He said war veterans were justified in occupying white-owned
commercial farms because they could not stomach seeing their
country being taken back by whites.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe urged the supporters to be vigilant and guard against
foreigners who wanted his government to be removed from power.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Tries to Improve Education System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa needed a higher
education delivery system which could provide training to more
than 400,000 educators,
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Kader Asmal said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country should have an institutional landscape in which at
least 25 public higher education institutions offered teacher
education, Asmal said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the annual conference of colleges of education
in Durban, Asmal said the highest priority for these institutions
would be the in- service upgrading and re-skilling of teachers.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this requires a delivery system that can provide
training to more than 400,000 educators."
</P>
<P>
Asmal said the institutional landscape of higher education,
including teacher education was expected to change drastically
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The national department of education was currently looking at
legislation to bring colleges of education into the fold of higher
education institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- South African Special
Investigating Unit on Thursday called for a stronger political
will to combat corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Willem Heath, head of the unit, told in Midrand near
Johannesburg that potential investors would be encouraged by a
clear policy that government was serious about tackling
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"(But) South Africa has not accepted this unconditionally and
the political will is questionable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Heath said many politicians and senior civil servants in third
world countries regarded the appointment of a permanent,
independent, anti- corruption agency as a bad reflection on the
government, but the opposite was also true.
</P>
<P>
"If... the perception is created that the government is doing
all in its power to address the problem, this is a clear
invitation to investors and possible developers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Heath said his unit was also hampered by delays in the
publication of proclamations required for an investigation to go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
"In many of these cases the unit could have avoided the loss
of state assets and money through urgent interdicts, attachment
orders or the freezing of bank accounts," Heath said.
</P>
<P>
He said corruption ultimately led to a loss of money, and a
lack of trust by potential investors.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Federal
Alliance of Farmers on Thursday voiced its support for organized
agriculture's petition against attacks on South African farmers.
</P>
<P>
The alliance spokesman Jan Bosman said in a statement the
party would support "each and every effort" by organized
agriculture to highlight the lack of protection of farmers and
their workers.
</P>
<P>
"Drastic times call for drastic measures and the South African

their time of need, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"Stop Farm Attacks deserves the full and unqualified support

</P>
<P>
Agri SA, the Agricultural Employers Organization and the
Transvaal Agricultural Union on Wednesday launched a countrywide
petition to collect thousands of signatures against farm attacks.
</P>
<P>
The four-month campaign, dubbed "Stop Farm Attacks" will seek
to gain as much support as possible for stronger government action
to curtail rural killings. The past recent months have seen an

HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Thursday urged African countries to support Ketumile Masire in
his capacity as the mediator to end the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>

Mugabe's spokesman George Charamba said after a meeting between

Charamba said Masire was still assessing the progress made in
the DRC peace process as he was holding meetings with concerned

Masire, who was former Botswana President and appointed by the

<HEADLINE> Uganda Launches Strategy for Girls' Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has launched on Thursday a
national strategy for girls' education, calling upon the
government to scrutinize and harmonize its roles and activities in
educating girl children.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the launching ceremony at the International
Conference Center in Kampala, Vice-President Specioza Wandira
Kazibwe said that one of the obstacles to girls' education is lack
of physical facilities like laboratories especially in girls
schools.
</P>
<P>
This has hindered girl students from excelling in science
subjects, she added.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe said the strategy of action for girls' education
compels the government to establish a girls school that is well
facilitated with a laboratory and a computer center in every
district in the east African country so as to provide life skills
to the girl child.
</P>
<P>
Of the 146 developing countries rated on the Gender Human
Development Index, Uganda is relegated to 132nd place compared to
Kenya's 112th and Tanzania's 123rd position. At the primary level,
it put girls' enrolment at 47 percent compared to 53 percent for
boys, and it widens to 32 percent for females and 68 percent for
males at the secondary level.

LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
Thursday praised Liberian President Charles Taylor for his efforts
to secure the release of about 500 U.N. peacekeepers including
some 300 Zambian soldiers held hostage by Sierra Leone rebels last
month.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was speaking when he accepted Liberian ambassador

play an important role in the peace process in the war-torn west
African country.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Radio Presenter Sentenced to 12 Years in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Thursday sentenced Georges Ruggiu to 12
years in jail for his role in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the 45-minute judgement before a packed courtroom in
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha where the U.N. tribunal is
based, Presiding Judge Navanathem Pillay said the sentence goes
into force immediately though the convict will be transferred to
another designated country to serve his sentence, from which the
three years Ruggiu has spent in detention awaiting trial will be
deducted.
</P>
<P>
Judge Pillay accused Ruggiu, former journalist and presenter
for Rwandan Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), of
inciting the genocide through his broadcasts in French. At least
half a million minority ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
killed in Rwanda during the 100-day massacre.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiu, a Belgium-born Italian, changed his plea on May 15 this
year from not guilty to guilty to two counts of direct and public
incitement to genocide and persecution.
</P>
<P>
Arrested on July 23, 1997, in Mombasa, Kenya, the 42-year-old
convict is the only non-Rwandan detained by the ICTR.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers, Mohamed Aouini from Tunisia and Jean-Louis
Gilissen from Belgium, said they expected nothing better than what
was handed to Ruggiu.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the independent Hirondelle News Agency,
Rwanda has criticized the 12-year prison sentence handed down on
Ruggiu as being too lenient.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Rwanda's representative to the ICTR Martin Ngoga as
saying that it has ignored the gravity of the crimes of which he
has been convicted, and to which he pleaded guilty.

<HEADLINE> Wing Hang and Dah Sing Banks Individual Ratings Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the same time, both banks' Long-term, Short-term and Support
ratings are affirmed at 'A-', 'F2' and '4' respectively, according
to an announcement by the Agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA said Hongkong's banks, in general, fared
surprisingly well during the Asian economic crisis of 1997-1999.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to their prudent management, sound capital base and
strong liquidity, Hongkong's financial institutions have remained
generally solid throughout the financial turmoil, it added.
</P>
<P>
In line with its peers, Wing Hang Bank was affected by the
economic depression in Hongkong in 1997-1999, causing its ROE fell
to below its historical norm, which, it should be noted, had been
better than the banking system average, the Agency argued.
</P>
<P>
As Hongkong economy has begun to recover since the second half
of 1999, Wing Hang's performance has also started to improve.
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA said, since June 1999, the bank's impaired loans,
including non-accrual loans, overdue loans and rescheduled loans,
show a similar, falling trend.
</P>
<P>
Having experienced a setback in 1998, when profitability
declined and non-accrual loans surged, Dah Sing Bank's performance
rebounded remarkably in 1999 as ROE, ROA and net profit doubled.
</P>
<P>
The Agency said, following the bottoming out of non-accrual
loans, a substantial increase in loan loss provisions in 2000 is
not expected. Therefore, the bank's profitability should remain
healthy and its financial profile sound.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Visit Middle East Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is scheduled to arrive in the region on Monday in an
effort to "narrow the gap" between Israel and the Palestinians in
final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The visit was announced by United States President Bill Clinton
Thursday in Lisbon, Portugal after his meeting there with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Barak, flew to Lisbon especially for the meeting with Clinton,
will rush back to Israel later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio quoted U.S. embassy officials in Israel as saying
that Albright will hold separate talks with Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. top diplomat will return to Washington Tuesday evening
or Wednesday after the meetings, the embassy officials added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have entered a crucial
stage and Clinton has decided to send Albright to the region to
push forward the talks, they added.
</P>
<P>
During the last two rounds of secret talks last month in
Stockholm, Sweden, progress was made on hammering out a framework
agreement on final-status issues, said Israeli Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, who headed the Israeli delegation at the
talks.
</P>
<P>
But the back-channel talks were called off by Barak on May 21
due to an upsurge of violent anti-Israel demonstrations in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
An official accompanying Barak to the Lisbon summit said
Thursday the secret talks would resume Thursday night in Israel,
but Arafat said there was no decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
There have been two tracks of final-status talks. One was
attended by Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo, while the other one was held between
Ben-Ami and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has urged Clinton to put more pressure on Israel to force
it to make compromise in the final-status talks, which deal with
such thorny issues as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements, border, security and water.
</P>
<P>
Barak blamed the Palestinian side for "foot-dragging" in
negotiations aimed to nail down a frame-work agreement and pave the
way for the signing of a permanent peace treaty by September.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Will Strive to Catch Up with Other ASEAN Members: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen reaffirmed here Thursday that peace and political
stability has returned in Cambodia and his country will strive to
catch up with other ASEAN members and fulfill its commitment to
achieving ASEAN's 2020 vision and the Hanoi's Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the dinner hosted by Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong in his honor, Hun Sen said that his government has
achieved many satisfactory results in many fields and "Cambodia
will actively participate on an equal footing in all ASEAN forum
to achieve the 2020's vision and the Hanoi's Plan of Action".
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this goal, Cambodia will make its best effort with
its partners within ASEAN and with the assistance from other
friendly countries to eliminate as soon as possible the gap
existing between the new and the old members of ASEAN," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, Cambodia is already committed to implement the AFTA'
s time frame as it had been fixed with the purpose of acceleration
of the ASEAN economic integration," he added, referring to the
implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Goh Chok Tong said that with peace in Cambodia and a favorable
environment there is a real chance for Cambodia to rebuild itself
and integrate effectively into ASEAN, noting Cambodia has already
made concrete contributions to ASEAN's market integration despite
being ASEAN's newest member.
</P>
<P>
"I especially welcome your desire to speed up the reduction of
tariffs for Cambodia and to implement AFTA earlier than was
required for the newer ASEAN countries," Goh added.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations between Cambodia and Singapore, Hun Sen
said that "Singapore could play an important role to assist
Cambodia to achieve its socioeconomic development, especially in
human resources development which is a fundamental factor for real
economic progress".
</P>
<P>
He said economies of the two countries can be complementary
for the mutual benefit of each other, noting that Cambodia needs
modern technology in many fields and private investment from
Singapore but Cambodia also has its economic potential essential
for the economic cooperation between Cambodia and Singapore for
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Goh said the Singapore government encourages Singapore
businessmen to trade and invest in the region including Cambodia
and will continue to share its development experiences with
Cambodia through technical assistance programs, adding he also
encourages qualified Cambodian students to take advantage of the
many scholarships in Singapore that are available to ASEAN
students.
</P>
<P>
According to Goh, total bilateral trade between Cambodia and
Singapore in 1999 stood at more than 460 million U.S. dollars, up
32 percent over that in 1998 and Singapore's investment in
Cambodia has totaled more than 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen arrived here this morning for a three-day official
visit at the invitation of his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Thursday said the United States has produced fresh evidence about
Osama bin Laden's alleged involvement in terrorist activities
which have been referred to Afghanistan Shariat (Religion) Court.
</P>
<P>
"We have told the Americans that Shariat Court has to look into
the so-called evidence," Taliban's representative to Pakistan
Maulvi Syed Mohammad Haqqani told a group of Islamabad-based
journalists at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. delegation, led by Under Secretary for Political Affairs
Thomas Pickering, in a recent meeting with a Taliban team in
Islamabad produced new "documents" of Osama's involvement in
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said that the Americans had failed to produce any
proofs when Taliban supreme leader Mulla Omar last year invited
evidence against the Saudi exile who lived in Taliban-controlled
part of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Washington accused Osama of masterminding the bombing of
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and has been
urging the Taliban to hand over him for trial. The requirement,
however, had been rejected by the Afghan militia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Drops in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending
dropped 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 757.3
billion U.S. dollars in April, the first decline in seven months,
the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 0.6 percent decline followed strong gains of 0.8 percent in
March, 1.3 percent in February and 2 percent in January. It was
the first decline since a tiny 0.03 percent drop in September and
the biggest drop since 0.9 percent in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The construction report was the latest indication that the U.S.
economy may finally be slowing under the weight of six interest
rate increases engineered by the Federal Reserve over the past
year in an effort to slow growth and keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose a
modest 1,000 last week but remained at a level indicating an
extremely tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
The weakness in construction sector was led by a 1.1 percent
fall in residential construction, which declined to an annual rate
of 340.1 billion dollars with both single-family homes and
apartment complexes showing decreases.
</P>
<P>
Spending on government building projects was down 0.6 percent
to an annual rate of 173.4 billion dollars as outlays for school
buildings, highways and military facilities dropped.
</P>
<P>
Bucking the downward trend, spending by the private sector on
office buildings and other commercial structures actually rose
during April by 1 percent to an annual rate of 203.4 billion
dollars. Increases were registered in office buildings, hotels and
hospitals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's gross domestic product (
GDP) grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter of the year over the
same period last year, said the country's statistical bureau on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first three months this year witnessed the greatest
quarterly jump of the GDP since the quarterly statistics began in
1995.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, Hungary's economy has enjoyed a steady
growth, with the GDP growth rate above 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the growth in the first quarter mainly to
increases of investment, industrial production, and exports.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts believe that part of the reason for this
year's high growth rate in the first quarter is because growth in
the same period last year was slow.
</P>
<P>
They estimate that growth will slow down in the following
quarter.

DALIAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- An 84-year-old Chinese woman still
keeps her husband in mind, though he, an Indian doctor, died some
58 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Dwarkanath Kotnis joined an Indian medical team and came to
China in 1938 when he was only 28 to help China to fight against
the Japanese invasion.
</P>
<P>
"He cherished our love, and was very considerate. He took good
care of me," said Guo Qinglan, speaking with Indian President
Kocheril Narayanan at his home today in the port city of Dalian in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Wearing traditional Indian clothing with a badge of Kotnis's
portrait pinned on her dress, Guo said the dress means that she
used to be a wife of an Indian.
</P>
<P>
"The age of 84 is something special in China, and maybe I will
go to the heaven," she joked in English to the president. Guo
studied at an American church school and served as a nurse in a
hospital in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Kotnis, who worked in an Eight Route Army hospital as a surgeon
and head of the Bethune Hospital afterwards, joined the Communist
Party of China in 1942.

<P>
They fell in love and got married in Jinchaji in north China, a
liberated area. And they gave their son the name Yinhua which
means India and China.
</P>
<P>
"He was vivacious, and liked singing. He spoke fluent Chinese,
and sometimes I couldn't help laughing when he told me a joke,"
said Guo, recalling Kotnis.
</P>
<P>
Guo and 16-year-old Yinhua went to the home town of Kotnis in
1958, where they planted a tree to commemorate Kotnis. Yinhua died
of medical mistreatment nine years later.
</P>
<P>
Guo remarried a Chinese after Kotnis' death in 1942. They have
a son and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan first met Guo when he was Indian ambassador to China
in the 1970s. Meeting Guo again after almost three decades, he
said he sincerely hoped that he will be able to see Guo again. "I
really hope so, but I am old, " said smiling Guo, who presented
two books about Kotnis to the president.
</P>
<P>
Guo visited Kotnis' family in India four times. "The whole
family is very nice, and treat me warmly," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I love both China and India. I hope that Sino-Indian
friendship will develop from generation to generation," she said.

<HEADLINE> 41,000 Eritreans Cross Border to Sudan: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced Thursday that it had
registered around 41,000 Eritrean asylum seekers who had arrived
in Sudan's eastern state of Kassaia over the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR office in Kenya's capital Nairobi said that the
influx continues but at a lower rate over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Most of the recent arrivals coming from the Mohammed Ali Hassan
farm were able to pay the equivalent of 100 to 300 U.S. dollars to
rent trucks to transport them to Sudan, the U.N. agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency is concerned about the plight of many of the 50,000
displaced people reportedly gathered at the farm who can not
afford to pay passage to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that it is airlifting urgently needed relief
supplies to Sudan and an Airbus 300 is scheduled to arrive in
Khartoum Thursday, bringing in 42 tons of plastic sheeting,
kitchen sets and medical kits from Copenhagen and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR office here also said that the agency has so far
delivered more than 2,400 tents to the Sudanese Commission on
Refugees for distribution to the new arrivals, in addition to
blankets, kitchen sets, soaps and high protein biscuits.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Self-reliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said here on Thursday that Kenya cannot rely on outsiders to solve
many problems the east African country is facing.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, poverty and lack of self-sufficiency in food
call for hard work, commitment and innovativeness on the part of
our farmers," he told thousands of people at the celebrations of
the Madaraka Day to mark Kenya's self-rule from Britain 37 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, poverty, unemployment, poor
performance of agriculture, high cost of food, education, health
and transport are some of the major problems facing Kenya in the
new century.
</P>
<P>
Moi urged Kenyan farmers to respond more aggressively to the
challenge of food self-sufficiency despite the current erratic
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Our farmers must redouble their efforts in order to expand
areas for food crops and produce more milk, meat, vegetables and
fruits to satisfy both our domestic and export requirements, now
and in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we cannot claim to be in full control over
our affairs when we cannot feed ourselves; we cannot win the
respect of other nations when we continue to rely on handouts from
outsiders."
</P>
<P>
Kenya has fulfilled many conditions for the resumption of the
loans from the donor countries and international financial
institutions, Moi said, adding that Kenya hopes to start receiving
donor support very soon.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his determination to continue the ongoing
privatization process, fight against corruption and improve
security in the country.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Reach Agreement on EU Reform: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany have reached
agreement on the reform of European Union (EU) institutions and
the introduction of German as a working language for the EU, Le
Monde newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck during a meeting between French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine and his German counterpart Joschka Fischer
in Berlin on Sunday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But a written agreement is yet to be signed by the two
ministers.
</P>
<P>
An institutional reform is necessary for the EU to expand to
take in Eastern European countries. France, which will take over
the EU rotating presidency on July 1, wishes to complete the
reform during its six-month term.
</P>
<P>
The Franco-German agreement covers four areas -- the balance of
votes at the European Council among EU members, the introduction
of qualified majority voting instead of unanimous voting for
adopting a draft law, closer cooperation among a limited number of
EU members in a period of time, and the future size of the EU
Commission, which now has 20 commissioners from 15 countries.
</P>
<P>
France also agreed to have German as a working language in EU
institutions, but French and English will remain the only two
languages in institutions of foreign affairs and security policies.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French President Jacques
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will meet on June 9 in
Mayence, western Germany, on EU institutional reform.

<HEADLINE> E-business Adoption Among HK SMEs Shows Slight Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- E-business among Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) of Hong Kong has slightly advanced in the first
quater of this year, according to the result of a survey released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly survey, jointly conducted by the Hong Kong
Productivity Council (HKPC) and IBM China/Hong Kong Limited, shows
that 58 percent of the respondents with a webpage are aware of the
categories of their visitor, an increase of 10 percentage points
compared with that of last quarter.
</P>
<P>
On the effectiveness of the webpage as a marketing tool, 51
percent of the companies with an on-line product catalogue
expressed that the webpage can help business transactions, an
increase of seven percentage points from the last survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was launched in September, 1999, to study and
monitor the development and adoption of e-business in Hong Kong
and provide the local business sector with a useful reference for
formulating business strategies accordingly.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, the deployment of e-business was classified into
six levels ranging from level 0 to 5, representing No Intention,
Show Intention, Basic Adoption, Prospecting, Business Integration
and Business Transformation respectively.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,063 local companies were interviewed by phone for
the third survey conducted in April 2000 and the result has been
grossed up to the whole population of around 207,274 active
establishments in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In terms of basic adoption, the survey shows that for 28.5
percent of the establishments, e-business usage is confined to E-
mail communications only.
</P>
<P>
At the level 3 of Prospecting, 8.7 percent of the companies
has a webpage and E-mail account, compared with 6.7 percent in the
last survey, an indication that more SMEs are now willing to
further enhance their e-business capabilities.
</P>
<P>
At level 4 and level 5, the indexes remained little unchanged
over the last quarter, an indication that web applications for
either on-line transaction or business integration of external or
internal information technology systems are still not commonly
used among local SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the survey findings, Wendy Wong, senior
consultant of HKPC, said "although the survey reflects an upward
tendency of e-business adoption in Hong Kong, the growth is at a
relatively slow pace."
</P>
<P>
"HKPC will continue to launch new initiatives to promote a
wider adoption of e-business by SMEs," she said.
</P>
<P>
Francis Ngai, executive of general business of IBM, said "the
level 4 and 5 indexes have remain unchanged for the last two
surveys, an indication that there could be a barrier for companies
in level 2 and 3 to advance further in deploying e-business. This
is most likely related to the security issue, which, as validated
by our own research, is a key concern for most companies."
</P>
<P>
"IBM is committed to helping local SMEs foster the e-business
adoption process by providing them with secured and cost-effective
solutions that cater for their need," Ngai added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Refugees Center Closed in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) is pleased that the Pillar
Point Vietnamese Refugees Center (PPVRC) was closed in a peaceful
and dignified manner at midnight Wednesday, Secretary for Security
Regina Ip said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese boat people saga has lingered on for a quarter
of a century, and the time is now ripe to close this chapter of
the history with vision and determination," she said.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to the government's decision to close PPVRC
after making an offer for the Vietnamese refugees and migrants
stranded here to settle in Hong Kong on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the past 25 years, Hong Kong had acted in accordance
with UNHCR (the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)
criteria and international practices on dealing with refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We have not turned away a single refugee boat. Nor have we
ever turned away from Hong Kong any person who has nowhere else to
go. We are not leaving anybody out there in a limbo. The
Vietnamese refugee population accommodated by us is bigger than
all Asian countries combined," Ip said.
</P>
<P>
"But as the HK SAR government helps the Vietnamese, we also
expect them to help themselves," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> Border Oil Trade Limits Frustrate Turkey's Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Civilian and military officials in
southeastern Turkey urged Ankara to open new border gates with Iraq
to prevent oil smuggling which would benefit the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Local authorities were dismayed by a recent government decision
to restrict border oil trade with Iraq, which was allegedly aimed
to prevent the fuel money from flowing into the PKK that has been
involved in armed struggle since 1984 for an independent state in
the Kurdish-populated southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Local officials claimed the move will further hurt the ailing
economy of the region, where trade is the major source of income,
and encourage smuggling that will only benefit Kurdish separatist
militants, Turkish Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The governors in southeastern Turkey complained that the Ankara
authorities did not consult them before making such decisions.
</P>
<P>
Military sources in the southeast said they had sent reports to
Ankara, calling for opening up at least two new border gates with
the Kurdish-populated northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Iraqi Kurds have been cooperating with
the Turkish military in fighting PKK separatists who are trying to
find a foothold in northern Iraq after being uprooted in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqi Kurds rely on income from Iraq's fuel trade with
Turkey. Thus, any restrictions on border trade will hurt their
revenues and negatively affect Turkey's ability to influence them.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Husamettin Ozkan has reportedly
promised to correct the mistakes and revitalize the border trade.

higher than 139.93 million dollars a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Australia Couldn't Accept Military Rule in Fiji: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer spoke Thursday to Fiji's military ruler,
Commodore Frank Bainimarama, and made it clear Australia could not
accept military rule in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the foreign minister was quoted by the
Australian Associated press as saying that Downer told Commodore
Bainimarama the inclusion of Speight or any of his supporters in
the Fiji government would be unacceptable while Commodore
Bainimarama stressed his main concern was the release of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Heading a 6-member group, George Speight took Fiji's Prime
Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and most of his cabinet members as
hostage in the parliament house on May 19. A breakthrough was
reported this evening when Speight and Bainimarama hold their
second face-to-face talk. A spokesman for Bainimarama indicated
afterwards that there was possibility that Speight would be
included in a civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Australia opposed firmly toppling with unconstitutional way a
democratically elected government in Fiji and revoking a
relatively fair 1997 constitution.
</P>
<P>
Fiji enjoys close economic and military cooperation with
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Downer confirmed Australia and New Zealand would
concentrate on the release of the hostages before deciding whether
sanctions should go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"Our joint judgment is that we think the wise thing to do is
this: wait until the hostages are released, keep the pressure on
Speight as best we possibly can," Downer told Sydney radio 2UE.
</P>
<P>
"Once the hostages are released, that is the opportunity for us
to talk yet again with the Fiji authorities about our desire to
see democracy restored and constitutional government reestablished,
" he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand have been liaisoning with other
nations, including India, Britain, the United States and Japan,
about the events in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
After the 1987 coup in Fiji, the country's commonwealth
membership was ceased for ten years and suffered a tough sanction.

<HEADLINE> Manila Clarifies Forthcoming Visit of OIC Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC)
Secretary General Azzedine Laraki will visit the Philippines in a
bid to secure an early release of the hostages in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement
that Laraki will come to Manila to express both the OIC's concern
for the safety of the hostages as well as its support for the
efforts of the Philippine government to secure the release of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the release of the hostages is the
responsibility of the Philippine Government alone, the DFA added.
</P>
<P>
The OIC head is expected to reiterate the OIC's call for the
government to continue to exert its utmost in order to arrive at a
peaceful solution to the humanitarian crisis that would ensure the
release of the hostages and their return to their countries as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The DFA explained that Laraki's visit to Manila will be similar
in nature to that of European Union (EU) envoy Javier Solana, who
paid a visit to Manila in a bid to secure an early safe release of
the Sulu hostages abducted by the Abu Sayyaf extremists from
Malaysia in April.
</P>
<P>
It said the EU's mission was aimed at manifesting the EU's
solidarity with the kidnap victims as well as with the Philippine
government's endeavor to secure their release.

<HEADLINE> Plant Spores Found in Antarctic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- spores of a kind of cool-
temperature tree 30-million-years old has been found at Antarctic
in an international study, Australian Associated Press AAP
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The found spores show vegetation grew in the coastal plains of
Antarctica similar to that now found in the cool-temperate
rainforest in the Tasmanian highlands.
</P>
<P>
Antarctica was home to a variety of forest plants including
insect eating plants and three meter pine trees before becoming a
barren ice world.
</P>
<P>
Professor Patrick Quilty of the University of Tasmania, who was
involved with the Ocean Drilling Program, said the finds allowed
scientists to clarify that Tasmania and Antarctica separated 30
million years ago, AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
This allowed cold currents to circulate around Antarctica,
cutting it off from the tropics. Ice sheets started to form and by
15 million years ago most of it was a frozen continent.
</P>
<P>
Australia started to move north from Antarctica at a rate of
five centimeters a year about 55 million years ago.

on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Swiss
Radio International reported Thursday.
</P>

"We have special interests in watches," Ineichen said. "And
that's an area where we'd like to get more tariff concessions. And
we have a few financial services issues we'd like to solve with
the Chinese."

Switzerland is one of the five WTO members yet to sign a
bilateral agreement with China. The other four are Costa Rica,

<HEADLINE> Gunman Identified Otherwise in Luxembourg Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The gunman holding more than two
dozens of children and three adults hostage for more than 21 hours
since Wednesday was originally from Tunisia and not from Algeria,
police sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old man, armed with a pistol, a hand grenade and a
knife, took as hostage 29 children aged between two and seven and
three female teachers from the Wasserbillig nursery school on
Wednesday afternoon, according to Belgian media reports.
</P>
<P>
He has been demanding to be flown to Libya with around 20
million francs (220,000 U.S. dollars) in return for the release of
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Though the deadline he set for being escorted to a nearby
airport and flown out to Libya was well passed, no incident
happened, to the relief of parents, relatives, police and rescue
workers at the scene.
</P>
<P>
The deadline was set for 8.30 a.m. (0630 GMT) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, who has a history of mental problems, has allowed
two children to walk out of the school building early on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He released more than a dozen children late Wednesday after he
was allowed to speak to his psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Lydie Polfer visited Wasserbillig
together with Portuguese and French officials.
</P>
<P>
Besides Luxembourg children, the hostages include Portuguese
and French kids.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg Interior Minister Michel Wolter on Wednesday
instructed that the hostage taking incident be ended without
violence though the police had cordoned off the school building
and had their guns trained on the windows of the building in the
village of Wasserbillig near the Luxembourg-Germany border.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton tried Wednesday to reassure
European allies on a proposed U.S. missile defense program, saying
Washington would share the technology with friendly, "civilized"
countries if it decides to build such a system.
</P>
<P>
-- Lucent Technologies Inc. bought Chromatis Networks Inc., a
small Herndon company that has never sold a single product but
stands at the intersection of the newest Internet gold rush.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A United Nations envoy said Syria was ready to accept that
Israel had completely withdrawn from southern Lebanon. Such a
decision could lessen chances of renewed violence on the Israel-
Lebanon border.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Vice President Al Gore called for legislation requiring
health insurers to provide children with mental health benefits
comparable to coverage for physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft asked for major changes to the government's
proposal to break it into two companies. Lawyers for Microsoft
said they still don't believe such a remedy would be sustained by
an appeals court. The company said a breakup and sweeping
restrictions on its conduct would have damaging unintended
consequences.
</P>
<P>
-- New-homes sales dropped an unexpectedly hard 5.8 percent to
an annual rate of 909,000 in April, its lowest point since
November. The leading-indicator index slipped 0.1 percent, as

<HEADLINE> HKSFC Chairman Stresses on Disclosure of Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Disclosure of information is of
critical significance for today's economy under the combined
impact of globalization, technology and innovation, according to
Andrew Sheng, chairman of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures
Commission Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Reliable, accurate and timely information is a market
fundamental," Sheng said at the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Second Asian Roundtable on
Corporate Governance, which was opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The market needs high quality information, timely disclosures
and efficient access to such information to maintain integrity and
to function fairly and efficiently, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has demonstrated that Asia has gaps
in disclosure, incentives to use information, the law and
regulatory net and capacity to use information, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that raw information is useless without
high quality accounts, including non-financial information,
prepared according to international accounting standards and
verified or audited according to international or generally
accepted auditing standards.
</P>
<P>
"Participation in the global economy imposes obligations as
well as providing opportunities. To exploit fully the benefits of
greater and cheaper sources of investment provided by
international capital, corporations must accept the disciplines of
better financial disclosure and high quality audits," he said.

CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Governor of the Central Bank of Lebanon Riad Salame
announced on Thursday that the total remittances sent home by
Lebanese expatriates is estimated at 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Salame said the exchange rate between U.S. dollar and Lebanese
pound has recently witnessed a decline, which is a good sign after
the Israeli pullout from south Lebanon last Wednesday. He expected
that the country's economy will develop faster with the prevailing
political stability.
</P>
<P>
Salame said the deposit periods for Arab funds in the bank,
including 500 million dollars from Saudi Arabia and 100 million
dollars from Kuwait, will be extended next year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government decided on Wednesday to
gradually limit the currently unlimited state guarantee for bank
accounts, reported Anatolia News Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It also decided that non-guaranteed deposits at the collapsed
offshore banks will be compensated by the state.
</P>
<P>
However, state compensations to deposit holders at the collapsed

offshore banks will not cover all deposits, and only deposits up to
20 billion Turkish Liras (about 3,000 U.S. dollars) would be
compensated.
</P>
<P>
The move is reported to be part of the banking reforms requested
by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Syria has achieved an average 5.5 percent of growth in

is 146-meter high and 801.50-meter long.
</P>
<P>
The viaducts and tunnels, which are located in the quake-prone

to resist earthquakes measuring 8.0 degrees on the open-ended
Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, added that the tunnels are not built on
the
active fault lines and that there is not a massive quake risk in
the area.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Critical of EU's View on Defense Identity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
on Thursday described the views held by Turkey and the European
Union(EU) regarding the European Security and Defense Identity
(ESDI) as "rather contradictory," reported the Anatolia News Agency
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Javier Solana, EU Common Foreign and Security
Policy Commissioner and Western European Union (WEU) Secretary-
General, here on Thursday morning, Cem expressed hope that the two
sides would reach a compromise in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been eager to involve itself in the ESDI process ever
since it was accepted to be candidate for membership of the 15-
member European club at the Helsinki summit last december. But EU
appears reluctant to include non-EU NATO nations in the European
defense structure.
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in Ankara Wednesday night for a one-day visit to
Turkey and will have a series of high-level contacts in Ankara. He
is expected to meet President Ahmet Necdet Sezer later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had looked forward to bringing its concern over the ESDI
issue to the agenda of its meeting with Solana.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that Solana had provided great support to Turkey on the
eve of the Helsinki summit, and expressed belief that they would
continue to work in a productive manner as they did in the past.
</P>
<P>
Noting that they had made an evaluation of Turkey's relations
with the European Union and NATO, Cem said that "There exists a
great difference between the opinions of Turkey and those of the EU
regarding the ESDI. But I believe that we will come up with a
compromise that would be satisfactory for both sides."
</P>
<P>
Solana said in his part that he and Cem would make an assessment
of the Turkey-EU relations in the post-Helsinki period.
</P>
<P>
The non-EU NATO allies, namely Turkey, Norway, Poland, Hungary,
and the Czech Republic, want to take part in the decision-making
mechanism of the ESDI. Their overtures have received support from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the issue reflects a striking difference
between the EU and the United States over the establishment of an
independent European defense system.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan President's Story to Come Alive on Screen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A movie on the story of Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga and her late husband was finished
shooting here Thursday and to be released later this year.
</P>
<P>
The movie titled "The Actor and the President" was directed by
award winning Australian cameraman Jeff Burton who is a close
friend of Chandrika's late husband Vijaya Kumaratunga, a movie
star-turned-politician.
</P>
<P>
Burton is the cameraman of the movie "Sirens" starring British
actor Hugh Grant and Australian super model Elle Machperson.
</P>
<P>
He said the movie in the making is a "tribute" to the couple,
whom Burton met in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic scene in the movie is the tragic death of
Vijaya Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Vijaya was shot dead by two unknown gunmen in front of his
house on February 16, 1988 while he was speaking to a commercial
artist friend in front of his house.
</P>
<P>
The assassination has been blamed on the leftist People's
Liberation Front which was leading a terror campaign against the
government.
</P>
<P>
The final shooting of the assassination scene was done at a
house identical to the Sri Lankan president's private residence at
the time.
</P>
<P>
Burton used doubles for the scene and the role of Vijaya is
played by a Sri Lankan doctor who looks very much like the
president's late husband.
</P>
<P>
The president's two children were aged 7 and 5 at the time.
Today her daughter Yasodhara who is 19 years is studying in London
and son Vimukthi is attending an international school in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Burton said that President Kumaratunga extended her fullest
cooperation to the movie and had spoken in detail to him and he
has got an excellent interview with her for his movie.
</P>
<P>
The movie which last about one hour is to brought back to
Australia for editing and to be released by Australia's Special
Broadcasting Service in September both in Australia and in Sri
Lanka.

LONDON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A road bridge in west London was hit
by an explosion early Thursday, but no casualties or injuries were
caused, police said.
</P>
<P>
A high-explosive device attached to a girder under the south
side of Hammersmith Bridge went off at 4.30 a.m. (0330 GMT) and
the bridge was slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorist officers were investigating a possible link with
Irish dissident groups.

</P>
<P>
Police closed the bridge and one of the main commuter routes
into the British capital, severely disrupting traffic.

Olympic trials here on Thursday, but they still qualify for the
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Liu and Wang had automatically made the Olympic squad because
of their fabulous performance at last year's World Chammpionships,
" said Shang Xiutang, general secretary of the Chinese Athletic
Association (CAA).
</P>
<P>
The event was won by their training partner Wang Liping, who
clocked a personal best time of one hour 28 minutes 33 seconds.
Sun Chunfang finished second in 1:29:45 while Tang Yinghua came
third in 1:30:36.
</P>
<P>
With Wang Liping joining Liu and Wang Yan to compete in Sydney,
Shang believes that the women's 20km event will be the best gold
hope for China's track and field in the coming Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"Even compared with coach Ma Junren's long distance runners,
the three athletes have a better chance to win an Olympic gold
medal," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
China claimed one athletics gold medal each from the last two
Olympic Games through Chen Yueling from the women's 20km walk at
Barcelona in 1992 and Wang Junxia from women's 5,000m at Atlanta
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hongyu and Wang Yan just returned from their package warm-
up tournaments in Europe and their coach Zhang Fuxin said they
should spend a period time recovering from fatigue.
</P>
<P>
"Liu won three races in Portugal, England and Germany while
Wang won the champion in Spain, " Zhang said. "They should take a
rest, so I let them drop out today."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said their biggest threat came from Russia, who had four
people clocked inside one hour 25 minute in the Russian Olympic
Trials early last month.
</P>
<P>
"That's really unbelievable. But that will not impose pressure
on our athletes. We still have time and we have the confidence to
beat them in Sydney."
</P>
<P>
In the men's 20km event, former World Cup champion Li Zewen won
the title in 1:23:09, followed by Bai Liansheng in 1:23:34 and He
Xiaodong in 1:23:45.

<HEADLINE> China Regulating Grain Purchasing Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Planning
Commission(SDPC) said today that it will strengthen regulation
over grain purchasing prices in China's provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC stressed the consistent prices in different regions,
which it held fundamental to China's reform in the grain
circulation system.
</P>
<P>
The local government should consult grain purchasing prices in
neighboring provinces before deciding its own pricing policy.
Those who violate the price agreement will be punishment,
according to new rules set by the SDPC.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will help local governments to control grain
purchasing as well as facilitate reform in the grain circulation
system, SDPC said.

<HEADLINE> Summer Fishing Ban in South China Sea Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China began to impose fishing bans
in South China Sea from 12:00 hours Beijing Time today. By 15:00
hours, no fishing ships were found to have violated the ban.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Fishery Bureau under the Ministry of
Agriculture said that the number of fishing ships participating in
the ban increased by more than 50 percent over last year to 26,853
due to the ban being imposed on more types of fishing ships.
</P>
<P>
He said that 296 fishery management ships were sent today to
cruise and inspect fishing waters north of 12 degrees north
latitude and have found no ships that violated the ban.
</P>
<P>
China began summer fishing bans in the East China Sea and
Yellow Sea from 1995 to protect dwindling marine fishing resources.
Last year, the ban was expanded to South China Sea. Statistics
indicate that within two months after the fishing ban was imposed,
the fishing output in these areas grew from 10 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the ban, leading groups on fishing ban
have been set up in Guangdong and Hainan provinces as well as
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Local fishery departments will
send out all fishery management ships and aircraft to patrol the
area. Fishing ships found to violate the ban will be severely
punished, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: China Needs Smooth SOE Reform After Its Accession into WTO: OECD Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The smooth reform without causing
any major social disturbances will be the biggest challenge for
China's state-owned enterprises (SOE) after its accession into WTO,
a senior OECD official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We should not expect too ambitious paces in the process of
China's SOE reform because it is a big country like a big oil-
tanker and it takes some time to make a turn," Seiichi Kondo,
deputy secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD), told Xinhua when attending the
second Asian roundtable on corporate governance in Hong Kong from
May 31 to June 2.
</P>
<P>
Kondo believed that the strong Chinese leadership will surely
promote a smooth transition of the country's state-owned
enterprises. This will help China's economy integrate with the
world economy, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leadership is determined to make a "turn" and has
taken some necessary steps to do so, Kondo said. He said that he
was optimistic about the success of the reform.
</P>
<P>
Although the injection of the public funds into China's economy
is very successful, it is important to establish a good tax system
to maintain the high level of growth, because a sound tax system
contributes greatly to the SOEs' reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned enterprises also have to have appropriate
corporate governance because the issue of a market economy, after
all, is how to get access to low-cost capital internationally, the
OECD deputy secretary-general noted, adding that that will
automatically pose impact on the economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the successful reforms of SOE, Kondo said that it is
also quite important to build up a sound social security system,
since the globalization forces these enterprises into severe
competition and the society and the government have to take care
of the losers and encourage them to go back in the competition.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the OECD's Asian Roundtable, which was attended by
over 120 delegates from many economies in Asia as well as
international and regional bodies such as the OECD, the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank, is the role of disclosure in
strengthening corporate governance and accountability.

<HEADLINE> HK Securities Markets Urged to Offer Quality Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's securities markets
were urged to use technology to offer quality services at
competitive prices, according to a senior SFC official.
</P>
<P>
The need for rapid development of technology in Hong Kong's
financial markets within an appropriate regulatory framework is
the key theme of the Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC)
11th annual report published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his chairman's statement of the report, SFC Chairman Andrew
L T Sheng said that technology has changed securities markets
profoundly in character, depth and liquidity, and "our financial
technology must be ready for connection with the rest of the world.
"
</P>
<P>
The challenges presented by rapid advances in technology and
sweeping market reforms and the need to contain costs were
successfully met during the year under review, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the future SFC's work, the SFC chairman said the
key tasks to be tackled include the development of on-line trading
and electronic initial public offerings and guidelines for the
approval of automated trading systems.
</P>
<P>
Also included are an upgrading of clearing arrangements to
include scripless trading and straight-through processing for
securities and futures markets and the creation of an electronic
investor resources center to aid investor education.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Sheng said that the SFC must prepare and upgrade
for the new economy. The commission is applying technology to
improve efficiency, introducing a more orderly workflow and
allowing the provision of online information management and
information sharing within the commission.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for online trading in Hong Kong have begun, and
the automated trading system of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange was
under extensive industry-wide test last year, according to Sheng.
</P>
<P>
The technology, media and telecommunications sector of the
stock market grew to 42 percent of the total as supply grew to
meet strong investor demand. Interest was further stimulated by
the launch of the Growth Enterprise Market, where 61 percent of
the companies listed had high technology content, indicating the
new economy began to grip Hong Kong and bring both challenges and
advances, Sheng concluded.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Develops Environment Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh in
collaboration with the World Bank and The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) has undertaken a two-year program to
develop environmental management guidelines in the country, The
Financial Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sustainable Environment Management Program of the
Ministry of Environment and Forest, the World Bank engaged
Environmental Services of Australia and Survey Research Group of
Bangladesh to undertake the development of sectoral guidelines for
environmental management.
</P>
<P>
Project officials said one of the purposes of the guidelines is
to provide technical information and recommendations to guide,
promote and facilitate improved environmental performance by the
relevant sectors.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines will also strengthen the environmental
management capacity of government agencies and provide a sound
technical basis for assessing proposals and applications,
determining technical requirements, making statutory decisions,
and monitoring and regulating sector performance.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines would be produced in four batches, each over a
period of about five months.
</P>
<P>
The program will cover 18 industrial sectors, including oil and
gas exploration, power generation, shrimp farming and processing,
hospital and clinic waste management, leather tanning, garment
manufacturing,etc.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines should be relevant and practicable for the
sectors and promote action and encourage progress by the sectors
toward cost-effective practice in environmental management in the
Bangladesh context, environment experts said.
</P>
<P>
World Bank's Country Director Frederick Temple said Bangladesh
is still facing the challenge of poverty alleviation, reminding
that there is a link between poverty and environment.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the crucial relationship between poverty and
environment should be taken into consideration by the policy-
makers,"Temple said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Cracks Down on Oil Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has been determined
to crack down on the rampant oil smuggling which claims some 15
million U.S. dollars annually, or about 30 percent of Tanzania's
entire petroleum sales.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa vowed at a meeting here Wednesday that
his government will use every means, with the greater public
support, to succeed in its war against massive tax evasion in the
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the smuggling of petroleum products through
customs was on the rise with a growing trend toward the illegal
trade and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that 25 to 30 percent of the petroleum sales
business in this country is illegal due to tax evasion," said
Mkapa in his opening speech at the road stakeholders' meeting on
the partnership of public and private sectors in the
infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the massive tax evasion in the petroleum
sector, which has an annual total fuel consumption at about
555,110 tons, was a serious set- back to government efforts to
create enabling conditions so that the economy can grow.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that smuggling across Tanzania's "porous"
borders was rampant because the entry points were not properly
patrolled.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tanzania announced several measures to curb the wave of
massive tax evasion in the petroleum industry, including the
introduction of a new technology of fuel marking known as the
"bicode".
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals,
the Tanzania Revenue Authority and the Tanzania Petroleum
Development Corporation are consulting on the possibility of
introducing bicode to make it difficult for businessmen to cheat
the government.
</P>
<P>
The bicode technology has been largely successful in Uganda and
Kenya where revenue authorities have been able to tame illicit oil
trade and recorded substantial increases in tax collection.
</P>
<P>
It will also enable customs officers to differentiate pure
petroleum products from adulterated and transit-destined fuel by
dishonest traders. Areas notorious for the illegal trade include
Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga, Bukoba, Kigoma, Mwanza
and Mara.
</P>
<P>
The government has already applied the petroleum sector
regulations and revoked licenses of several oil marketing
companies which deliberately fail to pay taxes.

<HEADLINE> China to Save World's Tallest Ancient Wooden Pagoda (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
start a massive restoration and salvation project to save the
world's tallest ancient wooden pagoda, which, in its 944 years of
existence, is in danger of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to save the wooden pagoda at all
costs," said Zhang Wenbin, director-general of the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics. "The final version of the restoration plan will
make no consideration of cost, as long as it works best for
protecting the pagoda and preserving its original look."
</P>
<P>
Standing 65.86 meters, the octagonal pagoda in Yingxian County
in north China's Shanxi Province is not only the tallest but also
the oldest wooden pagoda in China today. Compared with the
renowned Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy, the wooden pagoda in
Yingxian is 115 years older and 11.36 meters taller. The pagoda
was listed as a cultural heritage under first-class state
protection in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the restoration project including an overall
estimate of the damage and geological exploration of the pagoda's
foundation are already near completion, and are expected to cost
nearly seven million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts on ancient architecture are working on three separate
restoration plans, and one will be selected with final approval
from an expert panel organized by the State Bureau of Cultural
Relics later this year.
</P>
<P>
Although it has successfully weathered nearly a thousand years
of climatic changes, the pagoda is now seriously unaligned, mainly
due to the damage done by numerous strong earthquakes and cannon
attacks. The first two stories of the pagoda are leaning
northeastward, and some of its wooden columns and parts are broken
or split.

<P>
The increasing occurrence of earthquakes in the area also makes
it even more urgent to realign and restore the pagoda, according
to Cai Zejun, an expert on ancient architecture. "The pagoda is in
such poor condition that natural disasters such as gales or
earthquakes of high magnitude could topple the pagoda to the
ground," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the State Bureau of Cultural Relics has listed the
restoration of the wooden pagoda as a top priority for the
protection of ancient architecture this year, while the Shanxi
Provincial Government has set up a special restoration committee
to handle the project.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 noted experts in areas related to the restoration
of ancient buildings have been invited to the pagoda since late
last year in order to pool all possible expert wisdom to secure
the pagoda's existence for at least another 1,000 years, according
to Zhang Wenbin.
</P>
<P>
Three restoration drafts are being worked out for the present:
one for pure consolidation and reinforcement, one for
disassembling and reassembling all parts of the entire pagoda, and
the other for the partial disassembling and reassembling of the
first two stories of the pagoda.
</P>
<P>
Luo Zhewen, head of the expert panel on ancient architecture in
the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, said that as a measure of
caution, the final design will be submitted to the State Council
for approval and the bureau will have to apply for special state
funds to finance the project due to its massive scale and high
cost.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents More Professional in Infant Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted among 4,464
parents in four major Chinese cities show that parents are
becoming more professional in infant education.
</P>
<P>
Healthy, intelligent, and reasonable kids are the favorite
among Chinese parents, according to the survey conducted in
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the parents put health at the top for their
children's growth, and 45 percent of them said they use reason in
dealing with their kids. Another 28 percent said they stop
persuasive methods if their son or daughter shows no interest in
an activity.
</P>
<P>
The survey run by several pre-school educational study
institutions also indicates that parents are paying attention to
helping kids form good habits, as 34 percent of the parents say
factors other than intelligence will also influence the children's
growth process.
</P>
<P>
Being willful and too active were two main shortcomings that 32
percent of the parents mentioned. While experts reminded mothers
and fathers that these two shortcomings may also be a sign that
the children want to be independent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also suggests that unlike before, Chinese parents
are coming to realize that their improper teaching methods might
result in their children's bad behavior and shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
Chinese parents today take their kids to classes for piano,
violin, dancing, calligraphy and others, and do so not just to
turn the children into excellent players or dancers. More than two-
thirds of the parents say that these classes benefit the kids in
their exploration of their potentials.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Call for Ban on Smuggling of Fossils (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese and foreign
scientists attending an international conference here called for
an immediate ban on the illegal trade of fossils worldwide as the
increasingly rampant smuggling has been detrimental to scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
They made the call at today's opening of the Fifth
International Meeting of the Society of Avian Paleontology and
Evolution and the Symposium on Jehol Biota in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
"Fossils are the most important samples for paleontologists,
and the random collection and smuggling of fossils is not only
illegal, but also damaging to resources for academic research,"
said Zhang Miman, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
and chairman of the organization committee of the international
conference.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, large quantities of ancient animal fossils
have been discovered in southwest China's Yunnan Province and
Liaoning Province in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
In late 1993, fossils of Confuciusornis, one of the most
primitive birds in the world, were found in the western part of
Liaoning. Two years later, Chinese paleontologists discussed the
finding in the British academic journal "Nature." drawing wide
attention in international academic circles. However, fossils of
the primitive birds were soon found being sold in Japan and some
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
"I used to be so naive as to believe that Confuciusornis
fossils kept at the CAS were the only ones in the world," said
Zhou Zhonghe, a curator of bird fossils, who was among the first
Confuciusornis researchers.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Call for Ban on Smuggling of Fossils (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The smuggling of bird fossils began a dozen years ago and many
of them were brought out of China by traffickers. The reports on
the excavation of fossils of Mesozoic animals lured fossil
smugglers to eye the rare fossils of primitive birds and dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
"Unprofessional excavation of fossils is destructive, as much
important information is lost during the digging and can never be
recovered," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of rare bird fossils has not been effectively
curbed, though great efforts have been made by the government.
According to CAS researchers, hundreds of Confuciusornis fossils
have been sold on the international market, together with fossils
of dinosaurs and aquatic reptiles.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Law on Cultural Relics, fossils of
primitive vertebrates and primitive human beings are placed under
state protection as cultural relics, and UNESCO has listed them as
cultural heritages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, upon learning that China had prohibited the export of
primitive vertebrate fossils, Professor Peter Wellnhofer, a German
expert, posted notices in local fossil markets telling people that
it is illegal to trade in fossils from China. Storrs Olson, an
expert from the United States, said that major museums would never
buy fossils from unknown sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Yuanqing, a researcher from the CAS, said that
the rising number of cases of fossil fabrication has directly
threatened academic research.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Israel to Withdraw From Shebaa Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has urged Israel to withdraw from the Shebaa farms in
south Lebanon and to release Lebanese prisoners, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone talk with the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
on Wednesday evening, Kharrazi stressed that any provocative move
by the Israeli regime may create a critical situation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the latest developments in south
Lebanon following the Israeli withdrawal last week.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed hope that the Lebanese Hezbollah will play a key
role in the future of the country, saying that the U.N. is trying
to collect humanitarian aids by different countries to help
reconstruct Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which declines to recognize Israel, supports the
Hezbollah guerrillas who led Lebanese resistance against Israel's
occupation. The guerrilla said it will continue to fight Israel if
it does not leave the Shebaa region.
</P>
<P>
Shebaa Farms, seized by Israel from Lebanon in the 1967 Middle
East war, are located on the Lebanese side of Mount Hermon which is
</P>
<P>
Syria's highest mountain but under Israeli occupation now. 
</P>
<P>
Israel argues that the Shebaa Farms belong to Syria, and that a
withdrawal from this area will be considered in peace talks with
Damascus when they resume. 
</P>
<P>
According to the British-French agreement on the Lebanese-
Palestinian border in 1923, the Shebaa Farms are not included in
the Lebanese side. But Beirut said Syria had already bequeathed the
farms to it.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Resume Final-Status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators resumed their final-status talks Thursday in order to
reach a framework agreement on final-status issues to pave the way
for striking a final peace deal by September.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, has
confirmed the resumption of the talks, but he could neither
disclose where the talks were held nor who took part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
There were two tracks of final-status talks between the two
sides. One was attended by Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and
his Palestinian counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo, while another one
was held between Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
and Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between the two sides have been bogged down in
recent weeks. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has urged U.S.
President Bill Clinton to put more pressure on Israel to force it
to make compromise.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was in Lisbon, Portugal,
to hold talks with Clinton Thursday, blamed the Palestinian side
for foot-dragging in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak has moved his meeting with Clinton to Thursday morning in
Lisbon, instead of an evening meeting originally planned for
Berlin, Germany. This will enable him to rush home for the
Jerusalem Day celebrations marking Israel's 1967 capture of the
holy city which remains at the heart of the dispute with the
Palestinians.

<P>
Increasing usage of enviroment-friendly fuels such as natural

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Becomes Major Conduit for World Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The East African region has
become a major illicit drug conduit connecting America, Europe and
other areas in the world, police officers have warned.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the police in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda
concluded a three- day meeting here Wednesday, calling for joint
actions to crack down on the fast-growing drug dealings in the
region.
</P>
<P>
There is a worrying evidence that major drug barons are using
the region as a main transit route and destination for buyers
outside Africa, it was reported Thursday by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commissioner in Tanzania told the 8th
Operational Meeting on Drugs for the Directors of Criminal
Investigation Department and Heads of Anti-Narcotics Units for
East Africa that large, multi-kilo quantities of heroin are
staying in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Preventive measures are needed to be put in place before the
East African region comes to be seen as a safe warehouse and major
dealing center for hard drugs," Bruce Dinwiddy said.
</P>
<P>
Director of Criminal Investigation (DCI) in Tanzania,
Commissioner of Police Adadi Rajabu admitted the startling
revelation, saying most of the drugs seized in America and Europe
were traced back to the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is now evident that most of the said drugs could easily
find their way to Europe, America and other parts of the world
through ports and other exit points in East Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the East African region has experienced an increase in
illicit drugs related activities in the late 1980's and early
1990's due to the introduction of better means of communication.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to that period, our region had not yet established
itself as a major illicit drugs network of the world," he said,
noting that other than drugs such as heroin, cocaine, mandrax,
only Herbal Cannabis was largely consumed within member countries
in the region then.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting resolved to embark on exchange
programs for their law enforcer officers to conduct joint regional
training courses and to exchange drug related information.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that member states should ensure their legislation
allowed for pre-trial destruction of drugs and recognized the need
for the ratification of the protocol on combating drug trafficking
and abuse in East Africa.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Trails World in Gender Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is the 14th poorest country
in the world on the gender disparity in education, according to
the background to National Strategy for Girls Education in the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
The strategy notes that despite the assistance from
international and local agencies as well as political will which
has brought powerful female leaders to the fore, Uganda's
achievement in advancing female education still falls short of the
typical indicators.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 146 developing countries rated on the Gender Human
Development Index, Uganda is relegated to 132nd place compared
with Kenya's 112th and Tanzania's 123rd position," said a New
Vision report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Its female adult literacy rate of 48 percent and female life
expectancy of 41 years trail behind both Tanzania and Kenya," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, funded by the United Nations Children Fund
(UNICEF), pointed out that drop-out rates were higher among girls
and that female enrolment was still lower than that of males at
all levels of education.
</P>
<P>
At primary education level, it put girls' enrolment at 47
percent compared with 53 percent for boys, and it widens to 32
percent for females and 68 percent for males at secondary level,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone to Consult International Community on Sankoh's Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 1 (Xinhua) - Sierra Leonean government said
Wednesday that it would consult with the international community
to decide whether to put rebel leader Foday Sankoh on trial.
</P>
<P>
National Concord, a major Nigerian newspaper, Thursday quoted
the country's Information Minister Julius Spencer as saying in
Freetown on Wednesday that it is "a complex issue to decide
exactly what Sankoh should be tried for".
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a local radio interview with the minister as
saying that a decision would have to be taken on "whether to try
Sankoh locally or internationally".
</P>
<P>
He said Sierra Leone, relying heavily upon the international
community for assistance, did not want to make the decision on its
own.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was detained in Freetown on May 17, about a week after
he fled his home in the capital following a shooting-out by his
bodyguards at demonstrators before the eyes of the UN soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The public in Freetown was recently angry at Sankoh' s
unsuccessful escape and required the government to try him.
</P>
<P>
During Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war, rebels led by
Sankoh killed tens of thousands of people and mutilated thousands
of civilians, but Sankoh was amnestied for the crimes under the
Lome peace accord signed last July in exchange of the
demobilization of his troops.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels had in fact broken the accord by attacking and
taking hostages of the UN peacekeepers in the country, said some
observers.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of the West African State (ECOWAS)
earlier this week resolved at a summit in Nigeria's capital Abuja
that Sankoh should be moved to "a safer place" in another country.

<P>
With the telecom reform deepening, the government function will
be separated from enterprises management in local telecom
management administration, said Zhang. In this way, cooperation
between the competing firms will be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) which was
tried in some areas by the China Telecom local branches, Zhang
said that such a business does not tally with the ministry's
policy, and should not be expanded.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom, which is mainly engaged in fixed-phone business,
has released a notice to its local branches recently, asking them
to stop expanding the trial of PHS.
</P>
<P>
The PHS is a transformation from wireless access technology,
which is considered to be convenient in rural areas and small
cities, according to an official from China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also commented on changing the two-way charging system to
a call-payment system for the mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
"We support such a change, but before setting detailed
charging items, we have to take full consideration of the
different interests of the state, the firms, and the consumers. We
are searching for a way to ensure that these three entities all
have their interests protected."

BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains and showers are
expected to alleviate the sustained drought in the Huaihe and
Hanshui river valleys early this month, according to the Central
Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall ranging from 10 to 30 millimeters is forecast for the
Sichuan Basin, southern parts of Shaanxi and Hubei provinces,
central and southern parts of Henan Province, central and southern
parts of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, northern part of
Hunan Province, central and northern parts of Jiangxi and Zhejiang
provinces, eastern part of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and western
part of south China.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall may be as much 80 to 120 mm in a few isolated
areas, the source said, adding that northern part of Xinjiang,
eastern part of northwest China, and southern part of north China
will also see rain in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall, with occasional rainstorms and strong winds, will
possibly influence the harvesting of summer crops.
</P>
<P>
North China has been suffering from a severe drought due to
little rainfall and high temperature since early spring.

<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- China is taking measures to ensure
telecom inter-network connections, according to a high ranking
official with the Ministry of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjiang, vice-minister of the Information Industry,
said that a new regulation on telecom management, which will take
effect in the near future, will clearly define inter-network
connections as the basic responsibility of telecom operators.
</P>
<P>
It also rules out the arbitrating procedure when cutting a
telecom inter-network, said Zhang in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no real competition without an unlocked inter-
network connection," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
With China's market continuing to open, keen competition has
emerged in the telecom sector. But what the Chinese government
wants is "orderly and cooperative competition," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry recently dealt with a case
of cutting an inter-network connection because of competition in
Fuyang City in east China's Anhui Province. One manager of a
local company was fired as a result.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that most of the cases of cutting inter-network
connections occurred because of the interweaving of government
functions with the management of local telecom administrations. (

</P>
<P>
The two sides stressed that the two parties and countries will
make joint efforts to carry on the tradition, and in the coming
years will continue their good-neighborly friendship and step up
cooperation with the aim to enrich the contents of their
friendship and to bring the bilateral relations to a new level of
development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Jiang Zemin spoke highly of General Secretary
Kim Jong Il's visit to China at an important historical junction
of the turn of the century. He said Kim's visit is of great
significance to the further increase of understanding, trust,
friendship and cooperation between the two parties and the two
countries, and to the further development of China-DPRK friendly
relations in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he was delighted to visit China again following his
last trip 17 years ago. He said that DPRK and China share
traditional friendship and that the two sides should continue to
promote the friendly relations pioneered by the older generation
of leaders.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the tradition of meeting between
leaders of the two parties and the two countries should continue.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Kim briefed each other on their respective country's
political and economic situation. Jiang was very pleased to see

Jiang Zemin also expressed his sincere wishes that the DPRK
score greater achievements in its economic construction, foreign
relations and national reunification.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that DPRK is building a Korean-style socialism
according to its specific national conditions while China is
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Kim noted that China has scored great achievements in its
reform and opening to the outside world under the leadership of
CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core. China's
comprehensive national power is being improved and its
international status is rising as well, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
All that demonstrated that the policy of reform and opening to
the outside world, which was initiated by Deng Xiaoping, is
correct, and the Korean party and government support the policy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang said that although the international situation
has changed profoundly, China will unswervingly continue with its
independent foreign policy of peace, and develop friendly
relations with countries across the world under the five
principles of peaceful co-existence, and make joint efforts
together with other countries to build a just and rational new
international political and economic order.

<HEADLINE> China To Hold On-line Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- An on-line trade fair is to open
here tomorrow to attract overseas Chinese and foreign investment
in China's vast central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
The On-line Economic and Technological Cooperation Fair, the
first of its kind in China, will last until the end of the year,
according to Li Haifeng, deputy director of the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
People interested in the fair can log on at: www.chinainvest.
net.cn/qbh for information and for contacting potential Chinese
partners.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen Chinese provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities, along with several coastal cities, will
participate in the fair, which will provide a total of 1,800
projects in the fields of energy, machinery, electronics, and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, business weeks will be held in all the 18
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to provide
detailed information about their economies and answer questions on-
line, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair is jointly sponsored by the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Office of the State Council and the China Information
Society.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen industrial and business groups in Hong Kong, Macao,
the United States, Canada, Holland, and South Africa also have
become the fair's co-sponsors, linking the fair with their own
homepages to facilitate inquiries from their members.
</P>
<P>
This is the third trade fair that has been held for the country
's central and western regions. The 1998 fair attracted over 2,000
overseas Chinese and foreign businesses, inking more than 300
agreements worth 8.79 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming on-line fair represents a completely new
experiment under the new situation, the official said,

<HEADLINE> Police Explore New Model for Traffic Management (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A primary student pushed a button,
the traffic light switched to red, and he walked across the street
leisurely with no sign of worry on his face.
</P>
<P>
This is a common scene at a busy crossing in Nanjing, capital
of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, however, it was a completely different
picture at this very crossing. During after-school hours, the line
of students escorted by their teachers waited anxiously for the
traffic light.
</P>
<P>
How can it be? A tiny device that is capable of changing the
entire traffic conditions in the city?
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview, Yang Huanning, assistant minister of
Public Security, disclosed that the device is merely the tip of
the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
The iceberg, according to Yang, is the new urban traffic
management model being explored by Chinese police.
</P>
<P>
"While continuing to stick to its tradition of exerting arduous
efforts to manage traffic, Chinese police are trying to explore
new scientific managing models by applying advanced traffic
engineering theories," Yang stressed.
</P>
<P>
That's it! The new model!
</P>
<P>
The new model has seen its initial success in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, with a population of five
million, Nanjing has 300,000 motor vehicles and two million other
vehicles. In 1994, per capita road space in Nanjing was 4.7 sq.
meters, sharply lower than the seven-sq-meter national average,
and traffic jams dominated 80 percent of the crossings in the city
at that time.
</P>
<P>
Now, the situation is completely different. The city has few
traffic jams, few traffic accidents, and rare violations of
traffic regulations.

<HEADLINE> Police Explore New Model for Traffic Management (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu Xiaoxiang, head of the Traffic Management Bureau of Nanjing
attributed these improvements to the support of the local
government and the adoption of scientific traffic management
methods.
</P>
<P>
"The city government calls for nearly all the departments in
the city to make joint efforts to tap the city's potential for
smooth transportation", Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu added that all major crossings in the city have already been
computerized. For instance, automatic cameras have been installed
at 120 major crossings to monitor traffic conditions, and multi-
directional traffic lights have been installed at 150 major
crossings to direct drivers more scientifically.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since the adoption of this device, the
average speed of automobiles moving on the 14 major roads during
rush hours has risen by 77 percent.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, the Ministry of Public Security and the
Ministry of Construction initiated the "Smooth Traffic Project" in
36 major cities and some medium and smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
Meng Hongwei, director of Traffic Management Bureau under the
Ministry of Public Security, also thought highly of the role of
the new model in this project.
</P>
<P>
"The project aims at realizing the transformation from the old
experience-oriented management model to the new sci-tech dominated
model," Meng said.
</P>
<P>
As public awareness of traffic rules needing enhancing, it is
of vital importance to set up "elaborate streets," streets
featuring high standard, high quality, and a high level of
management, Meng pointed out at the meeting on enforcement of the
project.
</P>
<P>
" 'The people's police serving people,' that is our motto. In
the implementation of the new model, we should be patient and
reasonable in fighting backward traffic practices, for it has
lasted for centuries in China," Meng stressed.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The U.S.-based Lucent Technologies Inc., a research
and development arm of Bell, agreed on Wednesday to buy Chromatis
Networks for some 4.5 billion U.S. dollars, setting a new record
for the purchase of a company originating in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The value of the deal will rise to 4.8 billion dollars if
Chromatis, a developer of innovative optical-network technology for
metropolitan communications applications, meets certain performance
targets.
</P>
<P>
The payment will be in the form of some 78 million shares of
Lucent common stock. The 4.5-billion-dollar valuation is based on a
closing price of 58.125 dollars for Lucent stock on May 30.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cyprus government Wednesday decided to raise the
price of unleaded petrol from 0.378 Cyprus pound (0.612 U.S.
dollar) to 0.418 pound (0.677 dollar) a liter.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Minister of Commerce, Industry and
Tourism Nicos Rolandis also said the price of super oil will rise
from 0.4 pound (0.648 dollar) to 0.44 pound (0.713 dollar) a liter.
The price of diesel will increase from 0.146 pound (0.237 dollar)
to 0.166 pound (0.269 dollar) a liter.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to annul fuel subsidies to the
island's national carrier Cyprus Airways.
</P>
<P>
The new price hikes came into effect as from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- First quarter results of Israel's major banks were
positive across the board, according to earning reports released
Wednesday by Bank Leumi, Israel Discount Bank and United Mizrahi
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The banks' activities in the capital markets increased
threefold, with increased investments in both provident and mutual
funds -- resulting in increased management fees for the banks --
and commissions from the high volume of general trading.
</P>
<P>
Analysts question whether similar results will be produced in
the quarters to come.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish banks suffered a loss of 566 million U.S.
dollars in 1999, reported Anatolia News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics in a booklet of Banks Union of Turkey "
Our Banks-1999," a total of 18 banks were operating in Turkey as of
the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The total assets of these banks increased 96 percent to 72
quadrillion Turkish Liras in 1999 or 14 percent to 133.5 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The average of total TL assets in national income rose from 69
percent to 92 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's unemployment rate dropped to a seasonally
adjusted 8.6 percent of the workforce in the first quarter of this
year, in comparison with 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 8.7
percent in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
This is the second consecutive quarterly decline from the 9
percent rate recorded during the July-September period.
Unemployment rate reached a record high of 11.2 percent in 1992,
then declined during the following four years.

<HEADLINE> 3 Muslim Brotherhood Suspects Arrested in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian police have arrested three
suspected members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood in the north of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution at El-Manzala in Dakahlia Governorate, 90
kilometers north of Cairo, ordered the detention of the three
people Wednesday on charges of promoting the ideology of the
Brotherhood, Al Akhbar daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Video cassettes, books and other publications for propagating
Brotherhood ideology were seized in the houses of the three
suspects in El-Manzala, the pro-government newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The detainees will face several counts of incitement, including
attempts to overthrow the ruling regime, possession of outlawed
books and embracing the ideas of the banned group.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 members of the Muslim Brotherhood have been
arrested since October 1999, dozens of whom since the beginning of
May, in a growing government crackdown on the movement.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest Islamic fundamentalist
group, was banned in 1954 by former President Gamal Abdel Nasser,
but it enjoys intermittent periods of official tolerance as it does
not advocate violence in attempting to install a strict Islamic
rule.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks Arab Support for OIC Top Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has turned to Arab countries
for backing its candidate for the post of secretary-general of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) after winning a
majority support from the Asian group.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon hosted for Arab ambassadors in Ankara Wednesday,
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem asked for Arab support, which is viewed
as crucial in Turkey's candidate Yasar Yakis' election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Cem told reporters before the luncheon that Turko-Arab relations
are one of the priorities of Turkey's foreign policy, adding that
Turkey had been focusing on improving its ties with Arab countries
in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Without elaborating, Cem said that misunderstanding between
Turkey and Arab countries had been eradicated. But he was
apparently referring to the Arab complaints about Turkey's military
ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's flirtation with the Arabs came after Ankara reached an
understanding with Bangladesh on raising an Asian candidate for the
OIC's top post.
</P>
<P>
The OIC secretary-general is a four-year post which rotates
among the three groups of countries within the 55-member Islamic
body, namely the Arab, Asian and African groups. Turkey is in the
Asian group.
</P>
<P>
Under OIC standard practice, since the outgoing Moroccan
Secretary-General Azzeddine Laraki is not seeking a second term, it
is presumably the Asian group's turn now to appoint someone to the
office.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was the first country to announce its candidate for
the post, naming its Parliament Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhry,
and Turkey announced its contender secondly.
</P>
<P>
Turkey believes that its candidate is the most qualified and
competent contender, said Cem. Yasar Yakis, a career diplomat with
a vast experience of Middle East affairs as well as international
organizations, speaks fluent Arabic, French and English, the three
official languages in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu visited Bangladesh
last week to hold political consultations with his Bangladesh
counterpart on the issue.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two countries agreed to support an
Asian candidate, instead of an Arab choice, in the upcoming
elections for the leading OIC post, but neither is willing at this
point to withdraw its candidate.
</P>
<P>
Muslim countries, which have close relations with both Turkey
and Bangladesh, are trying to persuade the two members of the Asain
group to compromise and withdraw one candidate in favor of the
other.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomatic sources say that Ankara, which has already
received the backings of nine out of 17 countries, told Bangladesh
that Turkey was in a more advantageous position in terms of support
from the Asian group.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has reportedly made it clear that it would support
Turkish candidate in case that its own loses his chance in the
race.  The Jiddah-based OIC is scheduled to convene a foreign
ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on June 27-30 to
choose the new secretary-general, who will be approved at the next
OIC summit in Qatar on November 12-14 this year.

ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Germany have signed a
security cooperation agreement on jointly fighting organized crime,
drug trafficking and human smuggling, Anatolia News Agency reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turan Genc, director general of the Turkish Security Forces,
held talks on Wednesday with his German counterpart Ulrich Kersten,
who paid a two-day visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after their meetings, the two sides called
on the security organizations of all countries to cooperate closely
to fight against cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish police chief said that the close cooperation between
Turkey and Germany in this field is deep-rooted, being kept in a
good way.
</P>
<P>
During their meetings, Genc said that they discussed how to take
efficient measures to implement the agreement in curbing these
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
The German police head said that Germany has attached importance
to conducting international cooperation in the fight against cross-
border crimes.
</P>
<P>
"We want to hold seminars and exchange our experience," he said,
expressing congratulations to Turkish police on the success of
their operations against drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Germany have close ties in political, economic and
cultural fields. There have been 3 million Turkish citizens living
in Germany.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australia Hesitates on Sanctions  Against Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After George Speight took hostages of Fijian prime minister and
his ministers on May 19, Canberra has threatened for several times
to take sanctions against the island country. However up to now
only bans on freight, air transport and mail have been imposed by
trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council of the cabinet met Wednesday
night. Australian Associated Press Thursday reported that Foreign
Minister Downer confirmed the council had agreed not to apply
sanctions until former prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his 30
ministers were released. Meanwhile, Prime Minister John Howard
told reporter later that Australia remained committed to
implementing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Australia is hesitating. Downer had said on May 30 that "quite
apart from the immense harm it would do to all Fijians, it would
also down the economies of other neighboring countries such as
Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tonga and Samoa, and I do not think Australia
would be well regarded around the world if we were to do that."
</P>
<P>
There are different viewpoints among Fijian trade unions on the
issue. A Fiji trade union leader called Thursday on international
unions to step up trade bans despite the pain they will cause the
nation.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian Associated Press, Fiji Trade Union
Congress (FTUC) secretary Felix Anthony said trade bans were
necessary to protest against George Speight's capture of prime
minister Mahendra Chaudhry and most of his government.
</P>
<P>
"That's the only way that the international trade union
movement can tell the authorities here that this is not the way
things are supposed to be," he said.
</P>

Fiji's main money-spinner, the sugar industry, Anthony said,
already has ground to a halt, and schools and shops around the
country remain closed.
</P>
<P>
He said the FTUC would meet on Saturday to decide on whether to
push ahead with the stoppage.
</P>
<P>
Other Fijian business figures take a different stance saying
that Trade sanctions will only hurt the poor and the innocent and
could even have a backlash in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The clothing industry in Fiji employs 20,000 people - 60
percent of them Indian Fijians. The country import raw materials
from Australia and then sell back clothing. Seventy five per cent
of Fiji's exports to Australia are from the garment industry.
</P>
<P>
The Australia-Fiji Business Council warned that Sanctions will
lead to financial losses by Australian companies exporting to, or
invent in Fiji and result in job losses in Australia.
</P>
<P>
With all of these concerns, Australia is certainly to take
sanctions against Fiji if the democratizing process turned to be
wrecked at last.

CANBERRA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A major breakthrough has been made
in the bid to resolve Fiji's hostage crisis, a military spokesman
said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a very major breakthrough," said military
spokesman Eroni Volavola after a meeting between coup leader
George Speight and army Commander Frank Bainimarama.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can safely say that within the next 24 to 36 hours
you will start to see a lot of very positive things coming out of
parliament," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Speight and Bainimarama was the first face
to face talks between the pair since the hostage crisis began on
May 19.
</P>
<P>
The details of any peace deal remain unclear, although Volavola
hinted one concession was that Speight supporters would be part of
an interim civilian government to take over when the military
regime stood aside.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility is there," he said of the likelihood
appointment of Speight's men to government roles.

The report, issued by the UN Economic and Social Commission for

still dependent on outdated, labor intensive technology, and rely
heavily on low labor costs.
</P>
<P>
To increase the role of Asian small and medium-sized businesses
in the global market, it suggested that information technology is
especially needed.
</P>
<P>
A recent study conducted by the ESCAP found that certain
conditions are needed for diffusing information technology into
these businesses,such as establishing a legal framework for e-
commerce, increasing access to relevant information, building
business awareness and improving the information infrastructure,
it said.

<HEADLINE> Manila, MILF to Hold Another Talks Over Proposed  Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government and Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) peace negotiators agreed Thursday
to hold another round of talks later this month over the
government proposal of autonomy for the MILF, the government said.
</P>
<P>
Both panels will meet again on June 28 to settle the proposal
over autonomy for the MILF, chief government negotiator Edgardo
Batenga told reporters after ending their fourth round formal
negotiations in Mindanao Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The autonomy proposal, according to the chief negotiator, is
believed to be the only solution to end the armed conflict in
Mindanao"that is consistent and compatible with the Philippine
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
"The proposal has already been accepted by both sides in
principle,but what we are more concerned now is the time frame,"
said Batenga.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the MILF has some 20 days to study and answer the
proposal presented to them since President Joseph Estrada earlier
set the deadline as up to the end of this month for the two panes
to wrap up their talks.
</P>
<P>
Moner Bajunaid, MILF acting panel chairman, said that they are
also working hard to submit comments and counter-proposals to fine
tune lapses in the government peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
The two sides resumed their peace talks in Cotabato,
Maguindanao province Tuesday after the negotiation has been
stalled by clashes of government forces and MILF rebels in the
Mindanao area.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflicts between the two sides over the past few
months have killed more than 150 soldiers while having some 500
others wounded and about 200,000 civilians displaced.

BELGRADE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A close adviser of Montenegrin

<HEADLINE> Gunman Releases Two Children at Wasserbillig EDS-Updates with details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The gunman holding more than 20
kids hostage on Thursday released two children including the
youngest, a two-year-old girl, police said.
</P>
<P>
The released children now totaled 10. The children held hostage
are all aged under eight.
</P>
<P>
The man, armed with a pistol, a hand grenade and a knife, was
still facing off with the Luxembourg police at Wasserbillig in
eastern Luxembourg bordering Germany and had demanded to be flown
to Libya with around 20 million francs (about 220,000 U.S. dollars)
in return for the release of the 29 children he had taken hostage
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He also took three adult females from the nursery school as
hostage.
</P>
<P>
The man, only identified as an Algerian national who came to
settle in Luxembourg in 1982 and a father of two, has a history of
mental illness but he told the police that he does not want any
harm to come to the children.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 Portuguese children are among the hostages. French,
German and Luxembourg children are also being held captive since
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The police has cordoned off the nursery school and ambulances
and fire engines are standing by near the school building.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg Interior Minister Michel Wolter has instructed
earlier that the hostage taking incident be ended without violence.
Social workers are negotiating with the gunman.

<HEADLINE> Birthday Celebration for General Zhang Xueliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A celebration was held here today
marking the 99th birthday of General Zhang Xueliang, a national
hero of modern China.
</P>
<P>
"We respect General Zhang not only because he was a famous
figure but for his persistent patriotism," said Zhang Zhiqiang, a
history researcher with the Liaoning Provincial Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xueliang, born on June 3, 1901 on a horse-drawn carriage
in northeast China's Liaoning Province, is now living in Hawaii in
the United States with his wife Zhao Yidi.
</P>
<P>
His fellow townspeople have prepared two woodcarvings and a
wicker basket as birthday gifts.
</P>
<P>
The wicker basket contains soy beans and grain sorghum which
were abundant in northeast China, hometown of General Zhang who
has not visited there for 70 years, ever since the Xi'an Incident.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was instrumental in arresting Chiang Kai-shek, enemy of
the Communist Party of China, during the famous Xi'an Incident in
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and General Yang Hucheng arrested Chiang Kai-shek, leader
of the Kuomintang, and tried to force him to stop the civil war
and turn to fighting against the Japanese invaders, on December 12,
1936. This has since been known in modern Chinese history as the
Xi'an Incident.
</P>
<P>
Chiang was released unharmed after negotiations in which late
premier Zhou Enlai played a crucial role. However, Zhang was
imprisoned by Chiang, and spent decades under house arrest in
Taiwan under the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
According to the China-based Zhang Xueliang Foundation, this is
the first time that people from the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, and
the United States will all celebrate the General's birthday.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Lower Medicine Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez Jr. said in a radio
interview that the government wants more accurate estimates of
medicine prices and increased competitiveness in the bidding
process.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the practice of giving agency estimates for drugs
and medicines has not been used. We're perfecting the process by
which we can make accurate estimates so the accurate estimation of
prices can be carried out," Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
He added the government will still import lower-priced
medicines to pressure more pharmaceutical firms to bring down the
prices of their products.
</P>
<P>
"This is only a part of our campaign to lower prices. By
broadening our sources of medicines, we will further lower the
prices Romualdez said.
</P>
<P>
In line with his commitment to provide the poor with quality
health care, President Joseph Estrada earlier urged the Department
of Health and other concerned agencies to find ways of pulling
down medicine prices in the country, which he noted, cost ten
times more than those sold in other Asian countries, such as India.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Expand Relief Food Plan in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) is to
expand its emergency relief food operations in Kenya, especially
to cover 18 districts severely hit by drought.
</P>
<P>
The agency, through its emergency operation program, is
distributing 75, 000 tons of food in Turkana, Marsabit and Mandera
districts in northern Kenya at a cost of 43 million U.S. dollars,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
WFP deputy country director David Flether said Wednesday in
Garissa town,
</P>
<P>
Kenya's North Eastern Province, that his organization would
supply more food to cover up drought-hit districts in the next
six months.
</P>
<P>
He said in the next 10 days, the food program and partners
would launch an international appeal for help to those living in
the northern parts of Kenya who are the worst hit.
</P>
<P>
Flether noted that successive failure of both long and short
rains in many parts of Kenya had shattered the traditional
drought-coping mechanism in these districts.
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi appealed to
international donors for relief food, saying that 23 million
Kenyans, 80 percent of the population, were likely to starve
following the failure of the long rains in the current planting
season.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans Refuse to Leave Occupied Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Chairman of the Zimbabwe
National Liberation War Veterans Association Mike Moyo Wednesday
said members of the association will not leave the farms they
occupied despite calls by Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa
to vacate the farms.
</P>
<P>
Only President Robert Mugabe has the authority to order the war
veterans off the farms, he told a press conference here in Harare.
</P>
<P>
However, Moyo said that his association has called upon its
members who have occupied farms to ensure that their demonstration
remains peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans should refrain from violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied about 1,000 white farms since
February this year.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Dabengwa said the government does not expect war
veterans to resist vacating farms they are occupying once the
state starts resettling people under the amended Land Acquisition
Act.
</P>
<P>
The minister could not say whether he would order the police to
eject the war veterans if they refuse to budge as he is positive
that the occupiers would move out on their own.
</P>
<P>
According to the amended Land Acquisition Act, the government
will acquire farms without paying compensation for land.
</P>
<P>
War veterans leader Chenjerai Hunzvi issued an ultimatum to the
 government at the weekend to allocate land to ex-combatants and
villagers before the June 24 and 25 elections.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Armed Man Releases Two Young Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Two young children, including a
two-year-old girl, were released Thursday by an armed man holding
29 children and three adults hostage at a daycare center in a
small village in eastern Luxembourg near the border with Germany,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The gunman is still holding 27 children and three teachers, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old gunman came into the daycare center in the
village of Wasserbillig with a pistol, hand grenade and knife and
took the three workers and the children aged from several months
to eight years old, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Special operations police members armed with rifles have sealed
off the building and conducted a long night negotiation by
telephone with the gunman who is a Luxembourg citizen with
Algerian origin and has a history of mental illness, Interior
Minister Michel Wolter told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The gunman demanded 60 million Belgian francs (1.5 million U.S.
dollars and a plane to fly him to Libya later on Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have given the orders that the situation be ended without
violence, negotiations are still going on," said Wolter.
</P>
<P>
The children have had food and drinks, and medicines would be
taken into the building, he said.

<HEADLINE> Science Leads Professor to Riches (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 1 (Xinhua) --Professor Zhang Tingbi of the Life
Science College of Wuhan University in central China's Hubei
Province no longer goes from company to company seeking research
financing, as he did eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has been certified by a local accountants office as
having 131 million yuan (about 15.8 million U.S. dollars) worth of
assets from the intellectual property rights he possesses in a
Wuhan-based conglomerate which produces blood-enhancing health
products.
</P>
<P>
"The intellectual property rights system has kept improving in
China, and this will encourage more and more researchers to
actively apply their scientific findings to industrial production
and transform them into corporate stakes," said the 62-year-old
biology professor.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, when Zhang was doing research on plant pigmentation,
he had the idea to spread the application of porphyrin iron
technology by using biological methods to mass produce porphyrin
iron, an effective and low-cost agent for preventing and curing
iron-deficiency anemia.
</P>
<P>
His idea won support from a group of private businessmen who
invested 500,000 yuan (about 60,240 U.S. dollars) to finance Zhang
's research and development. A popular blood-enhancing health
product called "Hongtaokei Blood-Enhancing Agent" was soon
developed. Now, advertising for the blood-enhancing product can
be seen from crowded football fields to remote countryside houses.
</P>
<P>
The Hongtaokei Group, considered the largest private business
in the city of Wuhan, decided in 1996 that Professor Zhang should
have 10 percent of the group's stock, and Zhang was also elected a
director of the eight-member board of directors for the group.
</P>
<P>
Annual sales of the Hongtaokei-brand blood-enhancing agent now
exceeds one billion yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars), with
more than 100 million yuan (about 12 million U.S. dollars) paid in
taxes annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition to technological stock rights, Professor Zhang also
receives an annual salary of 120,000 yuan (about 14,458 U.S.
dollars), owns a town villa worth four million yuan (481,928 U.S.
dollars) and a limousine worth more than 800,000 yuan (96,386 U.S.
dollars). This constitutes a striking contrast to the traditional
image of Chinese professors who used to be poor while despising
any involvement in economic activities.
</P>
<P>
"Eight years ago, I was always short of money and worried a lot
over research financing," Zhang recalled, "in most cases, I could
not manage research and teaching simultaneously with the limited
financing I got."
</P>
<P>
Despite his new-found riches, the millionaire professor still
lives a simple life on the campus of the University.

<TEXT>
<P>
The fact that scientists who have become prosperous with their
research achievements have been pushed to the front stage by the
growth of high- and new-tech industries symbolizes that knowledge
economy will break through the obstacles of thought, property
rights, and the distribution system.
</P>
<P>
University professors and government officials alike are
encouraged by Professor Zhang's story. Professor Lu Zhongmei of
the Zhongnan (Central-South China) Institute of Political Science
and Law in Wuhan said social recognition of "scientific tycoons"
will be conducive to forming a range of new concepts.
</P>
<P>
Heralding the phenomenon of Professor Zhang Tingbi as an
epitome of developing China's fledgling knowledge economy, Chinese
economist Li Guang believed that under a knowledge economy, the
intellectual property rights system will help turn knowledge into
capital.
</P>
<P>
China has been swept by a wave of stockholding transformation
in the past decade, coupled with the establishment of capital
markets and the expansion of reforms regarding property rights and
income distribution.
</P>
<P>
Ownership of private assets and distribution according to
corporate stock proportions are now both protected by Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
"Regulations on Promoting Application of Scientific and
Technological Achievements" published last year stipulate that
factors of production such as technology and management expertise
are allowed and encouraged to be included in the distribution of
income, and the proportion of technological shares in the total
capital of an enterprise is raised from 20 percent to 35 percent
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Governments at various levels have been busy drafting measures
to introduce mechanisms that will encourage scientific and
technological innovations in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"China has been creating a nice environment for the development
of a knowledge economy," said economist Li Guang, citing Professor
Zhang Tingbi's success as an evidence.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the country has been reforming its academic
institutions, which will soon see a great number of scientific and
technological workers no longer depending on state finance for
salaries, but turning to the market for subsistence.
</P>
<P>
Economist Li Guang is confident that if thousands of scientific
tycoons can be brought about and scientific and technological
workers become fully market-aware, the springtime for China's
knowledge economy arrives.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Future Lies in Reunification: Army Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The future of Taiwan lies in the
ultimate reunification of the motherland, according to a signed
article in today's Liberation Army Daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
At present, the island of Taiwan at the crossroads. "Both
history and reality indicate to us that Taiwan's future lies in
the ultimate reunification of the motherland," the article said.
</P>
<P>
Only the reunification with the motherland will ensure Taiwan a
broad international space, respectable world status, and give the
Taiwan residents the dignity and honor of being Chinese, it noted.
</P>
<P>
After nearly a century of hard struggle, the Chinese people
have finally stood up, and the country is emerging as a big
country in the world after half a century development, it said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council and the biggest developing country in the world,
China has been playing a major role in the peace and development
of mankind, and has won high respect and honor from the
international community, the article said.
</P>
<P>
History demonstrates that Taiwan's fate has been closely linked
to the fate of the motherland, and a strong and united motherland
has always been the ultimate home of Taiwan, it said.
</P>
<P>
The island can achieve real independence, equality, and
security along with the motherland only when the country is
completely reunited on the basis of the one-China principle, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
It is only reunification with the motherland that will ensure
Taiwan's economy a solid basis of steady growth and safeguard the
prosperity and happiness of the Taiwan people, the article said. (

<P>
As a typical island economy, Taiwan is heavily dependent on
foreign trade, which accounts for over 96 percent of its total
gross domestic products (GDP). On the other hand, the mainland has
become the world's largest new market with a population of nearly
1.3 billion people, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The globalization and regionalization of the world economy
means that the island's hope of sustained economic growth lies in
the motherland, which has already been demonstrated by the
development of cross-Straits economic relations over the past 20
years, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is only reunification with the motherland that will ensure
Taiwan long-term peace and security amid the great waves of the
Pacific, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
From a geopolitical point of view, Taiwan has an important
position in Asia-Pacific strategy, and has been an area of
contention among the world's major powers. As a hilly island,
Taiwan also lacks strategic depth and is susceptible to outside
attacks, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that separated from the motherland, the island
of Taiwan will not have the capacity to defend itself against the
tempestuous waves of the Pacific, and will ultimately fall prey to
big powers.
</P>
<P>
"Only a united and strong motherland will always be the
powerful guarantor of Taiwan's peace and security," the Liberation
Army Daily stressed.
</P>
<P>
The complete reunification of the motherland represents an
irresistible historical trend, and will benefit both sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of "Taiwan independence" should bear in mind that
any attempt to split the island from the motherland will meet the
strong opposition of the entire Chinese people, who are ready to
defend the motherland's sovereign and territorial integrity with
life and blood, the article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Peng Peiyuan, vice-chairperson of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
has called for enhanced protection of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
During her recent inspection of cultural relics protection in
Shanxi province, Peng said that the general public should further
raise its awareness of relics protection and departments concerned
must strengthen their management capability.
</P>
<P>
The northern China province of Shanxi boasts over 3,500
cultural relics sites, many of which are of high historical and
artistic value.
</P>
<P>
While speaking highly of the province's efforts in the area of
relics protection, Peng said that all localities should further
implement the law on cultural relics protection, and deal properly
with the relationship between protection and economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more efforts should be taken to give a full
play to the role of cultural relics in public education and
scientific research, Peng said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Output, Exports in May Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's oil output and exports showed
steady increase in May, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The INA quoted Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid as saying
that Iraq's oil output in May reached 3.1 million barrels per day
(bpd), compared with 2.63 million bpd in April and 2.16 million bpd
in March.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, Iraq's oil output capacity will be able
to reach 3.3 million bpd, Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq's oil exports totalled 2.5 million bpd in May,
800,000 bpd up from the figure of March.
</P>
<P>
According to the oil minister, under the seventh phase of the U.
N. oil-for-food program due to end this month, Iraq is going to
export 350 million barrels of oil, bringing a record revenue of 85
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has fulfilled its commitments toward the contracts of
marketing oil under the seventh phase of the oil-for-food deal,"
Rashid was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iraq's accusation of the U.S. and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee who put on hold contracts
Iraq signed with foreign companies to import oil equipment and
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
During the fifth, sixth and seventh phase of the U.N. oil-for-
food deal, Iraq signed contracts worth 1.5 billion dollars with
foreign companies to rehabilitate Iraq's oil industry, but only 770
million dollars worth of contracts were approved, said Rashid.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly condemned the U.S. and Britain of impeding
the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food program by deliberately
shelving contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to import
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies to offset the
crippling impacts of the decade-long U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to import basic goods in
an exemption to the stringent sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Even if a framework for a final status accord is reached with
the Palestinians in the near future, the question of Jerusalem will
be left unresolved, Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office
Haim Ramon, responsible for Jerusalem affairs, acknowledged
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ramon, interviewed on Israel's Channel One Wednesday night, said
that "if there is an agreement, it will not include the issue of
Jerusalem, because I do not believe it is possible to resolve this
delicate matter at this point."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and his Israeli
team will hold a third and presumably last round of Stockholm back-
channel talks with their Palestinian counterparts on the framework
agreement in Israel on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The right-wing associations behind the plan to build a Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem's Abu Dis are now organizing to set
up greenhouses or an agricultural farm, security sources told
Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
The associations also plan to have guards and maintenance
workers living on the site, hoping in this way to guarantee the
Jewish hold on it even before the final approval of detailed plans
for the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the army, police and Shin Bet security service
all recommend erecting a fence between Jerusalem and the Arab
neighborhoods on its border to be handed to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will complain to U.S.
President Bill Clinton that the Palestinians are foot-dragging in
negotiations, as the latest round of peace efforts move to Lisbon,
and the Stockholm back-channel talks resume in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak brought forward his meeting with Clinton, which will took
place in Lisbon, to Thursday morning, instead of an evening meeting
originally planned for Berlin.
</P>
<P>
This is so he can rush back to Israel for Jerusalem Day
celebrations to mark Israel's 1967 capture of the city, which
remains at the heart of the dispute with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A bill setting a seven-year jail sentence for women who pray
at the Western Wall plaza and wear prayer shawls, blow the shofar
or read aloud from the Torah, was passed Wednesday by the Knesset
(Parliament) plenum in its preliminary reading.
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by United Torah Judaism (UTJ) faction, came
in response to a Supreme Court ruling last week allowing the Women
of the Wall group to conduct public prayers at the Wall.
</P>
<P>
Many of the secular Knesset members responded with rage. One
Israel Coalition whip Ophir Pines-Paz said the members of the UTJ
faction have forgotten that they live in a democratic and
egalitarian society in which people are not imprisoned for their
gender.

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a radio speech that
the government will do its part to beat the June 30 deadline for
reaching a settlement as set by President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"We can't draw yet the whole picture, but we are hopeful some
objectives of our president can be achieved," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada had instructed government negotiators and
their MILF counterparts to reach a peace agreement, or at least
make substantial progress in the peace efforts, by June 30.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the government, which is seeking genuine and long-
lasting peace in Mindanao, would not settle for any shortcut.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for a long-term solution. Aside from a military
solution, we want to put in place economic measures to address the
root causes of the problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Government and MILF negotiators are now putting the final
touches on a joint communique summarizing the highlights of their
two-day talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides resumed their peace talks in Cotabato,
Maguindanao province Tuesday after the negotiation has been
stalled by clashes of government forces and MILF rebels in the
Mindanao area over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflicts have killed more than 150 soldiers while
having some 500 others wounded and about 200,000 civilians
displaced.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mining Sector Declines by 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mining sector, one of the
country' s largest foreign exchange earners, has declined by 7.1
percent largely as a result of low international prices of
minerals, the weekly Business reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the latest Treasury monthly bulletin
indicated significant cuts in the production of a number of
minerals in the country, with asbestos output dropped by 37.1
percent, black granite by 97.6 percent, coal by 9 percent and
copper by 77.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beside low international prices for metals and minerals, the
mining sector has become less profitable due to the flat exchange
rate while the rise in the rate of inflation has also put pressure
on the production costs, which have been worsened by the critical
shortage of fuel facing the country.
</P>
<P>
A number of mining houses, particularly those listed on the
stock market, have issued cautionary statements to their
shareholders over the impact that the prevailing harsh economic
environment has had on their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Some mining houses have also suspended or cut back on their
exploration activities because of cash flow problems, while others
have reduced their production levels.
</P>
<P>
The mining sector contributes over 8 percent to Zimbabwe's
gross domestic product and employs over 50,000 people.

<HEADLINE> SADC Maize Harvest Expected to Increase by 12 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) region expects a maize harvest of 18.82 million
tons this year, 12 percent more than last year's output of 16.76
million tons, the daily Herald newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is likely to have produced just enough for its own
needs, while South Africa and Malawi will have surpluses to
compensate for deficits in the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
Maize prospects for the 1999-2000 season are generally brighter
than last year despite devastation caused by flooding in Zimbabwe,
southern Mozambique and parts of South Africa, Swaziland and
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
According to a food security update by the SADC, maize
production in South Africa is anticipated to reach 9.63 million
tons this year as against 7.11 million tons last year, while in
Zimbabwe the maize output is expected to increase from 1.52
million tons last year to 2.13 million tons this year.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The standards of living in many
African countries are worse today than they were at independence
in the 1960s, a recent report by the World Bank indicated.
</P>
<P>
"Average income per capita is lower than that at the end of
1960s," the East African Standard daily Thursday quoted the report
entitled "Can Africa Claim the 21st Century?" as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The region's total income is not much more than Belgium's, and
is divided among 48 countries with a median gross domestic product
(GDP) of just over 2 billion U.S. dollars -- about the output of a
town of 60,000 in a rich country," the report said.
</P>
<P>
With its rapidly growing population, the continent needs to
grow by at least five percent per annum just to maintain current
poverty levels, the report said, noting that nearly half of the
continent's people are now living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
"Africa accounts for barely 1 percent of global GDP and only 2
percent of world trade," the report said. "Its share of global
manufactured exports is almost zero."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has announced
its plans to construct two hydro-electricity power plants in the
country, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The development of the new power plants is expected to beef up
the nations's power supply and to exploit the void in the South
African market which is anticipating a critical power shortage by
2008.
</P>
<P>
According to permanent secretary Peter Mwamfuli of the Ministry
of Energy and Water Development, the blue print to construct the
power plants would be ready as soon as the funds to finance the
projects are accessed.
</P>
<P>
The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa said last
month that it had information to the effect that South Africa
would be hit by a power shortage to be caused by increasing
domestic, commercial and industrial usage of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping advised Zambia, which it said has great
potential to provide power to the entire region, to exploit the
situation and provide South Africa with electricity.

BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A 39-year-old man, armed with a
pistol, a hand grenade and a knife, was still facing off the
police with 23 nursery school children as hostage in eastern
Luxembourg on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunman, born in Algeria, has demanded to be

The hostage-taking took place on Wednesday at Wasserbillig near
the Luxembourg-Germany border.
</P>
<P>
The gunman was said to have become a Luxembourg citizen in 1982
but was said to have a history of mental problems. He also took
three adults from the day-care center as hostages.
</P>
<P>
Of the children taken hostage, some are from Germany, France
and Portugal besides those from Luxembourg.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A report from the State Information
Center shows that most Chinese economists foresee faster economic
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the economists surveyed said they expect the
gross domestic product to grow by 7.5 to 8 percent this year,
according to today's "China Securities."
</P>
<P>
Most of them believe that the consumer price index will
increase by one percent this year, and that there will be faster
growth in fixed-asset investment, probably by 9.6 percent on an
annual basis.
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign trade is expected to enjoy steady growth
in 2000, with exports surging by 13.5 percent and imports up 15.3
percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
However, about half of the economists are still not sure
whether or not this represents the beginning of a new round of
economic boom.

<HEADLINE> IMF New Chief Vows to Listen more </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) will listen more to the people and the authorities so that it
can give good advice, IMF's new Managing Director Horst Koehler
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, Koehler said he thinks the role of the IMF is not "
imposing," but "really giving good advice based on more listening
to the people and the authorities" and produce measures conducive
to strong growth.
</P>
<P>
Taking over the post of managing director of the IMF four weeks
ago, Koehler said one of the lessons he learned from the Asian
crisis is that the IMF should "listen better" to the people and
the authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to comment whether IMF's prescription for
Thailand is wrong, while admitting that the IMF has to do more on
crisis prevention.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is going to graduate from the IMF-led assistance
program, worth 17.2 billion U.S. dollars, next month, which it
received after its currency baht collapsed in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the fund, Thailand had to adhere to strict IMF
economic performance standards, with its compliance periodically
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF was accused of applying inappropriate conditions on
the package, including placing stringent curbs on government
spending, and miscalculating the depth of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was also criticized for applying the same solution to the
very different crises occurring in Thailand, South Korea and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Thailand stopped drawing funds from the package last June,
after receiving a total of 14.2 billion dollars in credits from
multilateral and bilateral contributors under the program.
</P>
<P>
Describing both his meetings with Chuan and Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda Wednesday as "fruitful," Koehler said he is
encouraged that the Thai economy is on the path of continued
recovery.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, to make the recovery sustainable, the Thai
government should further carry out the restructuring of the
banking sector, with focus on the improvement of the non-
performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Koehler also voiced support to the Chiang Mai Initiative,
saying it is "complementary to the IMF's own understanding of its
preparedness to support the countries."
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers from China, Japan, South Korea and the 10
members of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
agreed last month in Thailand's northern city of Chiang Mai on
establishing a regional financing arrangement to prevent future
currency crises and to provide short-term balance of payments
support for countries in need.
</P>
<P>
Koehler said he supports any initiative that will help the
countries in the region to improve their economies and to get out
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the first leg of Koehler's five-nation Asian tour.
He is going on to visit China, South Korea, Indonesia and India.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 girl school
dropouts in southwest China's Yunnan Province have returned to the
classroom thanks to the "Spring Bud Project," a national endeavor
that has been helping female school dropouts in poor areas for the
past six years.
</P>
<P>
Because many ethnic minority people living in the mountainous
and border areas of Yunnan still hold the idea that men are
superior to women, 200,000 students there have discontinued their
studies in recent years, and nearly two thirds of them were girls.
</P>
<P>
The "Spring Bud Project" was initiated by the Children's
Foundation of China in 1989. It developed into a national program
with the goal of seeing that all girl drop-outs return to the
classroom and complete their nine years of compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming Girls' Middle School has enrolled 150 girl students
from 23 ethnic groups and 71 poor counties since 1997. The
provincial Women's Federation and Children's Fund have provided
them with clothing for all seasons, books, and stationery, along
with tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the local Women's Federation has helped 63 laid-
off workers in urban districts send their children to junior and
senior middle schools since 1998.

BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists will work to
determine a group of perspective water resource areas in western
China, in an effort to meet the needs of major construction
projects and development of urban areas there.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Land and Resources said his
ministry's water resource exploration will focus on ground water
resources in big cities, industrial and agricultural development
zones in western China.
</P>
<P>
He said hydro-geological surveys will be launched in over 20
cities and areas in shortage of water supply.
</P>
<P>
They include Xi'an City of Shaanxi Province, Lanzhou City of
Gansu Province, Urumqi City of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
Tarim Basin agricultural and petro-chemical development zones and
Qaidam Basin development Zones.
</P>
<P>
The Official said another important task of his ministry in
water resource development of the western region is to help
utilize the unique large-sized natural ground reservoirs in inland
basin areas in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will develop ground water resources on a
moderate scale and monitor the use of ground water in several
river valley areas in western China.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that water shortage is the most serious
obstacle to economic and social development in western China.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Wants to Defer Opening Up of Automotive Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said his country wants the implementation of the
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) agreement for the automotive sector
to be deferred to 2005 from 2003.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is requesting that the agreement be effective in 2005
instead of 2003, for the benefit of the national car industry, the
prime minister told reporters in Langkawi after the presentation
of the ASEAN Kart Prix 2000 Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Our automotive industry is still small compared with other
countries where companies producing vehicles have merged to become
big companies. If we cannot defend our industry, we will be
swallowed up by these big companies," Bernama news agency quoted
him as saying when asked to comment on his statement on Tuesday
calling for a second look at the AFTA's agreement to open up the
automotive industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government needed to look after the automotive
industry as well as the interests of other companies which are
involved in the production of the national car.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concern that if the agreement was implemented,
other industries involved in the manufacturing of the national car
could be exposed to the possibility of being shut down.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries decided earlier this year to defer the transfer
of completely built-up and completely knocked-down products of the
automotive industry from the Temporary Exclusion List to the
inclusion list on Jan 1, 2005.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The latest in a series of New
Mexico's wildfires exploded in size Wednesday to become a 22,000-
acre blaze that threatened towns and water supplies in the Midwest
state mountains.
</P>
<P>
Tom Mott, a fire information officer, said the fire had
engulfed some 7,000 acres of dry timber in the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains as of Tuesday. Rapid growth, plus more accurate mapping,
brought the acreage to 22,114 by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Huge clouds of smoke billowed into the normally pristine air of
northern New Mexico and flames leaped several hundred feet into
the sky as the fire consumed mountain pine forests.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 firefighters were already on the scene and another 600
were expected to arrive shortly to fight the fast-moving blaze,
which is fueled by hot winds and dry weather, according to
officials.
</P>
<P>
Six helicopters and eight air tankers were dropping water and
fire retardant on the blaze but it showed no sign of slowing, said
fire information officer Charlie Jankiewicz.
</P>
<P>
The fire came on the heels of New Mexico's largest wildfire
earlier this month. It burned nearly 50,000 acres, destroyed 400
homes and threatened the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where
scientists made the world's first atomic bomb during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The latest fire forced the evacuation of the villagers of
Gallinas and El Porvenir in the mountains east of Santa Fe, N.M.
The fire continued to burn northeast Wednesday toward the Pecos
Wilderness and Gallinas Canyon, the main watershed for Las Vegas,
a city of 15,000 east of Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the West, wildfires have scorched parts of Arizona,
California, Colorado and Utah. Hot, dry weather has left huge
sections of the region vulnerable. More heat was in Wednesday's
forecast.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has "necessary abilities and
means" to be a strategic non-nuclear power and it will form rapid
reaction forces in five years, said Ukraine Defense Minister
Alexander Kuzmuk.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk made the announcement Wednesday when introducing a five-
year plan on military development, which was passed Tuesday by a
national security and defense meeting, reported the Interfax News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, whose strategic non-nuclear armaments include missiles
and heavy bombers, is making efforts to establish comprehensive
missile equipment in order to further achieve military
modernization, said Kuzmuk.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lucent Technologies, Chromatis Networks Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Lucent Technologies, the
world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, agreed
Wednesday to purchase the remaining shares of optical equipment
maker Chromatis Networks for about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars,
according to news releases from both companies.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts believe the deal is accelerating Lucent's
push to supplant rival Nortel Networks as the industry leader in
the optical networking products.
</P>
<P>
Lucent is buying approximately 93 percent of Chromatis'
outstanding shares for roughly 78 million shares of its own stock.
The company already holds a 7 percent stake in the privately held
company.
</P>
<P>
The deal gives Lucent access to Chromatis' chief product,
Metropolis -- which speeds multi-service traffic, such as voice,
data and video, onto optical wavelengths across optical networks
in cities -- a product rival Nortel cannot currently match.
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition of Chromatis will enable us to bring the
bandwidth-expanding power of optical technology directly to our
business customers, and gives Lucent a leadership position in the
fastest-growing segment of the optical networking market," said
Richard McGinn, chairman and chief executive of Lucent.
</P>
<P>
Harry Bosco, Lucent's group president of optical networking,
estimates that the metro optical networking market will generate a
revenue of 8 billion dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts predict that the merger may spur Nortel, a
leader in optical technology primarily for long distance networks,
to find an acquisition of its own, possibly looking at startups
like Astral Point Communications, a provider of optical equipment
for the carrier market, or Cyras Systems, a provider of optical
switching technology.
</P>
<P>
Chromatis, which was courted by several suitors, said Lucent
offered the best optical networking strategy among leading
equipment companies and had the geographical reach to be able to
spread Chromatis' products throughout the United States, Europe
and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Urged to Avoid Marginalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries in the Asian
Pacific region must maximize the advantages and minimize the
negative effects of globalization, thus avoiding to be
marginalized, an senior official of the United Nations stressed
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the 56th commission session
of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP) here, ESCAP Executive Secretary Adrianus Mooy said
developing countries' enhanced participation in the globalization
brings with certain risk.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian crisis amply demonstrated such participation is by
no means smooth nor does it guarantee equitable gains for all
countries and people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged a regional perspective for developing countries on how
to manage globalization and seize new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Besides the issue of globalization, the ESCAP session, being
held here from June 1 to 6, will focus on integrating developing
countries into the international trade system on a fair and
equitable basis.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and senior officials from 60 members and associate
member countries of the ESCAP attended Thursday's opening session.
</P>
<P>

the Asia-Pacific region which meets annually at the ministerial
level.

LONDON -- Sainsbury's, Britain's second biggest supermarket
group, has announced a steep drop in profits - blaming, in part,
the ongoing food price war.
</P>
<P>
Underlying pre-tax profits for the year to April 3 crashed 23
percent from 755 million pounds to 580 million pounds, although
sales rose 6.3 percent to 17.4 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
Sainsbury's said Wednesday that the profit plunge was due to a
poor performance by its core supermarket business caused by
vicious price-cutting measures and higher staff and property costs.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers overcame the
return of Patrick Ewing to edge the New York Knicks 88-79
Wednesday night in Indianapolis and take a 3-2 lead in the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers turned an 18-point deficit early in the second
quarter into a two-point lead by halftime, closing the period with
a 23-3 run.
</P>
<P>
Travis Best had his best game of the series with 24 points,
including 15 in the fourth quarter, while Jalen Rose scored 18
points and seven rebounds, Reggie Miller collected 16 points and
Mark Jackson added 11 points and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
Game 6 is Friday night at Madison Square Garden. In order to
win the series Knicks will still have to win a game at Indiana.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks will also have to find a way to score more points.
They had 32 in the first quarter in building their big lead, then
scored just eight in the second and 15 in the third.
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston led New York with 25 points. Ewing returned after
missing two games with foot tendinitis and had nine points and
four rebounds in the first quarter before
finishing with 13 points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson, hampered by a foot injury sustained at the end
of Game 4, shot just 2-for-8 for four points, while Latrell
Sprewell was 4-for-14. The Knicks shot 12-for-19 in the first
quarter but 18-for-54 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
Best shot 7-for-11 for the Pacers, who made 10 3-pointers, went
20-for-25 at the line and committed only seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
Indiana had 10 offensive rebounds to New York's three at
halftime, and Rose had 13 points. New York tied the game early in
the third quarter on a 3-pointer by Houston, but the Pacers scored
the next nine points and eventually went up by 11 as Jackson
backed his way into the lane and hit a jump hook.

DHAKA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Indians warmed up well for today's
crucial match against Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka, crushing
Bangladesh by eight wickets Wednesday in the seventh Asia Cup
Cricket at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, The Independent
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the second encounter of the Asia Cup was not
embarrassingly one-sided as the result suggested and the home side
piled up what looked like a challenging total.
</P>
<P>
"We batted too well in the start and had a huge total by the
25th over. It gave us the chance to bat with ease after that,"
said Indian captain Ganguly who pocketed 3,000 U.S. dollars for
all three prizes: man-of-the-match, the most-valuable player and
hitting most sixes.
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with his own performance, the Indian captain didn't
forget to praise his opponents, saying the overall team
performance of Bangladesh is improving.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Captain Bulbul also admitted that the Indians
batted extraordinary, but he regarded Wednesday's show as
Bangladesh's best batting performance ever, hoping this match
would give them confidence to play better in the future.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Urged to Help Tackle Environment Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environment Program (
UNEP) forum in Malmo, southern Sweden, issued a declaration on
Wednesday, urging the private sector and social organizations in
every country of the world to help cope with deteriorating
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum starting on Monday were attended by 600
specialists, including 80 environment ministers, representatives
of dozens of non-governmental organizations and leading
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that aside from the leading role the
government of each country is obliged to play, the private sector
and all social organizations and institutions should also shoulder
greater responsibilities in this respect to help turn the trend of
deterioration in the global environment.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the natural environment and resources on which
the mankind depends are getting worse at an astonishing speed
despite painstaking efforts made in protecting the world
environment by the international community since 1972, when the
United Nations called a meeting on mankind and environment in
Stockholm. A declaration was also issued at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
The forum attributed the worsening global environment to
various factors, including profound social and economic problems,
such as poverty, production, consumption as well as the unfairness
of wealth distribution and debt burdens.
</P>
<P>
The lack of international cooperation and impotence of actions
have also contributed to the deterioration, the document said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage the private sector to do more in environment
protection, the declaration called for the adoption of a "polluter
pays" principle, a system of environmental performance indicators
and reporting, and the establishment of a precautionary approach
in investment and technology decisions.
</P>
<P>
It urged social groups and institutions to play a part in
prompting policy-makers to put greater emphasis on green issues,
helping uplift the public awareness and renew the concept of
environment conservation, promoting transparency in environment
policy making to prevent corruption.

meeting to declare Papua's independence, I think we (the
government) have to react," Antara News Agency Thursday quoted
Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Shihab did not say what kind of actions would be taken
by the government if the meeting declared Papua's independence.
</P>
<P>
The minister said President Abdurrahman Wahid would repudiate
the government's permission to hold the congress if its
discussions went out of line.
</P>
<P>
The president did not regard the congress as representative of
the people of Papua, meaning it had failed as a Papua National
Congress, Shihab noted.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid had said the congress, which started on May 29
and will end on June 3, was running "unnaturally" because it had
excluded Papuans opposed to separation from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the participants of the congress had unanimously
expressed their wishes that Papua should go out of the Republic of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Papua (Irian Jaya) is the largest island in Indonesia with a
population of about two million.
</P>
<P>
Besides representatives from 14 districts in the province, a
number of foreigners representing NGOs from several countries were
reportedly participating in the congress.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the congress' organizers said earlier, the
congress aimed to discuss the rectification of Papua's history,
review of its political status, legislation on protection of the
Papuan people, consolidation of the Papuan people's components and
basic rights of the Papuans.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid has refused to open the congress, but donated
125,000 U.S. dollars for its financing.

COLOMBO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has been experiencing
heavy rains during the past two days, easing the prospects of an
impending power crisis.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain accompanied by thunder and lightning lashed
Colombo and its suburbs inundating several roads and causing

</P>
<P>
The national Ceylon Electricity Board Friday appealed to the

possibility of a power crisis in the country, if there is no
rainfall in the hydro catchment areas in the next two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Township Firms to Get New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Experts and officials attending an
agricultural seminar in Beijing yesterday called for the country's
township enterprises to expand the farm-produce processing
industry, says Thursday's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China has 350,000 township and village-run enterprises engaged
in agricultural and sideline products processing, which represent
a mere 1.75 percent of the country's total township firms, but
account for a quarter of the sector's annual output, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
"As the State-owned enterprises began to withdraw from the
agricultural produce processing sector, township firms should rush
to fill the vacuum," said Chen Jianguang from the agricultural
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises have the advantage and ability to focus on
agricultural and sideline products processing, packaging and
circulation, he added.
</P>
<P>
By developing the agricultural and sideline produce processing
sector, China will be able to readjust its agricultural structure
faster, and the difficulty farmers have in selling their products
may be resolved, officials and experts said at the seminar, adding
that rural residents' income would also be significantly raised.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to optimize township
enterprise structure by encouraging more firms to undertake farm
and sideline products processing, according to Chen.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Children in Beijing, Shanghai and
six other major cities in China will get free oral examinations
and dental consultations Friday and Saturday in public places such

<P>
The investigation also showed that 34.98 percent of 15-year-
olds have some diseased gums, the most serious among all age
groups.
</P>
<P>
The children-oriented activities mark the launch of a
nationwide program, 2000 China Oral Health Promotion, which seeks
to raise public awareness of the importance of dental care.
</P>
<P>
The program features three dental-health promotion vehicles
that will leave Shanghai on July 15 and tour 12 provinces and

<HEADLINE> China Drafts Plan for Dust Storm Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Science and
Technology has drafted a plan for prevention of dust storms and
desertification in China to be implemented in the following five
years.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Science and Technology said
the plan will be executed starting from 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, in the capital city of Beijing and
neighboring cities of Tianjin, Zhangjiakou and Chengde, more trees
and grass will be planted in both urban and suburban areas and
high-efficient agriculture will be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
In the capital's surrounding areas, vegetation coverage rate
will be increased and reclaimed farmland will be retired and
shifted to pastures.
</P>
<P>
In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the provinces of
Shaanxi, Liaoning, Hebei and Shanxi, where desertification is
accelerating, trees, shrub and grass will be planted to check the
trend.
</P>
<P>
Trees and grass will also be planted in retired farmland on the
hill slopes.
</P>
<P>
In overused and denuded grasslands, the major source of dust
storms that affect the capital and its surrounding areas, land
reclamation will be forbidden, crop farming will be stopped, and
pastures will be rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the fodder industry is to be encouraged for
the development of animal husbandry in the degraded pasture areas.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for more shelter forests to be planted.
</P>
<P>
For its smooth implementation, a number of experimental and
demonstration bases are to be built to promote the advanced and
effective techniques.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists will also strengthen basic research in
desertification prevention to improve the country's overall
capacity of fighting desertification.

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- League Most Valuable Player
Shaquille O'Neal was a unanimous selection to the All-NBA First
Team, but the player he edged out for the scoring title -- Allen
Iverson -- had to settle for Second Team honours.
</P>
<P>
The superstar center of the Los Angeles Lakers became only the
fifth player since 1981-82 to be a unanimous choice for the All-
NBA First Team, joining Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Karl Malone
and Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal fell one vote shy of becoming the first unanimous MVP in
league history earlier this month. That vote went to Philadelphia
76ers guard Iverson, who was denied a spot on the All-NBA First
Team.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal received the maximum 121 first-team votes and 605 points
from a panel of broadcasters and writers in the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Guard Gary Payton of the Seattle SuperSonics, who finished
sixth in the MVP voting, was second overall with 95 first-team
votes and 541 points.
</P>
<P>
Forwards Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Tim
Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs and guard Jason Kidd of the
Phoenix Suns joined O'Neal and Payton on the first team. Garnett,
the distant runner-up to O'Neal in the MVP voting, received 495
points followed by Duncan (460) and Kidd (445).
</P>
<P>
Iverson, a first-team All-NBA selection last season, received a
second-team high 420 points and 52 first-team votes.
</P>
<P>
Iverson is joined on the second team by Lakers guard Kobe
Bryant, center Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat and forwards

<HEADLINE> Maternal Care Centers for Rural Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Care centers for women in
central China's Henan Province are the first place that local
women turn to when they need contraceptives, or when they want to
confide in someone.
</P>
<P>
"When these care centers were first set up they only provide
contraceptives for bearing-age women, but now they also provide a
range of other services related to sex," said Xue Lixia, who runs
the center.
</P>
<P>
A woman surnamed Han in Xiaohancun called Xue, worried that she
is not interested in sex. She slept badly since her mother passed
away, and she disliked her husband touching her.
</P>
<P>
Xue told her it was not a major problem, but her depression has
affected desire to have sex. It would be better for Han to express
her concerns and share her feelings with her husband.
</P>
<P>
Xue said her center has helped 47 couples resolve their marital
problems due to problems in their sex life.
</P>
<P>
More care and individual services will ensure that family
planning policy will be smoothly carried out, said Wang Xianzhi,
demographer in the province.
</P>
<P>
Cui Xiaoling, a 29-year-old married woman in Caipocun Village,
told Xue that she could not get pregnant in the first five years
of marriage. She dared not tell anyone else, fearing ridicule and
gossip from others. Xue suggested that she undergo an examination.
Cui got pregnant soon after a salpinx operation.

The family planning policy implemented in China in the 1970s
only provided two contraceptive choices: ligation operations or
contraceptive ring insertions. Rural females can readily get
contraceptives from the center with information on how to use them.
</P>
<P>
"Incidences of gynecological diseases has dropped thanks to the
centers," said Chen Ruoli, vice-head of the provincial family
planning commission.
</P>
<P>
In the past, women were not allowed to bathe one month after
they gave birth, which was supposed to be bad for their health.
Procreation health publicity activities inform rural women how to
take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
The province, the most populous one in China with a population
of 93 million, started women care service for bearing-age women in
1996. There services include medical examinations every two months
for all women and birth consultation services.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Fabien Barthez breezed into English
premier league soccer club Manchester United and insisted he has
what it takes to step into the shoes of the team's legend
goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old French international, having completed a 7.8
million pounds switch from Monaco, a British record fee for a
keeper, is well aware that Great Dane Schmeichel is a hard,
perhaps impossible, act to follow.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bosnich, Massimo Taibi and Raimond van der Gouw have all
felt the strain of filling the number one jersey since Schmeichel'
s departure to Sporting Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Barthez, who has signed a six-year deal reputed to be worth 45,
000 pounds-a-week, which would make him the second highest earner
at the club behind skipper Roy Keane, said: "Peter Schmeichel was
a great, great goalkeeper and he played here for a very long time.
I need to be strong but I don't find it daunting."
</P>
<P>
"I have played in a World Cup final and Champions League final
before and nothing troubles me. I'm here to win and stay a long,
long time. I'm so, so happy to sign a six-year deal," he said.

<P>
GAZA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat said here Thursday Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak is "wasting time" and should be held
responsible for the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a meeting with European Union (EU)
Middle East special envoy Miguel Mauratinus. Early Thursday in the
Portuguese capital of Lisbon, Barak accused the Palestinians of "
foot-dragging" in the final-status peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Barak's accusation is baseless because facts refute it. They
(the Israelis) are the party that procrastinates and wastes time to
evade the sincere implementation of the signed accords and Sharm el
Sheikh memo," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"We have two letters of guarantee from the EU and the United
States for the memo that was signed under the auspices of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and King Abdullah II of Jordan," he added,
referring to the Sharm el Sheikh memo signed last September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he has no idea so far about when the talks with
Israel will be resumed. Earlier in the day, Arafat said no decision
has been made by the Palestinians on the resumption of the talks.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mauratinus expressed the EU's interest in the
peace process and hoped that the peace talks will be resumed as
soon as possible. The EU is ready to help the Palestinian and
Israeli sides reach a framework agreement on the final-status
issues over the coming weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu-Rudeina said Barak's
accusations "revealed the real intentions of the Israeli
government," which he said is not serious in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The coming week will be the final test of the Israeli
intentions, Abu-Rudeina added.
</P>
<P>
There have been two tracks of final-status talks. One was
attended by Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo, while the other one was held between
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian
Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei.
</P>
<P>
But the back-channel talks were called off by Barak on May 21
due to an upsurge of violent anti-Israel demonstrations in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has urged Clinton to put more pressure on Israel to force
it to make compromise in the final-status talks, which deal with
such thorny issues as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements, border, security and water.

<HEADLINE> Baku-Ceyhan Pipeline Protocol Passes One Turkish Parliament Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish parliamentary Commission
for Industry approved on Thursday an intergovernmental agreement on
the construction of the Baku-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline between Turkey,
Azerbaijan and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which has been approved by the parliaments of
Azerbaijan and Georgia, will be subjected to ratification by the
Turkish parliamentary Commission for Foreign Affairs on Friday.
</P>
<P>
If the Foreign Affairs Commission votes for the agreement, the
issue will be debated in the full parliament to be legalized.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on transport of Caspian basin oil to world markets
was signed among the three countries under the promotion of U.S.
President Bill Clinton, on the sideline of Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit at Istanbul last November.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the pipeline, starting from Azeri Caspian
port Baku to Turkish southern port city Ceyhan via Georgian capital
Tbilisi, is of political and strategic importance rather than a
lucrative investment.
</P>
<P>
They considered it a vital move of the U.S.-led western powers
to curb Russian and Iranian expansion of their influence in the
newly-independent Central Asia and Caucasus regions.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish parliament commission approved the agreement amid
Russian President Vladimir Putin's dramatic visits to Central Asian
countries, during which Russia and Turkmenistan signed a deal over
the sale of Turkmenian natural gas to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia is seen as Turkey's main competitor over the purchase of
Turkmen gas. Some Turkish experts argued that while Turkey lags
behind in its effort to secure access to gas and oil resources of
the Central Asia and Caucasus, Russia is trying to restore its
influences in the region.
</P>
<P>
Following its approval, the Turkish parliamentary commission
said that the Baku-Ceyhan project is very important for close ties
between countries in the region and the western world, which will
guarantee their prosperity and independence in the future.
</P>
<P>
"This project will increase Turkey's geostrategical importance
and help development of economic and social relations among the
regional countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, transportation of oil through this pipeline which has
one million barrel daily capacity via Ceyhan to the global market
will make Ceyhan an important international oil market center," the
commission added.
</P>
<P>
Cumhur Ersumer, energy and natural resources minister and deputy
prime minister, hailed the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline as another
expression of the Silk Road, adding it will make Turkey an energy
corridor.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Police shot and severely injured
the gunman to run to the safe rescue of 25 children and their
three adult teachers Thursday, police sources confirmed.
</P>
<P>
A Luxembourg police sniper trained in on the 39-year-old
Tunisian-born immigrant before the police from Luxembourg and
neighboring Germany stormed the nursery school building to rescue
the hostages who had been kept captive for the past 28 hours.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, armed with a pistol, a hand grenade and a knife,
walked into the nursery school at Wasserbillig in eastern
Luxembourg and took almost 40 kids and their teachers hostage.
</P>
<P>
After speaking with his psychiatrist late Wednesday, the gunman
released 10 children. He had demanded to be flown to Libya
together with a ransom of 20 million francs (220,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The gunman released four more children Thursday before the
police decided to move in to the rescue of the children, aged
between 22 months and seven years.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the village heard shooting and saw police and
medical staff running to the nursery school building.
</P>
<P>
Officials later confirmed that all the hostages were safe and
sound and were only sent to a nearby hospital for physical checks
and for re-union with their parents.
</P>
<P>
The gunman was said to have a history of mental problems and
was a father of two. He and his wife along with their children
had been living near the nursery school for four years.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rebound Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks bounced back
again Thursday amid more signs of slower U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial average closed up 129.87 or 1.24
percent at 10,652.20. The blue chip index fell 4.8 points
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 181.59 or 5.3
percent at 3,582.50. The composite rose 254.37 points Tuesday but
fell 58.57 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 28.21 at 1,448.81.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as three separate reports showed the U.S.
economic growth slowed a bit and therefore investors moved into
the tech and industrial sectors to buy.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Managers said its index
of manufacturing activity fell 1.7 points to 53.2 percent while
the Commerce Department reported construction spending fell 0.6
percent in April, the biggest decline in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
In the retail sector, sales were weak in May due to higher
consumer credit costs after the Federal Reserve had raised
interest rates six times since last June in an effort to cool off
the economy and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the economy suggested that the Federal
tightening is working. Wall Street analysts believed the
tightening cycle is nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch, the global securities research &AMP; economics group,
said in the latest survey that The Federal Reserve is expected to
tighten once or, at most, two more times in 25 basis point
increments. The group doubted that the Federal Reserve would need
to go beyond that, because the economy already appears to be
moderating.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 7.86 at 651.46 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 7.48 at 912.45. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 16.29 at 492.47.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,066 up, 925 down and 412
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased slightly to 951.18 million shares from
950.36 million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Market for 3G Wireless Services to Explode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Revenue for U.S. wireless third
generation (3G) operators is expected to grow more than 71 percent
annually in the next five years, according to a new study released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. wireless operator revenue will jump from 4.3 billion U.S.
dollars in 2002 to 63 billion dollars while wireless
infrastructure purchases will grow more than 53 percent annually
from 4 billion dollars to 34 billion dollars during the same five-
year period.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by the Phillips Group, a global
research and consulting firm focused on the telecommunications and
IT industries.
</P>
<P>
Introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the first
generation (1G) of mobile cellular communications systems were
analog, primarily used for voice. Starting in the 1990s, second
generation (2G) systems used digital encoding and have been used
mostly for voice. 3G systems apply high-speed data transfer and
state-of-the-art terminal technology enabling wireless multimedia
service. Its goals include high-quality audio and video and
advanced roaming. In addition, for those companies involved, 3G is
their opportunity to build the wireless Internet.
