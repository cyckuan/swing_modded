	White House Suggests Tax Deal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a hint of movement, a White House official  
said today that if Republicans would agree to a $250 billion, 
10-year tax cut for the middle class, the Clinton administration 
would be open to negotiations over the package's details. President 
Clinton yesterday made conciliatory comments about his hopes for a 
compromise with Republicans this fall over tax cuts and spending. 
Remarks from Gene Sperling, chairman of the White House National 
Economic Council, suggest that the White House is not necessarily 
wedded to the targeted tax cuts for retirement savings, long-term 
health care and other expenses it has espoused so far this year.

	Army Grounds Fleet of Helicopters  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army announced today it was temporarily  
grounding its entire fleet of CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters 
as a precaution after a crack was found in a transmission gear in 
one being used by the British Royal Air Force. Army Spokeswoman 
Nancy Ray said that 466 helicopters were involved in the grounding. 
The twin-rotored Chinook helicopter, which is manufactured by 
Boeing Co., is the military's medium tactical heavy-lift transport.

	Clinton Backs Yeltsin's Shuffle  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today backed  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's right to fire Prime Minister 
Sergei Stepashin and the rest of his Cabinet. Yeltsin named 
Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent, as acting prime minister and as 
his successor. But few believe Putin has any chance of being 
elected president and the Russian media has speculated that Yeltsin 
and his advisers are considering the possibility of canceling 
elections in a bid to extend his tenure.

	Russians, Rebels Add Troops in Caucasus  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- In a rugged Caucasus Mountain region  
where Islamic rebels have seized several villages, Russian security 
forces and the militants today amassed troops and weaponry. The 
standoff, one of the worst in the area since Russia's disastrous 
1994-96 war in neighboring Chechnya, began when Chechen militants 
moved into Dagestan on Saturday and occupied several villages just 
across the border. Chechnya has had de facto independence since the 
Russian troops withdrew three years ago, though Moscow still claims 
it is part of Russia.

	Carter Receives Top U.S. Award  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton praised the only living former  
Democratic president today as a man of peace who used his 
retirement from politics to help poor people at home and promote 
democracy abroad. Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, 
Rosalynn, each received the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a 
ceremony at the Georgia headquarters of the Carter Center, a human 
rights organization that sends observers to monitor elections 
worldwide. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation's 
highest civilian honor. 

</P>
<P>
	Nigerian President Wary of Violence  
</P>
<P>
	SAGAMU, Nigeria (AP) -- President Olusegun Obasanjo said Monday  
that shadowy elements were trying to undermine Nigeria's fledgling 
democracy by fomenting ethnic fighting that killed at least 60 
people last month in the southwestern town of Sagamu. Fifteen years 
of military rule ended in Nigeria in May, when Gen. Abdulsalami 
Abubakar handed over power to Obasanjo, who was elected in February 
presidential elections. Dozens of high-level military officials 
have been forced to retire in recent months. Lagos State Gov. Bola 
Tinubu hinted late last month that some of those retired generals 
were to blame for the upsurge in ethnic violence. 

</P>
<P>
	Oil-Dumping Complaint Rejected  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A complaint from independent oil producers  
that accuses Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Iraq of selling 
oil in the U.S. at artificially low prices was rejected by the 
Commerce Department today. If the petition, which charged those 
countries of harming U.S. producers, had been accepted and 
violations had been found, about 60 percent of the oil imported 
into the country would have been subject to steep tariffs.

<P>
	Tokyo Stocks Slip in Early Trading  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks slipped Tuesday in light trading.  
The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 71.30 points to 
17,119.15 in early trading. On Monday, the Dow industrial average 
fell 6.33 points to close at 10,707.70. 

</P>
<P>
	Baseball Umpires May Still Strike  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires may still strike this season  
but their union head told them to wait until the National Labor 
Relations Board rules on their unfair labor practice complaint. The 
possibility of a strike was first reported by Newsweek, but union 
head Richie Phillips said he has argued against an early walkout. 
The NLRB is not expected to rule until next month.

<HEADLINE> Lott Uses Va. Entity To Get Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the past year, Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott has raised tens of thousands of dollars in donations 
from wealthy Americans and corporations that exceeded the strict 
limits imposed by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott collected the money legally by setting up a state political  
committee in Virginia, which imposes no limits on the size or 
source of donations. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of givers reads like a Who's Who of companies with  
business before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, R.J. Reynolds and U.S. Tobacco each gave Lott's  
Virginia committee $10,000 last year while the Senate was debating 
proposed increases in the cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott joins a growing list of congressional leaders who are using  
nonfederal entities to raise money that otherwise would be 
prohibited by Watergate-era campaign finance laws. Those laws 
banned corporate donations and limited individuals to $2,000 per 
candidate per election. 
</P>
<P>
	The national political parties have exploited similar loopholes  
for state politics to raise six-figure donations from wealthy 
individuals, labor unions and companies. The contributions are 
known as ``soft money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen lawmakers are raising money outside federal  
limits, including Lott's counterpart, Senate Democratic leader Tom 
Daschle; House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas; and Rep. Patrick 
Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dramatic and pernicious expansion of the soft money  
system,'' said Donald Simon of Common Cause, a group supporting 
changes in the way campaigns are funded. ``What we see here is soft 
money being tied directly to federal officeholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott set up his political committee in Richmond, Va., on Oct. 9,  
1997, and has reported a total of $197,373 in donations so far. He 
has spent $188,130, including $20,000 to the Mississippi Republican 
Party and $5,000 to former Sen. Dirk Kempthorne's successful race 
for governor of Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is addition to Lott's own campaign committee that  
collects donations for his Senate re-election, and a separate 
federal political action committee he controls. Those entities are 
bound by the federal contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	But his Virginia committee boasts numerous donations that Lott  
otherwise would have been forbidden to collect under federal 
control. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
	--Lott took $5,000 from the law firm headed by former Republican  
National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, whose clients include 
tobacco giant Philip Morris. Law firms cannot give to federal 
candidates, but face no such restriction in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	--Venture capitalist L. John Doerr gave $20,000 -- 10 times more  
than he could give to Lott's re-election campaign. Doerr is a 
founder of a group that represents the high-technology industry, 
which has had a host of business before Congress from Y2K 
legislation to Internet taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The explosion in leadership PACs that take soft money is  
further evidence of the need to pass campaign finance reform,'' 
said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., a lead sponsor of legislation to 
ban such donations. ``If the Congress does nothing, more and more 
members are going to establish PACs that raise soft money, much of 
it in undisclosed, unlimited amounts from corporations and 
individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said his boss picked  
Virginia for his nonfederal account because that's where his 
federal PAC is headquartered. Both are called the New Republican 
Majority Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the same building,'' he said. ``It's not like one is  
in D.C. and one is in Virginia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, because the account is in Virginia, there is no limit to  
the amount of contributions it can accept. For example, James 
Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape Communications, 
contributed $5,000. HealthSouth, an Alabama health care company, 
gave $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	HealthSouth also gave Daschle $10,000. So did Northwest  
Airlines. American Airlines contributed $10,000 worth of travel and 
US Airways contributed $4,667 worth of travel. Congress is debating 
legislation to renew Federal Aviation Administration programs. 
Overall, Daschle raised $274,491 in soft money during the first six 
months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle's political director, Michael Meehan, said the senator  
does not accept soft money donations greater than $10,000 and is 
raising the money to help elect Democrats on the state and local 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Daschle's committed to electing Democrats to the  
Senate and the House and encouraging the next wave of potential 
Senate and House candidates,'' he said. ``One way to do that is to 
financially support them.''

<HEADLINE> Layden Said Mulling Move to Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Scott Layden, vice president of basketball  
operations for the Utah Jazz, met with New York Knicks officials 
over the weekend to discuss taking a similar position with the 
team, The Salt Lake Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden's departure is imminent, KSTU Fox television reported,  
citing its own unnamed sources. Layden refused comment Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz publicist Kim Turner told The Associated Press he couldn't  
confirm the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stranger things have happened, but as of Friday when I left  
the office, I didn't know anything about it,'' Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden has been valuable at recruiting talent, working trades,  
drafting and getting free agents, transforming the Jazz into one of 
the NBA's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Checketts, the Knicks president and chief operating  
officer, was president of the Jazz in the 1980s and maintains close 
ties to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' job opened in April with the firing of Ernie  
Grunfeld, who was general manager before being reassigned to 
special consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld was let go less than a week after the Knicks lost in  
the NBA Finals to the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune reported that Layden could make $1.5 million a year  
with the Knicks, about four times his Jazz salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden, son of former Jazz coach Frank Layden, helped shape the  
team the past 18 years, calling most of the major personnel shots 
for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Jazz in 1981 as an assistant coach. In 1988, he  
became a chief scout and was named director of player development. 
His title was upgraded to vice president of basketball operations 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz finished the 1999 season with a league-best 37-13  
record, but sputtered down the stretch and was eliminated from the 
playoffs in the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Utah's earliest playoff exit since 1995. The Jazz have  
had 13 straight winning seasons, as well as four division titles 
and two Western Conference championships in the last decade.

<HEADLINE> Hugh Quarshie at Gen Con Game Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Captain Panaka took time out from fighting the  
Phantom Menace to sign autographs at the 1999 Gen Con Game Fair, a 
convention for science fiction and fantasy game fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Panaka actually is Hugh Quarshie, who played the head of  
Naboo's Royal Security Forces in the George Lucas film ``Star Wars: 
Episode One -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The character had to protect Queen Amidala from the likes of  
such villains as Darth Maul and Rune Haako in the film. Quarshie 
said he enjoyed being ``part of somebody's dreamscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Ghana but raised in England, Quarshie acted in the Royal  
Shakespeare Company, along with television and movies, before he 
signed on with the 'Star Wars' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say I was quite pleased,'' Quarshie said Sunday. ``I  
was elated, of course. It's a kind of a rare opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarshie called the Star Wars movies ``a modern legend'' that  
has entered into the subconscious of millions of people. He said 
he's not surprised by all the hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been this long wait for the next 'Star Wars,'''  
Quarshie said. ``It's not quite on the level of the second coming -- 
I suppose it is for some people.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Discusses Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Bill Bradley says he might not be running  
for president if he had not left elective office nearly three years 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two years reminded me of how big the country is, and  
how diverse it is, and how rich it is in so many ways that 
sometimes, if you are in Washington, you don't always appreciate 
it,'' said the former Democratic senator from New Jersey, who is 
now running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'd be doing this if I had not left the Senate  
in January of 1997,'' he told reporters at Portland International 
Airport Sunday en route to a fund-raising function in Camas, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living in times of multiple change, in terms of  
globalization of the economy, of technological change, ... military 
threat changes and changes in the structure of our families. I came 
to a deeper understanding of all those during my two years out,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he isn't bothered by his relatively low recognition  
rate among voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 45 to 50 percent of the people in the country don't  
really know me. That's a good base to start from, because 50 
percent know me. That's why we have to raise the money, and that's 
why, in the fall, when we lay out health issues, people will get to 
know me. And I'm sure that by the primary season, which is 
February, that there will be far more than 50 percent. The good 
thing is that those people who know me seem to like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was surprised, but not overly concerned about  
President Clinton's support for the candidacy of the Democratic 
front-runner, Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Endorsements are important,'' he said. ``But I think,  
ultimately, people decide who they are going to vote for based on 
one question -- and that is who they trust with their life, who they 
trust with their job, who they trust has a view of life that is 
remotely similar to their own. And that will not be answered by 
surrogates. That will be answered by the candidate.''

<HEADLINE> Long-Distance Price War Heats Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nickel-a-minute rates on nighttime calls  
introduced by MCI WorldCom and Sprint will probably mean better 
deals for all long-distance consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean that market leader AT&AMP;T and other  
long-distance companies will match the rate cuts to hold onto 
customers and attract new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the latest price battle in long distance may hasten the  
shift toward selling consumers a package of phone, television and 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, stressing its plan to use its new cable TV empire to  
bundle all those services, said Monday it has no immediate plans to 
cut its nighttime calling rates. 
</P>
<P>
	And Qwest, the fourth largest long-distance company after No. 2  
MCI WorldCom and No. 3 Sprint, unveiled a new package today with 
250 minutes of calls and unlimited Internet access for $24.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint started the price war last month with a ``Nickel Nights''  
plan charging 5 cents per minute on long-distance calls between 7 
p.m. and midnight. Calls at other times are 10 cents a minute and 
there's a monthly fee of $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom responded on Monday by extending its popular ``5  
Cent Sundays'' plan to the entire weekend and weekday calls made 
between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Daytime calling rates on weekdays are 25 
cents per minute for customers paying a monthly fee of $1.95, or 10 
cents per minute with a monthly fee of $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's most prominent calling plans charge 15 cents a minute  
around the clock with no monthly fee or 10 cents a minute with a 
$4.95 fee. 
</P>
<P>
	For MCI, which has focused on high-paying business customers,  
the new calling plan was a sign that the nation's second-biggest 
long distance company values its share of the consumer market, 
which is seen slipping to 11 percent by year end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer market is nothing to sneeze at,'' said Rex G.  
Mitchell, an industry analyst for Banc of America Securities in San 
Francisco, estimating that consumer long-distance revenues will 
total $41 billion in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's share of the market, which began the year at more than 60  
percent, has been steadily declining and is expected to total just 
56 percent by the end of 1999. Sprint's is expected to be 6 
percent, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steep price cuts may not hurt long-distance companies if  
customers make more calls and talk longer. 
</P>
<P>
	When MCI introduced ``5 Cents Sundays'' in 1997, the average  
customer spent twice as much time on the phone on Sunday, said John 
Donoghue, MCI WorldCom's senior vice president of consumer 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies are less worried about floods of new  
callers clogging their lines because phone calls put little strain 
on the huge fiber-optic networks now being built to carry floods of 
Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The expense of carrying phone calls on such networks is so small  
that companies may choose to use long distance less as a revenue 
producer and more as a marketing come-on for bundles of phone, TV 
and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies are also benefiting from a  
government-mandated reduction in the fees they pay to local Baby 
Bell monopolies for connecting long-distance calls to the nation's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern that may be prompting the long-distance rate  
cuts is the prospect of new competition from the Baby Bells. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to get government permission to sell long-distance  
service, the Baby Bells still need to prove that their markets are 
open to competition for local service. Some industry analysts 
expect this will happen in certain states within a year.

<HEADLINE> Bengals QB Smith Still a Holdout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) -- Holdout quarterback Akili Smith is still  
pushing the Cincinnati Bengals to pay him more than what's been 
offered. The Bengals, however, don't plan to budge in their 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Mike Brown said the Bengals have run out of  
concessions in attempts to get a deal done with Smith, the No. 3 
pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already bent. We've given up what we want. We've even  
given up on giving him less than (Donovan) McNabb,'' Brown told The 
Cincinnati Enquirer for a story published today. ``We feel put upon 
when someone asks us to pay him more than the guy picked ahead of 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith reportedly wants a comparable deal to the seven-year, $54  
million contract No. 2 pick Donovan McNabb signed with the 
Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, through agent Leigh Steinberg, has turned down many  
offers, including a seven-year, $50 million deal in which all but 
the signing bonus and salaries were tied to team performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg said McNabb's deal can't be used as a benchmark  
because of racial accusations his agent made against the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is it written in the collective bargaining agreement  
because a beleaguered agent signed a horrible deal the guy behind 
him has to do the same? We're not looking to kill the Bengals and 
break the bank,'' Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The holdout is starting to take on a similar tone to 1992 when  
the Bengals selected Houston quarterback David Klingler high in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Klingler held out for much of camp before signing a four-year,  
$7 million deal Aug. 30, 1992, a week before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
	He struggled in the five games he started, going 1-4 and  
completing fewer than 50 percent of his passes. Klingler played 
poorly when the team went 3-13 in 1993 and he was benched in 
October 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He played three more seasons, but only threw 22 more passes. He  
retired after being cut from the Green Bay Packers last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker James Francis, one of the two remaining Bengals who  
played with Klingler in '92, said the holdout hurt Klingler. 
</P>
<P>
	``Training camp is important because once you get into the  
season, you've got a different opponent you've got to study every 
week and you don't have time to learn the offense and defense,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hold out the whole camp, it's like a year gone,  
basically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, who also represented Klingler, acknowledged that he  
and Brown hurt Klingler by not agreeing to a deal earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to live with the guilt that I may have played a part in  
damaging David's career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But offensive tackle Kevin Sargent, the other remaining Bengals  
player from 1992, said it isn't fair to compare the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is different the way they handle things, their  
personalities and the way they go about their business,'' he said. 
``It affected Dave for whatever reason.

	Soybean futures prices pushed higher Monday on the Chicago Board  
of Trade amid concern that widespread weekend showers did little to 
relieve bone-dry crops. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, energy futures gained.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans finished higher after a seesaw-session in which  
investors attempted to assess the impact of weekend rains across 
Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rainfall totals reached 2 inches in some areas. But some of the  
areas most affected by drought saw only minor rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were betting rain later this week in Illinois and  
Indiana -- two key growing states that have seen extended dryness -- 
also will prove inadequate for reviving fall-harvested crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department reported after trading had ended  
that soybean crop ratings nationwide deteriorated last week, from 
57 percent in good to excellent condition to 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That was slightly above analyst expectations for a 2  
percentage-point decline in conditions. More significantly, in 
Illinois -- the second-largest growing state behind Iowa -- only 48 
percent of the crop was in good to excellent condition, while 17 
percent in the crop was in poor to very poor condition. That was a 
sharp deterioration from a week earlier and showed that even the 
hardy soybean crop can suffer under extreme conditions. Projections 
of record production likely will be revised downward. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana had only 34 percent of its crop in good condition or  
better, while 21 percent was poor to worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also gained on a rally in the soybean oil complex  
following sharp gains overnight in the palm oil market, which 
competes for vegetable oil sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans for November delivery, representing the fall harvest,  
rose 5 cents to $4.88 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's corn crop also saw a modest 3 percentage point  
decline in its good-to-excellent ratings. December corn edged 
higher Monday, up 1/2 cent to $2.36 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude rallied to its highest levels in 21 months on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid reports of an explosion at a Corpus 
Christi, Texas, refinery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Citgo problem renewed concern about a recent string of  
refinery problems that have reduced production across the country, 
particularly to the key California market. Still, analysts said 
processing would see little impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures also rose in thin trading despite  
expectations for cooler temperatures in key consuming regions. The 
cooler weather likely would lower demand from utilities that power 
turbines up during heat spells as more consumers turn on air 
conditioners and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	September crude oil rose 29 cents to $21.27 a barrel; September  
heating oil rose 0.68 cent to 55.21 cents a gallon; September 
unleaded gasoline rose 0.21 cent to 66.04 cents a gallon; September 
natural gas rose 2.3 cents to $2.721 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Former Celtic Has Free Agency Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Ron Mercer, the newest member of the Denver  
Nuggets, showed up Monday to meet the team, five days late without 
assurances he will remain with the Nuggets beyond the year 
remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer was acquired from the Boston Celtics on Aug. 3, with  
Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius, in exchange for Danny Fortson, 
Eric Washington, Eric Williams and a future first-round draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived Monday with his agent, Tvester Scott, who said Mercer  
would enter the free-agent market at the end of the 1999-2000 
season unless the Nuggets offer him a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a business decision, just like the Nuggets have a  
business decision whether they want to extend the contract before 
or after the season,'' Mercer said. ``I have to look after myself 
and give an opportunity to go to other teams and explore it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said they met with general manager Dan Issel ``so we all  
understand each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott added: ``At the end of the season, we are going evaluate  
the Nuggets along with other teams, review all the options and do 
what is best for my player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer was due in Denver for an Aug. 4 news conference, but  
didn't show up. At the time, Issel said Mercer was disappointed 
that Boston media reports saying the Nuggets were prepared to offer 
him a six-year contract extension weren't true. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said a trip to Denver was necessary to clear up  
misunderstandings. Several published reports had the 23-year-old 
former University of Kentucky standout refusing to come to Denver 
until a contract extension was worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott said Boston coach Pick Pitino and the Celtics were to  
blame for his client not coming last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a three-way trade on the table that Ron was going to  
a top 10 team and at the last minute we heard from Rick Pitino that 
Ron is going to Denver,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	The feeling was that Pitino, Mercer's coach and mentor since  
college, misled him, the agent said. ``It is nothing against the 
Nuggets, it was just Boston wasn't fair with the kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets have struggled the past few years. They finished  
21-61 in the 1996-97 season, and were 14-36 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer blamed his no-show on miscommunication. ``I want to clear  
up everything. I want everybody to know that it wasn't Denver's 
fault and there was a miscommunication between some people,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercer said he told Issel he would come to the Nuggets prepared  
for the season, play hard for the team and leave any contract 
negotiations up to Scott and team managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to do a job and that is what I am going to do,''  
Mercer said. ``All I can do is play hard and those things are going 
to come when the time is right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged 15.9 points and 2.3 rebounds a game in two years  
with the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said Mercer took his physical exam and passed it to  
finalize the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a young player, who has a chance to be an All Star and  
can be as good as he wants to be in this league,'' Issel said. ``I 
think this is one more step for the Denver Nuggets getting back to 
credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitino, who coached Mercer at Kentucky and during his first two  
years in the NBA, shares the league-wide consensus that Mercer is a 
future star. But after Mercer told Pitino what it would cost to 
re-sign him, the coach decided the Celtics couldn't afford his 
talents, bright future or not.

<HEADLINE> Watson Draws Praise From Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos won't resume practice until  
Tuesday after beating the San Diego Chargers 20-17 in their 
preseason opener in Australia Saturday night, but coach Mike 
Shanahan is already singling out one player for praise. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan was happy with rookie cornerback Chris Watson's pass  
defense and his work on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson returned a punt for 41 yards and returned three kickoffs  
for 61 yards. His longest kick return, 61 yards, was called back 
because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see his speed and quickness out there,'' Shanahan  
said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he saw some ``flashes'' from other players, but  
nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	One player Shanahan was not happy with after the game was  
cornerback Tory James. He appeared to be fully recovered from the 
knee injury he suffered during the Broncos' preseason opener in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan was pleased that James intercepted a third-quarter pass  
and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown. But he was not happy with 
James' showboating near the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made that big play,'' Shananan said. ``But I was very  
disappointed that he took the ball up in the air before he got 
across the goal line. That't not the way we operate. The 
quarterback almost got him. It was almost a perfect play, except 
for the celebration after he crossed that goal line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos returned to Denver from Australia Sunday night. They  
took today off and were scheduled to resume practice in Greeley on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos play the Arizona Cardinals at home Saturday night in  
their second preseason game.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Comeback Foe Still Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Scratch Buster Douglas from the list of  
possible opponents for Mike Tyson's latest comeback bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite published reports to the contrary, Tyson's promoter said  
Monday that Douglas would not be Tyson's opponent for his first 
fight since his release from a Maryland prison. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Tyson still searching for an opponent for the  
scheduled Oct. 2 fight, with the list of possible fighters now 
apparently down to 33-year-old Orlin Norris and 30-year-old Zeljko 
Mavrovic. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Dan Goossen said that Douglas, the first fighter to  
beat Tyson, was not in proper physical condition to get ready in 
time for the fight. Douglas reportedly weighs more than 300 pounds 
and would have been closely scrutinized by Nevada boxing officials 
before being allowed to fight in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buster Douglas is not in fighting shape and will not be by  
October,'' Goossen said. ``Mike is anxious to return to the ring 
and is looking to fight someone that will be physically and 
mentally ready to fight in October. At this point, Douglas does not 
fit that description.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's manager, Shelly Finkel, is now trying to sign either  
Norris or Mavrovic for the comeback fight. If he can't find an 
opponent within the next two weeks, though, the Oct. 2 date at the 
MGM Grand hotel-casino in Las Vegas could be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Douglas had emerged as an attractive opponent  
for Tyson, who was eager to fight the man who knocked him out in 
the 10th round on Feb. 11, 1990, after entering the ring as a 42-1 
underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas lost the heavyweight titles to Evander Holyfield and was  
hospitalized in a diabetic coma after his weight soared to more 
than 400 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the hospital, Douglas began exercising and this  
led to his return to boxing. Since coming back in 1996, he has won 
eight of nine fights against mostly mediocre opponents but was 
knocked out in the first round by Lou Savarese on June 25, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, the older brother of former junior middleweight champion  
Terry Norris, is a former cruiserweight champion. Despite 26 
knockouts on his 49-5 record, Norris is defense-oriented and his 
fights are often devoid of action. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 220 pounds, Norris would be closer to Tyson's weight  
than would Douglas. Norris would have much less of a height 
advantage over Tyson than Mavrovic, who is 6-foot-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavrovic (27-1, 22 knockouts), a former European champion from  
Croatia, is an aggressive fighter. He lost a WBC title bid to 
Lennox Lewis on a unanimous decision last Sept. 26.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Visits New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made her first visit to  
the city Monday on her ``listening tour'' leading up to a likely 
Senate bid and heard about a Brooklyn community's schools that are 
crumbling, overcrowded and violent. 
</P>
<P>
	A $792 billion Republican tax-cut plan would only further  
jeopardize education programs affecting New York's public 
schoolchildren, she told the hundreds of Brooklyn residents who 
came to her meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city alone could lose as many as 4,000 desperately needed  
teachers,'' she said. In schools such as Brooklyn's Midwood High 
School, built for about 3,000 students but serving about 4,100, she 
said a tax cut of that size would be ``an irresponsible, damaging 
plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-minute discussion focused almost entirely on education  
problems, especially those linked to crime and lack of funds to 
sustain after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your candidacy is a great opportunity to re-vision  
education,'' said the Rev. Emma Jordan-Simpson of Concord Baptist. 
``We'd like to spend time creating after-school programs and not 
chasing money to fund those programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engineer Ernest Greene, a parent and lifelong resident of the  
area, said basic skills are often badly taught in crumbling schools 
with problems like malfunctioning heating, plumbing and 
``non-existent air-conditioning systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers at the Concord Baptist Church welcomed the potential  
candidate as ``our senator'' and ``senator-to-be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During her stop, Mrs. Clinton criticized congressional  
Republicans who recently defeated gun-control legislation that she 
said could help diminish the presence of guns in schools. She 
claimed 13 young people are killed by firearms in America every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Brooklyn stop, Mrs. Clinton planned to hold  
another ``listening'' session in Queens on Tuesday to discuss how 
to balance work and family life. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, a likely Democratic candidate in 2000 for the  
seat of retiring U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, started the 
invitation-only ``listening'' events in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Burwell said she was less concerned with talk about  
President Clinton's private problems than the troubles weighing on 
her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has different economic possibilities and some people  
can't afford health care -- that's a social sin,'' she said. As for 
Mrs. Clinton's comments in Talk magazine that her husband's past 
infidelities were a ``sin of weakness,'' Ms. Burwell said, ``I feel 
so many people have sinned. We all have sinned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood is heavily minority and  
Democratic, an area that should be supportive of her likely 
candidacy against Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican mayor of New 
York City. Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani have formally declared 
their candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The field of candidates may be swelling with the announcement  
that actor Al ``Grandpa'' Lewis is also forming a Senate 
exploratory committee. He dismissed his rivals for the job as 
``Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cigar-chomping, blunt-speaking Lewis, most famous for his  
portrayal of ``Grandpa'' on the hit '60s television series ``The 
Munsters,'' ran unsuccessfully for governor of New York last year 
on the Green Party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis conceded that with ``no machine and no money'' behind him,  
winning a Senate seat or the governorship is ``like climbing Mount 
Everest barefooted.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Smith Returns After Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Defensive end Chuck Smith returned to  
practice Monday for the first time since spraining a toe during the 
first day of training camp on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Smith was back, coach Dan Reeves worked the team in  
shorts and helmets during both practices due to injuries which kept 
10 players from working out. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said the Falcons will hold only one practice daily over  
the next three days before their preseason opener Friday night 
against the Detroit Lions at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said it was good to have Smith back.  
</P>
<P>
	``He needs the reps,'' the coach said. ``Other than the first  
practice, he didn't get to work. The reps are good for him, and we 
need the depth at that position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six players hurt during the practice with Jacksonville on  
Saturday were held out of Monday's workouts, including cornerback 
Michael Booker (quadriceps), linebacker Ruffin Hamilton (sprained 
knee), wide receiver Ronnie Harris (groin), defensive tackle Ben 
Huff (sprained foot), tight end O.J. Santiago (sprained knee) and 
cornerback Eelijah Williams (knee). 
</P>
<P>
	Four other players injured before Saturday remained sidelined.  
They include wide receiver Chris Calloway (ankle), wide receiver 
Eric Harris (back), center Todd McClure (knee) and defensive end 
Brett Williams (knee).

<HEADLINE> Indians Put Wright on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians put right-hander Jaret  
Wright on the 15-day disabled list Monday with a strained muscle in 
his upper back. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, 7-7 with a 5.94 ERA in 21 starts, aggravated a previous  
injury Sunday in a start against Tampa Bay, when he left the game 
in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians also designated left-handed reliever Chris Haney for  
assignment. Haney, who gave up Wade Boggs' 3,000th hit Saturday, 
has no record and a 3.18 ERA in 11 1-3 innings pitched for the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Jeff Tam, on the roster of Buffalo, Cleveland's  
affiliate in the International League, also was designated for 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The designation means the Indians have 10 days to trade, release  
or outright Haney and Tam to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians activated left-hander Tom Martin from the disabled  
list. Martin has not pitched for the Indians this season. He had 
surgery on his left shoulder in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians also promoted rookie David Riske from Buffalo. At  
Akron of the Eastern League, Riske, a right-hander, was 0-0 with a 
1.90 ERA and 12 saves. At Buffalo he was 3-0 with an 0.79 ERA and 
four saves.

<HEADLINE> GM: Air Bag Failure Not a Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is deciding whether  
General Motors Corp. should have to recall about 279,000 sport 
utility vehicles because the company failed a government air bag 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration to disregard the test and exempt the company from a 
recall because GM believes the test failure is not related to the 
vehicles' safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Five consumer groups disagree, saying GM should recall the  
vehicles because the air bags pose a serious safety problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials are reviewing GM's request. The highway safety  
administration is expected to make a decision in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are the passenger-side air bags on 279,132 Chevrolet  
Tahoes and GMC Yukons built between Sept. 1, 1998, and May 5, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe failed a government test of  
the vehicle's passenger air bag, registering a higher possibility 
of serious neck injury on the test dummy than allowed by federal 
regulation. GM exceeded the amount of force allowed on the dummy's 
neck in the test by about 17 percent. Many of the 1999 Tahoes and 
Yukons have the same air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has since determined the air bag deflated too quickly to pass  
the test. Starting in May, the company installed air bags with 
smaller vent holes to keep them inflated longer. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said Friday that the company wants  
the highway safety administration to disregard the test because 
``it is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In GM's petition, the company argues that statistically only one  
additional person would be at risk of a serious neck injury in a 
crash if the vehicles are not recalled. The company's conclusion is 
reached through a complicated formula that takes into account how 
often air bags deploy in crashes, the severity of crashes, how many 
people would be sitting in the passenger seat during accidents and 
how many would be wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also contends the neck injury criteria for the test is too  
strict. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company had a hand in developing the test before  
the agency agreed to the new air bag test in 1997 because 
automakers said they needed it to make air bags that deployed less 
forcefully. At the time, GM and other automakers strongly supported 
adoption of the new test. 
</P>
<P>
	GM ``is bluntly asking the agency not to enforce the very  
standard that GM and others ... advocated NHTSA to adopt only a 
very short time ago,'' four consumer groups complained in an Aug. 2 
letter to the agency. The groups were Center for Auto Safety, 
Consumers Union, Public Citizen and Parents for Safer Air Bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, argued in  
a separate letter last month that a recall was necessary because 
``a critical and potentially lethal safety problem'' must be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflating air bags have been blamed for 141 deaths since 1990 --  
mostly to child passengers or short female drivers in low-speed 
accidents they otherwise should have survived, according to the 
NHTSA.

</P>
<P>
	Makers of the ``Runaway Bride'' soundtrack exert a little more  
effort, mixing new songs with covers. They actually do a great job 
of picking songs that match the movie's theme: Titles like ``You 
Can't Hurry Love'' and ``I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking 
For'' are perfect for a flick about a skittish bride. 
</P>
<P>
	It's fascinating, sometimes, how soundtracks can mirror movies.  
By most accounts, ``Runaway Bride'' is a pleasant, mildly amusing 
but silly movie that plays it safe so as not to disturb its summer 
blockbuster potential. So is the disc. The Dixie Chicks' ``Ready to 
Run'' and Shawn Colvin's touching ``Never Saw Blue Like That'' are 
the highlights. Yet Eric Clapton's reading of Diane Warren's ``Blue 
Eyes Blue'' is infuriating to fans who hate to see him tackle 
material beneath him. Daryl Hall and John Oates' dull ``And That's 
What Hurts'' makes vintage 1980s cheese like ``Maneater'' sound 
classic in comparison.

	``New Ancient Strings'' (Hannibal Records) -- Toumani Diabate  
with Ballake Sissoko 

</P>
<P>
	This is truly a remarkable piece of work, not only for its  
simple beauty but for the generational connection between the 
artists and their fathers, who first recorded the music nearly 30 
years ago. ``New Ancient Strings'' is a reinterpretation of 
``Ancient Strings,'' a record released in 1970 by Sidiki Diabate 
and Djelimandi Sissoko. 
</P>
<P>
	``New Ancient Strings'' features duets by the younger Toumani  
Diabate and Ballake Sissoko on the kora, a 21-stringed instrument 
native to Mali, their West African homeland. The pair's fathers 
introduced the world to the harp-lute-like instrument with their 
seminal recording. The younger musicians are distant cousins who 
play together with a sureness that comes from being raised 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	This is music that floats, swirls and runs on a higher plane.  
Hauntingly melodic, the music might be considered by some as new 
age elevator sounds if not for the fact the recording is the true 
sound of the instrument. The record was made in a single night and 
in one take. There is no attempt -- nor need -- to create a mood.

	``Kulanjan'' (Hannibal Records) -- Taj Mahal and Toumani Diabate  

</P>
<P>
	American blues meet West African rhythms and instruments with an  
introduction by Taj Mahal and the result is a perfect mesh of the 
best of both worlds. The disc was made in Athens, Ga., with Diabate 
and six other Mali musicians joining Mahal and his national steel 
guitar. Diabete's kora, a 21-stringed harp-lute, adds a melodic 
quality to Mahal's more raw style. The blending of two seemingly 
disparate music worlds proves their connection rather than their 
difference, underscoring Mahal's belief that the blues originated 
in Africa.

	``Shine Eyed Mister Zen'' (Rykodic) -- Kelly Joe Phelps  

</P>
<P>
	Kelly Joe Phelps plays the blues, so his record company says.  
Forget about that. He puts poetry to music and plays a mean 
acoustic guitar. Call it what you want, but know it's a lonely 
world you're entering when you listen. There's the sailor in the 
opening tune who reclaims his true love at the expense of her 
husband and baby only to die with her when their boat sinks. 
There's the love-starved hobo who will ``whittle off the hours with 
a memory for my blade and carve the hand of Sally dear hoping her 
to find.'' There's the runaway husband who bemoans ``all these 
broken promises in a full of bones (that) lie behind the crows feet 
eyes of anyone better when they roam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is original music, not derivative of any style or anyone.  
Yet there's a familiarity to it that suggests Phelps has an insight 
to offer if you care to listen. And listen, you can't help if you 
pay attention to his playing. It's sure and styled to fit the 
lyrics. Whether sliding through ``The House Carpenter'' or picking 
a more folklike ``Wandering Away,'' Phelps sets the right tone.

<HEADLINE> Students Set To Return to Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- When his friends return to Columbine  
High for the first day of school, shooting victim Richard Castaldo 
won't be in class. He'll be in a hospital 8 miles away, thinking 
about the day he too can return. 
</P>
<P>
	On that first day of school, student Joshua Lapp said he will  
scan for friendly faces in Columbine's main hallway, where new 
white tile gleams in place of bloodstained carpet. 
</P>
<P>
	And boy's basketball coach, Rudy Martin, said he will walk into  
the gym only to feel the loss of Dave Sanders, a teacher and fellow 
coach killed as he tried to save students last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Although few expect memories of last term's deadly shootings to  
fade any time soon, many believe it will help when classes resume 
Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone's anxious and excited to get back there,''  
Martin said. ``A lot of us just want to get back into our building 
and sort of reclaim it, to bring some sort of normalcy back into 
our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castaldo, 17, was leaving Columbine on April 20 when seniors  
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, arrived armed with guns and 
pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	They fired at Castaldo and others and then entered the school,  
killing Sanders and 12 students. Twenty-three students were injured 
before the gunmen committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Castaldo and Anne Marie Hochhalter, both recovering from spinal  
injuries, are the only two students still hospitalized. Both are 
paralyzed from the waist down but plan to return to Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my friends are there. I don't see any reason to change,''  
said Castaldo, sitting in a wheelchair at Craig Hospital. ``I'm 
pretty much just trying to pick up my life where I left off ... 
except for a few things, of course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials have stepped up security, requiring  
identification badges for students, installing video cameras and 
hiring two additional guards. Two mental health counselors will be 
on hand all year, joining the regular staff of six counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain kids are going to be re-traumatized by going back, so  
the school has to be on alert,'' said Jeff Dolgan, chief of 
psychology at Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the students and staff may break down or experience  
flashbacks, a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jefferson County School District has spent $1.2 million to  
remove signs of the violence. Even the sound of the fire alarm has 
been changed, so it doesn't remind anyone of the alarm that blared 
for seven hours during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a different feel, which I think is great,'' said Mike  
Sheehan, 17, who is scheduled to be Columbine's next student body 
president. ``The No. 1 thing is, this should be a place to learn. 
If you have things distracting you it's hard to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any student too traumatized to stay may transfer, said Rick  
Kaufman, a district spokesman. A teacher and an assistant principal 
have decided not to return this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still a little nervous, but overall, everyone's excited  
to get back,'' said Lapp, 16, who watched the gunmen kill Isaiah 
Shoels in the library. ``Life isn't as easy as I thought before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because Harris and Klebold were often taunted and harassed by  
popular students, especially athletes, some hope that students have 
learned to show more compassion toward each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've tried to just be a kinder person,'' said Megan Frye, a  
14-year-old cheerleader at neighboring Chatfield High who often 
hangs out at Columbine. ``That's what me and my friends are trying 
to take out of this, just to be kinder, because obviously something 
wasn't right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Havens, a math teacher and coach for 37 years, hopes that  
attitude sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I have to say, when we lose athletes to drunken driving,  
and we have lost five or six over the years, it affects kids a 
couple of weeks and then it's over. They think they're invincible 
and they go back to the way they were.''

<HEADLINE> Starr To End Probe Before Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Independent counsel Kenneth Starr said today he  
is moving rapidly to conclude his investigation of President 
Clinton and the first lady and plans to finish before Hillary 
Rodham Clinton would stand for Senate in the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters after addressing a lawyers' group in  
Atlanta, Starr would not speculate about possible prosecutions of 
either of the Clintons. Nor would he give a possible date for the 
final report on his five-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether he plans to finish before the 2000 election,  
in which Mrs. Clinton is eyeing a Senate bid in New York, Starr 
said, ``The answer is yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly in that  
respect, and we are doing so,'' he said. ``I would anticipate that 
the final report will come at the earliest practicable moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his final report will cover all aspects of his  
investigation including the Clintons' Whitewater real estate 
dealings and the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was impeached by the House last December in connection  
with the Lewinsky case, but acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would need to be a comprehensive final report -- that is  
factually straight forward, that does not engage in 
characterization,'' he said. ``It's clear that the Congress did not 
want a final report to be an avenue for alleging that one or more 
individuals had engaged in criminal conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Starr praised an Arkansas judge's decision  
declaring that Clinton gave false testimony in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was very strong language,'' Starr said of the  
decision last month by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	While Starr wouldn't call her decision vindication in an  
interview with the NBC ``Today'' show, he did say: ``This is a very 
distinguished judge who looked at the facts and came to these 
conclusions. And I would just add that the system, did, in fact, 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has been investigating Clinton and his wife, Hillary, for  
over five years, and is thought to be winding down the probe. 
Clinton was impeached by the House last December in connection with 
the Monica Lewinsky case, but acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton White House has said that Clinton will pay the  
$90,000 fine levied by Judge Wright. The judge said in the July 29 
ruling she hoped that it might deter others ``who might consider 
emulating the president's misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which is in addition to $850,000 awarded Mrs. Jones  
in a settlement of her sexual harassment case, was aimed at 
covering legal costs related the president's denial that he had a 
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NBC interview today, Starr also said he ``was horrified''  
when Congress quickly released his report on Clinton to the public 
and allowed it to be posted on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the report contained many salacious details of  
Clinton's conduct, Starr said, ``Now, I have said and I will say 
again today, I don't think I did enough to warn the Congress, to 
say ... this is sensitive material. But I really did think, and I 
don't mean to criticize Congress, it made its decision and it was a 
broad bipartisan decision that that we're simply going to turn this 
information over to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he saw the telecast in which Hillary Rodham Clinton  
blamed her husband's problems on ``a vast right-wing conspiracy,'' 
and said that he ``simply took it as her sense of loyalty in light 
of the president denying the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr refused to comment on whether he might still seek  
Clinton's indictment. ``On that, I'm not going to comment at all,'' 
he said. ``It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting at all 
about the future of the investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Says Asian Demand Aids Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy remains in a severe state but is  
getting a boost from government spending and growing regional 
demand, the Economic Planning Agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its monthly report for August, the EPA said that increasing  
exports to Asia are helping to lift industrial production. 
</P>
<P>
	On the downside, however, it said the employment situation is  
worsening, with the number of working people continuing to fall and 
the jobless rate reaching a record-high 4.9 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently, the economy is improving somewhat. While the  
direction now is slightly upward, we can't say that it won't go 
down,'' said Takashi Omori, director of the national economic 
division at the EPA's research bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's pronouncements are closely watched by businesses  
and economists as key indicators of government thinking on the 
state of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst economic downturn  
in over 50 years. Corporations have begun to aggressively 
reorganize, while the government is pumping money into the economy 
to keep it afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya, who heads the EPA, suggested over the weekend  
that a planned second supplementary budget for the current fiscal 
year should be close to $8.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, there were more signs of life in the economy.  
</P>
<P>
	The Japan Center for Economic Research estimated that Japan's  
gross domestic product in June was 0.1 percent higher in real terms 
than May, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That calculation, the second consecutive monthly increase in  
GDP, would give Japan a 1.0 percent annualized growth rate, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the news was encouraging, however. The center said  
public spending climbed for the first time in three months, but 
personal consumption and capital spending shrank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Low capital spending is offsetting firm consumption and  
growing housing investment, and conditions are not ripe for overall 
domestic demand to grow,'' says a spokesperson for JCER, an 
affiliate of The Nihon Keizai Shimbun. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA report concurred, saying the key components of domestic  
demand remain in the doldrums. Private capital investment is still 
in a downward trend and falling wages continue to sap strength from 
the mild recovery in private consumption, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the agency left unchanged its overall assessment of  
the economy after revising upward its view in the two previous 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency revised upward its assessment of industrial  
production, however, saying there are signs that output is picking 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising steel exports to Asia due to the nascent economic  
recovery in the region as well as strong shipments in personal 
computers are helping to underpin output, Omori said.

<HEADLINE> Sonics Sign Vernon Maxwell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics signed guard Vernon  
Maxwell to a three-year contract, the team announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell averaged 10.7 points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 46  
games with the Sacramento Kings last season, his 11th in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell, 33, was originally drafted by the Denver Nuggets out of  
Florida in the second round of the 1988 NBA draft, number 47 
overall. His 1,155 3-pointers is sixth on the NBA's career list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited to be with Seattle,'' Maxwell said. ``I feel  
we have a great nucleus to get the Sonics back to a championship 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the Houston Rockets' NBA championship teams  
in 1994 and 1995. He has a career average of 13.3 points, 3.6 
assists and 2.7 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vernon's defensive intensity and clutch offensive ability will  
be great additions to our back court,'' team president and general 
manager Wally Walker said.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Gives Accounting Co. $1B Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cisco Systems, a leading maker of computer  
networking equipment, has agreed to invest $1 billion in KPMG LLP 
to aid the accounting and consulting firm's expansion onto the 
Internet, a published report said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose-Calif.-based Cisco was expected to announce the  
agreement Monday, The New York Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, KPMG will use the money to hire  
4,000 engineers and service professionals to develop and deliver 
Internet-based data, voice and video services to its clients, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 18 months, KPMG will build six technology centers  
-- four in the United States and two abroad, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Cisco will own a stake of less than 20 percent in  
KPMG, the U.S. unit of privately-held KPMG International, No. 3 
among the big five accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from both companies said they believe there is a  
winner-takes-all prize for companies that win the race to 
incorporate the Internet into their business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a realization that you can be out of business in  
three years,'' John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive told the 
Times. ``Whoever moves quickly first are those who will benefit 
over the next 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Butler, KPMG chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the New York-based firm has been courting potential technology 
partners in recent months. One result was a joint venture announced 
in June with Qwest Communications International to provide order 
processing.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Case Taking Important Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The next important step in the government's  
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. happens early this week when 
the judge receives hundreds of pages of documents largely 
summarizing months of courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the sides to  
present by Tuesday their versions of the facts of the case, one of 
the final steps toward a possible verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who made an unorthodox appearance in Atlanta today at a  
panel discussion with a Microsoft attorney and a lawyer from the 
New York attorney general's office, could decide the case late this 
year or early in 2000 -- unless off-and-on settlement negotiations 
succeed. New York is one of several states suing the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antitrust cases are by nature more complex than most other  
civil litigation,'' Jackson said at the American Bar Association 
discussion. He said his approach to the complicated Microsoft case 
was ``to try to avoid the Vietnam morasses'' that other cases, such 
as the breakup of AT&AMP;T, became. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began last October, the sides have met several  
times outside the courtroom, including once in early June. Future 
talks are anticipated this summer, but outside legal experts 
consider settlement unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust case, which accuses Microsoft of illegally  
wielding monopoly power in the software industry to crush potential 
rivals, has been on hiatus for seven weeks, since courtroom 
testimony ended June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said its court filing this week will focus on what it  
considers the government's failure to prove that the company's 
actions hurt customers, which would be necessary to support a 
guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The company apparently hopes to capitalize on a potentially  
embarrassing slip by government witness Franklin Fisher, an 
economist. Fisher told Justice lawyer David Boies in January that 
Microsoft's behavior ``on balance'' hasn't harmed consumers ``up to 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher caught himself moments later and amended his answer to  
explain that he believed consumers eventually would feel an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft strongly disagrees, said a company lawyer who outlined  
arguments in Microsoft's court filing on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, Microsoft will reassert that it's not an entrenched  
monopolist in the fast-paced technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	It will argue it didn't illegally discourage the nation's  
largest computer makers and Internet providers from distributing 
Web-browsing software manufactured by rival Netscape Communications 
Corp., recently bought by America Online Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The government improperly focused on a few manufacturers of  
computer operating-system software to illustrate Microsoft's 
dominance, the company contends. Proving a company wields monopoly 
power is essential to winning an antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft said it will argue it doesn't charge prices as  
high as a monopolist would, and its massive spending on research 
and development of new software ``makes no sense if Microsoft had 
durable monopoly power,'' the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants the judge to consider an array of fledgling  
technologies as its competition -- including new types of software 
and devices developed by America Online and others. It hopes to 
show that even though its flagship Windows software runs most of 
the world's personal computers, Microsoft's future influence is far 
from certain. 
</P>
<P>
	In another of its arguments, Microsoft will challenge the  
government's allegation that it included browsing software free in 
Windows in 1995 to undermine Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers, citing e-mails, contend Microsoft spent  
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop its Internet software 
but gave it away only after Netscape emerged as a threat to Windows 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's lawsuit quotes Microsoft's senior vice  
president, Paul Maritz, saying: ``We are going to cut off 
(Netscape's) air supply. Everything they're selling, we're going to 
give away for free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz denied making the comment, and on Sunday, The New Yorker  
reported, in its edition on newsstands Monday, Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates' reaction to the alleged quotation: 
</P>
<P>
	``A great lie! An unbelievable lie. Did anyone utter those  
words? Our e-mail, every piece of it, has been searched. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had found somebody who said it. Then we could take  
him out, and we could hang the guy, then we'd say OK, mea culpa. We 
found him -- the guy who said, 'I'll cut off your oxygen.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge will give the two sides one month to review each  
other's documents, then make revisions to their own filings and 
return them Sept. 10. Courtroom arguments are set for Sept. 21.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Johnson Tears Thumb Ligament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- LeShon Johnson, the Giants' running back who  
missed all of last season while fighting cancer, tore ligaments in 
his right thumb Monday and probably will miss New York's preseason 
opener against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was injured when he slipped while running a pass pattern  
out of the backfield late in the morning practice at the University 
at Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he planned to practice in the afternoon, Johnson was  
sent to New York City to be examined by Dr. Andrew Weiland, a hand 
specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery-Cornell Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving, his thumb was X-rayed and his right hand was  
placed in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the tear, the X-rays also showed a bone chip, Johnson  
said, noting his thumb was dangling after the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got back and I'm excited going out there on the  
field,'' Johnson said before lunch. ``I'm not going to let this 
slow me down. I'm just starting to feel good and get back on pace 
and something like this happens. It's a setback, but I can overcome 
it. I had worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was diagnosed with lymphoma in May 1998 after doctors  
found a tumor in his chest. The discovery during a routine 
examination came just months after the 28-year-old signed with New 
York as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent chemotherapy and radiation, finishing his treatment  
early this year. He has not missed a workout since practice started 
July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants coach Jim Fassel seemed optimistic that Johnson would  
miss no more than Friday's exhibition against the Vikings. He said 
there was an outside chance Johnson could play Friday, but that 
sounded very slim. 
</P>
<P>
	With starting halfback Gary Brown recovering from surgery on his  
buttocks, rookie draft picks Sean Bennett and Joe Montgomery and 
third-down back Tiki Barber will get most of the work at the 
position. Montgomery, the second-round pick, just returned to 
practice on Monday after missing a week with a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel said that if doctors were able to pin the ligaments and  
attached bone back in place, Johnson might be able to practice 
Monday. He would have to wear a splint for six weeks to prevent the 
thumb from bending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst case scenario is he misses Minnesota and then we  
have him back,'' Fassel said. ``That's what I think.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia Criticizes Takeover Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A $5.7 billion hostile takeover bid of Virginia-based Columbia  
Energy Group by NiSource Inc. would likely cripple both companies 
with massive debt and reduced earnings, Columbia chairman Oliver G. 
Richard III said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard made his comments in a letter to NiSource chairman Gary  
Neale in response to NiSource's announcement that it had received 
tender offers for more than 60 percent of Columbia's shares and was 
extending its $68-a-share offer until Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's board has rejected the offer as inadequate, saying  
the company is not for sale and that regulators likely would not 
approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite simply, the tender offer and related hostilities haven't  
changed our belief that NiSource's various merger proposals have 
been for the wrong price, at the wrong time and with the wrong 
company,'' Richard said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Neale said the strong response to NiSource's offer is  
proof Columbia shareholders want the merger to proceed despite the 
board's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've sent a resounding message: They want the board to  
fulfill its fiduciary obligations and meet with us to discuss our 
offer,'' Neale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neale said NiSource is committed to acquiring Columbia and is  
willing to increase its offer price if Columbia's board negotiates 
a friendly takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard said shareholders of both companies should consider how  
NiSource, with assets of $6.2 billion, could repay the massive debt 
a buyout of Columbia would require. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why shouldn't shareholders of both companies -- and regulators  
-- be concerned that NiSource's highly leveraged transaction could 
topple like a house of cards?'' Richard asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrillville, Ind.-based NiSource, the parent company of  
Northern Indiana Public Service Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in 
Massachusetts, would become one of the nation's biggest natural gas 
companies if it succeeded in the takeover. It had revenue of $2.9 
billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource began the unsolicited buyout offer after Columbia  
officials refused to engage in merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy, based in Herndon, Va., had 1998 revenues of  
nearly $6.6 billion. It is involved in natural gas exploration, 
production, transmission, storage and distribution as well as 
propane sales and electric power generation, sales and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of NiSource were down 68 3/4 cents to $24.87 1/2, while shares  
of Columbia were unchanged at $60.25 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

	TORONTO (AP) -- Brian McRae, acquired by the Colorado Rockies  
just nine days ago, was dealt to the Toronto Blue Jays today for a

<HEADLINE> Storied Bootmaking Plants Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOCONA, Texas (AP) -- After a hard cattle drive across Texas,  
cowboys who worked the Chisolm Trail 100 years ago would be sure 
and stop by this Oklahoma border town to pick up their handmade 
boots. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years to come, boots made in Nocona became famous, as  
much for their history as for their high-grade leather and stacked 
heals that fit in a stirrup. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, changing consumer tastes have sapped the boot business so  
much that Justin Industries -- which owns the Nocona factory and one 
in Fort Worth -- is closing both of them, putting about 260 people 
out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Western and Western-influenced products haven't been in  
demand,'' said David McGrady, general manager of the Nocona 
factory. ``Everything is fashion-driven and obviously Western is 
one fashion that's either in or out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Western boots have always been cyclical. Popular in the  
early 1980s due to the movie ``Urban Cowboy,'' the mid- to late 
'90s have been less kind to the traditional 13-inch-high dress 
boots. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Industries said its total 1997 footwear sales, including  
brands such as Nocona, Tony Llama and Justin Ropers, fell 16 
percent from the previous year to 186.5 million pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the country's largest cowboy bootmakers have been  
switching to boots with more of a work style, such as the 
flatter-heeled ropers. Many are making lace-up boots, although the 
tire-tread-like soles won't do for two-stepping at the local dance 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
	For Nocona, a town of 2,800 south of the Red River, the closing  
of the factory means the end of the area's largest employer and its 
biggest taxpayer. The 160 workers at the factory here make about 
3,500 pairs of high-end boots each week, ranging in price from $200 
to $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
	For townsfolk, the boot company has been not only a primary  
source of income, but a piece of a legend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sad thing, apart from the loss of jobs, is that it was  
kind of our identity,'' said Ricky D. Howard, president of Nocona 
Banking Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the town and the boot are named after Chief Peta Nocona of  
the Comanche tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	J.J. ``Daddy Joe'' Justin opened the business in the 1880s.  
After he died, the Justin family moved it to Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin's daughter, Miss Enid, felt so strongly that her father  
wanted the company in Nocona, that in 1925 she founded a competing 
company, Nocona Boot Co. with seven employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, nine years before she died at the age of 96, Miss Enid  
agreed to merge her firm with Justin Boot Co., by then one of the 
largest bootmakers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	She backed out of the sale initially, but her nephew ultimately  
sealed the deal. Now, workers are sorry Miss Enid ever allowed it 
to go through. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know it took just a few years for some men to tear up what  
it took one good woman 60 years to build,''' said Mary Brown, a 
26-year customer service worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees said they're bitter about the decision to move  
production to Justin factories in El Paso and Cassville, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the people on the production lines recently wore ``I was  
given the boot'' stickers. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent visit, several dozen funeral wreaths and crosses  
could be seen standing in the grass in front of the factory. 
Banners wilted in the 100-degree heat. Still, folks got out of 
their cars to read the messages: ``Sorry, Miss Enid,'' and ``Rest 
in Peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts believe that a trend toward casual dress  
may be the reason for the decline of dress cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are taking this low-key approach to their fashion.  
Certainly wearing Western boots takes a certain attitude,'' said 
Wendy Liebmann, president of the retail consulting firm WSL 
Strategic Retail. ``I would suspect people are moving more into the 
high-fashion loafer categories. You can wear them with jeans and a 
suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Mike Sultan, an economist with the Footwear Industries of  
America, said there's no true way to gauge why cowboy boots are no 
longer as popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we knew why, we could ride the wave. It's fashion and  
fads,'' said Sultan. 
</P>
<P>
	Many find it hard to believe that low sales are driving the  
factory closures. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Lone Star state, some law enforcement officers and chief  
executives still wear boots, while the Professional Rodeo Cowboy 
Association requires the footwear in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they say that the demand for the cowboy boot is gone,  
they're wrong,'' said Joan Tettleton, retail manager of the factory 
store, which is expected to stay open for business. ``The way 
everything is going right now, manufacturing is leaving the U.S.A. 
That's why they're closing this plant,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Factory manager McGrady said that Justin does subcontract  
overseas but manufactures the boots only in Missouri and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrady predicted the cowboy boot will be back.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, they will. How soon is anybody's guess,'' he said. ``We  
can't predict when bell-bottoms are coming back again, either.''

<HEADLINE> Day-Trading Firms Called Misleading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Day-trading firms mislead their  
investor-customers with promises of quick riches, fail to supervise 
their operations and make improper loans to customers to keep them 
trading, according to a report released today by state securities 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	A related analysis found that 70 percent of customers at one  
major day-trading firm lost money. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the North American Securities Administrators  
Association resulted from a 7-month investigation of the growing 
day-trading industry. It comes 11 days after Mark O. Barton shot 
and killed nine people at two day-trading firms in Atlanta where he 
had traded and lost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If day-trading firms want to become part of the mainstream,  
they need to play by the same rules the rest of Wall Street 
follows,'' said Peter Hildreth, president of the association, which 
represents securities regulators in the 50 states, Canada and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't get their act together they will be under  
increasing regulatory pressure,'' said Hildreth, who also is New 
Hampshire's director of securities regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said there are now 62 day trading firms operating  
with 287 offices around the country -- catering to roughly 4,000 to 
5,000 traders. 
</P>
<P>
	These firms provide their trader-customers with computers and  
high-speed hookups to trading networks and charge commissions for 
each trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Day traders ride the tiniest ups and downs of the stock markets,  
squeezing profits by buying and selling shares rapidly. Thousands 
of dollars of their own money are on the line, requiring fast 
thinking and strong nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	The traders, many of whom have abandoned their regular jobs, are  
distinct from the 5 million or so amateur investors who 
occasionally trade on the Internet at home or at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The state regulators hired an independent consultant, Ronald L.  
Johnson of Palm Harbor, Fla. to look at one firm -- All-Tech 
Investment Group Inc. Barton shot his victims at All-Tech's Atlanta 
office and at another firm, Momentum Securities, which had an 
office across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who based his analysis on a sampling of accounts at  
All-Tech, concluded that 70 percent of all day traders will lose 
and ``will almost certainly lose everything they invest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11.5 percent of traders demonstrated the ability to do  
profitable short-term trading, according to Johnson's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	In their investigation of a dozen day-trading firms, the  
regulators found they often lured investors with deceptive 
advertising about a high success rate and potential wealth, 
accepted people as customers who weren't suited for day trading and 
didn't have enough money to invest, improperly loaned money to 
customers and failed to keep accurate records. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, the report says, customers at day-trading firms  
loaned each other money, encouraged to do so by the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some day traders ... commonly trade beyond their means,'' the  
report says. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has defended its practices. James H. Lee, head of  
the Electronic Traders Association, continues to maintain that most 
day traders are profitable, and some firms claim success rates of 
60 percent to 70 percent or higher. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators already have cracked down on several  
day-trading firms. Since last fall, Massachusetts has filed or 
settled complaints against seven firms. In Texas, authorities 
closed two firms accused of operating without state licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In their report, the regulators urged the day-trading industry  
to more closely screen potential investors and more fully disclose 
the risks of the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which governs  
the Nasdaq Stock Market, recently approved such a rule -- requiring 
firms to disclose the risks to customers before they open accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the disclosure rule, the state regulators said  
the NASD also should adopt a rule specifically prohibiting 
day-trading firms from promoting and arranging loans among their 
customers, even though the activity already violates existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The loans can lead to forgeries, unauthorized transfers of  
customers' funds and other misconduct, the report says.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities day traders, most of them heading  
for losses, are being misled by host firms that promise them quick 
riches and make improper loans to keep them trading, state 
regulators contended Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the North American Securities Administrators  
Association resulted from a seven-month investigation of the 
growing day-trading industry. It came 11 days after Mark O. Barton 
shot and killed nine people at two day-trading firms in Atlanta 
where he had traded and lost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	A consultant hired by the regulators concluded in an  
accompanying analysis that 70 percent of all day traders end up 
losing money. A trade group said the consultant's sampling was too 
limited and hardly representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``If day-trading firms want to become part of the mainstream,  
they need to play by the same rules the rest of Wall Street 
follows,'' said Peter Hildreth, president of the association, which

</P>
<P>
	``If they don't get their act together they will be under  
increasing regulatory pressure,'' said Hildreth, who is New 
Hampshire's director of securities regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said there are now 62 day-trading firms operating  
with hundreds of offices around the country -- serving roughly 4,000 
to 5,000 traders. 
</P>
<P>
	These firms provide their trader-customers with computers and  
high-speed hookups to trading networks. They charge commissions for

consultant, Ronald L. Johnson of Palm Harbor, Fla., to look at one 
firm -- All-Tech Investment Group Inc. Barton shot some of his 
victims at All-Tech's Atlanta office. 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech is one of four day-trading firms that settled cases  
brought by Massachusetts securities regulators alleging deceptive 
marketing and improper investment advisory activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who based his analysis on trading records subpoenaed by  
Massachusetts of a sampling of 26 records showing trading activity 
at All-Tech, concluded that 70 percent of all day traders will lose 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11.5 percent of traders demonstrated the ability to do  
profitable short-term trading, according to Johnson's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Harvey Houtkin, founder and chief  
executive of All-Tech, dismissed Johnson's study as ``a 
self-serving piece of garbage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houtkin said his firm's customers have to have at least $25,000  
to invest and must demonstrate competency in trading. The company's 
Web site contains a warning about the risks, but he said many 
customers are not warned directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our clients are very sophisticated, relatively well-heeled,  
they know what they're doing,'' he said. ``To think that these 
people don't understand risk is almost insulting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Electronic Traders Association, an industry group of day  
traders and online traders, also issued a statement questioning 
Johnson's study, saying that it ``focuses on only one branch office 
of 287 branches of one firm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Tech, the statement said, ``was not a member of ETA. No one  
branch office is representative of the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the Electronic Traders Association also released a set  
of ``ethical principles'' for its member firms that it said 
addressed many of the issues in the NASAA report. 
</P>
<P>
	In their investigation of a dozen day-trading firms, the  
regulators contended the companies often lured investors with 
deceptive advertising about a high success rate and potential

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Julie Andrews has settled lawsuits with  
tabloids that reported in May she was being treated for addiction 
to prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe, a Florida-based paper, and the Daily Mail and OK! of

</P>
<P>
	The amounts of the settlements were not disclosed. Globe editor  
Tony Frost declined to comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Andrews had checked in at the Sierra Tuscon facility in  
Arizona to cope with grief related to throat surgery and the death 
of an aunt. Her lawyers have said she has never undergone treatment 
for any drug- or alcohol-related problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Andrews, 63, has had trouble singing since she underwent a

<HEADLINE> Clippers Re-Sign Tyrone Nesby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers re-signed forward  
Tyrone Nesby on Monday, matching the three-year, $8.9 million offer 
the 6-foot-6 forward signed with the NBA champion San Antonio 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nesby, who averaged 10.1 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.6 assists as  
a rookie with the Clippers last season, signed the offer sheet over 
the weekend. Since he is a restricted free agent, the Clippers had 
15 days to match it, and did so Monday, shortly after receiving it 
from the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never any question that we would re-sign Tyrone  
Nesby and doing so was one of our top priorities this summer,'' 
Clippers executive vice president of basketball operations Elgin 
Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers believe they will be strong at small forward during  
the upcoming season with Nesby and rookie Lamar Odom, their 
first-round draft choice, at the position. 
</P>
<P>
	As an undrafted free agent, Nesby earned a starting position  
with the Clippers 13 games into the abbreviated 1999 season and 
finished sixth among NBA rookies in scoring, fourth in 3-point 
percentage (36.5 percent), fifth in free-throw percentage (78.2 
percent) and eighth in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	Nesby led UNLV in scoring as a senior, averaging 15.8 points as  
well as 5.6 rebounds, but wasn't taken in the NBA draft.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Every investment period of a few years or more  
has its own particular brand of ``wisdom,'' promoted by the newest

</P>
<P>
	In each instance, an attempt is made to rewrite the rules, and  
for a time the rewriting produces results that may be spectacular. 
But sooner or later, the old wisdom catches up with the new. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are a few behavioral traits that reflect the attitudes and  
philosophy of at least some of the current market's participants: 
</P>
<P>
	----It's not profits but market share that counts.  
</P>
<P>
	This one, the current practice of which really is new, reflects  
the ability of high-tech stocks such as Amazon.com and America 
Online to claim leadership in emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Such companies race to sign customers, certain that by placing  
their own brand on the new marketplace they become a proxy for it, 
and that if they become No. 1 they have earned the label forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seem or seemed to believe it, pouring billions of  
dollars into the shares of these newer companies. Of late, however, 
some investors are wondering: Don't you need profits to succeed? 
</P>
<P>
	----It's a time for risk rather than caution.  
</P>
<P>
	Caution used to be the name of the game, as any ancient,  
white-maned investor will tell you. That view has become dated by 
the evidence of notable risk-takers who've made overnight killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Accustomed to a stagnant world, the old philosophers sought out  
blue chips and dividends that yielded single-digit annual gains. 
The new risk-takers want, and sometimes get, triple digits in a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that in doing so they sometimes pay double-digit or  
even triple-digit price-earnings ratios for their stocks. It's hard 
to argue with results, and some risk-takers have had big payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	What they still must contend with, however, are those much lower  
long-term averages that have a way of reimposing themselves on the 
marketplace. Big risk can mean big capital gains -- or big losses. 
</P>
<P>
	----As an employee, you work for opportunity, not for salary.  
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, that's the way some young investors make their  
money. Fresh out of college and certain that the world is simply 
chaos waiting for them to create it. They live for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the future more real are options, or the right to buy  
stock at a later date, when almost certainly (or so it is thought) 
the fruits of their genius will make the company a big winner. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the future is where it's at. At least among  
high-tech types, the future has never been more real, more 
imminent, more safer to plan for. It's there to be seized. 
</P>
<P>
	----As a top corporate executive, you believe in financial  
leverage. The idea is to grow the company; in fact, to keep pace 
with fast-growing consumer affluence you do so or lose market 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	If you can't do this by raising capital in the stock market you  
do it by borrowing it. You load up on debt, just as some Japanese 
firms did in the 1980s, when they seemed to buying up America. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a different era now, and some of those same Japanese  
companies are in woeful financial straits, since the bill always 
comes due. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, not long after they learned their lessons and put their  
balance sheets in order, many U.S. companies have big debts again, 
the better to grow and ``enhance shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Allmon of the newsletter ``Growth Stock Outlook''  
comments that ``a triple-A rating apparently no longer interests 
most companies as a badge of honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he sees it, enhancing shareholder value can mean a CEO  
scrambling to collect a fat payoff via stock options, which are 
becoming a larger percentage of chief executive pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he says, only 16 industrial companies are rated triple-A  
by Standard &AMP; Poor's, and only nine by Moody's.

<HEADLINE> Taylor, Dickerson, Newsome in Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Eric Dickerson said he was overcome by the  
permanence of it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the front steps of the Pro Football Hall of Fame on  
Saturday -- joined by fellow inductees Lawrence Taylor, Tom Mack, 
Ozzie Newsome and Billy Shaw -- the big tailback with the goggles 
and breakaway speed said it was more than the ceremony and a bronze 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someday you'll see a runner and think, `long, stately stride,'  
and say, `Damn, he looks just like Eric Dickerson,''' said the No. 
3 rusher in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a breezy and warm day for freezing such images forever.  
The huge video screens flanking the podium showed Taylor cutting 
across the field to cut down a runner from behind, Mack and Shaw 
pancaking defensive linemen and Newsome pulling in passes for the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Newsome's highlight reel that provoked one of the loudest  
reactions of the day. Interspersed with touchdown catches and big 
blocks were testimonials from coaches, players -- and former Browns 
owner Art Modell. The large contingent of Browns fans booed loud 
and long the man who took their team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	But Newsome, now the Baltimore Ravens' personnel director for  
Modell, was more than forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
	The tight end, who spent all 13 of his seasons in a Browns  
uniform, said he was ``proud to be joining as a member of that 
great tradition.'' He said he was looking forward to the return of 
the new Browns expansion franchise in tonight's Hall of Fame 
exhibition game against Dallas. And he welcomed other fans to the 
Browns' ``Dawg Pound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, the old/new franchise's fans barked and woofed.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, the fearsome linebacker for the New York Giants, was  
greeted by a large section which included dozens of fans wearing 
jerseys with his No. 56. His speech showed a softer side of the 
violent, rock-hard defender known as L.T. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who had pledged to former coach Bill Parcells that he  
wouldn't break down and cry, said he ``about lost it'' when 
introduced by his 17-year-old son, L.J. He had his ex-inlaws stand 
at one point and said, ``Even though they're ex-inlaws, I still 
love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since retiring six years ago, Taylor has encountered drug, legal  
and financial problems. During his speech, he thanked his kids for 
``understanding that people do make mistakes in life. They have the 
ability to forgive me and love me anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, who grew up in suburban Cleveland but spent his entire  
career with the Los Angeles Rams, failed to garner enough votes in 
his first 10 times as a finalist for induction. He thought he had 
run out of chances, just another overlooked offensive guard despite 
a glittering history of Pro Bowls and team success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only 60 miles from Cleveland to Canton,'' he said. ``But  
it seems like a million miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, an offensive guard for the Buffalo Bills who was the  
veterans committee nominee, thanked a long list of people for 
getting him into the hall, including the people in three different 
hometowns for welcoming him, his high school, college and pro 
coaches, his teammates and his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Unnerved by speaking in front of thousands of people and a  
national cable audience, Shaw somehow left out his wife of 39 
years, Patsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson, however, introduced her at the outset of his  
acceptance speech. A smiling Mrs. Shaw pointed at her husband and 
wagged a finger at him while he knelt in forgiveness. It brought 
laughter and applause from the fans sitting through the long 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw and Mack became just the fourth and fifth guards in the  
hall. Shaw also became the first person inducted who played his 
entire career in the American Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the inductees said they were thankful that they and their  
careers wouldn't be forgotten by future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickerson said his young daughter didn't understand the  
importance of his induction, but would someday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can bring your kids and your grandkids here and say, `Your  
granddad was a pretty good football player,''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Open Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures were mostly higher  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid uncertainty about 
the weather outlook for water-starved crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices opened lower but quickly turned higher as  
investors attempted to assess the impact of widespread showers over 
the weekend in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The rains were expected to provide some relief to crops in  
Illinois and Indiana, which were suffering critical shortages of 
soil moisture, but some agronomists said the rain was too little, 
too late for some corn and soybean crops. The conflicting views 
could cause heavy price volatility throughout the session, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for spring-planted crops have rallied sharply in the past  
two weeks as a drought that has been occurring for months along the 
eastern seaboard began to be felt in key Midwestern growing states. 
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio farmers were reporting progressive 
damage after enjoying weeks of nearly ideal growing weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were expected to closely watch the U.S. Agriculture  
Department's weekly crop update, which is to be released after 
trading ends today, for signs of additional deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.97 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.37 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/4 cents to $1.19 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 1/2 cents to 
$4.84 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while pork bellies were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell 0.50 cent to 64.85 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell 0.07 cent to 76.85 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs fell 0.15 cent to 45.45 cents a pound; February 
pork bellies rose 1.98 cents to 57.75 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Krayzelburg Sweeps Backstroke Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Lenny Krayzelburg completed a sweep of both  
backstroke events at the Phillips 66 National Swimming 
Championships on Monday and broke another record in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, 23, covered 100 meters in 54 seconds at the  
University of Minnesota Aquatics Center, breaking the U.S. Open and 
national meet record of 54.07 held by Jeff Rouse. Krayzelburg, of 
Studio City, Calif., had broken his own U.S. record in the 200 on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Thompson turned in the second fastest time in the history  
of the women's 100 butterfly, 58.15. The 26-year-old won her third 
title at the meet and the 23rd of her career. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Jones' clocking of 53.05 was enough to take the men's 100  
butterfly but was just shy of Neil Walker's U.S. record of 52.76. 
Jones' time of 52.90 in the preliminaries created some drama, but 
he wasn't able to better his effort in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Bedford won the women's 100 backstroke in 1:01.89, edging  
28-year-old high school English teacher and defending world 
champion Lea Maurer, who was timed in 1:02.04. Bedford, 26, won her 
seventh national title. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 400 freestyle, Lindsay Benko beat top seed Brooke  
Bennett -- the second fastest American ever in that event. Benko was 
timed in 4:11.31 in winning her second championship in three days. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Carvin won the men's 400 freestyle in 3:49.68.  
</P>
<P>
	Two national meet records fell in the 100 breaststroke. Megan  
Quann set the women's mark in 1:08.70, while Ed Moses got the men's 
in 1:01.21. A total of four meet records have been bettered in 
these national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet, expected to provide 10 additional U.S. qualifiers for  
the Pan Pacific Games in Sydney, Australia, concludes Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Drought Jeopardizes Bay Oysters / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- The drought has been a mixed blessing for  
the Chesapeake Bay's oyster population. 
</P>
<P>
	It is reducing fresh water flow into the bay, increasing  
salinity. That hurts the oysters because increased salinity 
encourages growth of oyster diseases such as dermo and MSX. 
However, saltier water also helps oysters reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers won't know the net effect until October, when  
biologists begin their annual sampling of oyster bars, said Chris 
Judy, director of the Department of Natural Resources shellfish 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	The change in the water composition will affect other species as  
well. Saltier water typically leads to more stinging sea nettles, 
which in turn eat tenophores, a jellyfish that consumes bay 
anchovies, the biggest food source for the bay's larger fish. With 
tenophores down, scientists expect a banner year for the critically 
important anchovy. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy and other bay managers say more is at stake than the  
oysters' contribution to water quality -- they filter and clean bay 
water -- and the seafood economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, political and financial support has been  
building toward a major attempt at restoring the bay's oyster 
population, estimated to be as low as 1 percent of historic levels. 
A massive oyster die-off alone would be enough to declare the 
drought a loser for the Chesapeake. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, water quality in the bay should benefit from the  
drought, because fewer pollutants will be washed from the land, 
scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- The Federation of Fly Fishers has  
announced that the Snake River is one of the five most endangered 
fisheries in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The fish habitats face immediate danger, with some of the  
world's most prized species on the verge of extinction, the group 
said at its international conference in Gatlinburg, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Snake River is in trouble because of federal dams impeding  
the migration of salmon and steelhead. Federation members cited 
eight dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers that they say block 
the passage of 95 percent of young salmon trying to transverse 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Organization members also said the health of the river is poor,  
resulting in the listing of nearly every species of salmon under 
the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The federation also named Wolf River, Wis., Crooked Creek, Ark.,  
Big Spring Run, Pa., and San Joaquin River, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Wolf River faces a potential new mining hazard, Crooked  
Creek has degrading water quality from existing gravel mining, Big 
Spring Run has improper hatchery operations that create poor water 
quality and San Joaquin River's steelhead population is being 
devastated by development, logging and mining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several priceless species have nearly been wiped out by  
habitat destruction, pollution and poor watershed management,'' 
said Greg Pitts, president of the Bozeman-based Federation of 
Flyfishers, which seeks to educate and promote conservation through 
the sport. ``But more than the health of fish is at stake. The 
value of these fisheries, both the direct economic value to the 
region and the intrinsic value of the species themselves are 
tremendous.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Countries Bid for 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- From heart-rending appeals to hard  
facts, South Africa, England and Morocco made their pitches to FIFA 
on Monday in an effort to win the bidding to stage the 2006 World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Presentations by Germany and Brazil were scheduled for Tuesday.  
FIFA's 24-man executive committee will decide on the host next 
July, and South Africa, England and Germany are considered the 
favorites. The 2002 tournament will be held in Japan and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa brought along a scantily-clad Zulu warrior who  
howled and danced among officials and reporters before the 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country's isolation from international football denied  
generations of players the opportunity to parade their skill on the 
world stage,'' South Africa Football Association president Molefi 
Oliphant said. ``They understood the need for such sacrifice 
because it accelerated the collapse of apartheid and our return to 
the FIFA family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa spent extra time outlining the tight security  
measures in an effort to overcome the fears about crime and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	England brought along a 135-person delegation that included 70  
media representatives, 19 flag-waving school children, Football 
Association members and former stars Bobby Charlton, Geoff Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign director Alec McGivan called it a ``real bid based on  
reality not promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``England is the home of football. England gave birth to  
football,'' McGivan said. ``We have a strong emotional case as the 
Home of football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Germany was host in 1974, England in 1966 and Brazil in 1950.  
Soccer's top event has never been held in Africa 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two African bids,'' said Driss Benhima, president of  
Morocco's bid. ``We are representing first Africa then the Arab 
nations.''

<HEADLINE> State Farm Faces Car Parts Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- When Peggy Frey picked up her newly repaired  
Ford Mustang from the body shop recommended by her insurance 
company, she found the hood didn't fit and the headlights were 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
	Frey, of Indian Shores, Fla., spent the next year battling with  
State Farm Insurance Co., contending it forced the shop to use 
substandard replacement parts when fixing her car after an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week a jury will begin hearing dozens of complaints like  
Frey's as it considers a class-action lawsuit that could 
fundamentally change the way insurance companies pay for car 
repairs. Jury selection was to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed on behalf of 5.5 million current and former  
State Farm auto insurance customers, could cost State Farm more 
than $2 billion and force the nation's largest auto insurer to drop 
its policy of insisting on cheaper replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The case marks the latest chapter in a debate over auto parts  
that has gone on for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	It involves door panels, hoods, fenders and other parts modeled  
on original equipment produced by automakers, but made without 
benefit of the original specifications. Known in the industry as 
aftermarket replacements, these parts made up about 15 percent of 
all crash-repair parts used last year, according to the 
Inter-Industry Conference on Auto Collision Repair, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs contend that State Farm breached its contract with  
customers and violated Illinois consumer fraud laws when it 
required cars be fixed with parts that don't return the vehicles to 
the ``pre-loss condition'' called for in its policies. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 40 other companies have policies requiring or favoring  
the use of aftermarket parts, but only Bloomington-based State Farm 
is named in this lawsuit. Plaintiff's attorney Don Barrett said 
State Farm was targeted because it is the industry leader and 
because of its policy requiring customers to pay more if they want 
original equipment parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way State Farm policyholders can be assured of getting  
original equipment parts is to pay the extra cost themselves -- an 
average of $100 to $150 per repair job, plaintiffs contend. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm says aftermarket parts are just as good as the others  
and save customers money. 
</P>
<P>
	Using such parts ``allows for competition in the crash part  
replacement market and keeps the costs consumers pay through 
insurance for auto repairs lower,'' spokesman Bill Sirola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Frey was involved in an accident with a truck, she had  
been restoring her 1988 Mustang in hopes of selling it to a 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the car ``looks like a reject,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	State Farm, which insures one of every five cars in the United  
States, tells body shops to use aftermarket parts if available. 
About 20 percent of the company's repairs use such parts, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	A February Consumer Reports evaluation of aftermarket parts  
found they typically take longer to install, often do not fit as 
well and are more rust-prone. Consumers Union, which publishes 
Consumer Reports, urged the Federal Trade Commission to require 
consumer consent for use of such parts and CU also suggested 
establishing safety standards for replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also charge some parts can lead to lower resale values  
and higher crash repair bills in the future. The Consumer Reports 
study said aftermarket bumpers performed miserably -- in a 5-mph 
crash involving a Ford bumper, damages totaled $235, compared to 
$1,320 for an aftermarket bumper. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirola said State Farm does not use aftermarket bumpers because  
they are not approved by the Certified Automotive Parts 
Association, an insurance-industry organization that sets standards 
for aftermarket parts. 
</P>
<P>
	But CAPA-approved parts have also been criticized. Last year,  
the Automotive Service Association, a trade group of nearly 13,000 
body shops, withdrew its representative from CAPA's board, saying 
CAPA had done too little to improve the quality of replacement 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	CAPA executive director Jack Gillis did not return telephone  
calls seeking comment. In 1990, State Farm paid $100,000 to 
Illinois policyholders to settle a suit over similar allegations. 
The company also agreed in a 1995 San Diego case to pay $3.5 
million toward parts testing and give $35 refunds to affected 
policyholders.

<HEADLINE> Justice Ginsburg Receives Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg brought  
her best Thurgood Marshall imitation to the American Bar 
Association's annual meeting, where she received a civil rights 
award named for the high court's first black member. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg was given the Thurgood Marshall Award for her work as a  
leading women's rights advocate who won several important Supreme 
Court rulings on sex discrimination during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg told the audience of an instance during Marshall's  
pre-Supreme Court days when he called a New York travel agency to 
see if it would book a room for him in a Southern hotel that 
practiced racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	When an agency confirmed a room for him, Marshall asked if he  
could be assured the hotel was not ``restricted.'' He got an 
embarrassed response: ``I'm sorry, Mr. Marshall, I didn't realize 
you were Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg added: ``Marshall feigned an exaggerated Southern drawl  
and growled'' -- and here she growled too, to the audience's delight 
-- ``Ahh have got some news for you!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg, who occupies the Supreme Court chambers used by  
Marshall during his retirement years, paid tribute to his legal 
work that led to the high court's 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education 
ruling that barred public school segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	``My advocacy, of course, did not begin to compare with Thurgood  
Marshall's. My life was never in danger, and the ACLU litigation I 
superintended was never the only show in town,'' Ginsburg said 
during Saturday night's event. 
</P>
<P>
	``But of one thing there is no doubt,'' she said. ``I gained  
courage and inspiration from Marshall's example -- his measured, 
step-by-step strategy, his understanding that it was necessary to 
educate his audience, his provision of that education in ways 
comprehensible by, and palatable to, the decision-makers.''

	Lawyers attending the ABA convention can stroll through exhibits  
by companies offering a wide variety of products and services: law 
book publishing, computer software for legal research, furniture, 
stationery and luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz brought a sport utility vehicle to the exhibition  
area, and Chrysler had a minivan and a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinkerton's detective agency advertised its help in protecting  
against international business risks. ``How do you respond if your 
corporate vice president is kidnapped while traveling in South 
America?'' its pamphlet asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Another company called DNA Identification Systems has a new $20  
kit for saving DNA samples. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to help so many people,'' said company  
spokeswoman Florrye Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	If questions of parenthood arise after someone dies and has been  
buried, having a DNA sample from that person would avoid the need 
for exhumation, she said. In adoption cases, a birth parent or 
other relative could provide DNA to help the child one day identify 
disease risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The kit allows someone to swab a saliva sample from the inside  
of the cheek, blot it on a card, seal it and have it notarized. The 
sample can be stored at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Why can't someone just get a Q-Tip and save a DNA sample on an  
ordinary piece of paper in an envelope? Cleveland says the kit made 
by her company has specially treated paper so the DNA will adhere 
and be protected against deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was Johnnie Cochran's resume.  
</P>
<P>
	Most people who appear on ABA panel discussions provide a few  
pages of career background. Cochran, the former criminal defense 
lawyer for O.J. Simpson, turned in an 18-page extravaganza 
detailing major cases he won, speeches and awards, and even his 
appearances on television shows such as ``Roseanne'' and ``The 
Guiding Light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His resume says that this year, Ebony magazine named him one of  
the 10 best-dressed black men in the country. In 1995, TV Guide 
called him one of the 10 most important people in TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Cochran and other lawyers on Simpson's defense team were  
honored by the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice ``for 
their dedication and courage in never wavering in their duty to 
their client.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cochran left one thing off his resume: winning the 1995  
not-guilty verdict in the Simpson case itself.

<HEADLINE> US Protest Marks A-Bomb Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Martin Sheen was among 400 anti-nuclear  
protesters who rallied outside Los Alamos National Laboratory 
Monday, the 54th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan. 
Sheen and 75 others were briefly detained. 
</P>
<P>
	The group protested the lab's production of new plutonium pits,  
which is the core of a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the generation that brought the bomb in. We have got to  
be the generation that should take it out,'' Sheen said during a 
mile-long march to the lab before the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab officials allowed the crowd to protest in a parking area  
outside a lab building, Sheen was taken into custody after he 
stepped over a yellow cord into a restricted area. 
</P>
<P>
	He knelt and said the Lord's Prayer, then told security agents:  
``I'm all yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen, 59, and the others detained during the 45-minute rally  
were put on buses and driven a mile to a downtown park, where their 
plastic handcuffs were snipped off. The U.S. Attorney will not seek 
to prosecute any of the 76 people, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment on the protest, lab spokesman John Bass said:  
``There is nothing really the lab can say about it. Disarmament 
would be a good idea, except for the fact that the lab, along with 
the other labs -- the DOE complex -- have been mandated by the 
Department of Energy, the Congress and the president to make the 
nuclear weapons stockpile, and that's what we do. That's our 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos was the birthplace of the atomic bomb, created during  
World War II under the Manhattan Project. Nagasaki, Japan, was 
bombed Aug. 9, 1945, to end the war.

<HEADLINE> Collector Gets Rembrandt Etchings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- An avid reader who bought a box of  
secondhand books for $25 found a little something extra inside -- 
two etchings by the Dutch master Rembrandt worth an estimated 
$16,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, whose name was not released, bought the books last week  
at a market in Deventer, about 60 miles east of Amsterdam, the 
daily De Telegraaf reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	When he emptied the box, the man discovered two etchings in an  
envelope. 
</P>
<P>
	Art historians identified the etchings as the work of Rembrandt.  
One depicts Rembrandt's mother. The other shows an image of the 
good Samaritan. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a Dutch woman pocketed $50,000 after she bought a book  
for $1 and found two Rembrandt etchings inside.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Concerts Plagued by Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Weekend riots outside concerts by the  
Dave Matthews Band were caused by people who didn't go to the shows 
but partied in the parking lots, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They apparently came to drink and party and have what they  
thought was a good time,'' Hartford Police Sgt. Neil Dryfe said. 
``Then the mob mentality took over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police defended their use of riot police and plastic bullets.  
</P>
<P>
	Concert promoter James Koplik said there were no problems within  
the Meadows Music Theatre, which was filled with 26,000 people for 
each of three sold-out shows. The concerts, which began Friday, 
wrapped up the band's two-year tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had three days of peace and love inside,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Outside was a different story. Officers arrested 55 people on  
charges including breach of peace, assault on an officer and 
rioting. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, a crowd of about 100 college-age youths --  
many high on alcohol, narcotics or illicit nitrous oxide -- 
overturned and torched several cars and set a pile of chairs and 
debris on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Police moved in. Officers were pelted with rocks and bottles.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, police officers wearing riot gear and carrying  
shotguns greeted concertgoers. Hundreds of youths without tickets 
gathered in a nearby parking lot where a local band was playing, an 
arrangement Koplik said was not authorized or organized by the 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	When the revelers were told to leave, they threw bottles and  
rocks. Police responded with pepper spray and rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no estimates on property damage, but said no serious  
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The melees came two weeks after the Woodstock '99 concert ended  
in violence, with tractor-trailers set ablaze, vendor stands 
overrun and authorities pelted with bottles.

<HEADLINE> Political Debate Focusing on Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- When Iowa caucuses launch the  
presidential nominating season, farm issues count. And Bill Bradley 
has spent weeks painstakingly explaining his switch in position on 
ethanol and pledging his future loyalty on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the nation doesn't know much about ethanol -- alcohol  
that's distilled from corn and mixed with gasoline. Backers say it 
burns cleaner than gasoline, and protects the environment -- 
something critics dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	It provides a big market for corn, puts money in the pockets of  
farmers and is very popular in Iowa. It's also subsidized by the 
government, a subsidy Bradley voted against when he represented New 
Jersey in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidate Bradley has a completely different view, vowing ``no  
raids on ethanol'' in his administration. ``I had very New 
Jersey-specific reasons for opposing that'' Bradley said of his 
earlier opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is not the only presidential hopeful eager to offer a  
take on the farm crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush used his first visit to Iowa to assure  
activists he was one oil-state governor who likes ethanol. Arizona 
Sen. John McCain has sought to end the ethanol subsidy, but McCain 
hasn't established any Iowa campaign yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle went to a family farm to demand ``immediate action,''  
while Pat Buchanan issued the latest 10-point plan to cure the 
``harvest of heartache.'' Gov. Tom Vilsack hailed support from the 
nation's governors. 
</P>
<P>
	All that happened on Monday, not a bad day for farmers  
increasingly at the center of the nation's political debate. Iowa 
is flooded with candidates -- five were stumping the state Monday in 
preparation for Saturday's Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the nation's economy is humming along in fine shape,  
with the stock market growing and unemployment sagging, a 
combination that's left many voters content with the direction the 
nation is heading. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's trouble in farm country.  
</P>
<P>
	Reasonably good weather has brought a very large crop to be  
harvested this fall, and prices for virtually all commodities have 
sagged to historic lows. As of Friday, corn was selling for $1.61 
to $1.67 a bushel and soybeans were bringing about $4.12 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	To break even, farmers need to get $2.50 a bushel for corn, and  
about $6 a bushel on soybeans. That means they're losing money on 
every bushel they harvest this fall, and that's just about the 
hottest topic in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can quit talking about an impending farm crisis,''  
Iowa Agriculture Secretary Patty Judge said. ``We are in a 
crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Respect for the office (of the presidency) and the farm  
economy,'' Bush snapped during a recent visit to Iowa when asked 
the top issues on the minds of voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look past those brimming silos and fields of corn and you'll  
see a harvest of heartache in the heartland of America,'' Buchanan 
told workers at a Des Moines insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle headed to a state legislator's farm in eastern Iowa ``to  
call attention to the mounting financial crisis facing American 
agriculture and propose a bold response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole traveled to the scenic Iowa State Fairgrounds to  
deliver her detailed package of farm relief earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``American farmers are the backbone of this nation,'' she said.  
``Farm families are America's heart and soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vilsack even convinced the nation's governors to pass a  
resolution calling on Congress and the president to pass 
``comprehensive'' farm assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our farmers are paying a price for each day that our  
government fails to address this crisis in rural America,'' Vilsack 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes has been criticized for being a bit stiff  
on the campaign trail, but he gets positively animated when the 
subject turns to farm economics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must stop punishing the farm economy and set American  
farmers free from high interest rates, high taxes oppressive 
regulation and unfair trade barriers,'' declared Forbes. ``The farm 
crisis is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander took a more direct role in  
the farm crisis -- he bought a pig, then promptly lost money when he 
sold it to a processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander paid $128 for the 343-pound pig, then sold it to a  
processing plant for $117 a few hours later, noting: ``I understand 
better how hog farmers feel.''

	It's a bipartisan deal, of course. Democrat Bill Bradley, former

farmers. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Tax Cut Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he remains optimistic  
about reaching a tax-reduction agreement with congressional 
Republicans but cannot accept cuts that threaten Social Security, 
Medicare and other vital programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Attacking the 10-year, $792 billion tax-cut bill passed by  
Congress last week, Clinton told the nation's governors Sunday he 
believes he has a winning formula to properly divide projected 
surpluses among tax cuts, debt reduction and popular federal 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we ought to blow it,'' he said. ``And if I can  
stop it, I will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the president said he remains optimistic that a compromise  
can be reached. ``I am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people 
are about the prospects of our reaching an agreement, and I am 
determined to try to do it,'' he said at the National Governors' 
Conference meeting in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	He also made clear he is optimistic he'll be able to make the  
case that a huge tax cut now would be bad for the economy and for 
the investments the nation needs to make in its own future 
prosperity and success. 
</P>
<P>
	And he told the governors the Republican bill would lead to huge  
reductions in spending on Medicare, farm programs and other items 
critical to the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP tax cut is based on projected budget surpluses that so  
far exist only on paper, Clinton said. ``So one of two things will 
happen,'' he said. ``We would either have huge cuts in all these 
things -- huge -- or we would have a reversion to past policies. We'd 
go back to deficit spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans contended that Clinton and fellow Democrats would  
say anything to avoid shrinking the size of government and reducing 
spending. ``The president wants more money so he can spend more 
money,'' Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., told the governors just before 
Clinton spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's appeal on taxes and budget surpluses came after a busy  
weekend back home in Little Rock, Ark., where he and Vice President 
Al Gore joined forces for the first time at a fund-raiser that 
collected some $300,000 for Gore's 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He was continuing a busy travel schedule this week, including a  
flight to Atlanta today to address the American Bar Association and 
present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former President 
Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.

<HEADLINE> Failed Merger Boosts Comcast Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Comcast Corp., the nation's third-largest  
cable company, earned $816.4 million in the second quarter thanks 
mainly to a $1.5 billion fee from the breakup of its proposed 
merger with MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings, which were equivalent to $1.01 per share, compared  
to a net loss of $92 million, or 13 cents per share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast received the fee received in May as part of AT&AMP;T Corp.'s  
deal to acquire MediaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 23 percent to $1.48 billion from $1.21 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Comcast also announced Monday that it was doubling its stake in  
Jones Intercable of Englewood, Colo., for $846 million in stock. 
The deal will leave Comcast with a 79 percent stake in Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a terrific quarter for our company as we  
completed a number of cable transactions, the most significant of 
which was the acquisition of a controlling interest in Jones 
Intercable,'' Comcast President Brian L. Roberts said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones Intercable owns about 260 cable franchises across the  
United States and employs 3,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast, which has a total of 6.1 million cable subscribers, has  
grown into a telecommunications powerhouse in the past decade. It 
has grown by two-thirds since late 1996 and also is buying Prime 
Communications of Austin, Texas. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 'Raymond,' 'The Practice' Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viewers for Quality Television saluted  
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ``The Practice,'' but for the first 
time in four years the citizen watchdog group did not honor a 
network with one of its annual awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,000-member organization named ABC's ``The Practice'' its  
best drama for the second year in a row. CBS's ``Everybody Loves 
Raymond'' won four awards, including best comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The group skipped its Network Commitment to Quality award, which  
NBC has won twice and Fox picked up last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a stretch to justify giving it,'' Dorothy  
Swanson, the organization's founder, said Monday, when the winners 
were announced. It was the first time since starting the network 
award that the group did not name a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers for Quality Television usually gives out its awards at a  
banquet around the time of the Emmys. This year it is forgoing the 
banquet and having members deliver the trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillian Anderson of ``The X-Files'' and Dennis Franz of ``NYPD  
Blue'' were named top actors in dramas. Ray Romano and Patricia 
Heaton of ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' won top acting awards for 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Camryn Manheim and Steve Harris of ``The Practice,'' Doris  
Roberts of ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and Peter MacNicol of ``Ally 
McBeal'' won supporting actor awards. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace'' won the group's founders' award, which  
honors an individual or series that has made a significant 
contribution but received little recognition.

<HEADLINE> H.S. Shooting Suspect Has Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The 15-year-old accused of wounding six  
Heritage High School classmates left a note that spoke about 
``laughing at the victims'' and referred to the Columbine High 
School group called the Trench Coat Mafia, an investigator 
testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	The handwritten note was in a notebook found under T.J.  
Solomon's bed after the May 20 shootings at Heritage, said Gary 
Nicholson, an agent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the paper, Nicholson said, Solomon wrote:  
``I am laughing at the victims who are getting down on their knees 
screaming, `Please, dear God, please don't let this crooked ... 
(obscenity deleted) murder me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying at a Juvenile Court hearing to decide whether Solomon  
should be tried as an adult, Nicholson said the note was found with 
three typewritten sheets of bomb-making instructions taken from the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon is charged with shooting and wounding six classmates at  
Heritage High in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers on May 20, a month 
after the shooting at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., in which 
15 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson quoted the note as saying: ``One big question I leave  
behind for you to find is why. But for the sake of my brothers and 
sisters related to the Trench Coat Mafia, those answers will have 
to remain out of the public eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This has nothing to do with Hitler, and it is not because I  
was picked on,'' the note said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two gunmen who killed 13 people and themselves in Colorado  
were members of the Trench Coat Mafia, a loosely knit group of 
students who shared a predilection for dark ``Goth'' culture. 
According to diary entries, they considered themselves outcasts in 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Richard Read argued in his opening statement  
that Solomon knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will show that the interests of this child being kept in  
the juvenile system do not outweigh society's interests of being 
protected from someone who showed such callous disregard for human 
life,'' Read said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Don Samuel argued in favor of keeping the case  
in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge William Schneider was not expected to rule immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	If Schneider keeps the case in juvenile court and Solomon is  
convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum five years of 
detention. If convicted in Superior Court, Solomon would face 351 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said Solomon's note also referred to bombs at Heritage  
High, although no bombs were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure if bombing the school is a good idea,'' Nicholson  
read from the note. ``If the cops are doing their jobs correctly, 
they'll find the bomb instructions along with this note. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll find four of these bombs, including three placed in and  
around Heritage High School. All in all, 17 will be found.''

<HEADLINE> Oasis Guitarist Quits Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Oasis guitarist Paul ``Bonehead'' Arthurs has quit  
the band. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a lot of consideration I have decided to call it a day  
with Oasis,'' Arthurs, 34, said in a statement released through the 
band's label, Creation Records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a fantastic eight years in one of the best bands ever  
to come out of Britain, and now feel I have come to the stage where 
I'd like to concentrate on other things in my life, outside of the 
demands of being in a successful rock 'n' roll band,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhythm guitarist Arthurs -- dubbed ``Bonehead'' because of his  
thinning hair -- was a founding member of the band, which was 
originally formed as Rain in Manchester, England, in 1991 with 
drummer Tony McCarroll and bass player Paul McGuigan. 
</P>
<P>
	A new singer, Liam Gallagher, suggested a change of name and the  
appointment of his brother, Noel, as lead guitarist and songwriter. 
Their successful debut album, ``Definitely Maybe,'' followed in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The band said there are no plans to replace Arthurs.

<HEADLINE>  Giants Ink DE Strahan for $32M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Once Michael Strahan and the New York Giants  
agreed to take three years off their contract and drop the signing 
bonus by about $6 million, it didn't take long to make him the 
NFL's second-highest-paid defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan, the two-time Pro Bowl defensive end whose 29 sacks over  
the past two seasons led the NFL, signed a four-year, $32 million 
contract Monday, the largest in Giants' history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is a very modest guy,'' said Tony Agnone, Strahan's  
agent. ``He absolutely is the best defensive player in football, 
and they wanted to make him the highest-paid guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only Dallas cornerback Deion Sanders will make more than  
Strahan, averaging $10.3 million annually under terms of a complex 
contract. However, Sanders has to play more than 70 percent of the 
Cowboys' defensive plays to be No. 1, Agnone said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't, Strahan will be the highest paid.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, recovering from toe surgery, is not in the Cowboys'  
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely happy. They made a commitment to me and I think  
we made a commitment to each other,'' Strahan said after signing 
the contract between practices at the University at Albany. ``I am 
happy to be in New York. I love New York and never wanted to go 
anywhere in the first place. So I'm glad they were able to get an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, Strahan will receive a $12 million  
signing bonus. The 27-year-old who grew up in Germany and didn't 
play football until his senior year in high school will earn 
$400,000 in salary this year. He will get $4.6 million in 2000 and 
then $7 million and $8 million, respectively, in the last two years 
of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan's old contract with the Giants would have expired after  
this season, and he warned the team during the offseason to get it 
done before this season started. 
</P>
<P>
	Agnone and Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi met several  
times over the last month, discussing both long- and short-term 
contracts, as well ones with incentives, voidable years and other 
gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Their breakthrough meeting came last Wednesday at Giants  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we realized was, let's not try to make everything so  
complicated and make things more simple,'' Agnone said. ``As we 
simplified things, we started realizing we could make this 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a three-page contract, unlike some of the 35-page  
ones Accorsi has seen recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get a contract any cleaner than this,'' Accorsi  
said. ``There isn't anything in it. There are five lines, each of 
the four years and the signing bonus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second-round draft pick in 1993 from Texas Southern, Strahan  
wasn't concerned about agreeing to a smaller signing bonus in 
return for a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather take that chance and see what I get negotiating a  
new contract instead of tying myself up for seven or eight years,'' 
Strahan said. ``I think I am young enough where I have enough 
confidence in my ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $8 million average salary makes Strahan the highest-paid  
defensive linemen, moving ahead of Minnesota's John Randle, who 
averages $6.5 million under a deal he signed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now entering his seventh season, Strahan blossomed the last two.  
He dominated up front and was selected to the Pro Bowl each year.

<HEADLINE> Violence at Dave Matthews Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A night after scuffles broke out and one  
car was torched, violence again erupted outside a Dave Matthews 
Band concert when riot police were pelted with rocks and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of three local shows on Friday was peaceful, but  
violence erupted the two following nights. Fifty-five people were 
arrested during the weekend on charges ranging from breach of peace 
to assault on a police officer to rioting, Hartford Police Sgt. 
Neil Dryfe said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The melees come two weeks after the three-day Woodstock '99  
concert ended in an ugly orgy of violence, with tractor-trailers 
set ablaze, vendor stands overrun and authorities pelted with 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	Dryfe said there were no problems inside the theater, where the  
popular rock band's sold-out shows at the Meadows Music Theatre 
played to 25,000 people each night, but police had to contend with 
a heavy barrage of bottles in lots surrounding the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Ed Pawlina said the situation was ``out of control'' at  
about 9:15 p.m. Sunday, but most of the crowd began leaving by 11 
p.m. after the concert ended. Empty beer and liquor bottles 
littered the parking lots and streets around the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	City councilman Lou Watkins, chairman of the city's public  
safety committee, said there were minor injuries but nobody was 
seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a riot,'' he said. ``We've got some rowdy  
concertgoers. Actually, they're not concertgoers, they're people 
who didn't get in. The police department is doing a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said police began using tear gas and pepper spray --  
the police said it was only pepper spray -- at an unruly crowd in a 
nearby parking lot where a local band was playing. One crowd member 
threw a bottle at a police officer, hitting him in the jaw, they 
said. The officer responded by spraying the bottle-tosser and other 
officers began moving in, said witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the tear gas came, everyone just started throwing  
bottles. They were like birds in the sky swooping down,'' said Jeff 
Bogino, 19, of Avon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a rainstorm of bottles,'' said his friend, Ben  
Reder, 19, of West Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	In another parking lot, witnesses said a dozen officers pushed  
hundreds away as the doors were opened. They said people began 
throwing objects at the officers because they felt intimidated and 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert Sunday was the last date this year on the two-year  
tour of the Dave Matthews Band. Their hit albums include ``Under 
the Table and Dreaming.'' Earlier this year, Forbes magazine ranked 
the band at 42 on its list of top-earning entertainers with 
estimated revenue of $30 million.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks' Robert Pack Is Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dallas Mavericks point guard Robert Pack was  
arrested for allegedly threatening his ex-girlfriend and violating 
an order of protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman told police that Pack came to her Harlem home at 3:20  
a.m. Sunday and began verbally harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
	Pack, 29, of West Orange, N.J., was charged with harassment and  
criminal contempt. Police did not identify his ex-girlfriend, 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Pack had a disappointing season for the Mavericks in 1999,  
playing in only 25 games and shooting 43 percent from the field 
while hampered by numerous injuries. He averaged 3.2 assists, his 
lowest total since his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mavericks are Pack's fifth NBA team. He also played for  
Portland, Denver, Washington and New Jersey. He was traded from the 
Nets to Dallas in 1997 as part of the biggest multi-player deal in 
NBA history.

<HEADLINE> White House Hints at Tax Cut Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a hint of movement, a White House official  
said Monday that if Republicans would agree to a $250 billion, 
10-year tax cut for the middle class, the Clinton administration 
would be open to negotiations over the package's details. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we agree on the size, and that it should be  
targeted to working families, we certainly would be willing to 
compromise with both Republican and Democratic members of Congress 
on its exact composition,'' Gene Sperling, chairman of the White 
House National Economic Council, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Sunday made conciliatory comments about his  
hopes for a compromise with Republicans this fall over tax cuts and 
spending. But Sperling's remarks seemed to be the first time the 
White House has explicitly suggested that it is not necessarily 
wedded to the targeted tax cuts for retirement savings, long-term 
health care and other expenses it has espoused so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments still leave the White House significantly short of  
the $792 billion, 10-year measure Republicans pushed through 
Congress last week. Clinton has promised to veto the bill, and GOP 
leaders have shown little interest in settling for a $250 billion 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	``It pales in comparison to what a majority of members of  
Congress have voted to put on the president's desk,'' said Pete 
Jeffries, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill includes a 1 percent reduction in all income-tax  
rates, an easing of the ``marriage penalty'' tax paid by many 
married couples, a capital gains tax-rate cut, elimination of the 
inheritance tax on large estates, and a slew of tax breaks for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	In an alternative that the Senate rejected, Senate Democrats  
proposed increasing the standard deduction for joint and single 
filers and the itemized deduction for married couples. They did not 
embrace universal savings accounts, federally subsidized retirement 
accounts for individuals that was the core of Clinton's tax-cut 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	As administration officials have said all along, Sperling said  
that before discussing tax cuts, the two sides would first have to 
agree on extending Medicare's solvency, providing a prescription 
drug benefit and financing other domestic priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling said that if Republicans would agree to using $250  
billion in tax cuts for the middle class, ``and that is something 
we can get done, we can save for another day whether you also have 
a broader, larger tax cut that affects well-off Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jacob Lew made a similar point Sunday  
on ``Fox News Sunday,'' saying, ``You know, there's actually a lot 
we agree on in terms of tax policy. ... Let's agree on a tax cut 
for working Americans and let's leave behind the tax cut for the 
most wealthy and special interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling said the GOP package had roughly $250 billion in tax  
breaks for the middle class, which he said should ease the two 
sides' effort to agree on such a package. But those remarks, and 
Lew's, seemed aimed at isolating out that portion of the Republican 
plan and making it harder for them to achieve the rest of their 
proposed reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	By largely partisan roll calls, the House and Senate approved  
the GOP tax package last week. Party leaders won't send the measure 
to the White House until after lawmakers return from their August 
recess for fear that Clinton could veto it and dominate the 
public-relations war in Congress' absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, GOP lawmakers are fanning out in their districts to  
try raising interest in their tax package. Most polls have shown 
that when asked how they would like to use projected budget 
surpluses, most Americans consider tax cuts a low priority.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 6.33 at 10,707.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks struggled to another loss Monday as  
long-term interest rates soared to a 21-month high in the bond 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.33 points to close at  
10,707.70. The blue-chip index sputtered throughout the session, 
rising as many as 47 points and sinking as many as 30 from Friday's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 2.49 to 1,297.80, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 
28.99 to 2,518.98. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now 4.5 percent below its record high, set just last  
month, and the Nasdaq is 12 percent below its record, also set July 
16. Analysts are divided over whether the market's protracted 
sluggishness signals a broad correction, or if it's merely a step 
back from prices that had soared too high, too fast. Wall Street 
considers a drop of 10 percent to be a correction, or a pause in a 
rising market. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co., said it's  
unlikely that the market will break out of its trading range until 
Aug. 24, when the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest 
ratesfor a second time this summer, hoping to slow the growth of 
the nation's economy to a noninflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their move is in the bag,'' he said. ``But until they make  
that move, we'll see a lot more of this sideways action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of higher interest rates have pressured stocks and bonds  
for weeks, and bond prices plunged sharply on Monday, sending 
yields sharply higher. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond 
climbed to 6.23 percent, the highest level since Nov. 4, 1997. With 
yields rising, bonds are becoming an attractive, less volatile 
alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks can no longer count on a strong economy and lower  
interest rates,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells 
Fargo &AMP; Co. ``Rising interest rates will damage economic growth and 
earnings expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin kept world markets slightly off  
balance Monday after he fired his prime minister and the entire 
Cabinet. It's the fourth time in 17 months he has dismissed the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	While the broad market sputtered, a flurry of deals and new  
products spurred some gains for computer-related companies. 
Advanced Micro Devices rose 1 7/8 to 19 1/4 after releasing a new 
computer microprocessor it says can outperform Intel's high-end 
chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Net2Phone Inc., a company that provides telephone service over  
the Internet, rose 3 7/8 to 20 3/8 after NBC agreed to take an ownership 
stake in exchange for prominent placement of Web site links. 
</P>
<P>
	Data General rose 4 1/4 to 17 7/16 after agreeing to be acquired by  
EMC Corp., a larger rival in the computer data-storage business. 
EMC fell 3 to 57. 
</P>
<P>
	As companies complete their preparations for the Year 2000,  
computer businesses are likely to thrive, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most industries have completed their preparedness, or they're  
close to doing so,'' he said. ``These companies are doing well 
because there's going to be a lot of demand once that hurdle is 
cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp decline of the Nasdaq, which is dominated by  
technology stocks, may also indicate that those shares are ready to 
level out or improve, said Rao Chalasani, chief investment 
strategist at Everen Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nasdaq has taken the brunt of the market's decline and the  
Dow has bucked the trend,'' he said. ``It may be the Dow's turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, MCI WorldCom fell 3 13/16 to 77 7/16 after saying  
it will offer evening long-distance service for 5 cents a minute, 
matching a plan by rival Sprint. Analysts fear the price cuts will 
eventually harm earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil and oil services shares were mostly higher as the price of  
crude oil rose. Chevron rose 13/16 to 96 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 824.38 million 
shares, compared with 850.17 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.58 to 610.46, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.05 to 777.87. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.15 to 425.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.62 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 1.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 slipped 
0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.6 percent higher.

<HEADLINE>  Putin Named As Acting Prime Minster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin fired Prime Minister  
Sergei Stepashin and the entire Cabinet today, and announced that 
the new premier is the man he'd like to see as president next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's unexpected move marked the fourth time in 17 months he  
has fired the government. Yeltsin immediately named Vladimir Putin, 
the head of the Federal Security Service, the main successor to the 
KGB, as acting prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin, 46, has spent most of his career in the country's  
security services and has little experience with political or 
economic issues. But Yeltsin, whose term expires next year, 
declared Putin would be his preferred successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced he will serve the nation well while working in  
this high post, and Russians will be able to appraise Putin's human 
and business qualities. I trust him,'' Yeltsin said in a television 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also want everyone who goes to the (presidential) polls in  
July 2000 to make their choice to trust him too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Yeltsin's backing is a mixed blessing. The president's  
approval rating has been in single digits all year, and his 
endorsement could do a candidate more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Putin declared his candidacy in his first remarks after  
being nominated for the post. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will undoubtedly run for president,'' said Putin.  
</P>
<P>
	But first parliament must approve him as prime minister. A vote  
on his candidacy must take place within a week. Yeltsin appointed 
the deputy chief of the Federal Security Service, Nikolai 
Patrushev, as acting head of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Yeltsin's critics said the president's unpredictable  
behavior made him unfit to govern. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to explain madness,'' Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy  
prime minister, told the Echo of Moscow radio station. ``The people 
have grown tired of watching an ill leader who is not capable of 
doing his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, the Clinton administration reacted cautiously,  
saying it is ready to work with Putin. ``Clearly it is within 
President Yeltsin's prerogative'' to make such a change, said David 
Leavy, a national security spokesman for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials most recently worked with Putin in resolving  
Russia's role in the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo, Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin takes over as prime minister at an extremely volatile  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's security forces are trying to suppress an uprising by  
several hundred Islamic militants who have seized several villages 
in the southern republic of Dagestan. Russian forces fired rockets 
and artillery at the rebels over the weekend, but did not dislodge 
them. More clashes were expected in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Russia's economy is still struggling following a financial  
crash last year. The changes did not augur well for Russia's 
enfeebled economy because foreign lenders are unlikely to release 
any new aid until a new government is in place. It may also hold up 
talks on rescheduling some of Russia's mammoth foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the Russian stock exchange was suspended after the  
benchmark Russian Trading System index fell 11 percent in the first 
hour of trading. It later resumed and the index rallied to 101.72, 
down 1.4 percent from Friday's close at 103.15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Constitution bars Yeltsin from a third term, and the  
Russian media has speculated that Yeltsin and his advisers are 
considering the possibility of postponing or canceling elections in 
a bid to extend his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin has vigorously denied these claims. Yeltsin signed a  
decree today that sets parliamentary elections for Dec. 19, as had 
been expected. Still, the latest upheaval adds to conjecture about 
Yeltsin's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a year, the first Russian president will transfer his  
powers to a newly elected president for the first time in 
history,'' Yeltsin said. ``You will elect your president in fair 
and honest elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin ousted Stepashin at a brief meeting early today at the  
Kremlin. Stepashin, who served for only three months, said he was 
not given any reason for his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning I visited the president, and he signed a decree  
on my resignation. He thanked me for good work -- and fired me,'' a 
somber-faced Stepashin told the Cabinet in a speech broadcast on 
Russian television. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild-mannered Stepashin, who has been staunchly loyal to  
Yeltsin, indicated he was not pleased with his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly expressed my position concerning my resignation ...  
but this is his right as the president and the 
commander-in-chief,'' Stepashin said. ``I told the president that I 
have been, am, and will remain with him until the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, 68, has suffered a series of ailments in recent years  
and usually visits the Kremlin only a couple days a week for a few 
hours at a time. He has not set clear policy goals, and the 
repeated political shake-ups have added to the sense of a 
government that is drifting without any real direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian media has speculated that members of the president's  
inner circle were pushing for Stepashin's removal in order to 
advance their own candidate -- presumably Putin. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin was a KGB officer in Germany during the Soviet era and has  
spent much of his adult life in the security services. Like 
Stepashin, he is a Yeltsin loyalist who had little political 
experience before being named to the prime minister's job. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin did not publicly criticize Stepashin during his brief  
tenure in office, but the president did not give him broad 
authority and Stepashin did not initiate any major changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``These three months haven't been wasted, we have managed to  
keep the situation in the country under control. The ruble hasn't 
plunged contrary to many predictions,'' Stepashin said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the ruble began to fall immediately upon news of his  
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his tenure, Yeltsin has frequently reshuffled his  
staff and the turnover has become even more rapid in the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	He dismissed Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in March of last  
year, then sacked his successor Sergei Kiriyenko last August and 
fired Yevgeny Primakov in May.

down 1.4 percent from Friday's close at 103.15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Constitution bars Yeltsin from a third term, and the  
Russian media has speculated that Yeltsin and his advisers are 
considering the possibility of postponing or canceling elections in 
a bid to extend his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin has vigorously denied these claims. Yeltsin signed a  
decree today that sets parliamentary elections for Dec. 19, as had 
been expected. Still, the latest upheaval adds to conjecture about 
Yeltsin's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a year, the first Russian president will transfer his  
powers to a newly elected president for the first time in 
history,'' Yeltsin said. ``You will elect your president in fair 
and honest elections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin ousted Stepashin at a brief meeting early today at the  
Kremlin. Stepashin, who served for only three months, said he was 
not given any reason for his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning I visited the president, and he signed a decree  
on my resignation. He thanked me for good work -- and fired me,'' a 
somber-faced Stepashin told the Cabinet in a speech broadcast on 
Russian television. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild-mannered Stepashin, who has been staunchly loyal to  
Yeltsin, indicated he was not pleased with his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly expressed my position concerning my resignation ...  
but this is his right as the president and the 
commander-in-chief,'' Stepashin said. ``I told the president that I 
have been, am, and will remain with him until the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, 68, has suffered a series of ailments in recent years  
and usually visits the Kremlin only a couple days a week for a few 
hours at a time. He has not set clear policy goals, and the 
repeated political shake-ups have added to the sense of a 
government that is drifting without any real direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian media has speculated that members of the president's  
inner circle were pushing for Stepashin's removal in order to 
advance their own candidate -- presumably Putin. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin was a KGB officer in Germany during the Soviet era and has  
spent much of his adult life in the security services. Like 
Stepashin, he is a Yeltsin loyalist who had little political 
experience before being named to the prime minister's job. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin did not publicly criticize Stepashin during his brief  
tenure in office, but the president did not give him broad 
authority and Stepashin did not initiate any major changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``These three months haven't been wasted, we have managed to  
keep the situation in the country under control. The ruble hasn't 
plunged contrary to many predictions,'' Stepashin said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the ruble began to fall immediately upon news of his  
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout his tenure, Yeltsin has frequently reshuffled his  
staff and the turnover has become even more rapid in the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	He dismissed Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in March of last  
year, then sacked his successor Sergei Kiriyenko last August and 
fired Yevgeny Primakov in May.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Mike Strahan, the New York Giants' all-Pro defensive end, got  
the contract extension he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Edgerrin James, Lamar King and L.J. Shelton, three of the NFL's  
unsigned first-round draft choices, continued to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan, the defensive end whose 29 sacks the past two seasons  
are the most in the NFL, signed a four-year, $32 million contract 
on Monday that could make him the NFL's highest-paid defensive 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Dallas cornerback Deion Sanders will make more than  
Strahan, averaging $10.3 million annually. To earn that, Sanders 
must play more than 70 percent of the Cowboys' defensive plays and 
he's currently sidelined after surgery on a toe that kept him out 
much of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan, who at 27 is entering his seventh season, was a  
second-round pick of the Giants in 1993. He will receive a $12 
million signing bonus and $400,000 in salary this year, $4.6 
million in 2000 and then $7 million and $8 million the last two 
years of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan was entering the final year of a contract he signed  
three years ago. He told the Giants in the offseason he wanted a 
new deal done before the end of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely happy. They made a commitment to me and I think  
we made a commitment to each other,'' Strahan said after signing 
the contract between practices at the University at Albany. ``I am 
happy to be in New York. I love New York and never wanted to go 
anywhere in the first place. So I'm glad they were able to get an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James, meanwhile, arrived in Indianapolis with his agent Leigh  
Steinberg in hopes of coming to terms with the Colts. He was the 
fourth overall draft pick and is already figured as the starter at 
running back in place of Marshall Faulk, traded to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I wasn't going to sit at home in California and  
Edgerrin wasn't going to be in Florida as training camp 
progresses,'' Steinberg said. ``I'm hoping that since we have come 
so far, we can narrow the gap and get Edgerrin into camp. Thus far, 
I view our talks as constructive and now is the time to get this 
resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Bill Polian said the two sides are not any closer  
to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young man is holding out. They haven't made any movement  
off a ridiculous number, which is $11 million to sign for five 
years,'' Polian said. ``That's not acceptable, that's not do-able 
under any circumstances. They haven't made any movement off 
voidable years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton remained a holdout with the Cardinals, who are  
threatening to pencil him out of their plans for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When and if L.J. Shelton comes in, anything we get out of him  
is a bonus,'' coach Vince Tobin said. ``We've got to get ready for 
a football season. I've been around too long to worry about 
something I don't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Shelton's absence, Matt Joyce is the No. 1 left tackle, but  
Anthony Clement, a second-year player who missed virtually all of 
last season with back surgery, has come on strong in training camp. 
Tobin said Shelton would really have to impress the coaching staff 
to get back in the mix when he finally agrees to a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're trying to make our football team, you need to be in  
camp,'' Tobin said. ``You don't get significant playing time by 
where you're drafted. You get significant playing time by what you 
do on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, a defensive end who was Seattle's No. 1 choice, got the  
same sort of message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, Lamar should be getting a little nervous,'' said  
Holmgren, the Seahawks' coach and general manager. ``He's starting 
to slip behind everybody and you can't allow that to happen with a 
young player.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	In training camp news: 	
</P>
<P>
                             *Falcons 	
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson, holding out of training  
camp in a bid for a new contract, plans to meet with the Atlanta 
Falcons on Tuesday at Furman University, coach Dan Reeves said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Reeves downplayed the possible meeting, it could signal a  
major break in the holdout that has kept Anderson off the practice 
field since training camp began July 29. The player's agent, Jim 
Sims, who also would attend any meeting, did not immediately return 
a telephone message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he is under contract for this season, Anderson accumulated  
$60,000 in fines -- $5,000 per day -- as of Monday. The running back, 
set to make $2.6 million in the final year of his current deal, has 
been seeking a new five-year contract with a signing bonus of at 
least $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, defensive end Chuck Smith returned to practice for the  
first time since spraining a toe during the first day of training 
camp on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	The promising season of Carolina Panthers rookie cornerback Tony  
Booth ended with a knee injury that will require surgery and at 
least six months of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Booth, a seventh-round draft choice who was getting rave reviews  
from coach George Seifert, injured his left knee during the team's 
morning practice. Tests showed a complete tear of both the anterior 
cruciate and medial collateral ligaments, Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was obviously doing very well. It's a disappointment, an  
extreme disappointment not to have him this season,'' Seifert said. 
``A lot of players go through these types of things and go on to 
have great careers, so that's how we basically have to look at 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting safety Mike Minter was knocked unconscious shortly  
before Booth's injury. Seifert said Minter likely would miss most 
of the exhibition season but should be ready for the Sept. 12 
regular-season opener at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back J.J. Johnson, Miami's top draft pick, is expected  
to miss up to 10 days after straining his left hamstring in a 
weekend scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the first of Miami's two second-round draft picks, said  
he heard a ``popping'' sound as he went down after catching a 
15-yard pass in Saturday's scrimmage against the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions    	
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Aaron Gibson, Detroit's first-round draft  
pick, will undergo several weeks of rehabilitation on his injured 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson, the 370-plus-pounder from Wisconsin, met with Dr. James  
Andrews, an Alabama-based orthopedist, on Monday morning and 
Andrews recommended rehabilitation, team spokesman Steve Reaven 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a ``50 percent chance to come back in and play'' this  
season, coach Bobby Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team feared Gibson, the 27th overall pick, would require  
surgery.

	Yeltsin Fires Premier, Cabinet Again  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Without offering an explanation, Yeltsin fired  
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin today and named former KGB agent 
Vladimir Putin as Russia's fifth prime minister in 18 months. 
Yeltsin praised Stepashin ``for his good work'' during his three 
months as prime minister. Yeltsin said he was choosing Putin as his 
hand-picked successor, but few believe that Putin has any chance of 
being elected president in 2000. The 68-year-old Yeltsin has been 
in ill health for much of his second term, and his erratic behavior 
has raised questions about his mental stability.

	Albright Gets Assurances From Barak  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Assured by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak  
that he intends to transfer an additional 11 percent of the West 
Bank to the Palestinian Authority, Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright announced today she would travel to the region at the 
start of September. Her twin aims are to keep Israel and the 
Palestinians on track in implementing the now-stalled Wye River 
accords and to find a formula for reopening peace talks between 
Israel and Syria after a three-year lapse. Albright talked by 
telephone over the weekend with Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Sharaa.

	Starr To Wrap Up Clinton Probe  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Independent counsel Kenneth Starr says he'll  
likely wrap up his five-year investigation of the Clintons before 
the first lady might stand for election for the Senate from New 
York in 2000. But Starr would not speculate about possible 
prosecutions of either President Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
He also didn't give a possible date for the final report on the 
probe.

	13 Die in Calif. Van Crash  
</P>
<P>
	FIVE POINTS, Calif. (AP) -- A van crowded with farm workers  
slammed into a tractor-trailer rig on a remote farming road early 
today, killing 13 people in the van. Most of the passengers in the 
van were in the back, sitting without seat belts on two benches 
that were installed along the sides, police said. California farm 
workers often are transported in overloaded vans, a problem that 
has contributed to a disproportionate traffic death rate among 
Hispanics in the area.

	Two Germans Charged With Spying  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The German Defense Ministry said today it has  
arrested two Germans accused of selling high-tech weapons secrets 
to Moscow. German lawmakers warned Russia it risks losing financial 
support from Germany over such incidents. Prosecutors said last 
month they had arrested an engineer and his alleged accomplice, a 
salesman who was about to board a plane from Hanover to Moscow with 
military files. DaimlerChrysler Aerospace confirmed that the 
52-year-old engineer, identified only as Peter S., worked at its 
guided missile systems subsidiary.

	Nagasaki Marks Bombing Anniversary  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The people of Nagasaki on Monday marked the 54th  
anniversary of the atomic bombing that killed more than 60,000 
people and led to the end of World War II. On Aug. 6, 1945, 
Hiroshima felt the blast of the world's first atomic bombing, when 
140,000 people died. Three days later, a second American A-bomb hit 
Nagasaki. Japan surrendered unconditionally six days later. The 
mayor of Nagasaki said the bombing showed the world that ``nuclear 
weapons cannot be tolerated.''

	ExciteAtHome Stock Drops on Report  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ExciteAtHome's stock was down 8 percent in  
trading today on a report that AT&AMP;T Corp. is in talks with America 
Online Inc. to allow access to AT&AMP;T's cable systems. The New York 
Times, citing executives close to the companies, reported that the 
deal could diminish the role of ExciteAtHome by eliminating its 
exclusivity deal with AT&AMP;T. However, AT&AMP;T said in a statement today 
that it will honor its current contract with ExciteAtHome. AOL has 
more than 17 million members, and operates the most popular network 
of Web sites, according to Media Metrix. ExciteAtHome operates the 
sixth most popular network of Web sites.

	Dow Is Up 1.59 Points  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices edged higher on Wall Street today as  
rising bond yields and political uncertainty in Russia kept 
investors from making many new commitments to stocks. Just before 
the close, the Dow industrials were up 1.59 to 10,715.62. Declining 
issues on the NYSE led advancers 1,759-1,221. The Nasdaq was down 
22.33 at 2,525.64.

	Giants Sign Strahan for $32M  
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two-time Pro Bowl lineman Michael Strahan  
became the NFL's second-highest-paid defensive player today, 
signing a four-year, $32 million contract with the New York Giants. 
Only Dallas cornerback Deion Sanders -- averaging $10.3 million 
annually, provided he plays more than 70 percent of the Cowboys' 
defensive plays -- will make more than Strahan. The 27-year-old 
Strahan, who has recorded 29 sacks over the past two seasons, will 
receive a $12 million signing bonus.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Private Admitted Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- An Army private accused of bludgeoning  
a soldier to death admitted he beat the victim's head with a 
baseball bat, a fellow soldier testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several soldiers have said they believed the killing was an  
anti-gay hate crime. Pfc. Barry L. Winchell, 21, was perceived as a 
homosexual by some soldiers in his unit, according to 
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, the watchdog group for gays 
in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Army nor Winchell's family will comment on his  
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's military hearing was to determine whether there was  
enough evidence to send the case against Pfc. Calvin N. Glover to a 
general court-martial. The hearing was to continue on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, 18, of Sulphur, Okla., was charged with premeditated  
murder in Winchell's killing in the hallway of Winchell's barracks 
at Fort Campbell last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Winchell and Glover served in the 502nd Infantry Regiment's 2nd  
Battalion at the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Alfred Brown testified that Winchell  
suffered massive head injuries when he was beaten with a blunt 
object after a party outside the barracks on July 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfc. Ryan Futch, who served in the unit with the three soldiers,  
guarded Glover after he was taken into custody. Futch testified 
that during that time, Glover told him he had hit Winchell several 
times with the bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Futch also said he overheard Glover make disparaging remarks  
about blacks and homosexuals to another prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfc. Arthur Hoffman, a member of Winchell's company and a good  
friend of the victim, described Glover as someone with an apparent 
drinking problem who often tried to pick fights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman testified that on July 3 Winchell had gotten the better  
of Glover during a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover was represented by Capt. Thomas Aug and Capt. Thomas  
Moshang. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a lack of preparation time, Aug and Moshang asked for a  
delay in the hearing but were rejected.

<HEADLINE> Escaped Killer Reported Seen in Maryland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIR HILL, Md. (AP) -- An escaped killer may have been waiting  
for a ride from a family member when he was spotted by two women 
who recognized him from a newspaper photo, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for Norman Johnston was focused on northeastern  
Maryland after two women spotted him leaning against a rail at an 
intersection Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Johnston, who disappeared after fleeing about 1 p.m.,  
has relatives in nearby Childs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it appears he's on foot,'' said State Police Capt.  
Henry Oleyniczak. ``It's conjecture on my part that maybe he was 
waiting for a ride. The first question that comes to my mind is why 
is he sitting on a guard rail at a major intersection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me think maybe he's waiting for somebody.''  
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was convicted in 1980 of killing four teen-agers to  
cover up a multimillion-dollar burglary ring he ran with his two 
brothers. The film ``At Close Range,'' starring Sean Penn, was 
based on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Oleyniczak said the women noticed that the man sitting on a  
guardrail resembled a picture of Johnston in a newspaper they were 
carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are looking at the picture, looking at him. One says  
'That's him!''' Oleyniczak said. ``He sees them doing the double 
take with the photograph and takes off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site was about 10 miles from an apartment complex in East  
Nottingham Township in Pennsylvania where Johnston was spotted 
Saturday night. He disappeared into the surrounding cornfields 
before police could nab him, Oleyniczak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, who turns 49 today, was spotted talking on a pay phone  
Friday night but escaped into the 600-acre Nottingham County Park 
after a scuffle with a park ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	He escaped Aug. 2 from a central Pennsylvania prison where he  
was serving a life sentence. Authorities said he opened the window 
in his cell, sneaked across a grassy yard and wriggled through a 
fence at the maximum-security complex.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains in Quiet Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose Monday, gaining against the  
Japanese yen as well as the euro in a quiet trading session. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even Russia's latest political upheaval was enough to lift  
the dollar out of its summer doldrums. Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin fired his government for the fourth time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0712, down  
from $1.0756 late Monday. The dollar also was quoted at 115.20 
Japanese yen, up from 114.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers reiterated  
the Treasury's long-standing position that a strong dollar is in 
the U.S. economy's interests. Summers made the statement in 
response to a question from reporters after giving a speech to an 
economics club in Chesterfield Township, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent weakness in the dollar against both the euro and the yen  
has ignited speculation that the Treasury might change its 
long-standing ``strong dollar policy.'' But throughout this time, 
Summers has consistently stated that the policy hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4953 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4883, and 1.5029 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5039. The British 
pound fell to $1.6064 from $1.6108. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8258 German 
marks, up from 1.8185; 6.1237 French francs, up from 6.0697; and 
1,808.32 Italian lire, up from 1,798.56.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Rodman doesn't appear to be too happy  
with his new wrestling gig. 
</P>
<P>
	The former basketball bad boy, who was let go by the Los Angeles  
Lakers, signed a one-year contract in June with World Championship 
Wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's money; that's all I'll say,'' Rodman told TV Guide in its  
August 8 issue. The tattooed athlete wondered why he had to wrestle 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanna show up,'' he told the magazine.  
</P>
<P>
	The WCW is putting Rodman in the ring with star wrestlers  
Hollywood Hogan and Sting while touring around the country for the 
next five weeks. 
</P>

ring for several pay-per-view shows in 1997 and '98.

<HEADLINE> Lions' Gibson To Undergo Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- Offensive lineman Aaron Gibson,  
Detroit's first-round draft pick, has a ``50 percent chance to come 
back in and play'' this season, coach Bobby Ross said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson will undergo several weeks of rehabilitation on his  
injured shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson, the 370-plus-pounder from Wisconsin, met with Dr. James  
Andrews, an Alabama-based orthopedist, on Monday morning and 
Andrews recommended rehabilitation, team spokesman Steve Reaven 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team feared Gibson, the 27th overall pick, would require  
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	When the period of rehabilitation ends, Gibson will return to  
meet with Andrews, Reaven said. At that time, he could be fitted 
with a harness that would allow him to play with the injured left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that it will require surgery at the end of  
the year,'' Ross said. ``But it is Dr. Andrews' feelings that Aaron 
has a 50 percent chance to come back in and play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to rehab him very hard for the next two weeks, do  
what we can do and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury has hampered Gibson since mini-camp. The Lions say  
the injury occurred before he was drafted and was not detected in 
pre-draft medical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions have refused to say how much Gibson weighs, but coach  
Bobby Ross made it known he was disappointed by how much he weighed 
at the beginning of camp. Gibson, 6-foot-4, was supposed to report 
to camp at 373 pounds. He weighed as much as 425 pounds early in 
his college career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross said Gibson could make a good right tackle, but might also  
use him at guard.

<HEADLINE>  Police Begin Duties in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hundreds of police from about a  
dozen nations have begun patrolling in Kosovo in an attempt to help 
NATO-led peacekeepers restore law and order. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some members of the international police force arrived  
in Kosovo several weeks ago, Sunday marked the completion of 
training and start of official operations for nearly 500 members of 
what will be a 3,100-strong international police force. 
</P>
<P>
	Policemen from Sweden, Germany, Bangladesh, Canada, Russia,  
Chile, Portugal, Denmark, Romania, the United States and other 
countries took up formal duties Sunday in an attempt to help the 
more than 35,000 NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo reduce daily 
killings, abductions and other violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims are most often Serbs targeted by ethnic Albanians  
seeking revenge for more than a year of savage Serb repression that 
ended in June, after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed 
to pull his troops out of the Serbian province in exchange for an 
end to the NATO bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers have been unable to stem the violence, and  
their representatives argue that as a military force, their primary 
job is not to act as police. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, the chief European  
Union envoy for Kosovo, last week said NATO should continue to have 
the main responsibility for keeping order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid the role of the international police force hasn't  
been properly thought out,'' Ahtisaari, a chief broker of the 
Kosovo peace plan, told Finnish radio. ``The idea that 3,000 police 
could maintain order ... is out of this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing violence underscored such concerns. At Kosovska  
Mitrovica, north of Pristina, ethnic Albanians hurled stones and 
taunted French peacekeepers Sunday for a second straight day to 
demand free movement across a bridge into the Serb district. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has a gun,'' French Lt. Meriadec Raffray said of the  
potential for serious violence in the town. ``Anyone who says you 
can control the guns here is a liar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armed French troops blocked the bridge over the Ibar River with  
armored vehicles as 150 young ethnic Albanian males waved 
red-and-black Albanian flags and cursed the soldiers as 
``terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one ethnic Albanian was arrested. One French soldier  
was led away dazed after a stone struck him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's incident ended without major incident and was on a  
smaller scale than a confrontation the previous day, when up to 
1,000 ethnic Albanians tried to cross the bridge. At the other 
side, hundreds of Serbs waited, taunting them with profanity. 
</P>
<P>
	French troops pushed the group back over the bridge in a series  
of scuffles. At least four ethnic Albanians were arrested Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovska Mitrovica, a mining center valued by both Serbs and  
ethnic Albanians, is divided by the river into predominantly Serb 
and ethnic Albanian communities. Since the end of the Kosovo war, 
the central bridge has become a symbol of confrontation, with Serbs 
preventing ethnic Albanians from returning to live north of the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting other tensions and violence apparently rooted in  
ethnic hatreds, NATO officials in Pristina, the provincial capital, 
said Sunday that peacekeepers in Kosovska Mitrovica observed a 
grenade and small-arms attack on a Serb residential district. The 
peacekeepers returned fire, apparently hitting one of the attackers 
and arresting another.

<HEADLINE> Expos Send Down Cabrera, Recall Blum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- When Geoff Blum got the call he's waited for all  
season, he thought it was a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wondered who was making a crank call,'' Blum said Monday  
after learning from Montreal's minor league coordinator that the 
Expos brought him up to replace injured shortstop Orlando Cabrera. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I got over that and realized it really was Don Reynolds  
calling, I was pretty excited,'' Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old infielder didn't have to wait long to see his  
first career major league action. Manager Felipe Alou put him in 
the lineup Monday night, batting eighth against the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best thing,'' said the native of Redwood City,  
Calif. ``Don't let me sit on the bench thinking about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised it took this long to get the call, but I'm  
surprised at how it happened,'' Blum said. ``It's unfortunate to 
see Orlando go down the way he did, but it's a golden opportunity 
for me and I have to take advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cabrera, who homered Friday and Saturday, sprained his left  
ankle while running the bases during the Expos' 4-2 win Sunday. The 
team expects he will be sidelined 3-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Blum was batting .265 in 268 at-bats with 10 homers and 37 RBIs  
with the Triple-A Ottawa Lynx. 
</P>
<P>
	Expos manager Felipe Alou said he didn't know much about Blum, a  
switch hitter whose minor league statistics suggest he's mainly a 
singles and doubles hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistic that jumped out at Alou was that he had only six  
stolen bases this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``So the speed thing remains the same,'' Alou said.  
</P>
<P>
	Montreal has just 48 steals this season -- tied with Oakland for  
fourth-lowest in the majors. Outfielder Manny Martinez leads the 
team with 16 and Vladimir Guerrero is second with only seven. 
Outfielder Rondell White, once a speedster, has been slowed by 
injuries and has five.

<HEADLINE> AMD Releases New Microprocessor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. renewed its  
challenge to archrival Intel Corp. by releasing a new computer 
microprocessor today that it says can outperform Intel's high-end 
chip for computers. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD claims its new Athlon chip will run faster than Intel's  
fastest Pentium III, clocking a speed of 650 megahertz compared 
with 600 megahertz for Intel. Athlon also can outperform Intel 
chips operating at the same speed, AMD says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athlon is AMD's latest attempt to use superior technology  
against its larger rival. But AMD has stumbled previously because 
of production problems. And Intel typically responds to new threats 
with big price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD said computer makers IBM and Compaq Computer Corp. have  
committed to using the chip in some of their machines and AMD said 
it's also shipping the new chip to ``dozens of leading system 
manufacturers worldwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PCs with the new chips are expected by the end of August.  
</P>
<P>
	AMD initially will offer the Athlon in a 650-megahertz version  
for $849 each wholesale, a 600-MHz Athlon for $615, and 550- and 
500-MHz versions for $449 and $249, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Those chips are likely to end up in personal computers priced  
between $1,500 and $2,500.

<HEADLINE> Bill Bradley Campaigns in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Evaluating the 2000 presidential campaign at this  
point is like playing a basketball game without a scoreboard, 
Democratic hopeful and former NBA star Bill Bradley said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a strategic plan since the beginning and we are  
checking off each step along the road,'' the former New Jersey 
senator told nearly 200 people in front of the Denver Public 
Library. ``We are raising money and recruiting volunteers, creating 
a campaign unlike any one that has come before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has surprised many campaign watchers by steadily  
amassing a sizable campaign war chest of $11 million and becoming a 
contender in the race for the Democratic nomination, once thought 
to be an easy win for Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he is committed to campaign finance reform and in  
not accepting contributions from political action committees, he is 
putting theory into practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most Americans have a profound mistrust in the political  
process, primarily because of the role money plays,'' Bradley said. 
``I have faith that my campaign will increase broader participation 
from people from all walks of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley stopped in Denver on his way to Houston to address the  
National Urban League Conference, where he plans to address 
problems that are not unique to the black community. He stressed 
what he has made a key campaign theme: racial unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain issues like childhood poverty, health care  
and the problems facing working families, where race can sometimes 
get in the way. But race has always been at the core of who I am,'' 
he said. ``When Ronald Reagan was president, it was well known that 
if you wanted to please the boss, you had to figure out ways to cut 
taxes, increase defense spending and reduce regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	'' With me as president, if you want to please the boss, you  
will have to figure out ways to make tolerance and racial unity a 
common-sense notion.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Gov. Warns About 2000 Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- California Gov. Gray Davis said Monday his  
fellow Democrats -- most notably Vice President Al Gore -- won't have 
an easy time winning the nation's largest state in the 2000 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake, California is in play,'' Davis said in an  
interview between meetings at the National Governors' Association 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The assessment underscores the tough road ahead for Gore,  
current front-runner for the Democratic nomination. President 
Clinton breezed to California victories in 1992 and 1996, allowing 
him to devote attention to battleground states elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategists looking ahead to the general election  
believe the GOP presidential nominee could do grave damage to the 
Democratic candidate by making California and New York competitive. 
Democrats traditionally need to win those two states to claim the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not taking anything for granted,'' said Gore spokesman  
Roger Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know campaigns are contests just by their definition and no  
one expects nor wants a coronation -- for any candidate. So our plan 
is and always has been to work very hard in each of the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The front-running GOP campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush  
urged New York Gov. George Pataki to avoid a bitter Senate primary 
in 2000 and ensure a united front for the presidential election. 
Pataki endorsed Rudolph Guiliani in the Senate race, despite a 
longtime feud with the New York mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, Davis won his 1998 election by 20 percentage  
points, but thinks the presidential race there will be tight. But 
he said Gore's experience and political philosophy give him the 
edge over Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is not the time to pop the champagne corks,'' he said.  
``I've told everyone who's asked that we have our work cut out to 
help carry California for Al Gore. I am convinced we can do it, but 
it will require very serious effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is backing Gore over his sole rival, former Democratic  
Sen. Bill Bradley, for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said the California Republican Party is not as weak as his  
lopsided 1998 victory would suggest. He also said Gore will not be 
as strong a candidate as Clinton was in California, because none of 
the current crop of politicians is a match for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who has raised more money than Gore in California this  
year, intends to be competitive in the state, said Bradley 
spokesman Eric Hauser. 
</P>
<P>
	``November 2000 is a long ways away,'' said Hauser. But with  
Bradley having spent nine days in California already this summer, 
``we think we're starting to build some support out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he expected Gore to beat Bradley decisively in the  
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is also focusing on the vote-rich state, preparing for the  
GOP primary and laying the groundwork for a tight race against Gore 
or Bradley if he wins the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made a three-day trip to California in June and will return  
in September. He raised $4.2 million in California by the mid-July 
reporting period, collecting more than expected from the computer 
industry -- a business sector Gore had expected to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush plans to campaign hard in California and plans  
to be there a lot,'' said his spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. ``He is not 
taking any vote for granted and will not cede any votes to another 
candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Clinton won California with 46 percent of the vote.  
President Bush received 33 percent and Ross Perot had 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Clinton received 51 percent of the vote, compared to 38  
percent for Republican Bob Dole and 7 percent for Perot.

	In return, NBC, the broadcasting unit of General Electric, and  
Snap.com would acquire an equity stake in Net2Phone, with NBC 
gaining the right to nominate a board member to Net2Phone's board 
of directors. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Net2Phone's stock jumped by nearly a third on the news, climbing  
$5.34 3/8 to $21.84 3/8 in early trading today on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hackensack, N.J.-based company claims 30 percent of the  
Internet phone service worldwide, with 250,000 customers. While it 
has had some quarters of profitability, it has yet to turn an 
annual profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was founded in 1997 as a subsidiary of IDT Corp., a  
long-distance carrier which still owns two-thirds of the business. 
Net2Phone successfully raised $81 million in an initial public 
offering of stock on July 29. After an initial surge, the stock has 
drifted lower, toward the initial offer price. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the service to place long-distance calls requires the  
Net2Phone caller to have a computer with speakers and a microphone 
and the company's free software available at its Web site. The 
recipient does not need a computer and can pick up the call on 
their regular phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	Net2Phone charges under 5 cents a minute for domestic calls  
anywhere in the United States. Calls from the United States to 
Argentina or Japan would be 42 cents and 17 cents a minute, 
respectively, according to rates posted on the company's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Snap.com, a joint venture between NBC and online media company  
CNET, is slated to be merged with NBC.com and other properties 
later this year to form NBC Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement with Net2Phone will powerfully bridge NBC's  
Internet properties with the most ubiquitous consumer technology in 
the history of the world -- the telephone,'' said Martin J. 
Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive Media.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Woman Allowed Off Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A federal judge has overturned the death  
penalty for a 78-year-old woman believed to be the nation's oldest 
woman awaiting execution. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ortrie D. Smith on Friday said Faye Copeland  
should be allowed off death row, said her attorney, Kent Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith let stand her convictions for the murders of five  
transients. Barring appeal, Mrs. Copeland will remain in prison for 
the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were killed in an ongoing livestock swindle that  
involved her husband, Ray. Authorities said in the late 1980s the 
couple would hire transients as farmhands, get them involved in 
buying cattle with hot checks, then kill them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Copeland was also convicted and sentenced to death. He died  
in 1993 at age 78 while awaiting execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Copeland claimed she was an innocent bystander who was a  
victim of battered woman's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson filed the appeal because the jury that convicted Mrs.  
Copeland was not allowed to hear evidence of battered woman's 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson said he was happy that the threat of execution was  
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is, she is a 78-year-old woman who is  
probably enjoying a better quality of life than what she had,'' 
Gibson said. ``She works in the greenhouse at the prison every day. 
She wouldn't hurt a fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came on Mrs. Copeland's 78th birthday,

<HEADLINE>  Boggs' 3,000th Caps Historic Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs was still glowing.  
</P>
<P>
	The newest member of the 3,000-hit club strolled into the Tampa  
Bay Devil Rays clubhouse Sunday morning, eager to get on with the 
rest of a career he has no plans to end soon. 
</P>
<P>
	He's 41 and no longer contending for batting titles, however the  
home run he hit Saturday night for his greatest individual 
accomplishment raised his average to .297. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs doubled for No. 3,001 in his only at-bat Sunday before  
taking the rest of the day off against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said 3,000 hits is not a termination point in my  
career,'' he said, adding that he hasn't given a lot of thought to 
how much longer he'd like to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have to rip the shirt off of me. If I'm  
hitting .300 and still performing, and the game's still fun, I'll 
continue to play if they'll have me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The historic hit, on a 2-2 pitch from Chris Haney in the sixth  
inning of a 15-10 loss to the Indians, capped a remarkable 
three-day run of baseball history. And it was perhaps fitting that 
hit No. 3,000 was a home run, only the second of the season for 
Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire began the three-day stretch Thursday night in St.  
Louis by becoming only the 16th player to hit 500 career home runs. 
McGwire, who set the single-season mark of 70 last year, added No. 
501 later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, Tony Gwynn, who broke into the major leagues three  
months after Boggs, got his 3,000th hit, lining a single in the 
first inning in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Saturday and Boggs.  
</P>
<P>
	``Three milestones in three nights, that's pretty amazing,''  
Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	In baseball history, the closest two hitters have reached such  
milestones was in 1970 when Ernie Banks slugged his 500th home run 
on May 12 and Hank Aaron got his 3,000th hit five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, Eddie Collins got his 3,000th hit 17 days after Tris  
Speaker had passed the milestone, until now the closest two players 
had reached that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken could become the third player to reach 3,000 this  
season. The Baltimore star, currently on the disabled list, needs 
32 hits to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	And, just as McGwire added homer No. 501 before his game ended,  
Gwynn used his 3,000th hit as the beginning of another multi-hit 
contest. The San Diego right fielder collected four hits and left 
the game in the eighth inning with a career total of 3,003. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's big home run came against the Padres. And before Gwynn  
left St. Louis, McGwire made sure to collect a souvenir for his 
son, Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Gwynn and I swapped jerseys,'' he said. ``I don't get  
anything for myself. I do everything for Matt. So I had him sign 
it, `To Matt.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs put a special stamp on his moment, too, becoming the first  
player to homer for No. 3,000. He capped an emotional trip around 
the bases by getting down on his knees and kissing home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people got caught up in the moment as Boggs stood in  
for the big at-bat. While the fans gave him a huge ovation, the 
public-address announcer forgot to call Boggs' name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had always said this is not a race. That if it was a race,  
then it would have meant something more special,'' Boggs said, 
alluding to the attention he and Gwynn received pursuing the 
milestone at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now to do something no one else has ever done, that's  
special. If I had just gotten a little bloop hit or something like 
that, I would have just been Wade Boggs, the singles hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs spent the first 11 seasons of his career with the Boston  
Red Sox and the next five with the New York Yankees. The 
opportunity to chase 3,000 before family and lifelong friends is 
one of the reasons he signed with the expansion Devil Rays last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropicana Field is about 20 miles from where he grew up and  
played Little League ball in Tampa, and the crowd of 39,512 that 
witnessed history included his father, wife and 12-year-old son, 
Brett. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs said the moment was more than the realization of a dream.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a thousand times more. You couldn't imagine. When  
you're running around the bases, you're not even touching the 
ground. You're just floating around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell you the truth, I thought I was going to sit down there  
and start crying like a baby. I shed a couple of tears when I 
hugged my father, but I was happy more than anything ... It was 
just a fantastic moment. It really was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs went home to celebrate and watch highlights of the game  
with 50 to 60 close friends and family members. Tampa mayor Dick 
Greco, a neighbor, showed up at 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had tickets for (Sunday),'' Boggs said. ``I said: `Sorry,  
mayor. I did it last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-time All-Star walked into the clubhouse seven hours  
later, carrying a bat and a new pair of shoes to replace the ones 
he used on the most memorable night of an 18-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a blast. Just the amount of adrenaline that's still  
in my body. I couldn't wait to wake up this morning and come to the 
ball park,'' Boggs said, conceding a tremendous burden had been 
lifted off his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	A superstitious person who joked that he may now change a  
well-known pregame routine that includes a meal with chicken, Boggs 
had worried that an injury or accident might prevent him from 
reaching 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He kept thinking about Roberto Clemente, who reached the  
milestone on the last day of the 1972 season and died in a plane 
crash that winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you get there,'' Boggs said, ``until you really seize  
the moment, everything is a panic attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays hold an option on his contract for 2000 and have  
yet to talk to him about next year. One thing Boggs knows is he's 
not ready to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got some great names to pass,'' he said. ``You look at  
the list and it's phenomenal. They are some of the greatest players 
to ever play this game, and I'm so fortunate to be in the same 
breath with those guys.''

<HEADLINE> Custodian's Family Gets $6 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- The estate and family of a school janitor  
who died from a cancer linked to asbestos was awarded $6 million 
from two companies whose construction materials contained the 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricio Sanchez Jr. sued the U.S. Gypsum Co. and National  
Gypsum Co. in 1996, about 18 months before he died at age 60 of 
mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the chest that has been 
linked to exposure to asbestos fibers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez spent 31 years as a janitor with the El Paso Independent  
School District. 
</P>
<P>
	He alleged that he was exposed to the companies' joint-finishing  
compounds that contained asbestos during construction and 
renovation work. 
</P>
<P>
	A county jury on Aug. 4 ordered the companies to pay $6,050,000  
in compensatory. The parties reached a settlement before the 
punitive damages phase of the trial; terms of the settlement were 
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very ill and he went through a lot of pain and we  
shared in that pain,'' said Sanchez' 33-year-old son, Pat Sanchez. 
``To us, the verdict gave us a sense of justice and holding someone 
accountable for what happened to my father. My dad's cancer could 
have been avoided completely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez' claims against four other companies -- Owens-Corning  
Fiberglas Corp., Synkoloid, Kelly-Moore Paint Co. and W.R. Grace 
Co. -- were settled during an earlier trial, said Stan Ferguson, 
associate general counsel for U.S. Gypsum, now known as USG Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson would not comment on the award.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials at National Gypsum, now known as Asbestos Claims  
Management Corp., could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Authors Cleared in Casino Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Two author brothers whose fondness for  
high-stakes blackjack landed them in a stranger-than-fiction 
criminal case have a happy conclusion to their two-year ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mississippi judge has dismissed charges against Frederick and  
Steven Barthelme, writers who admit they may have been compulsive 
gamblers but deny that they cheated casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors now say the blackjack dealer charged with trying to  
signal the Barthelmes during their gambling sprees in 1996 
apparently was also flashing signs randomly at other patrons at the 
Grand Casino in Gulfport. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers had faced up to two years in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Frederick, 55, said Monday he and his brother lost $10,000 on  
the night they were accused of cheating and were shocked when they 
were rousted the next morning at the casino and ordered to leave. 
He said the experience was ``remarkable and a little bit 
terrifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really quite silly if you sit back and look at the  
whole thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barthelmes, who were cleared of criminal charges last week  
but may still have to testify against the dealer, have written a 
book about their gambling and the criminal case. ``Double Down'' is 
expected to be released in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an education -- a scary education,'' said Steven, 52,  
who like his brother teaches English at the University of Southern 
Mississippi in Hattiesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Their arrest in 1997 came not long after the release of  
Frederick Barthelme's novel ``Bob the Gambler,'' about an architect 
with a gambling problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Holleman, the brothers' attorney, said their only mistake  
was sitting for a long time at a high-stakes table where the dealer 
was behaving erratically. ``They were at the wrong place at the 
wrong time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge dismissed the charges at the request of prosecutors  
after a Nevada gambling expert hired by the state examined casino 
surveillance tapes and found no proof the brothers cheated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barthelmes admit losing more than a quarter of a million  
dollars over two years at casinos, which became legal in 
Mississippi in 1992. Frederick said their heavy gambling, with 
inherited money, began after the deaths of their parents in 1995 
and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just started gambling like crazy, stupidly, but we did  
it,'' he said. ``The book covers the whole thing, including the 
deaths of our parents and the gambling -- sort of a thoughtful 
inquiry in the sort of problems of gambling and the loss of money, 
the loss of family.''

<HEADLINE> GM: Air Bag Failure Not a Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. is arguing it should not  
have to recall about 279,000 sport utility vehicles because the 
company failed a government air bag test. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration to disregard the test because the company believes 
the test failure is not related to the vehicles' safety. Agency 
officials are reviewing GM's request and are expected to make a 
decision in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Five consumer groups say GM should recall the vehicles because  
the air bags deflate too quickly in head-on collisions, allowing 
neck injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are the passenger-side air bags on 279,132 Chevrolet  
Tahoes and GMC Yukons built between Sept. 1, 1998, and May 5, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe failed a government test of  
the vehicle's passenger air bag, registering a higher possibility 
of serious neck injury on the test dummy than allowed by federal 
regulation. Many of the 1999 Tahoes and Yukons have the same air 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
	In the test, the head of the unbelted dummy went through the bag  
and hit the frame of the windshield, then snapped back. GM exceeded 
the amount of extension allowed on the dummy's neck in the test by 
about 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Since May, GM has installed air bags with smaller vent holes in  
the vehicles to prevent the bags from deflating too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said Monday that the company wants  
the highway safety agency to disregard the test because ``it is 
inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company's petition argues that very few people, if any,  
would be at risk of a serious neck injury in a crash if the 
vehicles are not recalled. GM also contends the neck injury 
criteria for the test is too strict, allowing for less than a 1 
percent chance of a serious neck injury for an unbelted passenger 
in a head-on crash. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company had a hand in developing the test before  
the agency agreed to the new air bag test in 1997 because 
automakers said they needed it to make air bags that deployed less 
forcefully. At the time, GM and other automakers strongly supported 
adoption of the new test. 
</P>
<P>
	GM ``is bluntly asking the agency not to enforce the very  
standard that GM and others... advocated NHTSA to adopt only a very 
short time ago,'' four consumer groups complained in an Aug. 2 
letter to the agency. The groups were Center for Auto Safety, 
Consumers Union, Public Citizen and Parents for Safer Air Bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, argued in  
a separate letter last month that a recall was necessary because 
``a critical and potentially lethal safety problem'' must be fixed. 
Advocates argued GM had a readily available solution with the new 
bags with smaller vent holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer groups said the agency must pay careful attention  
to indications of neck injuries because in many cases of deaths 
attributed to air bags the victim's neck was snapped back. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflating air bags have been blamed for 141 deaths since 1990 --  
mostly to child passengers or short female drivers in low-speed 
accidents they otherwise should have survived, according to the 
NHTSA.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Blasts House Over AmeriCorps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today criticized House  
lawmakers for trying to kill one of his administration's pet 
projects -- the AmeriCorps volunteer service program -- and vowed to 
veto any bill that would eliminate its funding. 
</P>
<P>
	In an address to AmeriCorps graduates, Clinton chastised  
Republican lawmakers for being shortsighted in seeking to curtail 
the program that has helped build homes and teach students to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still some who are determined to zero out funding  
for AmeriCorps. In other words, ideological argument in the face of 
all the evidence of all the good you've done,'' Clinton told a 
group of families and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the House Appropriations Committee voted to cut all  
funds for the program in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they zero out the funding, their bill has zero chance of  
becoming law, because I will veto it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the attempt to eliminate the program is further  
evidence that the tax-cut bill recently passed by Congress goes too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason that you have people up there trying to zero  
AmeriCorps is they know they can't pay for their tax cut without 
big cuts,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He used the event to again assert that the surplus should be  
used first to secure the future of Social Security and Medicare and 
added that the bill could force cuts in education and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The AmeriCorps program enlists ordinary citizens for community  
service projects nationwide. Young adults get college tuition 
assistance in return. Since AmeriCorps was established four years 
ago, more than 100,000 people have volunteered to work at schools, 
churches and nonprofit groups.

<HEADLINE> Instant Messaging Has Big Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Why would two respectable businesses repeatedly  
snipe over something they give away, brings in little or no 
revenue, and got its start as a tool for idle gossip? 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to instant messaging services, Microsoft Corp. and  
America Online Inc. believe they have sound reasons to duke it out. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are so persistent because instant messaging offers  
an important new way for providers of online access to broaden 
their array of features and differentiate themselves from 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other aspects, instant messaging can help lure Internet  
users to other online services, such as e-mail and Web news and 
entertainment, where they are more likely to read ads and buy goods 
and services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that they would make money off of instant  
messaging,'' said Emily Meehan, an analyst with The Yankee Group 
research firm, based in Boston. ``It's sort of the entrance point 
for the consumer into a window of content and Internet 
properties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instant messaging offers Internet users the ability to exchange  
notes that immediately pop up on the recipient's computer screen. 
In the past three weeks, AOL, which has the dominant service by 
far, has repeatedly counterattacked Microsoft's attempt to 
establish a new rival -- in part by blocking users of the Microsoft 
service from exchanging messages with AOL's 43 million users. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL intensified its efforts Monday to dominate the market by  
creating an alliance with Internet service provider Juno to enable 
its users easy access to AOL's Instant Messenger service -- AOL's 
third such deal within a week. As with similar AOL agreements on 
Friday with Internet providers MindSpring and Earthlink, users will 
be able to sign up for the service immediately upon going online, 
instead of clicking their way to AOL's site. 
</P>
<P>
	And Microsoft officials said Monday that AOL once again blocked  
its effort to try to allow its users to exchange messages with 
AOL's users. AOL has repeatedly claimed that Microsoft is trying to 
hack its way into its computer system and, citing privacy concerns, 
has built a digital firewall to keep MSN users out. An AOL 
spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL and Microsoft both believe they have tapped a fast-growing  
Internet arena that will become as essential to users as e-mail, 
the older cousin to instant messaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, though technically the upstart after launching its  
service just three weeks ago, has big plans for its messaging 
service. It's signed up 700,000 users as of the end of last month, 
when Microsoft last gave out figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the medium started as a tool for teen-agers and an  
instant way to reach family and friends, Microsoft envisions it as 
an essential business communications tool. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a user of Microsoft's service might be able to use  
a mobile phone to instantly see important online information, such 
as ``flashed'' details on a canceled flight while driving to the 
airport, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've seen over the last several years is a lot of high  
schoolers gossiping and an instant way to reach family and 
friends,'' said MSN lead product manager Deanna Sanford. ``But I 
think there is an even more important part of communications moving 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rhetoric, AOL is expected eventually to open up its  
Instant Messenging service to MSN's system, allowing Microsoft's 
users to exchange messages with AOL's. That's because AOL and 
Microsoft share a common goal: Signing up as many users as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value of a communications utility goes up the more people  
who are using it,'' said David Card, an analyst with the Jupiter 
Communications research firm. ``That's one reason why I feel (AOL) 
will support an open communications standard.''

<HEADLINE> Maine Town Not As Steamy As On TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARMONY, Maine (AP) -- The coast may be a great place for lovers,  
but don't go there in search of ``Passions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fictional Harmony featured in NBC's steamy new soap opera is  
actually composed of shots made in the picturesque Maine seaside 
towns of Camden, Belfast and Rockland. Otherwise, the soap, which 
premiered a month ago, is taped in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Harmony is about 120 miles from the ocean, nestled in  
woods between Moosehead Taxidermy and Lumberjack Lodges. 
</P>
<P>
	And life in the community in the central Maine woods is a lot  
different from the TV show that dwells on four turbulent, 
over-the-top families. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people just drink beer, drive through the woods and  
go fishing. That's Harmony life,'' Matthew Vautier, 21, said while 
sitting with friends in one of the booths at the C &AMP; R General 
Store. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, the real Harmony has no fish cannery, no  
sprawling mansions, no newspapers, no tycoons, no cafes, no 
hospital, no police officers and no blacks or Hispanics. Nor does 
it have a mysterious evil presence or levitating Ouija boards, 
elements of a soap opera which NBC spokesman Michael Feeney 
describes as ``'Peyton Place' meets the 'X-Files''' -- that is, sex, 
duplicity and a touch of the occult. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first week, ``Passions'' sparked a passionate public  
outcry after a plot line propelled Sheridan Crane, the socialite 
daughter from the town's most moneyed family, into a car crash in 
the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died nearly two years 
ago. Even dicier, Diana was referred to as Sheridan's friend. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC said it meant no offense.  
</P>
<P>
	Many real-Harmony residents can't get NBC without a satellite  
dish (it airs at 2 p.m. EDT in most markets), so they can't tune in 
to glimpse their sordid twin city. 
</P>
<P>
	If they did, they would see a hip town with a cast of beautiful  
young people who speak without Maine accents and sport the latest 
big-city fashions. The typical wardrobe in the real Harmony is 
jeans, T-shirts, flannels and work boots befitting its 
working-class roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have rich people like that,'' said Carolyn Leone, 17,  
who joined Vautier at his booth at C &AMP; R's. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not our town, but we wish it was,'' added Joe Dorson, 22.  
</P>
<P>
	What the real Harmony lacks in urban chic is made up for with  
rural character. The town has miles of woods and fields, a post 
office, volunteer fire department, elementary school, public park, 
two general stores, a town office and a couple of garages. The 
Grange doubles as a Bingo hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Harmony's 850 people are farmers, loggers or garage  
mechanics. The biggest employers are the Bartlett Yarn Production 
House, with 26 workers, and Creative Apparel, whose 100 workers 
make military fatigues. Others work in shoe factories in nearby 
Dexter and Guilford, where Harmony people send their kids to high 
school and to do their shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say small-town life sometimes mirrors a soap opera, but  
even the raunchiest gossip in Harmony doesn't come close to that of 
its TV namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	The plots revolve around the four families but focus largely on  
the teens, with some supernatural mayhem thrown in by Tabitha the 
sorceress and her companion Timmy, a doll she brought to life. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the spooky pair plotted to keep twin sisters from  
finding one another and tried to drown the daughter of one them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Sennett, a cattle farmer and yarn house worker, was not  
happy to learn her birthplace is being depicted as coastal -- 
``There's too many tourists on the coast'' -- but also hopes people 
are watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the town could use some livening up,'' she quipped.  
``Maybe this will do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Passions'' isn't Harmony's first brush with Hollywood. Many  
proudly point out that Stephen King's ``Graveyard Shift'' was 
filmed at the yarn house. 
</P>
<P>
	Creator James E. Reilly set ``Passions'' in Maine because of its  
rich history. But ``Maine'' is never mentioned on the show. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Harmony lives up to its name, according to Debbie  
LaBree, 46, owner of the country store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harmony is an economically depressed town, but you couldn't  
find kinder people,'' she said as she carved meat for her deli 
counter recently. 
</P>
<P>
	But just because it isn't as scenic or glitzy as its television  
counterpart doesn't mean Harmony is without its charms and 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a little bit of passion in any community,''  
LaBree said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	HARD ROCK: ``Hard Rock Live,'' which started life as a TV series  
showing musicians in concert, is expanding into actual live 
performances. The restaurant and American Express are sponsoring a 
concert tour by Atlantic artist Beth Hart, through Atlanta, Boston, 
Chicago, New York and elsewhere. The tour benefits VH1's Save the 
Music Foundation, which boosts music programs in schools through 
donated instruments or money.

<HEADLINE> IMF Reconsidering Debt Relief Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund is  
reconsidering plans to sell some of its gold reserves to help 
finance a Western debt-relief plan for some of the world's most 
debt-burdened countries, a top IMF official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices have plunged to 20-year lows on the prospect of a  
global gold selloff, which was hastened by the Bank of England's 
auction of 3.5 percent of its reserves last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's loss of luster has triggered bankruptcies, layoffs and  
street protests in South Africa, the world's biggest producer of 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying very hard to see if there is an alternative to  
selling gold,'' said Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy 
managing director, who was visiting South Africa for the 
inauguration of Tito Mboweni as the country's first black central 
bank governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer's remarks, reported by Dow Jones Newswires, were the  
first official comment from the IMF since as criticism of the 
proposed sale began mounting three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition by South Africa and by other gold-producing countries  
to the IMF plan to sell up to 10 million ounces of its 100 
million-ounce reserves has ``caused us to look for another 
solution,'' Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa has one of the highest average costs of production,  
at $246 per ounce. On Monday, gold for current delivery closed at 
$257.50 a troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a gain of 
40 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold peaked at $875 a troy ounce in New York in January 1980.  
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of miners in South Africa stand to lose their  
jobs if gold prices continue sliding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We listened very carefully to what South Africa has said'' on  
the issue, Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer said no obvious alternative to the IMF's gold sales has  
been put in place, and any other financing proposal would likely be 
``complex''.

<HEADLINE> Boston Coll. Gets $5M Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- A benefactor has given Boston College $5  
million for student spiritual retreats and volunteer programs. 
</P>
<P>
	John McNeice Jr. is a 1954 graduate of the Jesuit university who  
made his fortune by building an investment firm. He said Monday he 
sees his gift as a way for young people to be ``men and women for 
others'' -- not self-absorbed college students. 
</P>
<P>
	The donation ``completes their education, not only their  
academic training, but their spiritual training as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The John and Margarete McNeice Student Formation Fund will help  
pay for the university's volunteer and student retreat programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Each spring break, for example, some 450 BC students head to  
impoverished Appalachian communities to volunteer. Another 800 
students participate in a program that combines academic work with 
service in Boston-area hospitals, shelters and prisons. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Medinah Braces for PGA Championship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- It's time to get reacquainted with Medinah  
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Couples, who until Monday had not walked amongst the 4,161  
trees since the second round of the 1990 U.S. Open, was ambling 
along during a practice round when he hit a 4-iron into the 17th 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	Only later did he recall hitting a 7-iron on the same par-3 hole  
nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I did notice the difference. It's a lot farther back,''  
he said. ``There's a little yardage on everything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 81st PGA Championship brings the world's best players to  
Medinah for the first time since Hale Irwin made that mile-long 
birdie putt on the 72nd hole of the 1990 Open, then went 19 holes 
the next day to beat Mike Donald in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	So much has changed.  
</P>
<P>
	Irwin is now 54 and making a killing on the Senior PGA Tour.  
Donald is now 44 and trying to make a living on any tour. Only 43 
players in this weekend's field played in that U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	And Medinah is a lot longer than it used to be -- from 7,195  
yards in 1990 to 7,401 yards for the PGA Championship, the longest 
course in a major tournament since Columbine Country Club measured 
7,436 yards in the thin air outside Denver for the 1967 PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long course,'' said John Huston, who tied for 14th in  
the '90 Open. ``I don't see it as incredibly long, although only 
one par-5 is reachable. There's nothing real goofy about it. It's 
real fair, and the fairways are pretty generous for a major.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval played Medinah as an 18-year-old amateur and tied  
for 56th in the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pure,'' he said Monday before heading out to the practice  
green. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only complaint were the greens, which took a beating  
from record heat in the Chicago area over the past few weeks and 
could be a real sore spot when the weekend rolls around. Some 
already were brown in spots, not a good sign as early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greens aren't what they would like,'' Couples said.  
</P>
<P>
	Couples played his practice round early Monday, with only eight  
players in front of him, and noticed some bumpy rolls. Couples 
could only imagine what might happen late in the first and second 
rounds when more than 100 players have trampled across such 
vulnerable greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're going to be pretty ragged,'' he said. ``But  
I'm saying that loosely. It's not like we're going to be putting on 
dirt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples wasn't alone in his concern over the greens. And by the  
end of the week, there could be another source of controversy -- the 
17th, which has always been somewhat of a lightning rod at Medinah. 
</P>
<P>
	The par-3 was only 168 yards in 1990, but the green sloped  
severely from the back to the front, right toward Lake Kadijah. 
Anything short could suck back into the water. Anything long into 
the back bunker produced a shot just as frightening as No. 12 at 
Augusta National. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, some players complained then that Nos. 2, 13 and 17 all  
looked the same, perhaps because all of them cross water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I remember from the U.S. Open was three of the four  
par-3s were very similar,'' Jeff Sluman said. ``Everybody thought 
that, and I guess they fixed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th is now 206 yards, with the green pushed far back from  
Lake Kadijah with severe undulation, as opposed to the predominant 
tiered greens of Medinah. 
</P>
<P>
	Huston, for one, liked the change.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's better than it was, but it's still a hard hole,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Count Paul Azinger among the critics.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame,'' said the 1993 PGA champion. ``It was a great  
hole before, an impact hole -- a little severe, but fair. You 
thought about that hole all day. The old hole was a little bit 
shorter, but a lot scarier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't get me wrong -- it's still a hard hole,'' he said. ``But  
there was a bit of drama before. If you had a one- or two-shot 
lead, you had to get it over that water, and you were thinking 
about that. I don't like anything about it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have three days to get used to it, just like the rest of  
the field will have time to figure out Medinah, or search for 
recollections of a U.S. Open nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 *DIVOTS:* Despite the withdrawal of Jumbo Ozaki, the PGA  
Championship has 94 of the top 100 players in the world rankings, 
giving it the strongest field for a major this year. Ozaki was 
replaced by Craig Stadler, who also is in the top 100. ... Ryder 
Cup captain Ben Crenshaw has scheduled a meeting with his 
prospective team on Tuesday. The subject of money -- and whether 
players should be talking about it -- figures to be a top issue. ... 
While John Daly has missed other majors during his ongoing battle 
with alcoholism, this is the first PGA Championship he has missed 
since his stunning victory at Crooked Stick in 1991. According to 
Callaway tour rep Mike Galeski, Daly told him last week his game 
simply wasn't ready. Daly was replaced by Mike Reid, whose 
bogey-double bogey-par finish cost him the 1989 PGA Championship at 
nearby Kemper Lakes.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens Sign Two More Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The Montreal Canadiens signed goaltender  
Frederic Chabot and defenseman Craig Rivet on Monday, and also 
confirmed the signings of Barry Richter, Scott Lachance and Dainius 
Zubrus. 
</P>
<P>
	Chabot agreed to a two-year deal, while Rivet signed a one-year  
contract worth $660,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivet, who played the last five seasons with the Canadiens, had  
two goals and eight assists in 66 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Chabot, who was claimed by Montreal in the 1998 NHL waiver  
draft, played in 11 games last season, posting a 2.23 goals against 
average and a .915 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadiens confirmed the other signings, which were reported  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Richter, a 28-year-old free agent defenseman, signed a two-year  
contract. He played in 72 games with the New York Islanders last 
season, finishing with six goals and 18 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Lachance, a defenseman, and Zubrus, a right wing, both re-signed  
with the Canadiens. Lachance, who will make $1.21 million next 
season, had two goals and nine assists in 76 games, while Zubrus, 
who will make $660,000, had six goals and 10 assists in 80 games.

<HEADLINE> EMC To Acquire Rival Data General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOPKINTON, Mass. (AP) -- EMC Corp., the No. 1 maker of storage  
systems for big business computers, will buy rival Data General 
Corp. in stock deal worth nearly $1 billion that will help EMC 
expand its range of technology products. 
</P>
<P>
	EMC makes memory disks and storage software for mainframe  
computers used by large companies to process massive quantities of 
information. Data General specializes in storage systems for 
``server'' computers that run networks of smaller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition delivers on our long stated objective of  
constantly expanding our market opportunities,'' EMC chief 
executive Michael Ruettgers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	EMC said Monday it will issue 0.3262 of a share of EMC common  
stock for each share of Data General common stock. The transaction 
is worth about $950 million based on EMC's stock price of $57, 
which was down 5 percent, or $3 a share in trading Monday on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Data General stock was up 32 percent, or $4.25 a share at  
$17.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	EMC previously had no presence in the fast-growing midrange  
storage market, valued at $10 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Data General's server business will operate as a separate unit  
of EMC after the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition accelerates EMC's progress toward a goal of $10  
billion in revenues by 2001. Last year, EMC reported about $4 
billion in revenues, while Data General reported $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Westboro-based Data General, founded in 1968, has a  
workforce of about 5,000. EMC employs 11,200 worldwide. An EMC 
spokesman did not say if any jobs would be lost in the acquisition.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Injury List Starting To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The strain of training camp showed  
Monday as several Tennessee Titans players sat out practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Frank Wycheck watched both practices from the  
sidelines with a strained hamstring, while defensive end Kenny 
Holmes rested with tendinitis in his knee. Tight end Tony Church 
wore a brace on his left hand for possible ligament damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Bruce Matthews and defensive lineman Mike Jones sat out  
the second practice for some rest. 
</P>
<P>
	But running back Rodney Thomas ran for the first time since  
having arthroscopic surgery on his ankle a week ago. Coach Jeff 
Fisher said the team hopes Thomas will be able to carry the ball a 
few times Sunday night in the Titans' exhibition opener at Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Pratt Lyons, injured in a car accident last week,  
watched practice wearing the halo that doctors placed around his 
head to stabilize his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons broke a bone in his neck last week when his car skidded  
off the road and into trees, throwing him through the windshield. 
Doctors said Lyons, not expected to play this season, was fortunate 
to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
	He is on blood thinners to avoid clotting, while doctors wait to  
see if he needs surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	He rode a cart on the field and stayed with his linemates after  
practice as they worked with tackling dummies. He talked briefly 
with reporters and thanked people for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a tough guy,'' tackle Jason Fisk said. ``I went to see  
him a couple days after, and he was sitting up and trying to move 
his bed around so people could fit in his room.''

<HEADLINE> NBC, Snap.com Link With Net2Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is taking an equity stake in Net2Phone Inc.,  
a company that provides telephone service over the Internet, in 
exchange for prominent placement of links on the network's top Web 
sites, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal announcement of the deal was expected today.  
</P>
<P>
	According to an announcement obtained Sunday by the AP, NBC will  
prominently link and market the company's Internet telephone 
services on the NBC.com, Snap.com and NBC Interactive Neighborhood 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to those sites will be able to search phone listings  
and have Net2Phone's service dial the listing automatically. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement with Net2Phone will powerfully bridge NBC's  
Internet properties with the most ubiquitous consumer technology in 
the history of the world -- the telephone,'' Martin J. Yudkovitz, 
president of NBC Interactive Media, said in the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	NBC, the broadcasting unit of General Electric, and Snap.com, a  
joint venture between NBC and online media company CNET, would 
acquire an equity stake in Net2Phone, with NBC gaining the right to 
nominate a board member to Net2Phone's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Net2Phone Inc., based in Hackensack, N.J., successfully raised  
$81 million in an initial public offering of stock July 29. After 
an initial surge, the stock has drifted lower, closing Friday at 
$16.50, $1.50 above the offering price.

<HEADLINE> Divide Over Nixon Remains Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP) -- On the 25th anniversary of Richard  
Nixon's resignation, visitors to his presidential library Monday 
echoed the rest of the nation's conflicting feelings about his 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	For one woman, the images in the Richard Nixon Library and  
Birthplace's permanent exhibit brought back childhood memories of 
her parents watching TV coverage of the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did happen and it shouldn't have happened,'' said Pandy  
Byrd, 35, of Yorba Linda. ``I hope that my children would come away 
with the understanding that the end does not justify the means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of a narrow, dimly lit room at the library, Nixon  
waves farewell in a life-size photograph. Familiar pictures of his 
last days in the White House line the walls, and his voice can be 
heard on a June 23, 1972, tape recording of a conversation about 
ways to limit an FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Most visitors went to the library Monday unaware of the  
anniversary. But a reminder of the historic day revealed that 
strong opinions about Nixon remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very, very wrong,'' said Bob Teston, 60, of Yorba  
Linda. ``I hated to see him resign. I had voted for him. But it was 
for the good of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teston said he would tell the 2-year-old grandson he cradled in  
his arms that Nixon ``was a good president who made mistakes like 
most people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Leung, 51, of New York City, remains a Nixon admirer,  
crediting him for opening China and attributing his downfall to 
``crazy left-wingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a Vietnam veteran and he did a lot of things to try to  
protect us in Vietnam,'' he said. ``I think people forget that he 
made one mistake and he did so much for the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing to visit the library on the anniversary of the  
resignation was a ``curious coincidence'' to the Rev. Leo 
Constantino, 64, of Wheaton, Ill., a Vietnam War opponent who 
protested against Nixon and voted for Democrat George McGovern in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon's image has softened over the years, Constantino said, and  
``we must look at his presidency in a balanced and fair manner. But 
we must never forget that he caused a crisis in the republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The library did not mark the day with a special exhibit.  
Executive Director John H. Taylor said that was unnecessary because 
the museum is full of references to Watergate and the final days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a time of reflection,'' he said. ``Neither is it a time  
of celebration nor a time of breast-beating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, among Nixon supporters, his resignation was viewed as a  
comparatively honorable act. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of everything that's going on I think the darkest day  
in American politics was the day the Senate acquitted Bill Clinton 
of lying under oath,'' said Patricia Fortier, 43, of Buena Park. 
``President Nixon had the dignity to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He resigned for the good of the country,'' Leung added.  
``That's more than you could say about the man who holds the 
current position.''

<HEADLINE> Two Chinese Swimmers Are Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Two Chinese swimmers have been  
banned for three years after testing positive for a second time for 
banned performance-enhancing drugs, world swimming's governing body 
FINA said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong Guoming and Wang Wei both tested positive for the anabolic  
steroid clenbuterol in an out-of-competition test in March of this 
year. It was the second offense for both swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong's ban takes effect immediately, while Wang's will run from  
Apr. 13 next year -- the date on which he finishes his current 
two-year ban. Both swimmers have been disqualified from any 
competitions they have taken part in since March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornel Marculescu, executive director of FINA, said he did not  
know yet why the body's doping panel had decided on the three-year 
ban rather than excluding the swimmers for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have already had two years, so they will be banned for  
five years,'' Marculescu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Xiong was one of seven Chinese swimmers banned for two years  
after testing positive for the performance-enhancing steroid DHT at 
the 1994 Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He stormed back at last year's Asian Games in Bangkok, winning  
gold and breaking the Asian Games record in the 200-meter medley 
and taking silver in the 400-meter medley. 
</P>
<P>
	Marculescu said three Chinese swimmers and two coaches had  
received bans last year for doping offenses, but he believed the 
Chinese swimming federation was doing its best to wipe out 
drug-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they take very strong measures,'' he said. ``You are  
out for life for one doping offense, and the most difficult thing 
is that if you have a doping case in one province then you cannot 
take part in the national championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Monday two long-distance swimmers and two divers were  
banned from competition for doping offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA suspended Spain's David Meca-Medina and Slovenian Igor  
Majcen for four years after both tested positive for the steroid 
nandrolone earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension came two days after Meca-Medina won the 22-mile  
Ocean Marathon in Atlantic City, N.J. Majcen came third. 
</P>
<P>
	Synchronized diver Tracy Bonner, of the United States, who won  
the U.S. championships with her partner Kathy Pesek, was banned for 
a year after testing positive for dextroamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA said dextroamphetamine could be ruled legal under certain  
circumstances. If Bonner is given permission to use the drug in the 
future, her suspension will be reduced to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Yulia Pakhalina, the reigning world and European  
champion for 3-meter springboard diving, was banned for two months 
after testing positive for caffeine.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Lost $490 Million Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most health maintenance organizations lost money  
for a second year in a row in 1998, prompting many plans to raise 
premiums and cut benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs lost a combined $490 million last year, compared to a $768  
million loss in 1997, according to a study released Monday by Weiss 
Ratings, an independent ratings service based in Palm Beach 
Gardens, Fla. Before 1997, the HMO industry was profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	About 56 percent of HMOs lost money last year, down slightly  
from the 57 percent in 1997, the Weiss study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not good news for the consumer,'' said Martin Weiss,  
chairman of Weiss Ratings. That's because HMOs that lose money are 
more likely to go out of business, quit unprofitable markets or 
raise premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO industry's financial health should improve again this  
year as a result of many plans raising premiums by more than 5 
percent and curtailing coverage of Medicare recipients, Weiss said. 
Higher rates led to the narrower losses in 1998, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 576 HMOs analyzed by Weiss, 100 failed to have enough  
fiscal reserves as called for under guidelines set by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners. The guidelines seek to 
ensure that the HMOs have enough money to pay claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has a long way to go before consumers are safe,''  
Weiss said 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs operated by United HealthCare lost $174.6 million last  
year, most among large HMOs, the Weiss study found. Prudential 
HealthCare, which last week was bought by Aetna, lost nearly $60 
million in 1998. Aetna's HMOs lost about $15.9 million. Aetna is 
now the nation's largest health insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The steep losses raise the question of whether plans will skimp  
on coverage to save money, said Peter Young, a consultant with 
Health Care Strategic Issues in Fort Myers, Fla. ``These numbers 
are not good, no matter how you look at it,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and hospital executives have complained for the past few  
years about problems getting HMOs to paying medical bills. They say 
HMOs' financial problems are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Few large HMOs have gone bankrupt in recent years, but when they  
do, consumers can be left scrambling for insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200,000 New Jersey residents last fall had to find a new  
health insurance coverage when HIP Health Plan of New Jersey went 
bankrupt in one of the biggest fiscal collapses in the industry's 
history.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Gives Carter Top U.S. Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton praised the only living former  
Democratic president Monday as a man of peace who used his 
retirement from politics to help poor people at home and promote 
democracy abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, each  
received the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony at the 
Georgia headquarters of the Carter Center, a human rights 
organization that sends observers to monitor elections worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have done more good things for more  
people in more places than any other couple on the face of the 
earth,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation's highest  
civilian honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta award ceremony was a rare meeting for Clinton and  
Carter, who had called Clinton an embarrassment because of the 
Monica Lewinsky sex-and-coverup scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	As the impeachment drama neared its end late last year, Carter  
did not mince words. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an embarrassment. I hope it's over soon,'' Carter said in  
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter has never been particularly close to the only other  
Democrat who has held the White House in the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it goes all the way back to the Carter presidency,''  
said Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science 
professor. ``Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas and attributed 
his one loss in 1980 to Carter because Carter had sent a large 
number of the Mariel boatlift people to Arkansas, where they 
rioted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government sent thousands of Cuban refugees to Fort  
Chaffee, Ark., after the Mariel boatlift. Clinton got assurances 
from the Carter administration that no more would be sent after a 
riot left dozens injured, but a month later the administration sent 
refugees harbored in four other states on to Fort Chaffee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton always thought that impacted on his defeat,'' said  
Bert Lance, Carter's director of the Office of Management and 
Budget. ``If there was distance in their relationship, that 
probably was just the political reality of the time. As far as I 
know, they've had a good personal relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton focused on the times the two worked together,  
including Carter's efforts to support democracy in Haiti, and he 
compared Carter's work after leaving office to the 
post-presidential achievements of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The work President Carter has done through this extraordinary  
Carter Center to improve our nation and our world is truly 
unparalleled in our nation's history,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, the 39th president, was recognized for brokering the  
Camp David peace accords, signing the Panama Canal treaty and 
re-establishing normal diplomatic relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carter was recognized as a longtime advocate of improved  
mental health care, widespread childhood immunization, women's 
equality and enhanced care for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also noted the Carters' work helping to build  
homes for the needy through Habitat for Humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, saying he was ``almost speechless with emotion,'' said  
it was ``especially meaningful'' to receive the award from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, you have demonstrated global leadership often  
under the most difficult of circumstances in your commitment to 
protect human rights,'' Carter said, specifically citing the recent 
war in Yugoslavia and the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	On a lighter note, Carter couldn't resist an observation, from  
one former president to one who will be out of office after next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll be able to play golf without any television or  
telephoto lens focused on your stroke,'' Carter quipped. But 
there's a downside, too: ``I understand golfing partners don't give 
as many mulligans to ex-presidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will make the same award to Former President Gerald Ford  
and seven other people at a separate ceremony in Washington on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Carter's diplomatic missions helped resolve U.S.  
disputes with Haiti and North Korea. At the time, he was sometimes 
critical of the Clinton administration's policy in both nations. 
And some Clinton critics claimed that Carter was doing more for 
foreign policy than the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter also asked that the United States lead a fact-finding  
mission to Sudan to determine whether a plant destroyed in an 
American missile attack really was manufacturing chemical weapons, 
as U.S. officials asserted.

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am Ends With Spirited Send-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The 13th Pan American Games slipped  
into history with a closing ceremony Sunday featuring splashes of 
culture from across the Americas and a send-off from this Canadian 
prairie city's most famous rock band. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tone of the opening was intended to be inspirational,  
Sunday's closing struck a note of the celebratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers meant to symbolize geese kicked off the evening, racing  
onto the field and forming the word ``Viva'' while a 15-piece band 
played a salsa tune. 
</P>
<P>
	As highlights of the competition played on the large screen at  
the far end of the stadium, some 2,500 athletes and coaches swept 
into Winnipeg's stadium en masse, an unruly gaggle who danced and 
swayed and gyrated to the beat. The flagbearer from Guyana did a 
little dance, dipping and swaying his South American country's 
banner. Two athletes carried hand lettered signs, ``Thank You 
Winnipeg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the greatest cheers were for the athletes from the  
Dominican Republic, site of the next Games, who carried a huge sign 
lettered in English and Spanish, ``See you all in Santo Domingo 
2003.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the more solemn moments of the event had their comical  
aspects. Just as in the opening ceremony, athletes started a wave 
during the speech of Mario Vazquez Rana, the head of the Pan 
American Sports Organization. Then, moments after he began 
speaking, a cloudburst drenched the field, prompting the athletes 
to scramble under the grandstand for cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The bittersweet extravaganza's headliners were The Guess Who, a  
1960s band from Winnipeg famous for such hits as ``American 
Woman,'' and ``These Eyes.'' The band opened with ``No Time,'' as 
athletes, volunteers and anyone who could get to the field huddled 
around the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The band's appearance was a coup for games organizers, who  
wanted the city's most famous rock export to perform -- just as they 
reportedly did in 1967, the last time Winnipeg was the site of the 
Pan Ams. One member of the band says he can't recall a concert 
during the games 32 years ago, but officials said photographs of 
the performance, featuring matching houndstooth jackets, exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their experience will mean a lot -- a bridge over the  
generations from the last games to these,'' said Brian Koshul, a 
spokesman for the games. ``It's a time to say goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was a chance for Winnipeggers to express their  
mixture of sadness and relief that the folksy regional Olympics 
have come to an end. Those who seemed most melancholy were 
volunteers filing into Winnipeg Stadium for the closing ceremony. 
The city mustered 20,000 volunteers, outfitted them in 
salmon-colored shirts and khakis and dispatched them to 33 venues 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, having a huge sporting event three years after losing  
its professional hockey team, the Winnipeg Jets, provided a needed 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since we lost the Jets, people have been a little down,'' said  
Tom Tierney, 52, a retired civil servant who volunteered for the 
boxing, volleyball and artistic gymnastics competitions. ``This 
brings us back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the dignitaries joining the spectators were Jean Chretien,  
Canada's premier, and Johny Ventura, the mayor of Santo Domingo, 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead act may have been from rock 'n' roll, but opera,  
calypso, merengue and cha cha rhythms added an eclectic feel to the 
event. A masked parade of Caribbean performers added swathes of 
purple, gold and red to the field at Winnipeg Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes, led by the Canadians, jumped out of the stands and  
joined the dancers as the Dominicans raced around the edge of the 
field with their banner. After a lap, the Dominicans crowded around 
the stage for the dignitaries. Ventura jumped to his feet and 
danced with his compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
	The most solemn moment of the games came when the cauldron was  
extinguished and the flame symbolically passed to Santo Domingo. An 
aria was composed for the event, but the steady rain put out most 
of the fire anyway, taking away the drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Winnipeg now joins Mexico City as the second country to have  
been host of the Pan Ams on two occasions. The Canadian city's 
first event, in 1967, involved 2,400 athletes from 28 countries who 
took part in 23 sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the games were last held here in 1967, the community  
talked about that event for 30 years,'' said Larry Desrochers, the 
producer-director of the opening and closing ceremonies. ``I think 
Winnipeg and the country will talk about these games for the next 
30 years.''

<HEADLINE> British Airways Profits Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Widespread fare discounts and weaker demand for  
premium-class seats squeezed quarterly profit margins for British 
Airways PLC, which reported Monday a 46 percent drop in its 
year-on-year operating profit. 
</P>
<P>
	However, pressure on profits was more than offset by 177 million  
pounds ($285 million) that BA earned from the sale of assets, 
particularly its stake in Galileo International Inc., a global 
ticketing company. 
</P>
<P>
	BA's pretax profits rose 38 percent to 200 million pounds, or  
$322 million, for the three months ended June 30, up from 145 
million pounds, or $233 million at the current exchange rate, 
during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnover in the first quarter slipped 2.9 percent to 2.22  
billion pounds ($3.57 billion) from 2.29 billion pounds ($3.67 
billion), while quarterly operating profit dropped to 94 million 
pounds ($151 million) from 173 million pounds ($279 million). 
</P>
<P>
	BA confirmed plans to reduce its capacity by up to 12 percent  
over the next three years to help cope with an excess of seats on 
many air routes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through our fleet and network changes, British Airways will  
emerge from current market conditions with lower costs and a young 
aircraft fleet focused on the most profitable sections of the 
market,'' chief executive Bob Ayling said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	BA plans to increase the number of flights on profitable routes  
to try to attract more business customers, while curtailing service 
on routes that are less in demand, such as London to Jakarta or 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of BA rose 6 1/4 cents to $63.81 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Green Bay TE May Play Expanded Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Mark Chmura has been a valuable part of  
the Green Bay Packers' offense for the last five seasons. This 
year, however, the tight end's health is absolutely vital to the 
team's success. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why coach Ray Rhodes held Chmura out of several workouts  
during the first week of training camp. Rhodes insisted Chmura 
needed to rest his sore right Achilles' tendon, even though Chmura 
said it was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Mark he's a guy that doesn't have to prove anything to  
anybody,'' Rhodes said. ``If he stays healthy in training camp, 
he's done his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura came to the Green Bay Packers seven years ago as a  
sixth-round draft pick with a bad back and a tendency to avoid 
tough blocking assignments. Since then, he has developed into 
perhaps the game's best all-around tight end, with both sure hands 
and solid blocking skills. 
</P>
<P>
	He also became a favorite target of Brett Favre, one of Chmura's  
best friends off the field. Since not too many of Favre's other 
favorite targets are around Green Bay these days, Chmura has become 
more important than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	With wide receiver Robert Brooks retired and Antonio Freeman  
still in a contract holdout, offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis 
said he might look for tight ends Chmura and Tyrone Davis to carry 
some of the receiving load. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't going to be wholesale changes (in the Packers'  
offense), just little, subtle changes,'' Lewis said. ``One of those 
might be finding Mark more than we did last season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura caught 47 passes for 554 yards last season, both of which  
were his best totals since 1995. The three-time Pro Bowler also 
signed a five-year contract extension which essentially guaranteed 
he will finish his career in Green Bay and made him the game's 
highest-paid tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	Chmura could have waited until he became a free agent and  
listened to offers from other teams, but the Massachusetts native 
is comfortable in Wisconsin. He plans to move into a new home in 
the Milwaukee area this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``My focus has always been with this team, because they gave me  
my first chance,'' Chmura said. ``We've got a tough season ahead 
with all the changes around here, and I wanted to be a part of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers coaches are keeping a watchful eye on Chmura's  
Achilles', which he said is almost completely pain-free. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an excellent tight end that works the middle really well  
and has the speed to get down the field,'' Lewis said. ``We're 
going to try to use him as much as possible this year.''

professional scout for the Tampa Bay Lightning after serving the

overhaul of the team that had the worst record in the NHL the past 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton prodded the Senate today to  
move on a long-stalled treaty to ban nuclear testing worldwide, 
telling a military ceremony it would ``strengthen national 
security, not only of the United States, but of people around the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to hold  
hearings on the treaty in the fall. It has been signed by 152 
nations but not yet ratified by the United States, Russia or China. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in America's interest,'' he said. ``Why? Because we have  
already stopped testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 pact has been held up by that panel's chairman, Sen.  
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., in a dispute with the administration over arms 
control agreements between the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton intensified his campaign on behalf of the treaty at the  
ceremony at nearby Fort Myer in Arlington, Va., celebrating the 
50th anniversary of the creation of the office of chairman of Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the 14 men who have served in the post attended,  
including the present chairman, Gen. Henry Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised those who have held the post, the top uniformed  
military officer in the country, calling the position 
``indispensable'' to presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will come a time in the service of every president -- my  
time has come unfortunately on several occasions -- when you have to 
have the honest advice of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. And sometimes, it is the last thing in the world that you 
want to hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As commander-in-chief, Clinton also praised the military and  
celebrated the recent victory in the Balkans. Still, Clinton added, 
``We know not every battle will be like Kosovo. Not every battle 
can be won from the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the occasion to step up the White House campaign on  
behalf of the test ban treaty, noting that four former Joint Chiefs 
chairmen -- Colin Powell, David C. Jones, William J. Crowe and John 
Shalikashvili -- publicly supported the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains bottled up in the Foreign Relations Committee, where  
Helms is holding it hostage to other measures. Mainly, Helms wants 
the administration to send to the Senate changes in the landmark 
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty agreed to by Clinton and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration wants to wait until the Russian  
parliament first ratifies a later arms-reduction pact, the 
so-called START II agreement to reduce American and Russian 
warheads to a maximum of 3,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Although administration officials had hoped the Duma, the  
Russian parliament's lower house, would take up that measure when 
it reconvenes next month, the timetable could be affected by 
Yeltsin's firing today of his foreign minister and Cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles Shakes Off Tabloids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- There are thousands of islands in Greece.  
And floating near one of them is a tabloid newspaper's dream: a 
picture of Britain's Prince Charles on a luxury cruise with his 
longtime love Camilla Parker-Bowles. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters and speed boats hired by British, Greek and other  
news organizations have so far failed to spot the Alexander, the 
402-foot yacht that set off Thursday on the 10-day cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasing Charles -- or other members of the royal clan -- is a  
routine pursuit among the intensely competitive British tabloids. 
But this trip offers a blockbuster element: a glimpse of the prince 
and Ms. Parker-Bowles relaxing together in the sultry Greek summer 
along with Charles' two sons, Princes William and Harry. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of details has not deterred British papers from  
cranking out columns of speculation and supposition on events 
aboard the yacht, dubbed the ``Love Boat'' by several papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yacht get together was William's idea,'' wrote the tabloid Sun  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers also have mulled over whether 17-year-old William  
will indulge in a romantic fling on the cruise. The queen, however, 
is apparently not amused by the Greek getaway, the papers have 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	In a somber twist, the last time such a British-led royal hunt  
was mounted in Greece was for Diana just weeks before her death in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	News editors were left hoping that a British tourist on holiday  
might spot the yacht and tip off a newspaper or that William and 
Harry, 14, venture out on their own to a Greek island nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	At least six helicopters have been in the air or standing by to  
track down the vessel, in a frenzy costing tens of thousands of 
dollars to follow up rumors and hunches on the prince's 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	One Greek agency was charging $5,000 to rent a helicopter for  
five hours and $1,500 for daily hire of a speed boat. On Sunday, 
the hunt focused on the western island of Zakinthos but there was 
no reported sighting of the couple. 
</P>
<P>
	News and picture editors at one major British newspaper, who  
spoke on condition of anonymity, said a holiday shot of Charles and 
Camilla could sell for anything between $800 and $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If a tourist spots the royals and phones in the tip, cash  
rewards are generous if the information checks out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alexander's owner, Greek shipping tycoon John Latsis, is  
used to guarding the privacy of influential friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Past cruise guests include former President Bush, retired Gen.  
Colin Powell and actor Marlon Brando -- as well as Charles and Diana 
before their separation.

<HEADLINE> HHS Lobbies Over Transplant Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armed with a supportive report by an  
independent scientific panel, the Clinton administration is asking 
Congress to allow its policy on organ transplantation to take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you will read the report,'' Health and Human Services  
Secretary Donna Shalala wrote in a letter sent to every member of 
Congress. ``It is thoughtful, balanced and clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National  
Academy of Sciences that frequently advises the government, 
essentially supports the administration's approach to allocation of 
scarce organs for transplant. For its part, the other side wrote 
its own letter to Congress, focusing on a few areas where the 
report supports its concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of Health and Human Services should go back to  
the drawing board with the transplant community and agree on new 
policies that will benefit all patients,'' wrote Dr. William D. 
Payne, president of the United Network for Organ Sharing, which 
runs the nation's transplant system under an HHS contract and 
strongly opposes the HHS policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The essential problem is supply and demand: There were nearly  
21,000 transplants performed last year but more than 4,800 people 
died waiting for a new organ. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is how to distribute donated organs among some 65,000  
patients now waiting for transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	The transplant network and much of the transplant community  
supports the current system, which relies heavily on geography. 
Organs are offered locally first, then regionally and then 
nationally -- meaning a relatively healthy patient who is located 
close to the organ donor often gets offered an organ before a 
sicker patient elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the HHS issued regulations directing the network to  
remake its system and give organs to the sickest patients first. 
</P>
<P>
	The network objected -- both to a new system and to HHS telling  
it what to do -- and lobbied Congress for a change. Congress put the 
rule on hold for a year and asked the Institute of Medicine to 
study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the HHS has been negotiating with transplant  
surgeons and hospitals and plans to issue a revised version of its 
regulations within weeks. The network agrees the discussions have 
been productive. 
</P>
<P>
	A moratorium on the rule's implementation expires Oct. 21, and  
the HHS is asking Congress to let it take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the report ... puts to rest the misunderstandings  
and misrepresentations that have surrounded our recommendations,'' 
Shalala wrote to members of Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The report recommends that the regulations be implemented by  
establishing larger areas for the sharing of livers, the organ that 
has generated the most controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	It agreed with the HHS that the department should take an active  
role in overseeing the transplant system. And it said the network 
should make more data available more quickly, affirming another 
aspect of the HHS rule. 
</P>
<P>
	But it did not totally support the department. The HHS has cited  
disparities in the length of time people must wait for transplants 
as one of the chief reasons for remaking the system. But the 
Institute of Medicine said that waiting time is a misleading 
indicator. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is seizing that point to argue that the entire HHS  
rule is wrongheaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Institute of Medicine has questioned the basic medical  
premise of the pending federal organ transplant regulations,'' 
Payne wrote last month, the day after the report was released. 
``Therefore, the regulations should be withdrawn.''

<HEADLINE> Five Grand Slams in One Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Five grand slams were hit Monday night, the first time that's  
happened in 129 years of major league baseball 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Tatis of the St. Louis Cardinals and Jose Vidro of the  
Montreal Expos got it started early. Mike Lowell of the Florida 
Marlins connected, Bernie Williams of the New York Yankees followed 
and Jay Buhner of the Seattle Mariners set the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Four grand slams had been hit in one day many times since major  
league baseball began in 1871, but never five. The last time four 
had been hit was July 28, 1998, when Sammy Sosa, Gabe Alvarez, 
Darrin Jackson and Ray Lankford connected. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been a season of slams in the big leagues. The five  
raised the majors' total to 96 -- the record of 141 was set in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the first player to hit two slams in the same  
inning on April 23 at Los Angeles, Tatis hit the third of his 
career on Billy Brewer's first pitch in the fourth during a 12-6 
win at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	With three slams this year, Tatis tied Jim Bottomley (1925) and  
Keith Hernandez (1977) for the Cardinals' record. 
</P>
<P>
	Vidro connected on his first pitch from Carlos Almanzar in the  
sixth inning of the Expos' 8-0 win over visiting San Diego. It was 
his first grand slam in the majors and Montreal's first since last 
Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell hit his first career grand slam on a 3-1 pitch in the  
eighth inning against San Francisco's John Johnstone, who had just 
relieved starter Livan Hernandez. The home run tied the score at 4, 
and Florida went on to beat the Giants 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' sixth career slam came at Oakland on a full-count  
pitch by reliever Mike Oquist, capping an eight-run second inning 
that gave the New York Yankees an 8-0 lead over the Athletics. 
Williams started toward first after taking a 2-2 pitch for a ball, 
then returned to the plate as his teammates laughed in the Yankees 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Buhner connected in the sixth inning at Safeco Field on a 3-1  
pitch from John Snyder of the White Sox, giving the Mariners a 6-3 
lead in a 6-4 win over Chicago, 
</P>
<P>
	The three grand slams in one day tied the AL record, last  
accomplished last Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 57 slams in the AL this season and 39 in the NL.  
Both leagues set records in 1996, with 81 slams in the AL and 60 in 
the NL.

<HEADLINE> Rodriguez, Grimsley Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Seattle Mariners pitcher Frankie  
Rodriguez was suspended for seven games and New York Yankees 
pitcher Jason Grimsley for three on Monday for their roles in a 
brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was penalized for throwing at and hitting Chuck  
Knoblauch with a pitch in the ninth inning of New York's 11-8 win 
Friday night at Seattle, for using obscene language and for 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was brutal,'' Rodriguez said. ``That's a huge punishment.''  
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley was suspended for throwing at and then hitting Edgar  
Martinez on consecutive pitches the previous inning after Alex 
Rodriguez had homered. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting Knoblauch, Frankie Rodriguez was taken out of the  
game. He then started yelling at the Yankees in their dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The benches and bullpens emptied with some of the Yankees intent  
to get Rodriguez, and the pitcher knocked down Joe Girardi with two 
punches. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, Girardi and Yankees coach Don Zimmer also were  
ejected following the fight. Yankees manager Joe Torre was ejected 
an inning earlier for arguing a call. 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley said Monday night that he had no intention of hitting  
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these guys know me and they've seen me give up home runs  
before, and they know I don't try to hit anyone. The pitches just 
got away from me,'' he said. ``If I'm going to hit somebody, I'm 
not going to throw it 87 mph. I'm going to grab a four-seamer and 
throw it 95 mph and hit him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grimsley's suspension was due to start Tuesday, and Rodriguez's  
following the five-game suspension of Mariners pitcher Jose 
Paniagua, who on Monday dropped the appeal of his penalty. Paniagua 
was suspended following a July 11 fight against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners manager Lou Piniella was a little surprised with the  
length of the Rodriguez suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``A week, wow! They're really coming down heavy these days,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez said he planned to appeal, but Grimsley hasn't  
decided. If he does, the suspension can't begin until after a 
hearing before AL president Gene Budig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know exactly what I'm going to do as far as appealing.  
It depends on if I'm needed or not,'' Grimsley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said before Monday's game at Oakland that he had not yet  
decided whether to encourage Grimsley to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In relation to what Rodriguez got, I think it was fair,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez and Grimsley also were fined.

<HEADLINE> Oasis Guitarist Arthurs Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Oasis guitarist Paul ``Bonehead'' Arthurs said  
Monday he has quit the band after eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Arthurs apparently talked over his plans with  
the band and engineered an amicable split. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a lot of consideration I have decided to call it a day  
with Oasis,'' Arthurs said in a statement released through the 
band's label, Creation Records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a fantastic eight years in one of the best bands ever  
to come out of Britain, and now feel I have come to the stage where 
I'd like to concentrate on other things in my life, outside of the 
demands of being in a successful rock 'n' roll band,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhythm guitarist Arthurs -- dubbed ``Bonehead'' because of his  
thinning hair -- was a founding member of the band, which was 
originally formed as Rain in Manchester, England, in 1991 with 
drummer Tony McCarroll and bass player Paul ``Guigsy'' McGuigan. 
</P>
<P>
	A new singer, Liam Gallagher, suggested a change of name and the  
appointment of his brother, Noel, as lead guitarist/songwriter gave 
the group a new direction. Their successful debut album, 
``Definitely Maybe,'' followed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The band said there are no plans to replace Arthurs, who played  
on the new album due out next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a judge in London approved an 550,000 pound (dlrs  
880,000) payment to McCarroll to settle a lawsuit he brought 
against the band after he was fired in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Kan. School Panel Debates Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- In a vote that will be closely watched  
around the country, the State Board of Education is expected to 
decide whether evolution should be left off a list of topics for 
science assessment tests given to high school students. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-member board, scheduled to vote on Wednesday, has split  
5-5 along philosophical lines in recent years, and it is unclear 
how much support there is for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	But some conservative members on the panel say they object to  
describing Charles Darwin's theory as one of the basic tenets of 
science, saying it cannot be proven. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the proposal have already lined up.  
</P>
<P>
	The heads of all six state universities have sent a letter to  
the board chairwoman, saying the proposal ``will set Kansas back a 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going back to the 1880s,'' said Charlie Pierce of  
Hutchinson High School, who has taught biology for 18 years. ``It 
does make us look to the people in the rest of the country that 
we're a bunch of hicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that public  
schools cannot teach creationism, the theory that a higher power 
created the universe. The proposal's opponents say conservatives 
are trying their only remaining tactic -- trying to limit the 
teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas is one of a handful of states -- including Arizona,  
Alabama, Illinois, New Mexico, Texas and Nebraska -- where, in 
recent years, school boards have attempted to take evolution out of 
state science standards or de-emphasize evolutionary concepts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas school boards would not have to follow the proposed  
standards when they formulate curricula. But the standards would 
determine what students can be asked about on the statewide 
assessment tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the state has no list of topics that should be on the  
tests. Educators are forming such a list -- it likely will require 
questions about parts of the atom, genetics and forms of energy, 
for example -- and the debate is over whether evolution should be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, three board members formed a committee to work out  
a compromise between educators who favor standards stressing 
evolution's importance and those who think schools should be able 
to decide what to teach about the origins of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's proposal mentions natural selection -- the idea  
that advantageous traits increase in a population over time -- but 
dropped from an earlier plan a section calling evolution by natural 
selection ``a broad, unifying theoretical framework in biology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's report says only that students should develop an  
understanding of evolution but makes no mention of whether they 
should be tested on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Board member Bill Wagnon said he plans to ask the board to vote  
on a different proposal, written by a committee of 27 science 
educators. Their standards call for students to be tested on 
evolution in 10th grade. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter the outcome, the debate has already drawn the interest  
of educators elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think other states are looking at what's going on in  
Kansas,'' said Molleen Matsumura, network project director of the 
National Center for Science Education in El Cerrito, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the National Academy of Sciences said evolution must  
be taught in public schools if children are to understand biology 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization issued a guidebook for teachers, parents and  
school administrators that asserted: ``There is no debate within 
the scientific community over whether evolution has occurred, and 
there is no evidence that evolution has not occurred.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine District Adds Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The school board that governs Columbine  
High School has adopted 27 security measures, including panic 
alarms in main offices and mandatory identification badges for high 
school students and staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The only recommendation by the Jefferson County school  
district's Safety Task Force that was rejected, because of cost, 
was the addition of a second non-uniformed campus supervisor at 
each of the 16 high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the high schools and the district's 18 middle schools  
now have a uniformed school resource officer who is a police 
officer or sheriff's deputy. All will have one under the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students will return to their school on Aug. 16 for  
the first time since the April 20 massacre. Columbine seniors Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with guns and pipe bombs, 
killed 12 students and a teacher, wounded 23 others and then took 
their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Other measures adopted Monday include: requiring visitors to get  
a school pass, the continued use of search dogs and the 
installation of a hot line and tip box to report incidents that 
might lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some task force members asked whether the measures would have  
stopped the shooting rampage had they been in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found all of our recommendations can create some kind of  
safety in the schools. I think some of these recommendations could 
have prevented what happened,'' said task force member and 
Columbine student Sergie Gonzalez.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Coast Guard rescued 26 people from a  
fishing boat off the coast early today after the vessel struck an 
underwater object and started taking on water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coral Sea, a 55-foot commercial fishing boat, was carrying  
21 passengers and five crew members when it sprang a leak shortly 
after midnight. It was less than a mile off Ballast Point, near San 
Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no injuries,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Michael  
Clayes. ``Everybody's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coral Sea was pumped out and towed back to shore, he said.

<HEADLINE> 13 Die in Labor Van Crash in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIVE POINTS, Calif. (AP) -- A van overloaded with farm workers  
slammed into a tractor-trailer rig making a U-turn on a remote 
farming road early today, killing 13 people in the van and 
seriously injuring two others. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the passengers in the van were in the back, sitting  
without seat belts on two benches that were installed along the 
sides, said Highway Patrol Officer Brian Yokley. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal to have anyone ride without proper seats and seat  
belts, but California farm workers often are transported in 
overloaded vans, a problem that has contributed to a 
disproportionate traffic death rate among Hispanics in the area.

	The truck driver, who was not injured, was turning his rig  
around on the two-lane road after parking on the shoulder to sleep, 
said California Highway Patrol Officer Eric Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
	The van ``couldn't avoid hitting the tractor-trailer,'' Erickson  
said. ``Their brakes locked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tractor-trailer rig included two empty trailers, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened shortly after 5 a.m., just southeast of  
this tiny town in Fresno County. The laborers had just gotten off 
work from sorting tomatoes in the fields, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two injured people also were in the van, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dona Portillo, 26, said the van's owner was her grandfather,  
Jose Lopez Rosas. He wasn't in the van, but she said her father was 
and was among those killed. She did not give her father's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Portillo said she had been working in the fields with her  
mother and father, and she and her mother had found a different 
ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told my mom, `You go ahead and go with them, so you can  
rest and go to sleep,''' Ms. Portillo said, sobbing, after 
returning to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured survivors were taken to University Medical Center in  
Fresno -- a 17-year-old girl in critical condition and a male in 
serious condition, said Michelle Van Valkenburg, a hospital 
spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Ruling on Oil Dispute Expected Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The petroleum industry is awaiting word on  
whether the government will agree to consider charges that unfair 
foreign imports are driving U.S. oil producers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	If the government decides to accept the petition by Oklahoma  
oilmen, America's trade policy could be put to a new test, with a 
possible tariff on as much as 60 percent of imported oil -- and 
higher prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department was expected to make the announcement  
late today. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute already has fractured the oil industry, with Big Oil  
pitted against the struggling independent producers. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a petition filed by an Okahoma-based group of  
independent oil companies charging that Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Iraq 
and Venezuela have violated U.S. trade laws by selling oil in this 
country for less than it costs them to produce it. The petition 
also argues that production is being unfairly subsidized by the 
foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Trade Association, a Commerce agency, was to  
decide whether the oilmen's petition had proper standing, allowing 
the case to proceed. If rejected, the decision could be appealed to 
a special court, but such a process could take years. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency in recent weeks has been taking comments from  
hundreds of small oil producers, major energy users and the larger 
oil companies. Under the law, 25 percent of the industry must 
support the petition for it to be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	If the allegations are found to be true it would amount to  
illegal dumping of oil in violation of federal anti-dumping laws. 
The United States would be obligated to impose tariffs and 
penalties against such imports, amounting in some cases to as much 
as a 170 percent increase in the price of a barrel of imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of anti-dumping laws to challenge oil imports has stunned  
many trade experts because oil is traded and its prices often set 
on the worldwide market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This involves a commodity that no one ever would have thought  
would be subject to an anti-dumping case,'' said Robert Litan, a 
Brookings Institution economist who has been one of the law's most 
vocal critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's absurd about this case is Americans have been opposed  
to higher oil prices for my entire adult lifetime and here we have 
a case where the effect could well be to raise prices,'' he 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harold Hamm, president of an Enid, Okla.-based independent  
oil company, who helped found a group called ``Save Domestic Oil'' 
expressly to bring the complaint, argued the anti-dumping law was 
enacted to protect U.S. companies in just such a case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oil is not any different. Dumping did occur and it put 100,000  
people out of jobs,'' Hamm said in a telephone interview. ``There's 
not anything absurd about it. Our only line of defense is the trade 
laws and I think we've got a very good case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists and trade specialists, however, argue the case  
is extremely weak and some contend -- if the oilmen were successful 
-- it could result in a backlash against the anti-dumping law. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of other users of the anti-dumping (provision)  
who do not want this case to go further. It puts a real spotlight 
on it,'' said Gary Hutbauer, a trade expert at the Institute for 
International Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Already the petition has caused repercussions:  
</P>
<P>
	--The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the large,  
international oil companies, has vowed to fight it along every 
step. It hired an attorney who specializes in bringing anti-dumping 
cases to fight this one. 
</P>
<P>
	--More than 100 organizations, companies and industry groups from  
airlines and truckers to farmers have filed in opposition, arguing 
a favorable ruling would harm consumers by raising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mexico has put on hold plans to phase out its tariff on U.S.  
natural gas imports until the anti-dumping case is resolved. 
Venezuela has staunchly denied the charge it is selling oil at 
below-market value.

<HEADLINE> Former Cycling Coach Murdered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Motorcycle hit men killed a former  
trainer on Costa Rica's national cycling team who also worked for 
professional teams in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Elkin Dario Rendon, 46, was shot four times Sunday by the  
passing gunmen while riding his bicycle in Medellin, police in 
Colombia's second-largest city said. A riding partner was shot in 
the hip, but survived the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The motive for the shooting was unknown, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rendon was assistant coach of the Bogota-based Postobon  
bicycling club between 1986 and 1992, said Raul Meza, a former 
colleague and director of the Orbitel club, based in Medellin. Meza 
said Rendon was retired and living off income from passenger buses 
he owned in Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendon was married with three children -- one of whom raced  
bicycles on Colombia's professional circuit, Meza said.

<HEADLINE> Logging Costs Raise Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- Five years after the Clinton  
administration's Northwest Forest Plan was supposed to strike a 
balance between logging and wildlife, a judge again has found 
federal forest managers breaking the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	With logging already cut back by 80 percent to restore salmon  
runs and save the northern spotted owl from extinction, this latest 
battle in the war over woods has many wondering whether national 
forests can sell timber while also guaranteeing fresh water and a 
clean habitat for animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Have we developed a system of law and an approach that is  
simply too expensive to use?'' asked Jack Ward Thomas, the former 
chief of the U.S. Forest Service who led the scientific team that 
created the Northwest Forest Plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the pressure on for things to come out above cost, it  
looks to me like it's getting tougher and tougher,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Dwyer in Seattle ruled last Monday  
that despite spending $8 million a year, the Forest Service had 
failed to fully follow a Northwest Forest Plan mandate to survey 77 
species of rare plants and wildlife before selling timber in 
Oregon, Washington and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwyer imposed an injunction stopping nine timber sales -- equal  
to enough timber to build about 7,000 homes -- until the surveys are 
done. Dwyer was scheduled to rule later this month whether to stop 
30 other timber sales that environmentalists want blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very significant victory for the Northwest forests,''  
said Doug Heiken of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, which 
initiated the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling brought back memories of 1991, when Dwyer shut down  
logging on nearly 25 million acres of old growth forests after 
finding the Forest Service and U.S. Bureau of Management had failed 
to follow laws requiring them to maintain habitat for the spotted 
owl and other species. 
</P>
<P>
	The injunctions were lifted after the Northwest Forest Plan went  
into effect in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwyer's new ruling has revived the timber industry's fears of  
dwindling log supplies and boosted environmentalists' hopes of 
someday stopping all commercial logging in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the tip of the iceberg,'' said Chris West, vice  
president of the Northwest Forestry Association, a timber industry 
group. ``With this decision, we can see future timber sales 
disappear, and also have many of the sales we have bought over the 
last five years that haven't been cut being taken away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., have  
asked the Forest Service for meetings to figure out a way to deal 
with the ruling. And Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has offered a 
rider to the Interior budget bill to give the Forest Service more 
freedom to act. 
</P>
<P>
	But economic pressure to save what once was the region's leading  
industry has waned. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy of the Northwest -- particularly the Silicon Forest  
west of Portland -- has flourished amid a boom of high-tech industry 
and increased tourism. Isolated timber towns, however, continue to 
founder. 
</P>
<P>
	The national forests were created in 1891 as a reserve against  
cut-and-run logging, and were not heavily tapped until after World 
War II, when returning soldiers started building homes for the baby 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Now all but 5 percent of the old-growth forests have been cut to  
produce everything from subway ties in New York to venetian blinds 
in Europe, and most of what is left is on national forest land. 
</P>
<P>
	One company that had two recent timber buys affected by Dwyer's  
injunction is Superior Lumber in Glendale, which relies on public 
timber for 50 percent of its log supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Lumber weathered the cutbacks in national forest  
logging that closed hundreds of other mills by buying up private 
timberlands, installing high-tech milling equipment and traveling 
as much as 300 miles for logs. 
</P>
<P>
	President Steve Swanson said he was frustrated to have two  
timber sales held up over concerns for species that aren't even 
listed as threatened or endangered. Swanson also said the forest 
plan's promise of a certain, if smaller, timber supply has never 
been met. 
</P>
<P>
	``The regulations around endangered species are not as onerous  
as the survey and manage process,'' he said. The protected species 
include rare salamanders, mushrooms, slugs, mosses, lichens, plants 
and the red tree vole, a favorite food of the spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent report from the General Accounting office found that  
the cost of preparing timber sales under the Northwest Forest Plan 
has nearly doubled, from $126 per thousand board feet in 1992 to 
$243 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The taxpayer would save the most money if there were no  
logging on national forests,'' said Heiken.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Prosecutor Seeks Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- A man offered to plead guilty to five  
counts of murder to avoid the death penalty for killing a pregnant 
woman and her three children, but the prosecutor rejected the plea 
and said the man deserved to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Darrell Moore said Monday he would take Richard  
DeLong to trial and seek the death penalty. Under DeLong's offer, 
which he made twice in letters, he would have been sentenced to 
life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had three kids, a baby and a mama killed, and in my  
judgment that warrants the death penalty,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLong has been ordered to stand trial on five counts of murder  
in the Jan. 19 death of Erin Vanderhoef, her three children and her 
full-term fetus. According to testimony at a pretrial hearing, 
DeLong and two accomplices strangled Ms. Vanderhoef and her 
children after DeLong's girlfriend learned he and Ms. Vanderhoef 
had had an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	One of DeLong's lawyers, Tom Budesheim, did not return a call  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLong's girlfriend, Stacie Leffingwell, and a neighbor, Harold  
``Bobby'' Lingle, are charged with helping DeLong and also face the 
death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness testified at the pretrial hearing that Miss  
Leffingwell hated Ms. Vanderhoef over the affair and that the 
full-term fetus the woman was due to deliver was DeLong's. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Vanderhoef was lured out of her house on Jan. 19 on the ruse  
that Lingle would buy milk and doughnuts for everyone, according to 
testimony. While she went to the store with him, according to the 
testimony, DeLong strangled her children, Darlene, 8; Jimmy, 11; 
and Chris, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The three then allegedly killed Ms. Vanderhoef when she and  
Lingle returned.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Fans Boo J.D. Drew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- J.D. Drew learned a little something Monday  
night during his first appearance at Veterans Stadium: In the city 
where booing is an art form, decoys don't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew, the player who refused to sign with the Phillies after  
they made him the No. 2 pick in the 1997 amateur draft, received 
loud boos during batting practice before the St. Louis Cardinals 
played Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was the only chance to boo him. Drew's Philadelphia  
debut was nixed by a hand bruise that kept him out of the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even though bullpen catcher Jeff Murphy wore Drew's  
jersey during BP, fans booed the right Drew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go back to the past,'' Drew said. ``I never had a  
problem with the people of Philadelphia. Hopefully, that clears it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite. The Vet, perhaps the only stadium where Mark McGwire  
isn't the main attraction in batting practice, resonated with boos 
when the real Drew came up to bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a bandage on his bruised right hand, Drew laughed  
throughout his BP session. He homered once, a line drive to right 
that was thrown back onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting, Drew ran to the outfield and got his only cheers  
when he booted three straight grounders. When BP was over -- and 
fans finished gaping at McGwire's nearly half-dozen shots to the 
upper deck -- Drew walked to the dugout with Cardinals manager Tony 
La Russa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a point to make,'' La Russa said. ``I don't think it  
was anything about Philadelphia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Drew had a news conference in which he lamented  
the delay in his Vet debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be good to get it out of the way,'' said Drew, listed as  
day-to-day. ``I don't really know what to expect. It's just a 
matter of going out there and living it, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy's disguise was reminiscent of the time Phillies Hall of  
Famer Mike Schmidt played a half-inning with a wig after 
criticizing the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a beefed-up security and police presence at the  
stadium, and those on the field included Cardinals security 
director Joe Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	The stands were filled with signs, such as: ``J-Greed Drew,''  
``J.D. Who?'' ``Greed Will Be Your Demise,'' and ``Greed is a 
Cardinal Sin.'' Oddly, one sign read, ``Free Pete Rose.'' There 
were many profane banners, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Sajak of the big-money game show ``Wheel of Fortune,'' threw  
out the ceremonial first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the game, the Phillie Phanatic placed several  
money bags, painted with dollar signs, in front of the Cardinals' 
dugout. He then hid behind his all-terrain vehicle with a mock 
dynamite blaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals coach Rene Lacheman ran out of the dugout and  
confiscated the bags; it did not appear to be part of the act. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities were reminiscent of the night Albert Belle  
played his first game against the Indians in Cleveland after 
signing with the Chicago White Sox. Though Drew didn't play, at 
least he smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew said he went out to dinner in Philadelphia on Sunday night,  
but no one recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not like McGwire,'' Drew said. ``You can't miss him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would serve as Drew's bodyguard, McGwire said,  
``Absolutely not. No thank you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the fans had fun with it, Phillies players tried to  
downplay Drew's return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could care less,'' said Doug Glanville, who plays Drew's  
position -- center field -- and leads the National League in hits. 
``He's just another ballplayer. He did what he felt like he had to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure the Philly fans will definitely voice their opinion.  
It's sort of like when John Elway didn't go to the Colts. I expect 
Philadelphia fans will probably remember forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies lost their rights when they failed to sign him  
within 12 months of the draft. Drew and agent Scott Boras wanted 
$11 million, while the Phillies offered about $2 million guaranteed 
with options that could have made the deal worth about $6 million 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew went back into the draft, was picked fifth by the Cardinals  
in 1998 and got a guaranteed deal worth $7 million, including a $3 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's to the point where now I play in St. Louis, and I'm very  
happy,'' Drew said. ``I couldn't work things out here. Hopefully, 
there's no hard feelings.''

<HEADLINE> Govs. Help Bush With Their Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Gov. Tommy Thompson wanted to run for  
president, but was blocked by harsh reality: A fellow Republican 
governor -- George W. Bush -- has a few more things going for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``His name is Bush. He's from Texas. He can raise a ton of  
money. And he's better looking than me,'' the Wisconsin governor 
said with a grin and a what-can-you-do shrug of his wide shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than those few things, I'd be the front-runner.''  
</P>
<P>
	Like quietly envious bridesmaids, several Republican governors  
are loyally helping Bush fulfill a dream that they once had for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, who early this year questioned whether Bush had  
accomplished much as governor, will ride his motorcycle in Iowa to 
rally Bush voters this week. He opened Bush's Iowa office in June, 
and has raised more than $300,000 in Wisconsin for the leading 
Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson has Bush's ear on education and welfare issues.  
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Gov. John Engler helped rally GOP governors behind  
Bush, and has raised about $2 million for his colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, a key policy adviser, flew to Austin,  
Texas, in late May to help Bush prepare for his first campaign 
swing. He also will campaign in Iowa this week for Bush, who is 
competing in the state GOP's straw poll Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating has impressed Bush's political team  
with his television appearances on Bush's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Gov.Tom Ridge is credited by Bush backers for  
locking down his state's political operation, and raising $1.4 
million before July. Ridge also lends Bush policy advice, 
particularly on how Republicans can be more effective champions of 
the environment, the governor said in an interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Gov. George Pataki scored points with the Bush campaign  
by setting aside ill feelings toward Rudolph Giuliani and endorsing 
the New York mayor for Senate. Bush believes a united GOP front 
will force the presidential Democratic nominee to campaign harder 
than usual in a state Democrats must win to retain the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Bush advisers, they didn't explicitly ask Pataki to  
endorse Giuliani; they did urge the New York governor to make sure 
the party was not bitterly divided after this fall's Senate 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki got the message.  
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-one of the 31 GOP governors have endorsed Bush, with  
several more in the pipeline. Bush is counting on the state leaders 
to ignite their political operations, raise money and offer advice 
that would help him replicate their political successes in a 
national election. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows the mindset of a state better than the governor  
so governors are the masters of the message,'' Bush spokeswoman 
Karen Hughes said as the state leaders gathered at the National 
Governors' Association. Bush and his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb 
Bush, did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
	To various degrees, Pataki, Ridge, Keating, Racicot, Engler and  
Thompson mulled seeking the presidency or were considered potential 
candidates. Now they're auditioning for the vice presidential 
nomination or a Cabinet post. 
</P>
<P>
	Engler, Ridge and Pataki -- listed in order of likelihood -- have  
the best chance to end up on Bush's list of potential running mates 
if he wins the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, a former FBI agent, would have a shot at returning to  
the Justice Department as attorney general. Keating is a top 
criminal justice adviser to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Racicot could benefit from the precedent of putting a western  
state governor in charge of the Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson could fit into several Cabinet posts.  
</P>
<P>
	Govs. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, John Rowland of  
Connecticut and Bill Owens of Colorado have lower national 
profiles, but are working hard to nominate Bush. ``I'll have the 
troops up in New Hampshire,'' said Cellucci, considered a potential 
Cabinet official. 
</P>
<P>
	Job advancement is not all that motivates the governors to help  
Bush: Electing the Texan would show that their moderate, pragmatic 
approach to politics is more successful than the route taken by 
congressional Republicans, several governors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a way for us to lead, to put our agenda forward,''  
said Utah Gov. Michael Leavitt. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how hard the governors try, envy is a hard feeling to  
suppress. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said a colleague pulled him aside recently, and said  
with a touch of sadness: ``Maybe I should be president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Leavitt, the governor, whom Leavitt declined to  
name, concluded that a leader emerges from each generation -- and 
this was Bush's moment. That governor has endorsed Bush, Leavitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt realized himself that Bush had emerged in December, when  
he visited Israel with the Texan and watched fawning crowds flock. 
That night, Leavitt wrote in his journal: ``I've seen fate fall on 
a man today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fate Bush's fellow governors had long hoped might fall  
on them.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games End After Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- They ended with Freddy Krueger winning  
the final gold medal and athletes dancing the merengue in the rain 
at the closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13th Pan American Games, plagued by seven positive drug  
tests and nine Cuban defections, but highlighted by the enthusiasm 
of the youthful competitors, concluded Sunday. Krueger, a water 
skier from Orlando, Fla., -- no, his address is not on Elm Street -- 
won the men's jumping event, giving the United States its 106th 
gold and 296th medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty cool to win the gold medal,'' Krueger said. ``You  
grow up watching the Olympics; this isn't the Olympics, but it's as 
close as we get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the hemispheric Olympics, and the United States ended it  
with the most medals, by far. The final count showed the U.S. team 
with 296 (106 gold, 110 silver, 80 bronze), followed by Canada with 
196 (64-52-80) and Cuba with 156 (69-40-47). 
</P>
<P>
	But Sunday's feature event, the men's basketball final, did not  
add to the gold rush. The U.S. men have not won the Pan Ams gold 
since 1983, and the collection of CBA all-stars sent this year lost 
to Brazil 95-78 -- its worst loss in men's basketball. The 
Brazilians ran their patterns to perfection and shot 60 percent in 
the first half to take control. They went inside to 6-foot-10 A.J. 
Santos to hold off the charging Americans in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played a great, great game,'' guard Damon Bailey said.  
``I'm not sure if we would have been together for 10 years we could 
have beaten them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States didn't fare so well in basketball, it  
won gold in women's softball and soccer, as expected. The world 
champion softball team outscored opponents 83-1 and had three 
no-hitters, two of them perfect games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also won in men's water polo to get an Olympic  
berth. The silver medal behind Cuba for a group of baseball minor 
leaguers also earned a spot in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The final day had no defections, but Cuba went home stung by  
nine members of its delegation leaving. And there were four more 
positive drug tests, costing two Cuban weightlifters their gold 
medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem in Olympic sports is drugs,'' Pan American  
Sports Organization president Mario Vazquez Rana said after 
announcing that William Vargas, winner in the 136.4-pound 
weightlifting class, and Rolando Delgado, the 152-pound class 
winner, tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone. 
Baseball players Roberto Vizcarra and Hector Alvarez also tested 
positive for Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not win over the drugs, drugs will win over us,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The others who failed drug tests were all gold medalists: Steve  
Vezina, the goalie on Canada's in-line roller hockey team, and high 
jumpers Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, the men's indoor and outdoor 
world record-holder and 1992 Olympic champion, and Juana Rosario 
Arrendel of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Mexican baseball player Ray Martinez refused to be  
tested, which was tantamount to testing positive. 
</P>
<P>
	At the closing ceremony, featuring a temporary reuniting of  
Winnipeg's contribution to rock music, The Guess Who, highlights of 
the competition played on the large screen at the far end of the 
stadium while some 2,500 athletes and coaches marched en masse. It 
was an unruly gaggle who danced and swayed and gyrated to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes and administrators did the merengue and cha cha in the  
rain, and even organized a wave in the stands while Vazquez Rana 
attempted to make his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guess Who, a 1960s band that long since split, performed  
``American Woman,'' ``These Eyes,'' ``No Time,'' and ``Undun,'' as 
athletes, volunteers and anyone who could get to the field huddled 
around the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	They left to a long ovation, and the Pan Ams headed to the  
Dominican Republic for 2003.

	CRAWFORD, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush, who is also eyeing a  
house in Washington, D.C., on Monday completed the purchase of a 
ranch west of Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to own this beautiful piece of land in central  
Texas,'' the GOP presidential front-runner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling it a private matter, Bush declined to disclose details  
of the purchase of the ranch, located near the 700-resident town of 
Crawford, about 90 miles southwest of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to being able to spend time there with my  
family,'' Bush said, thanking the Engelbrecht family for their 
``longtime care and stewardship of this special piece of land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A work team recently surveyed the nearly 1,500-acre ranch and  
crews researched whether Bush, an avid fisherman, could build a 
private 100-acre fishing lake on the land. 
</P>
<P>
	His office didn't immediately return calls.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Bush was spotted visiting a cafe in nearby  
McGregor and chatting with local residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and his wife, Laura, sold their home in Dallas after his  
1994 election as governor. They've been living in the Governor's 
Mansion in Austin since he took office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also has a lake house in eastern Texas, near Athens.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Jim McDermott said Monday he will not run  
for the Senate in Washington state against Republican Slade Gorton 
but will instead seek reelection to his 7th District seat in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``After many months of thought and discussions with numerous  
friends and supporters,'' McDermott said in a statement, ``I have 
concluded that my political future is in the House of 
Representatives, where I have built up seniority, and where I can 
be an influential force on health care, trade and environmental 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott, 62, has won six terms in Congress but lost bids to  
become governor in 1972, 1980 and 1984. The Democrat has 
contemplated a Senate run for months, and he had written a letter 
asking state Democrats whether he should challenge Gorton. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure clears the way for state Insurance Commissioner  
Deborah Senn, a Democrat who has already announced she is running 
for Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	McDermott said that next year he expects to serve in a  
Democratic majority in the House, where he has a seat on the 
influential Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that I could have raised the necessary money  
and campaign support to run a successful race for the Senate,'' 
McDermott said in a statement. ``But to do so would have meant 
taking a major part of every day over the next year to ask people 
for money. That's not how I want to spend my time.''

	BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- David Curtis, chairman of the Vermont  
Democratic Party and a lawyer known for his advocacy for gays, 
women and the underprivileged, died over the weekend at age 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis died at the Fletcher Allen Health Care hospital in  
Burlington of heart failure complicated by lung cancer and AIDS, 
family and friends said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis began his professional life as a corporate lawyer and a  
Republican before a midlife change in which he joined the 
Democratic Party and became a defense attorney for underprivileged 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Montpelier, Curtis got degrees from the University  
of Vermont and Boston College Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered politics as a Republican state legislator from  
Charlotte, serving in the House in 1975 and 1976. He was appointed 
defender general in 1985 and was responsible for overseeing the 
state's network of attorneys who represent poor people accused of 
crimes. In 1969, he was the lead lawyer in a case that struck down 
Vermont's law against abortion, Lippert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis disclosed he had AIDS when Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.,  
asked him if he knew anyone who could testify before Congress on 
the subject. Curtis divorced in 1978 and left Vermont for several 
years as he first dealt with his homosexuality. He provided legal 
help to the poor in Tennessee and later for Lakota Indians in South 
Dakota.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- C-SPAN will have some competition on its  
coverage of the GOP presidential straw poll in Ames, Iowa this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee will provide live coverage  
from Saturday's event over the Internet. The speeches, hand-shaking 
and baby-kissing by the GOP presidential hopefuls will be sent from 
a satellite truck directly to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ames coverage is part of an RNC's ``e.GOP'' campaign to  
incorporate the Internet into their communications, organizational 
and fund raising efforts. They plan to expand use of the satellite 
truck during the course of the campaign, covering events all over 
the country and transmitting them on the Internet and via 
satellite.

<HEADLINE> 'Spiderman' Burglar Gets 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A burglar dubbed Spiderman by police was sentenced  
Monday to 20 years in prison for stealing $5,000 in property, 
including cash, a laptop computer and jewelry, from a seventh-floor 
waterfront condominium. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick James was convicted in December for the June 21, 1998,  
theft. 
</P>
<P>
	James, a former Army paratrooper, is suspected of stealing $6  
million in cash, jewelry and credit cards in more than 130 
high-rise burglaries throughout South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Spiderman used his agility and upper-body strength  
to climb quickly from one balcony to the next without ropes or 
hooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Ellen Leesfield on Monday  
sentenced James to two 20-year terms, which will run concurrently, 
for burglary of an unoccupied dwelling and grand theft. He must 
serve a 15-year minimum-mandatory term. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the sentencing, the judge Monday denied a motion for a  
new trial.

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Group Lacks Arena Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mario Lemieux's ownership group remains  
without an agreement on concessions that would free the Pittsburgh 
Penguins from paying millions of dollars owed the county and city 
for Civic Arena improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal is needed before Lemieux can close on his already  
twice-delayed purchase of the bankrupt Penguins. A federal 
bankruptcy judge last week granted a second extension for the sale 
to be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegheny County commissioner Bob Cranmer has objected to some  
of the concessions, which were reached previously by city-county 
negotiator Stephen Leeper. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranmer originally agreed to the proposal, but is having second  
thoughts because it might force the county to use general revenue 
funds to pay off part of the $37 million debt, some of which dates 
to the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranmer met Monday with fellow commissioner Michael Dawida,  
Mayor Tom Murphy and Leeper to sort out differences and begin work 
on a compromise agreement that would allow the sale to go through 
but not require the use of taxpayer cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeper will now go back to Lemieux's group to try to reach an  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position is the same as last week,'' Cranmer said. ``The  
taxpayers of Allegheny County should not have to pay Howard 
Baldwin's debt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins piled up an estimated $120 million in debt when  
Baldwin and, later, Roger Marino were the Penguins' owners. Baldwin 
took over in 1991 and Marino joined up in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the snag, the Lemieux group remains confident an  
agreement can be reached that would allow the sale to close as 
early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of encouraged, actually,'' said John Brabender, a  
Lemieux spokesman. ``We're really not that far apart. Everybody has 
honest intentions in this, and everybody realizes this has to close 
sooner than later. Nobody is going to block this deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brabender hopes the sense of urgency -- the Penguins report to  
training camp in 3 1/2 weeks -- will accelerate an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Lemieux takes over, the team cannot launch a  
ticket-selling campaign or begin marketing the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that everybody is going to work real hard to  
get this done,'' Brabender said. ``There's nothing that is going to 
come out of left field, no big surprise. I believe they want to get 
it a little better for the county. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the conversations I've had, Bob wants to get this done  
... so Mario Lemieux will be the new owner by next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cranmer also objects to a clause that binds the city and county  
to build a new arena for the Penguins by 2002. Allegheny County 
will switch its form of government next year from a panel of three 
commissioners to a single county executive, and Cranmer and Dawida 
will leave office then. 
</P>
<P>
	As the talks with the city and county continue, Lemieux's group  
continued Monday to seek additional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's backers have said for several weeks that the $50  
million in cash needed to close the sale is in place, but the group 
apparently wants more investors to assure that the Penguins can 
field a contending team.

<HEADLINE> Virtual Serengeti Showcases Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	August for parents is when the I.B. index reaches its most  
dangerous levels, but computers can help. 
</P>
<P>
	The I.B. index is the number of times per hour a kid whines  
``I'm bored!'' A more productive response than ``Go to your room!'' 
is available from Grolier Interactive in NATURE: Virtual Serengeti 
for both PC and Macintosh platforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtual Serengeti is an interactive tour of the rich wildlife of  
Africa's Serengeti Plain that allows users to interact virtually 
with the environment and wildlife, getting inside a leopard's head, 
for example, without risking getting inside its stomach. And it's 
lots cheaper than airfare to Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Recommended for users nine years and older, the CD-ROM is hosted  
by George Page of the television series Nature, produced by 
WNET-New York. The premise of the software is that Page sends the 
player to Africa to complete some field research studies for an 
upcoming documentary. The players travels through the Serengeti and 
collects and analyzes video clips of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't exactly a pulse-pounder. But what makes the software  
interesting and worthwhile is the collection of more than 150 
animal video clips and the way the user must discover them. 
</P>
<P>
	The screen view is controlled by sweeping the cursor and it  
offers the illusion of walking along the plains with a full 360 
degrees of motion. When the cursor passes over a part of the 
landscape that would be appropriate for an animal, it changes to a 
video viewfinder and the video clip of that animal runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The background sound is what you would hear as you walked about  
-- insect, bird and beast calls, wind sounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The software allows you to travel to seven different parts of  
this vast plain and includes an interactive field guide with 59 
entries on various animal species, as well as maps. The field guide 
covers topics like animal body language, sounds and body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The animal videos are quite good and the cursor-driven user  
interface is very easy to use. The software opens with a good 
tutorial and installation obligingly installs QuickTime video 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements are relatively modest in light of today's  
muscle-machine approach to computing. For the PC, it's a minimum 
133-megahertz Pentium, 116 megabytes of RAM, 16-bit SVGA video 
display capable of displaying thousands of colors, a six-speed 
CD-ROM, sound card and speakers. For the Mac, 120-megahertz 
PowerPC, 16 megabytes of RAM, OS 7.1 or higher, quad-speed CD-ROM 
and a display capable of thousands of colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Grolier products are widely available at retail and this one  
goes for $29.99, which you'll probably find discounted at some 
outlets. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Couch Stars in NFL Exhibition Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- The night began with the introduction of the  
old stars of the Cleveland Browns. Then the exhibition game started 
and the possible star of the future was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Tim Couch shared the spotlight with the Browns' return to  
the NFL by passing for a touchdown and completing 10 consecutive 
passes. He left after the third quarter, with the Browns eventually 
pulling out a 20-17 overtime victory against the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we did a real good job,'' Couch said. ``Obviously,  
we didn't do everything just like we wanted, but we won the game. 
That means a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 overall draft pick out of Kentucky finished 11-of-17  
for 137 yards, guiding the Browns to 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the opening kickoff, dozens of former Browns standouts  
were introduced before the new Browns expansion franchise played 
its first exhibition game. The franchise had been moved to 
Baltimore in 1996 and renamed the Ravens by owner Art Modell. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch gave a pro-Browns crowd of 25,156 at Fawcett Stadium -- a  
Hall of Fame Game record -- a glimpse of the future instead of 
dwelling on the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch came in for starter Ty Detmer to start the second quarter.  
He threw deep for Kevin Johnson on his first snap, barely 
overthrowing his fellow rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	But Couch more than rectified that by hitting his next 10  
attempts, including a 24-yard scoring pass to Johnson -- his seventh 
straight completion -- to give the Browns a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really special to have my dad, my family, here for my  
first touchdown,'' Couch said. ``That was definitely a great 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the streak, he showed remarkable poise and versatility.  
He avoided a sack by stepping up in the pocket to get away from the 
outside linebackers and deftly flipped a 5-yard pass to fullback 
Tarek Saleh. Couch scrambled for an 8-yard run and a first down on 
his first series and later was rocked hard on a sack by Dat Nguyen 
for a 7-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good to get a couple hits on you,'' Couch said. ``You  
kind of get the cobwebs knocked out of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was 9-for-10 for 88 yards in the opening half, opening a few  
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim Couch had a nice first half,'' Dallas quarterback Troy  
Aikman said. ``He hung in the pocket well and did a good job of 
picking up his secondary receivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his first attempt of the second half, he under threw Darrin  
Chiaverini down the right sideline but Chiaverini adjusted on the 
ball and won the jump ball with a cornerback for a 31-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch was watching from the sideline -- wearing a baseball cap  
and wide smile -- as Phil Dawson kicked the 20-yard field goal that 
gave the Browns the victory.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Administration Backs Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration Monday backed  
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's right to shuffle his prime 
ministers. ``I don't think we should blow this out of proportion,'' 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the prerogative of the president to choose the  
premier,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin pushed Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and the rest of  
his Cabinet through his now-familiar revolving door in a move that 
some analysts said may be related to looming corruption probes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian president named Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent  
and now head of the Federal Security Service, as acting prime 
minister and as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeltsin's move was shrewd and logical,'' Ariel Cohen of the  
Heritage Foundation said in an interview. ``He is struggling for 
his own survival as well as for the survival of his family clan, 
which is under investigation for abuse of power and corruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Graham, senior associate at Carnegie, said ``corruption  
is part of this. It is one of the reasons Stepashin was dismissed 
now and not later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said Stepashin was not moving quickly enough to cut off  
investigations. But also, Yeltsin is looking for a successor and 
Stepashin was not going to be it, he added. ``He did not create a 
good impression abroad,'' Graham said. ``They had doubts Stepashin 
was their man and they had to find someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup came less than two weeks after Stepashin made a  
get-acquainted visit to Washington and reached agreement with Vice 
President Al Gore for negotiations in Moscow later this month on 
another round of nuclear weapons reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks will go ahead, with John D. Holum, under secretary of  
state for arms control, heading the U.S. delegation, an 
administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said both  
President Clinton and Yeltsin had made it clear ``they want their 
folks to push on arms control, nonrpoliferation of dangeorus 
weapons and on eocnomic issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Graham said even before Stepashin's dismissal it become  
clear ``we were not going to make much progress on these anyhow 
until there is a transfer of power in Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials worked with Putin in resolving Russia's role in  
the NATO peacekeeping force, said David Leavy, a White House 
spokesman. ``We work with the Russian government based on policies, 
not personalities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaction from governments around the world was restrained.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that is an internal matter for the Russian  
government,'' said British Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain.

<HEADLINE>  Lukas, Baze Join Horse Racing Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- ``Lucky'' Lukas? No way.  
</P>
<P>
	D. Wayne Lukas has conditioned more champions than any other  
thoroughbred trainer, won a record 13 Breeders Cup races and 
amassed more than $200 million in career purse earnings -- but don't 
call him lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in the luck factor,'' Lukas said Monday,  
moments after being inducted into the National Museum of Racing's 
Hall of Fame. ``If you have to depend on luck in this game, you're 
gonna get beat a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also inducted Monday were jockey Russell Baze and thoroughbred  
racehorses Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Lukas' achievements is long enough to line a  
racetrack. Highlights include receiving the Eclipse Award as the 
nation's top trainer four times, winning the Belmont Stakes three 
times and winning 12 Triple Crown races. His most recent Triple 
Crown victories came this year, when Charismatic won the Derby and 
the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has led the nation in earnings 14 of the last 16 years,  
and his 1998 mark of $17.8 million is a record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ceremony spotlight centered squarely on him, Lukas, 63,  
chose to share the glory with a half-dozen assistants who gathered 
around him onstage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those records would never have happened without these guys,''  
Lukas said, his voice shaking. ``You guys have propped me up, 
carried me. And I know I wasn't easy to work for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tradeout here, and I got the best in the trade --  
just like I do every time I trade (horses) with you guys,'' he 
said, grinning at the other trainers in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	His assistants joked about Lukas' short temper and  
``expletive-laced tirades,'' but they were heavy in their praise. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many things have changed in our industry because of Wayne  
Lukas,'' said former Lukas assistant Mark Hennig. ``So many 
trainers never run multiple divisions, and he's shown us the 
reality that any race is just one flight away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his success, Lukas said it ``hasn't always been blue  
skies and clear sailing in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been solidly criticized by certain people in the industry  
and the media who don't always agree with what we do. But I make no 
apologies for what we've tried to do,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my nature to push the envelope every time,'' he said.  
``If you want a coach who wants to walk the ball up the court, you 
better get another guy, because we're going to run and press all 
the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baze was short with his remarks and blushed as he accepted the  
honor, which he called ``an embarrassment of riches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 25-year career, Baze has ridden 6,662 winners and earned  
more than $94.5 million in purses. He has also been the only rider 
to record 400 or more wins in each of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past four years, Baze has been awarded the Isaac Murphy  
Award, presented by the National Turf Writers Association to the 
jockey with the highest winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I have been able to set those numbers that I have  
for the last couple of years is because I've been able to go out 
every day and do it,'' Baze said. ``I've been blessed that I 
haven't been injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exceller, who raced from 1975 to 1979, came from 22 lengths back  
to beat two Triple Crown winners in the 1 1/2-mile Jockey Club Gold 
Cup in 1978. Exceller won by a nose over Triple Crown winner 
Seattle Slew and Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Miesque, who was based in Europe for her entire racing career,  
made two starts in the United States, won two Grade I races, and 
was voted two Eclipse Awards. She also won a total of eight Group I 
races in France and England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun Bow raised eyebrows in 1964 when he defeated Kelso by 12  
lengths at the Brooklyn Handicap, setting a track record of 1:59. 
That autumn, they split in two dramatic duels in the Aqueduct and 
Woodward Stakes. Gun Bow raced from 1963 until 1965 and earned 
$798,722.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Juneau Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Heavy rain and mist kept authorities from  
recovering the bodies of four people killed when a light plane 
slammed into a hillside just outside Alaska's capital city. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine Cessna 185 barely missed the treetops above a  
popular boat launch on Douglas Island before banking and crashing 
into the slope Sunday evening, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Alaska State Trooper found the wreckage and the bodies a few  
hours later. ``He indicated that the wreckage was pretty spread 
out,'' Juneau Police Lt. Ron Forneris said. The victims had not 
been positively identified late Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Clouds blanketed the Juneau area all day on Sunday, and  
visibility varied as mist moved along the forested hills and marine 
waters. Many of the planes and helicopters that ply southeast 
Alaska's skies during the summer tourist season were absent, 
grounded by poor flying conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Wendeborn was checking incoming boats for the Alaska  
Department of Fish and Game at the boat launch when the plane burst 
into the sky above her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up and he's literally maybe three feet off the top of  
the treetops,'' Wendeborn said. She said the pilot abruptly gave 
the plane full throttle and banked away from the icy waters of 
Gastineau Channel, toward the island's mountainous interior. 
</P>
<P>
	``He put the gas to her and started climbing,'' Wendeborn said.  
``The engine was just screaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the plane zoomed out of her sight, Wendeborn heard it clip  
a tree, and then she heard the engine die, but did not hear an 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Beeler said he heard a plane's engine sputter and die,  
followed by a crash, as he walked back to the road from a fishing 
spot on nearby Fish Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It coughed maybe three times, then there was about three  
seconds of silence, then a crash,'' said Beeler, a tourist visiting 
from Cape Coral, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal National Transportation Safety Board will  
investigate the crash, Forneris said.

<HEADLINE> Allied Domecq Mulls Jinro Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Allied Domecq PLC of Britain is  
negotiating to take over the whiskey operations of South Korea's 
ailing Jinro Group, Jinro officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jinro controls about one-fourth of South Korea's whiskey market,  
which was estimated at $667 million in sales last year and is 
growing fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied Domecq is likely to invest between $150 million and $200  
million to take over management of Jinro's whisky distillery, but 
Jinro will also maintain a stake and provide a distribution 
network, said Jinro spokesman Chun Young-tae. 
</P>
<P>
	The national Yonhap news agency said Allied Domecq and Jinro  
will sign a deal as early as next week, but the Jinro spokesman 
could not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Jinro was South Korea's 19th largest conglomerate and its  
leading alcoholic beverage maker before it went bankrupt in 1997. 
Jinro has since been running under court receivership. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Jinro agreed to sell its beer brewery, Jinro-Coors,  
for $378.4 million to Oriental Brewery Co., a joint venture between 
Belgian brewing giant Interbrew and South Korea's Doosan.

<HEADLINE> Parolee Captured After Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOLSOM, Calif. (AP) -- A parolee in a recreational vehicle led  
police on a high-speed chase that finished in a fiery crash, 
setting off a seven-hour manhunt that ended early Monday when he 
was shot and dragged out of the American River. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sullivan, 35, was arrested after officers wounded him  
following a search along the river's brush-filled banks near 
downtown Folsom east of Sacramento, sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Rick 
Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan was taken to the University of California, Davis  
Medical Center, where he was listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan, a member of the ``Sacramaniacs,'' a white supremacist  
prison gang known for selling drugs and weapons, had been under 
surveillance, wanted for drug violations and evading police by 
fleeing a checkpoint for drunken drivers, Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pursuit began about 7:30 p.m. Sunday after police tried to  
apprehend Sullivan just east of Sacramento. Instead, he drove off, 
firing at officers from his RV as they pursued him on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Several miles later, officers put a spike strip across the  
roadway to stop the vehicle, which crashed down a ravine. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan came out shooting, and officers returned fire,  
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Sullivan fled, the crashed vehicle burned, starting a brush  
fire in the ravine. Flames shot as high as 15 feet and smoke could 
be seen a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, investigators trolled the river to confirm Sullivan's  
statement that there was another person in the recreational 
vehicle, Gibson said. No traces of another person were found as of 
Monday afternoon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan was paroled after serving seven and a half years of a  
14-year prison sentence for voluntary manslaughter, corrections 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempted murder of a police officer and evading police are  
among the charges Sullivan is expected to face, Gibson said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Hails Decision on Clinton Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent counsel Kenneth Starr today  
praised an Arkansas judge's decision declaring that President 
Clinton gave false testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was very strong language,'' Starr said of the  
decision last month by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	While Starr wouldn't call her decision vindication in an  
interview with the NBC ``Today'' show, he did say: ``This is a very 
distinguished judge who looked at the facts and came to these 
conclusions. And I would just add that the system, did, in fact, 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has been investigating Clinton and his wife, Hillary, for  
over five years, and is thought to be winding down the probe. 
Clinton was impeached by the House last December in connection with 
the Monica Lewinsky case, but acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton White House has said that Clinton will pay the  
$90,000 fine levied by Judge Wright. The judge said in the July 29 
ruling she hoped that it might deter others ``who might consider 
emulating the president's misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which is in addition to $850,000 awarded Mrs. Jones  
in a settlement of her sexual harassment case, was aimed at 
covering legal costs related the president's denial that he had a 
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NBC interview today, Starr also said he ``was horrified''  
when Congress quickly released his report on Clinton to the public 
and allowed it to be posted on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the report contained many salacious details of  
Clinton's conduct, Starr said, ``Now, I have said and I will say 
again today, I don't think I did enough to warn the Congress, to 
say ... this is sensitive material. But I really did think, and I 
don't mean to criticize Congress, it made its decision and it was a 
broad bipartisan decision that that we're simply going to turn this 
information over to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he saw the telecast in which Hillary Rodham Clinton  
blamed her husband's problems on ``a vast right-wing conspiracy,'' 
and said that he ``simply took it as her sense of loyalty in light 
of the president denying the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr refused to comment on whether he might still seek  
Clinton's indictment. ``On that, I'm not going to comment at all,'' 
he said. ``It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting at all 
about the future of the investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Space Station Illnesses Downplayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Stale air inside NASA's new space  
station may have sickened astronauts on the last supply run, but 
the doctor on board says the headaches, nausea and dry, itchy eyes 
were ``no big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Daniel Barry says the symptoms were so fleeting, and so  
benign, that neither he nor his six crewmates reported their 
illnesses until a couple of weeks after they returned to Earth -- to 
the dismay of NASA, which now may never be able to diagnose the 
problem. The space agency is changing guidelines for future crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry says it's impossible to know whether the symptoms were  
caused by stagnant air or chemical fumes inside the station as some 
reports suggest, or whether it was simply prolonged space motion 
sickness. His own stuffy nose and headaches, for example, were no 
worse than what he experienced on a previous flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Any indication by NASA officials or others that the crew was  
very sick is ``way overblown,'' Barry told The Associated Press. 
``I don't think we had any more nausea on this flight than you 
would typically have on a flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As a physician, I didn't have a significant medical concern  
for the health of the crew,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry insists he would have intervened if someone was really  
sick. The astronauts were warned before their May 27 launch about 
possible atmosphere problems aboard the space station, and so Barry 
kept close watch over his crewmates. 
</P>
<P>
	When ill, the astronauts simply retreated to the docked space  
shuttle Discovery and relaxed or had lunch, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is taking the matter seriously, nonetheless. A team has  
been appointed to evaluate the air inside the space station and 
help prevent future visitors from becoming ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts are not due back at the space station until December.  
The first permanent crew doesn't move in until March. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation is especially difficult because none of the  
astronauts were wearing medical sensors and none of them took air 
samples when they became ill. As a result, NASA has to rely on 
anecdotal information, said Jim Van Laak, deputy manager of space 
station operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Space flight can be quite uncomfortable for some people'' even  
under the best of circumstances, Van Laak said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA refuses to elaborate on the illnesses or identify who got  
sick, citing medical privacy. But in a seven-page internal report 
obtained and published last month by an independent Web site called 
NASA Watch, the space agency listed the medical problems and 
possible causes. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S., Russian and Canadian crew spent less than 3 1/2 days inside  
the international space station at the end of May and beginning of 
June, making repairs and stocking its two rooms with supplies. The 
station had been sealed since the last shuttle visit six months 
earlier; the first crew reported no health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Russian module containing air purifiers and other  
life-support equipment had yet to arrive -- its much-delayed launch 
is off until November -- systems aboard Discovery were used to 
cleanse the station atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Air in the station was routed to the shuttle and back again, and  
it's possible a duct could have been blocked, Van Laak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the astronauts used handheld fans and limited their  
time in the Russian control module Zarya -- one astronaut used a 
timer to alert her when to leave -- carbon dioxide still may have 
built up back there. Unlike on Earth, exhaled carbon dioxide does 
not float away in space.

<P>
	Barry, 45, said he could tell the air was stale when all seven  
gathered for pictures in the U.S.-built chamber, Unity. In 
retrospect, he wishes he would have taken air samples then. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew collected air samples only twice, just as they were  
supposed to: when they entered and left the station. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is requesting more air samples on future flights,  
especially when astronauts feel sick. Managers also are asking 
crews to promptly report any illnesses, and are considering 
individual carbon-dioxide monitors -- a recommendation from Barry.

<HEADLINE> J.P. Morgan Plays a Golden Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- J. Pierpont Morgan played run-on games of  
solitaire in his hotel suite near the White House and filled the 
room with the smoke of expensive cigars. It was early on the 
morning of Feb. 5, 1895, and the financier did not enjoy being kept 
waiting -- even by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The call finally came from Grover Cleveland, who was laboring to  
rescue the country from an economic depression worsened by a 
confidence-shattering run on the gold reserves in the U.S. 
Treasury. ``Have you anything to suggest?'' the president asked 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan believed he could stanch the flow and save the country's  
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	By the 1890s, gold had acquired the sheen of myth and power.  
Those who favored keeping the United States on the gold standard 
were dubbed ``gold bugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the South and West -- heavy with farmers and  
ranchers, small businessmen and workers -- saw the gold bugs as the 
center of an Eastern conspiracy that arrayed farmers against 
capital, creditors against debtors. 
</P>
<P>
	Their remedy was to topple gold and replace it with silver, to  
put more money in circulation by coining silver dollars, thus 
eliminating tight money and advancing prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1896, the demand for silver would reach its highest point  
when William Jennings Bryan electrified the Democratic convention 
by confronting supporters of the gold standard and declaring, ``You 
shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But meanwhile, the demand for cheap money and the inflation it  
would bring, the fear that the gold standard would be overthrown, 
alarmed European and American investors and gold began a retreat 
across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	By custom, not law, the U.S. gold reserve had been maintained at  
$100 million and that level had a hold on the popular imagination. 
A dollar less than $100 million was seen as a step toward disaster. 
And by 1895 the gold reserve was evaporating like a reservoir in a 
summer drought. 
</P>
<P>
	In her biography, ``Morgan, American Financier,'' published this  
year by Random House, historian Jean Strouse wrote that the 
Treasury gold reserve had fallen below $60 million by the spring of 
1893. The president and Congress tried to refill it by issuing 
bonds. The gold flowed out faster than before. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan promised to form an international syndicate to buy gold  
and to protect the Treasury from further withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
	``As he saw it, his efforts to stem the drain, avert default and  
restore confidence in the dollar would protect the billions 
invested in the United States and reopen the channels for foreign 
capital,'' Strouse wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Feb. 4, 1895, the Treasury canceled further negotiations  
with the financier. The president would compel Congress to 
authorize gold bonds for public sale instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan, believing the news would result in a stock market crash,  
ordered out his private railroad car. Arriving in Washington, he 
was told Cleveland was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come to Washington to see the president and I am going  
to stay until I see him,'' Morgan said. He retired to the Arlington 
Hotel, where he slipped the cards from their silver case and began 
to play solitaire while smoking ``a large Rosa de Santiago 
Celestiale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The invitation came at 9:30 the next morning. Morgan and his  
people walked across Lafayette Square to the White House. Morgan 
held an unlit cigar in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	After perfunctory handshakes, he found himself ignored while  
Cleveland and his people conferred among themselves. Morgan found a 
seat in a corner of the president's office listening to the others 
talk. He held on to the cigar but did not light it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in the position of a messenger waiting for an answer,''  
his son-in-law said later. ``It was not a situation he was used 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a call came in reporting there was just $9 million  
in gold left in the New York subtreasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan said that was unfortunate because there were $12 million  
in drafts against that gold. Everyone knew that there was little 
chance Congress, with its growing numbers of free-silver advocates, 
would choose to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the president turned to the financier. ``Have you  
anything to suggest?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan played his card.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he had located a dusty but still valid 1862 law that  
authorized the secretary of the Treasury to put the government into 
debt to buy gold coins on his own authority without having to get 
congressional approval to issue bonds to buy the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The tension broke and the financier and the president began to  
work out terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland asked if Morgan could guarantee that the gold being  
purchased would not simply resume its flow out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The financier offered the guarantees, knowing that with his  
connections he could keep them -- and realize the profits that went 
with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan stood. His trousers and the White House carpet around him  
were covered in a fine brown dust. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan had, without realizing it, ground the unlit cigar in  
his hand to powder. 
</P>
<P>
	------

<HEADLINE> State Farm Faces Car Parts Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- When motorists take their cars to the repair  
shop after a fender bender, they may find their insurer insists on 
the use of cheaper, and possibly inferior, replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
	That practice will be the focus on a class-action lawsuit  
against State Farm Insurance Co. that could fundamentally change 
the way insurance companies pay for car repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection was set to begin today, with arguments expected  
to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed on behalf of 5.5 million current and former  
State Farm auto insurance customers, could cost State Farm more 
than $2 billion and force the nation's largest auto insurer to drop 
its policy of insisting on cheaper replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The case marks the latest chapter in a debate over auto parts  
that has gone on for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	It involves door panels, hoods, fenders and other parts modeled  
on original equipment produced by automakers, but made without 
benefit of the original specifications. Known in the industry as 
aftermarket replacements, these parts made up about 15 percent of 
all crash-repair parts used last year, according to the 
Inter-Industry Conference on Auto Collision Repair, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs contend that State Farm breached its contract with  
customers and violated Illinois consumer fraud laws when it 
required cars be fixed with parts that don't return the vehicles to 
the ``pre-loss condition'' called for in its policies. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 40 other companies have policies requiring or favoring  
the use of aftermarket parts, but only Bloomington-based State Farm 
is named in this lawsuit. Plaintiff's attorney Don Barrett said 
State Farm was targeted because it is the industry leader and 
because of its policy requiring customers to pay more if they want 
original equipment parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way State Farm policyholders can be assured of getting  
original equipment parts is to pay the extra cost themselves -- an 
average of $100 to $150 per repair job, plaintiffs contend. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm says aftermarket parts are just as good as the others  
and save customers money. 
</P>
<P>
	Using such parts ``allows for competition in the crash part  
replacement market and keeps the costs consumers pay through 
insurance for auto repairs lower,'' spokesman Bill Sirola said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Frey was involved in an accident with a truck, she had  
been restoring her 1988 Mustang in hopes of selling it to a 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the car ``looks like a reject,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	State Farm, which insures one of every five cars in the United  
States, tells body shops to use aftermarket parts if available. 
About 20 percent of the company's repairs use such parts, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	A February Consumer Reports evaluation of aftermarket parts  
found they typically take longer to install, often do not fit as 
well and are more rust-prone. Consumers Union, which publishes 
Consumer Reports, urged the Federal Trade Commission to require 
consumer consent for use of such parts and CU also suggested 
establishing safety standards for replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also charge some parts can lead to lower resale values  
and higher crash repair bills in the future. The Consumer Reports 
study said aftermarket bumpers performed miserably -- in a 5-mph 
crash involving a Ford bumper, damages totaled $235, compared to 
$1,320 for an aftermarket bumper. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirola said State Farm does not use aftermarket bumpers because  
they are not approved by the Certified Automotive Parts 
Association, an insurance-industry organization that sets standards 
for aftermarket parts. 
</P>
<P>
	But CAPA-approved parts have also been criticized. Last year,  
the Automotive Service Association, a trade group of nearly 13,000 
body shops, withdrew its representative from CAPA's board, saying 
CAPA had done too little to improve the quality of replacement 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
	CAPA executive director Jack Gillis did not return telephone  
calls seeking comment. In 1990, State Farm paid $100,000 to 
Illinois policyholders to settle a suit over similar allegations. 
The company also agreed in a 1995 San Diego case to pay $3.5 
million toward parts testing and give $35 refunds to affected 
policyholders.

<HEADLINE> ExciteAtHome Stock Drops on Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ExciteAtHome shares plunged more than 10 percent  
Monday following a report that AT&AMP;T Corp. was in talks with America 
Online Inc. to allow it to offer Internet services over the phone 
company's cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a deal would allow the two companies to combine their  
extensive technical and marketing expertise, while at the same time 
would diminish the role of ExciteAtHome by eliminating its 
exclusive rights to provide high-speed Internet and communications 
services through the AT&AMP;T's network. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Monday, AT&AMP;T denied that any specific discussions  
were ongoing, though it acknowledged it has talked with AOL in the 
past. AT&AMP;T also said it would honor its current contract with 
ExciteAtHome. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome shares fell $4.56 1/4, at $38 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange. AOL was up 81 1/4 cents to $85.56 1/4, while AT&AMP;T 
was down 81 1/4 cents at $50.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of the talks appeared in Monday's New York Times.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past several months, AT&AMP;T has spent billions buying cable  
companies to create a national network for local telephone and 
high-speed Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its deal last summer to acquire Tele-Communications  
Inc., AT&AMP;T received stake in AtHome and an agreement to give AtHome 
exclusive Internet use of its cable systems into the next decade. 
AtHome merged with Excite in May. 
</P>
<P>
	However, AT&AMP;T has run into problems with local cable officials --  
first in Portland, Ore., then in Broward County in Florida -- who 
say the telecommunications giant must open up it's high-speed cable 
network to competing Internet service providers. AT&AMP;T is appealing 
both decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Jeff Ware of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. said he thinks  
AT&AMP;T will explore deals with other Internet service providers once 
its exclusivity contract with ExciteAtHome expires in June 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``(AT&AMP;T has) said before that they're open to deals with other  
cable ISPs after this time period is over. They don't want to be 
tied down to one provider,'' he said. ``When these deals expire 
it's up to ExciteAtHome to renegotiate another deal. It's their 
business to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., has more than 17 million subscribers,  
and operates the most visited network of Web sites, according to 
Media Metrix. Redwood City, Calif.-based ExciteAtHome, which is 26 
percent owned by AT&AMP;T, uses cable TV systems to provide high-speed 
Internet access to consumers

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Sign First-Round Pick Bryant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- First-round draft pick Fernando Bryant  
ended his 11-day holdout Monday, signing a five-year, $5.3 million 
deal with the Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerback participated sparingly in the afternoon practice  
then said he was happy the holdout, the first protracted one in the 
Jaguars' short history, was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt some pressure on myself,'' Bryant said. ``But the  
bottom line is, I'm a football player. The other problem wasn't me. 
I'm out here to help the team. That's what I'm here to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant, a four-year starter at Alabama, sought a four-year  
contract, feeling that if he played well his first three seasons, 
he would have more leverage in a possible renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars are not in the practice of offering four-year deals  
to rookies and didn't change with this one, although the team 
didn't want to portray anybody as a winner or loser in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never any animosity,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. ``We  
had to work with the young man to get him here. Everyone wanted him 
here. We were disappointed he was not here. But it was a business 
deal. It's a win-win situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant got a $2.1 million signing bonus, about $200,000 more  
than was initially on the table. He's slated to make $844,000 in 
his first year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal came after he sat with Coughlin, senior vice president  
Michael Huyghue and owner Wayne Weaver and received assurances they 
would renegotiate if he has a successful first three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said if I come in and help the team the way I'm supposed  
to help the team, everything will be taken care of,'' Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	His arrival will heat up an already spirited battle for  
Jacksonville's starting cornerback position. Bryant was one of 
three players the Jaguars drafted at the position in an attempt to 
improve a pass defense rated 23rd last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's starters, Dave Thomas and Aaron Beasley, were listed  
first on the depth chart heading into training camp. Coughlin said 
Bryant's absence from the team's first 14 practices doesn't 
preclude him from starting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to see what kind of shape he's in, how well he can  
work,'' Coughlin said. ``We'll see this week. The big thing is, 
he's in now and we've got a chance to work with him. He's way 
behind. But we've got a chance to work with him.''

<HEADLINE> McDowell Released by Angels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Former Cy Young Award winner Jack  
McDowell, who failed in his attempt to make a comeback from elbow 
and shoulder surgery, was placed on unconditional release waivers 
Monday by the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old right-hander, who joined the Angels as a free  
agent in February 1998 and re-signed for this season, was 0-4 with 
an 8.05 ERA in four starts. He began the season on the disabled 
list and wasn't activated until July 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13-year veteran and three-time All-Star led the Chicago  
White Sox to the 1993 AL West title with a league-leading and 
career-high 22 victories -- joining Early Wynn and LaMarr Hoyt as 
the only Chicago White Sox pitchers to win the Cy Young Award. He 
has a 127-87 career record with 62 complete games and a 3.85 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim called up 27-year-old right-hander Lou Pote from  
Triple-A Edmonton, where he was 7-9 with a 4.50 ERA in 23 starts 
and one relief appearance. Last season in Double-A, he was 8-10 
with a 5.31 ERA in 19 starts and 13 relief appearances for Midland.

<HEADLINE> Actor Victor Mature Dies at 86 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. (AP) -- Victor Mature, the brawny star of  
the 1940s and '50s who played Samson in ``Samson and Delilah'' and 
Doc Holliday in John Ford's ``My Darling Clementine,'' has died. He 
was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Mature, who largely retired from films around 1960, had suffered  
from cancer for three years, said a longtime friend in the 
entertainment business, Zollie Volchok. The San Diego County 
coroner's office said it was notified that Mature died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tall, dark-haired and muscular, with heavy-lidded eyes and a  
full mouth, Mature earned the nickname ``beautiful hunk of man'' in 
films like ``One Million B.C.'' and ``Song of the Islands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While first making his name as a glamour-boy star with a  
devil-may-care attitude, he gradually gained more critical respect 
in the late 1940s in such films as ``Cry of the City'' and ``Kiss 
of Death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared in musicals, Westerns, comedies, historical epics  
and melodramas. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``My Darling Clementine,'' 1946, he was Doc Holliday to Henry  
Fonda's Wyatt Earp. The version of the fabled gunfight at the O.K. 
Corral is considered one of Ford's greatest films. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 telling of the saga of Samson and  
Delilah cast Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the title roles. It was a 
smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at 20th Century Fox for many years but often loaned out  
to other studios as well. ``They turned pictures out like 
crackerjack,'' he told The New York Times in 1971. ```Kiss of 
Death' got made because Fox was one black-and-white picture short 
on its schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That 1947 film paired Mature with a screen newcomer, Richard  
Widmark. Mature played a thief who turned state's evidence, Widmark 
a psychopathic killer. The film caused a sensation and earned 
Widmark an Academy Award nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Mature's other films: ``The Shanghai Gesture,'' 1941,  
directed by Josef von Sternberg; ``My Gal Sal,'' 1942, with Rita 
Hayworth; ``I Wake Up Screaming,'' 1941, with Betty Grable; 
``Wabash Avenue,'' 1950, again with Miss Grable; ``The Robe,'' 
1953, as the slave Demetrius; a sequel, ``Demetrius and the 
Gladiators, 1954; and ``Chief Crazy Horse,'' 1954, with Mature in 
the title role. 
</P>
<P>
	Mature was a favorite of reporters during his heyday, always  
available for interviews. He enjoyed deflating the pomposities of 
Hollywood as well as his own image. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his favorite stories concerned the making of ``Samson and  
Delilah.'' DeMille wanted him to wrestle with a tame movie lion for 
a crucial action scene. The actor refused. ``But Jackie never hurt 
anyone; he doesn't even have any teeth,'' DeMille argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah?'' Mature replied. ``I don't want to be gummed to death,  
either.'' A stunt man tussled with Jackie, and Mature did his 
closeups with a lion skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful with his money unless a friend was in need, he invested  
in real estate and retail stores, enabling him to retire 
comfortably before he reached 45. He moved to Rancho Santa Fe, and 
once bragged that he played golf four hours a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	He made only a few film appearances in the past 35 years,  
notably the 1966 Italian farce ``After the Fox,'' in which he 
spoofed his old image; and ``Every Little Crook and Nanny,'' a 1972 
comedy in which he co-starred with Lynn Redgrave. In 1984 he made a 
rare appearance on television, playing Samson's father in a new 
version of ``Samson and Delilah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making fun of the notion that he was just a pretty face, he  
liked to joke that he once tried to get into a country club that 
didn't accept actors by saying, ``Hell, I'm no actor, and I've got 
28 pictures and a scrapbook of reviews to prove it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said he ``took acting five times as seriously as  
anyone else. I just couldn't show it. Some kind of complex, I 
guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mature was born Jan. 29, 1913 -- some references say 1915 and  
1916 -- in Louisville, Ky., the son of an Austrian immigrant who 
became a successful businessman. Coming to California in the 
mid-'30s, he studied at the Pasadena Playhouse, paying his way with 
odd jobs because he didn't want to rely on his father. He made his 
screen debut with a small role in ``The Housekeeper's Daughter,'' 
1939. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of his stardom, Mature dated stars such as Miss  
Hayworth and Lana Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	He was married five times. Survivors include his wife, Lorey, a  
former Chicago opera singer, and their daughter, Victoria, who 
recently graduated from an opera program at the University of 
California, San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral service was to be held in Louisville, Ky., on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 'Sixth Sense' Tops 'Witch', 'Bride' / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Darkened theaters turned into mass seances as  
the summer's latest fright film, the tale of a boy who talks with 
the dead, debuted at No. 1 in North American theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychological thriller ``The Sixth Sense'' starring Bruce  
Willis and Toni Collette took in $25.8 million, according to 
industry estimates released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-budget horror hit ``The Blair Witch Project'' stayed in  
second place with $24.5 million. Last week's top movie, the Julia 
Roberts-Richard Gere comedy ``Runaway Bride,'' fell to third with 
$21 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' a Pierce Brosnan-Rene Russo remake  
of the Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway crime caper, opened at No. 4 with 
$14.6 million. The superhero comic-book spoof ``Mystery Men'' 
premiered in sixth place with $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iron Giant,'' an animated film about a robot who falls to  
Earth, took in $5.7 million to debut at No. 9. ``Dick,'' a satiric 
retelling of the Watergate scandal through the antics of President 
Nixon's teen-age dog-walkers and secret advisers, came in a 
disappointing 11th with $2.2 million in its first weekend, for a 
total of $3.4 million since opening Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a low-key ad campaign, ``The Sixth Sense'' managed to  
rise above a crowd of new releases, said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks box office 
ticket sales. The movie ads used hushes and whispers to intrigue 
filmgoers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say when you whisper, it gets people to listen. They did  
listen in this case,'' Dergarabedian said. ``People are just hungry 
for horror movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with four other major new releases, ``The Sixth Sense''  
had to contend with ``Runaway Bride'' and ``Blair Witch,'' which 
earned a combined $64.3 million last weekend. ``Runaway Bride'' has 
taken in $74.1 million in 10 days, while ``Blair Witch'' has 
grossed $80.2 million, most of it since going into wide release 10 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in the face of blockbusters like that, we were able to  
work through the clutter,'' said Chuck Viane, head of distribution 
for Disney, which released ``The Sixth Sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sixth Sense'' was the highest-grossing movie ever to open  
in August, surpassing ``The Fugitive,'' which took in $23.7 million 
in 1993. It was Willis' second-best opening ever, behind 
``Armageddon,'' which grossed $36 million in its debut last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in 2,161 theaters, the movie averaged $11,939 a screen.  
``Blair Witch,'' which did a stratospheric $26,528 a screen when it 
hit wide release last weekend, averaged $11,438 in 2,142 theaters 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan Entertainment, distributor of ``Blair Witch,'' and its  
filmmakers spent just $350,000 producing the movie. Artisan expects 
it to top $100 million at the box office by next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 'Sixth Sense' wasn't out this weekend, we clearly would  
have been No. 1,'' said Steve Rothenberg, Artisan executive vice 
president of domestic distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' finally dropped  
out of the top 10 after 11 weeks. The movie came in at No. 12 with 
$2.2 million, for a domestic total of $412.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $25.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Blair Witch Project,'' $24.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Runaway Bride,'' $21 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' $14.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Deep Blue Sea,'' $11 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Mystery Men,'' $10 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Inspector Gadget,'' $8.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Haunting,'' $6.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Iron Giant,'' $5.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``American Pie,'' $4 million.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com, New York Times Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc. and The New York Times Co. have  
settled a legal dispute over the online retailer's use of the 
Times' best-seller list in promoting discounts for its books. 
</P>
<P>
	Since mid-May, Amazon.com has offered 50 percent discounts on  
books that appear on the Times' list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times objected to Amazon's republication of the list without  
permission, however saying that it constituted an unlawful use of 
intellectual property. Amazon filed a federal court lawsuit on June 
4, asking that it be allowed to continue to refer to the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced Monday, the Times will allow  
Amazon to continue using the list, and Amazon will continue to 
supply the Times with its sales data. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon agreed to delay posting the list until the Times has made  
it available to the general public and include a disclaimer that 
the Times is not affiliated with and does not endorse Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon also will continue listing the Times' best-seller books  
in alphabetical order, rather than by numerical sales ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon's major online competitor for book sales,  
barnesandnoble.com of New York, offers a similar discount for 
Times' best-sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes and Noble has an arrangement with The Times under which  
people who read a book review on the Times' Web site can click a 
link and order the book from barnesandnoble.com. Barnes and Noble 
spokesman Ben Boyd said the deal provides the Times a commission on 
books sold that way and lets barnesandnoble.com use Times content, 
including the best-seller list.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Teamsters Ratify Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Teamsters at Anheuser-Busch Cos. have approved  
a new five-year national labor contract, but the threat of a strike 
still looms after half of the brewery's 12 domestic plants rejected 
local contract provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch -- maker of Budweiser, Bud Light,  
Michelob and other beers -- said that until there is agreement on 
all national and local contracts, there is no deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will certainly try to resolve the local contract  
supplements, but we're not ruling out the possibility of striking 
in the future,'' Teamster spokesman Bret Caldwell said Sunday 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch spokesman John E. Jacob said the two parties  
would likely meet this week to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 8,000 bottlers, distillers, truck drivers and mechanics  
ratified the national contract by a 59 percent margin on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But local contract supplements, which address plant-specific  
issues such as mandatory overtime and hiring of seasonal help, were 
rejected in St. Louis; Cartersville, Ga.; Fort Collins, Colo.; and 
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Some locals at the plants in Newark, N.J., and Los Angeles also  
rejected the contract supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were approved in Columbus, Ohio; Baldwinsville, N.Y.;  
Williamsburg, Va.; Houston; Fairfield, Ca.; and Merrimack, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal promises workers more than $24 per hour by 2004, with  
slightly more than that paid each hour for benefits. But some union 
members have complained that it doesn't go far enough on issues 
such as job security, mandatory overtime and subcontracting. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch and the Teamsters have been in negotiations for  
22 months. The old contract expired in March 1998.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 10, Orioles 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Paul Sorrento homered for the second  
straight game and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays extended their mastery 
over the Baltimore Orioles with a 10-9 victory Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays beat the Orioles for the sixth straight time  
since a 10-7 loss on opening day. Their two-year record of 13-6 
against Baltimore is the club's best versus any opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorrento hit his ninth homer in the fifth inning, a two-run shot  
to right off Jason Johnson (3-6), who allowed nine runs and 12 hits 
in four innings in his first start against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Smith, starting at third base with Wade Boggs taking the  
night off, had a pair of RBI singles for the Devil Rays. Tony 
Graffanino also drove in two runs with a double. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Ryan Rupe (6-6) gave up five runs and five hits in five  
innings. Roberto Hernandez, the sixth Tampa Bay pitcher, worked the 
ninth to earn his 31st save in 34 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed an RBI groundout to Brady Anderson before getting  
Mike Bordick to fly out with the tying run on second. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Baines, who has six RBIs in his last two games, hit a  
two-run homer -- his 23rd -- off Rupe in the sixth. Bordick had a 
two-run triple for the Orioles before scoring on B.J. Surhoff's 
single in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, trailing 10-5, scored three runs against the Tampa  
Bay bullpen on Jeff Conine's sacrifice fly in the seventh and Brady 
Anderson's RBI single and Surhoff's sacrifice fly in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles wasted an opportunity to pull the game out when  
Esteban Yan struck out Conine with the bases loaded to end the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the fourth in five games for Tampa Bay, which  
took two of three during a weekend in which Boggs also got his 
3,000th hit against the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks, in part, to its success against the Orioles, the  
last-place Devil Rays are 20-16 in the AL East. Outside their 
division, they are 27-49. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore, which is 8-26 in the AL East, has lost 10 of 14  
games. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Boggs was named co-AL player of the week, sharing the with  
Oakland's Miguel Tejada. He will donate the jersey, batting gloves, 
shoes and cap he wore for his 3,000th hit to the Hall of Fame. The 
Devil Rays will add manager Larry Rothschild's lineup card, a 
ticket stub and commemorative card. ... Sorrento's homer gave Tampa 
Bay 111 this season, equaling their total from all of last year 
when the Devil Rays had the fewest in baseball ... Six straight 
Devil Rays reached base in the second and again in the fifth ... 
The Orioles have been outscored 90-45 in the second inning ... 
Surhoff snapped an 0-for-12 slump with his RBI single in the third 
... Anderson stole two bases, making him 26 of 30. ... The 
attendance was 17,796, down from the 35,729 the Devil Rays averaged 
against Cleveland with Boggs chasing his 3,000th hit.

<HEADLINE> 4 Retailers Settle Sweatshop Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four prominent retailers agreed Monday to  
settle a federal class-action lawsuit claiming garment industry 
sweatshop abuses on the U.S. territory of Saipan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under settlements filed in U.S. District Court, Nordstrom Inc.,  
J. Crew Group Inc., Cutter &AMP; Buck Inc. and Gymboree Corp. agreed to 
require independent monitoring of their Saipan contractors in 
working toward compliance with U.S. labor laws and international 
human rights treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to destroy the garment industry in Saipan, but it  
should not come at the price of indentured servitude,'' plaintiff 
attorney William Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder still must approve the  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Three lawsuits filed Jan. 13 described approximately 32  
contractors in Saipan as ``America's worst sweatshop'' where there 
were beatings, forced abortions, vermin-infested quarters, barbed 
wire and armed guards. Employees worked 12 hours a day, seven days 
a week, the suits claim. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Los Angeles class-action suit against 17 retailers,  
attorneys for the remaining 13 defendants argued Monday that 
California has no jurisdiction and the case should be moved to 
Saipan. The judge told lawyers to submit more documents next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Another federal suit filed in Saipan, targeting overtime pay,  
was dismissed by a judge on Friday because the identification of 
``John Doe'' plaintiffs could jeopardize their safety on the 
island, Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile the third suit, filed at state court in San Francisco  
against 18 retailers, will also be settled, Lerach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the settlement, the companies will establish a  
$1.25 million fund to finance the independent monitoring program, 
provide money to the workers, create a public education campaign 
and attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the settlement is a positive step toward our goal  
of ensuring that the goods we contract to manufacture in Saipan are 
made in compliance with law,'' Nordstrom's co-president, Erik 
Nordstrom, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel like we should've been in this suit to begin  
with. We think that we would have prevailed in the case had we 
stuck it out, but this is a business decision,'' said Harvey Jones, 
chairman and CEO of Cutter &AMP; Buck. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that his company already closely monitored its  
contractors for wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Statements released by J. Crew and Gymboree stressed the  
companies weren't admitting any wrongdoing in settling the suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys also filed a letter of agreement in principle to  
settle with Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., 
Donna Karan International Inc. and Chadwick's of Boston Ltd., who 
were about to be named as defendants in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuses in Saipan, a 13-mile-long Western Pacific island in the  
Northern Marianas, had been documented previously, but the 
class-action suits were the first legal attempt to hold U.S. 
retailers accountable for alleged mistreatment of workers by 
subcontractors under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32 Saipan factories -- mostly owned by Chinese, Japanese and  
Korean subcontractors -- stamp their clothing with ``Made in the 
USA'' tags, misleading consumers to think the clothing was made in 
compliance with U.S. labor laws, the suits alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fiscal year that ended in October, the Saipan companies  
shipped an estimated $1 billion in wholesale clothing duty-free to 
the U.S. mainland, saving more than $200 million, according to 
plaintiffs' attorney William Lerach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northern Marianas, seized by U.S. troops from Japan in World  
War II, negotiated a commonwealth relationship with Washington that 
left control of immigration and minimum wages in local hands. It 
also exempted Saipan's exports from the U.S. duties and quotas that 
limit imports.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Defamation Suit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Calling Jack Kevorkian ``virtually `libel  
proof,''' a divided state Court of Appeals dismissed a defamation 
lawsuit filed by the assisted-suicide advocate against two medical 
groups that called him a ``killer'' in their literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Such lawsuits should be dismissed in cases ```where an allegedly  
libelous statement cannot realistically cause impairment of 
reputation because the person's reputation is already so low,''' 
the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find that, as to the issue of assisted suicide, plaintiff  
is virtually `libel proof,''' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 ruling, released Monday, was praised by an attorney for  
the Michigan State Medical Society, a defendant in the case along 
with the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	William McHenry, a lawyer for Kevorkian, said the ruling will be  
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence for second-degree  
murder and drug delivery in the lethal injection of Thomas Youk, 
52, a Lou Gehrig's disease patient. Kevorkian, 71, says he has 
attended more than 130 suicides.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Residents of Nagasaki joined in a prayer for peace  
today, the 54th anniversary of the second atomic bomb attack on 
Japan in the closing days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our city of Nagasaki was instantly transformed into charred  
ruins,'' Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito said in a commemorative ceremony 
marking the bombing, which killed more than 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``From this hellish experience, we have gained the conviction  
that the existence of nuclear weapons cannot be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on the southwestern Japanese city on Aug. 9, 1945  
came three days after the United States carried out the world's 
first atomic bombing on nearby Hiroshima in an effort to force the 
Japanese into surrender. The Hiroshima blast killed 140,000 people. 
Japan surrendered unconditionally on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11:02 a.m., the exact moment of the bombing, people with  
hands clasped in prayer observed a moment of silence in Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Bells at churches and Buddhist temples echoed through the city,  
610 miles southwest of Tokyo. The wail of sirens at city fire 
departments went off at the same time, as white doves flapped into 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the only nation in the world to suffer atomic bombings, we  
must be determined never to repeat the tragedies of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said in a message delivered 
by one of his Cabinet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi praised a resolution adopted at a U.N. conference held in  
Nagasaki last November to make sure that it remains ``the last 
city'' to suffer atomic attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the survivors of the bombing who have died since the  
previous year's anniversary are added to an official list kept by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The list, which does not include those who died in the initial  
bombing, was started in 1968 with more than 26,000 names. The city 
acknowledges that some names are likely missing because of a lack 
of records. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the names of 2,733 people were added to the list,  
which now holds the names of 121,588 people. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a century later, even those who survived the  
blast continue to suffer physically and emotionally. Many of those 
who survived the initial blast suffered radiation sickness and fear 
their children might become sick or be targets of social 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people shun marriages with bomb victims or their  
descendants because of fears about radiation sickness being passed 
down over the generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of those who remain today live in a state of loneliness  
and anxiety,'' Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forever changed what  
mankind knew to be the destructive potential of warfare. And the 
bombings continue to be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide Asahi newspaper reported last week that the U.S.  
bomber was running out of fuel and dropped its load on Nagasaki 
without being able to visually confirm the target because of thick 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary target for the Aug. 9 mission was Kokura, another  
southwestern city, with Nagasaki the second choice. There were too 
many clouds over Kokura, so the B-29 changed course for Nagasaki, 
the Asahi quoted retired former Army Lt. Gen. Frederick Ashworth 
and co-pilot Fred Olivi as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders had required that the bomber return without dropping the  
bomb if the target could not be seen, the Asahi said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate anniversary ceremony in Nagasaki, more than 200  
people gathered to remember the 10,000 Koreans who died in the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Koreans who had been forcibly brought to Nagasaki during Japan's  
1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula were working at 
factories or other projects when the bomb fell.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Economic Mood Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Business sentiment in Japan improved sharply in the  
April-June quarter and is expected to rise further in the next two 
quarters, a government survey of corporations showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly study by the Economic Planning Agency showed the  
percentage of companies saying conditions had improved catching up 
with those who saw conditions worsening. 
</P>
<P>
	The ratio -- called the diffusion index -- improved from minus-26  
in the January-March quarter to minus-8 in the April-June quarter, 
the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes as Japan is fighting to emerge from its deepest  
economic downturn since World War II. Though the economy grew in 
the first quarter, the country is still grappling with record high 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey suggests businesses are increasingly optimistic that  
growth will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA survey showed that companies expect the economy to  
improve toward the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the July-September period, the diffusion index is forecast  
to rise to a plus-10, followed by plus-24 in the October-December 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	A positive reading in the July-September period would mark the  
first time the index has stood in positive territory in 10 
quarters, an agency official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also showed that corporations see mild improvement in  
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	On a darker note, however, the survey showed that private  
capital investment remains depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first half of the year, companies reduced capital  
expenditure by 7.9 percent from the same period a year earlier and 
said they plan to cut spending by a further 9.4 percent in the 
July-December period. That would mark the fourth straight period of 
contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA surveyed 4,528 manufacturers and non-manufacturers  
capitalized at or over 100 million yen ($870,000), of which about 
4,300 responded.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was slightly higher against the yen  
Tuesday morning in light trading, while Japanese stocks fell 
following a decline on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.38 yen at late morning, up 0.22 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
115.20 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 71.30 points,  
or 0.41 percent, to 17,119.15 at the end of the morning session. On 
Monday, the average closed up 106.21 points, or 0.62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's gains came early in the  
session, when Japanese banks covered short, or oversold, positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback also got some support as a safe-haven currency  
after Russian President Boris Yeltsin fired his government for the 
fourth time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall, traders said action remained thin.  
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.56 yen, up from  
123.03 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened moderately lower as many  
investors were holding back in the absence of major market-moving 
news. Also, some players began taking off for Japan's annual 
``Obon'' summer holidays this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market was pressured by concern over a possible  
hike in U.S. interest rates and a fall of 28.99 points to 2,518.98 
in the technology heavy Nasdaq index Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.33 points  
to close at 10,707.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Opinion is growing in U.S. financial markets that the Federal  
Reserve will boost rates to contain inflationary pressure when 
officials meet Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 3.81 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,420.72. 
The TOPIX closed up 3.85 points, or 0.27 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8550 percent from Monday's finish of 1.8450 percent, driving 
its price down to 99.53 yen from 99.61 yen.

<HEADLINE> Racism in Criminal Justice Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- It's becoming a familiar tale of ``driving while  
black'' -- a carload of black men is pulled over by police who want 
to search for drugs even though there is no evidence the men are 
carrying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, one of the men in the car was a Washington, D.C.,  
public defender who sued the Maryland police and won a settlement. 
Robert Wilkins spoke about the 1992 incident during an American Bar 
Association discussion Sunday about racism in the criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, the Justice Department's acting civil rights  
chief, told the audience, ``We are talking about civil rights 
violations'' in such incidents. ``These stories are legion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said such practices also are bad law enforcement because  
while police might find small-time couriers, they may be ``missing 
very big fish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said Attorney General Janet Reno is ``convinced that you can  
have law enforcement that's sensitive to these issues, avoid racial 
profiling, and be effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we allow racial discrimination to occur, then we're just  
undermining the whole community policing concept,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The moderator of the discussion, American University law  
professor Angela Jordan Davis, asked, ``How is it that the issue of 
racism in criminal justice is still so pervasive in 1999?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't prosecutors have the power in fact to dismiss these  
cases'' if they involve unfairness based on race, Davis asked. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Houston law professor Sandra Guerra said focusing  
on prosecutors might not work. ``Prosecutors can't identify all the 
people who should have been stopped who weren't stopped,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Court of Appeals Judge Wendell L. Griffen, a member of  
the audience, suggested, ``The buck can stop with judges'' who can 
throw out cases involving racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffen said some type of cost should be imposed on those  
responsible for race-based prosecutions. ``Racism so far doesn't 
cost anybody anything in this system except the victims,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Jackson, a prosecutor in Atlanta, wondered from the  
audience, ``How do we fix these things as a group? People vote for 
politicians who are going to be tough on crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins suggested, ``You can say you're tough on crime and still  
have an agenda that's smart on crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkins said the settlement in his case required the Maryland  
state police to report on searches they conducted along Interstate 
95. The results showed a high share of black motorists being 
searched, although drugs were found on them no more frequently than 
on white motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The disparity showed up even though the police knew of the  
reporting requirement, he said. ``It changed my view, 
unfortunately, for the worse about whether the legal system can 
address these kinds of issues.''

<HEADLINE> Commission Probes Riot After 78 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- The search for mass graves of victims of the  
1921 Tulsa race riot led to two locations in a cemetery and tests 
indicated ``something there,'' an archaeologist testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I have to be very honest and say we can't say  
these two locations represent victims of the race riot,'' state 
archaeologist Bob Brooks told the Tulsa Race Riot Commission. 
Brooks said only excavation could determine that and ``of course, 
since we're working in a cemetery, this is a very sensitive 
matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 80 years after white mobs torched Tulsa's black business  
district, witnesses and survivors are finally getting the chance to 
share their stories with a special panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-member group, which includes a survivor, historians,  
lawmakers and community members, has already been investigating the 
riot for two years. The commission is trying to better determine 
what happened May 31, 1921, when white mobs torched Tulsa's black 
business district, and if reparations should be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors were to appear before the panel later in the day to  
share their memories of that day. John Hope Franklin, the son of a 
riot survivor and head of President Clinton's national advisory 
board on race, was scheduled to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	The official death count of about three dozen has long been  
disputed. Historian Scott Ellsworth, a commission aide who also has 
written a book on the riot, believes at least 200 to 300 people, 
mostly blacks, perished in the two days of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had an intense study for over a year just looking at  
death figures,'' Ellsworth said. ``I think we are now convinced 
this is the largest single incident of racial violence in American 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission already has located 62 living black survivors,  
looked into reports of airplanes bombing blacks and of bodies 
tossed into the Arkansas River. 
</P>
<P>
	The riot broke out when a white lynch mob clashed with blacks  
who came to help protect a black man accused of assaulting a white 
elevator operator. The woman later refused to bring charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobs set fire to homes, businesses and churches in the thriving  
black business district called Greenwood. When the smoke cleared, 
more than 35 blocks were in ruins and dozens lay dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Many blacks left and never returned. The National Guard rounded  
up thousands of others and held them at the fairgrounds, convention 
hall and a baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, the city seemed to bury those memories with the  
ashes of Greenwood. It was only in 1996 that it recognized the 
anniversary of the riot. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, the Legislature created the commission when Tulsa  
lawmakers raised the issue of restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Don Ross, inspired by Florida's decision to pay the  
descendants of black victims of the 1923 massacre in Rosewood, 
originally sought payments for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross, who is black, now supports tax breaks for businesses that  
locate in low-income areas, ones he feels were robbed of their 
economic legacy by the riot. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only record of anybody getting payment as a result of the  
Tulsa disaster was a white man who owned a pawn shop where guns and 
ammunition were stolen for an assault on the black community,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Forrest Claunch, leader of the Republican caucus,  
isn't sure how controversial the issue will be when the commission 
submits its recommendation on reparations in January. But he sees 
no reason why this generation should pay for what happened 78 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It becomes tantamount to saying we are entirely a product of  
our past and I don't believe that's true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veneice Dunn Sims, a 94-year-old black survivor who previously  
recorded her memories on videotape for the panel, isn't sure of the 
need to ``stir up stuff'' from the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think with the progress that has been made since then, they  
ought to let a dead dog lie dead,'' Mrs. Sims said in advance of 
today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sims can still recall the pale blue dress she had to leave  
behind as she and her family fled. Her home -- and the dress neatly 
laid out for a high school banquet -- burned during the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Sims doesn't see the need to stir up the past, if  
someone decides she should be paid for her losses, she wouldn't 
mind having something to leave for family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they offered, well yes, I'd take it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> ExciteAtHome Stock Drops on Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ExciteAtHome shares plunged more than 10 percent  
Monday following a report that AT&AMP;T Corp. was in talks with America 
Online Inc. to allow it to offer Internet services over the phone 
company's cable network. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a deal would allow the two companies to combine their  
extensive technical and marketing expertise, while at the same time 
would diminish the role of ExciteAtHome by eliminating its 
exclusive rights to provide high-speed Internet and communications 
services through the AT&AMP;T's network. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Monday, AT&AMP;T denied that any specific discussions  
were ongoing, though it acknowledged it has talked with AOL in the 
past. AT&AMP;T also said it would honor its current contract with 
ExciteAtHome. 
</P>
<P>
	ExciteAtHome shares were down $4.31 1/4, or 10 percent, at $38.25  
in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. AOL was 
up 75 cents to $85.50, while AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T was down 81 1/4 cents at 
$50.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of the talks appeared in Monday's New York Times.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past several months, AT&AMP;T has spent billions buying cable  
companies to create a national network for local telephone and 
high-speed Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its deal last summer to acquire Tele-Communications  
Inc., AT&AMP;T received stake in AtHome and an agreement to give AtHome 
exclusive Internet use of its cable systems into the next decade. 
AtHome merged with Excite in May. 
</P>
<P>
	However, AT&AMP;T has run into problems with local cable officials --  
first in Portland, Ore., then in Broward County in Florida -- who 
say the telecommunications giant must open up it's high-speed cable 
network to competing Internet service providers. AT&AMP;T is appealing 
both decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., has more than 17 million subscribers,  
and operates the most visited network of Web sites, according to 
Media Metrix. Redwood City, Calif.-based ExciteAtHome, which is 26 
percent owned by AT&AMP;T, uses cable TV systems to provide high-speed 
Internet access to consumers

<HEADLINE> 13 Die in Labor Van Crash in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIVE POINTS, Calif. (AP) -- A van loaded with farm workers driven  
by an unlicensed driver slammed into a truck on a remote road in 
the early-morning darkness Monday, killing 13 people and renewing 
worries about the safety of laborers who often cram into vehicles 
to get to work in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1983 Dodge Ram van smashed like an accordion on impact. Most  
of the 10 men and five women in the van were sitting without seat 
belts on two carpeted benches installed on each side, California 
Highway Patrol Officer Brian Yokley said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's illegal in California to have anyone ride without proper  
seats and seat belts, but certified farm vehicles are excluded from 
the law. This van received its last annual certification in 1997, 
but had not been certified since, the highway patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	The van's driver was among those killed. Two other passengers  
were injured. Authorities did not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government agency Notimex said the Mexican consulate  
in Fresno confirmed that the 13 dead farmworkers were Mexicans. No 
one was available at the consulate Monday afternoon for further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver didn't have a license and his driving privileges had  
been revoked because of several violations, CHP Officer Eric 
Erickson said. The driver, from Fresno, had been cited for not 
wearing a seatbelt, not having a license, and was once arrested for 
drunken driving. Erickson said there was no conviction for the DUI, 
but it wasn't clear why. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, who wasn't injured, had a clean driving  
record. He was turning his rig around on the two-lane road after 
parking on the shoulder to sleep, Erickson said. The rig's two 
trailers were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The van ``couldn't avoid hitting the tractor-trailer,'' Erickson  
said. ``Their brakes locked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The van was going at least 55 mph, and the skid marks were 50 to  
80 feet long, Erickson said. The accident happened shortly after 5 
a.m., just southeast of this tiny town in Fresno County. The 
laborers had just gotten off work sorting tomatoes in the fields, 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In central California's agricultural heartland, farm workers are  
often transported in crowded vans -- a problem that has contributed 
to a disproportionate traffic death rate among Hispanics in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway patrol is so concerned that it has a team focused  
entirely on vehicles overcrowded with farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Six officers, dubbed ``Los Centinales'' -- or ``the Sentinels'' --  
have spent the past three summers patrolling before dawn, stopping 
trucks and vans of farm workers to check whether the vehicles are 
complying with state codes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stop those vehicles that are obviously overloaded ... the  
back end is sagged down because of the weight of the people,'' said 
Sgt. Jorge Chaidez, who runs the unit out of the highway patrol's 
office in Fresno. ``I've seen up to 22 people in a small van.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dora Portillo, 26, said the van involved in Monday's crash was  
owned by her grandfather, Jose Lopez Rosas. He wasn't in the van, 
but she said her father was among those killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Portillo said she and her mother also had been working in  
the fields, and the two women had taken a different ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told my mom, `You go ahead and go with them, so you can  
rest and go to sleep,''' Ms. Portillo said, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured survivors, a 17-year-old girl, was in  
critical condition. The other, a man, was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Yolanda Cervantes, who organizes an annual driver safety  
awareness program in nearby Mendota, said most farm workers have no 
alternatives but to ride in crowded vans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something has to change because every time you see these you  
don't have one death, you have multiple deaths,'' Ms. Cervantes 
said. ``I've seen too many.''

<HEADLINE> Jazz's Layden May Move to Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Scott Layden, vice president of basketball  
operations for the Utah Jazz, met with New York Knicks officials 
over the weekend to discuss taking a similar position with the 
team, The Salt Lake Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden's departure is imminent, KSTU Fox television reported,  
citing its own unnamed sources. Layden refused comment Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz publicist Kim Turner told The Associated Press he couldn't  
confirm the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stranger things have happened, but as of Friday when I left  
the office, I didn't know anything about it,'' Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Watkins, a spokesman for Madison Square Garden, would  
neither confirm nor deny the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a matter of club policy, we'll have no comment on rumor or  
speculation,'' Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden, son of former Jazz coach Frank Layden, helped shape the  
team over the past 18 years, calling most of the major personnel 
shots for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Jazz in 1981 as an assistant coach. In 1988, he  
became a chief scout and was named director of player development. 
His title was upgraded to vice president of basketball operations 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Checketts, the Knicks president and chief operating  
officer, was president of the Jazz in the 1980s and maintains close 
ties to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' job opened in April with the firing of Ernie  
Grunfeld, who was general manager before being reassigned to 
special consultant. Player personnel director Ed Tapscott has been 
handling many of the general manager's duties this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune reported that Layden could make $1.5 million a year  
with the Knicks, about four times his Jazz salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz finished the 1999 season with a league-best 37-13  
record, but sputtered down the stretch and were eliminated from the 
playoffs in the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Utah's earliest playoff exit since 1995. The Jazz have  
had 13 straight winning seasons, as well as four division titles 
and two Western Conference championships in the last decade.

<HEADLINE> Long-Distance Price War Heats Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans are being offered the lowest  
long-distance rates in recent history as phone companies jockey for 
customers to whom they can sell other services like local and 
wireless calling. 
</P>
<P>
	Both MCI WorldCom and Sprint have halved their nighttime calling  
rates to a nickel-a-minute, sharply undercutting AT&AMP;T, the market 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sparking new long-distance business, the moves  
are designed to position the companies for the day when all types 
of phone service will be bundled together, along with television 
and Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint started the latest price war last month with a ``Nickel  
Nights'' plan charging 5 cents per minute on long-distance calls 
between 7 p.m. and midnight. Calls at other times are 10 cents a 
minute and there's a monthly fee of $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom responded on Monday by extending its popular ``5  
Cent Sundays'' plan to the entire weekend and weekday calls made 
between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. Daytime calling rates on weekdays are 25 
cents per minute for customers paying a monthly fee of $1.95, or 10 
cents per minute with a monthly fee of $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which charges 15 cents a minute around the clock with no  
monthly fee or 10 cents a minute with a $4.95 fee, said Monday it 
has no immediate plans to match the price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said it was unlikely the moves by MCI WorldCom and  
Sprint would go unanswered by AT&AMP;T and other competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The MCI plan will result in a new wave of lower prices for the  
consumer,'' said Rex G. Mitchell, an industry analyst for Banc of 
America Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T will have to improve its plan,'' said Mitchell. ``AT&AMP;T  
has to have a plan with the words `five cents' somewhere in there 
in order to stay competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and other rivals may also choose to compete against the  
nickel calling rates in other ways. Qwest, the fourth largest 
long-distance company, was expected to launch a new package on 
Tuesday with 250 minutes of long-distance calls and unlimited 
Internet access for $24.95. 
</P>
<P>
	For MCI, which has focused on high-paying business customers,  
the new calling plan was a sign that the nation's second-biggest 
long distance company values its share of the consumer market, 
which Mitchell sees slipping to 11 percent by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer market is nothing to sneeze at,'' said Mitchell,  
estimating that consumer long-distance revenues will total $41 
billion in 1999. AT&AMP;T's share of the market, which began the year 
at more than 60 percent, has been steadily declining and is 
expected to total just 56 percent by the end of 1999. Sprint's is 
expected to be 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price cuts may not hurt long-distance companies if customers  
make more calls and talk longer. 
</P>
<P>
	When MCI introduced ``5 Cents Sundays'' in 1997, the average  
customer spent twice as much time on the phone on Sunday, said John 
Donoghue, MCI WorldCom's senior vice president of consumer 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies are less worried about floods of new  
callers clogging their lines because phone calls put little strain 
on the huge fiber-optic networks now being built to carry floods of 
Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The expense of carrying phone calls on such networks is so small  
that companies may choose to use long distance less as a revenue 
producer and more as a marketing come-on for bundles of phone, TV 
and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies are also benefiting from a  
government-mandated reduction in the fees they pay to local Baby 
Bell monoplies for connecting long-distance calls to the nation's 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern that may be prompting the long-distance rate  
cuts is the prospect of new competition from the Baby Bells. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to get government permission to sell long-distance  
service, the Baby Bells still need to prove that their markets are 
open to competition for local service. Some industry analysts 
expect this will happen in certain states within a year.

<HEADLINE> Sides Split on West Bank Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The chief Palestinian negotiator insisted today  
that Israel resume a West Bank troop withdrawal in September, while 
Israeli officials said the pullback could only begin in October 
after Palestinians fulfill their peace obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has asked Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright to postpone a visit to the region until the 
dispute over the implementation of the Wye River land-for-security 
agreement has been settled, said Yoav Koren, an aide to Israeli 
Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright had been expected in the Middle East this week, but the  
chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said she has delayed her 
trip until September. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the U.S.-brokered Wye accord, Israel is to withdraw from  
13.1 percent of the West Bank in three stages over three months. 
Barak's hard-line predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, suspended the 
accord, citing Palestinian violations, after pulling back troops 
from 2 percent of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said he has told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and  
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that implementation of the accord 
would resume in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest dispute between Israel and the Palestinians appeared  
to stem from different interpretations of what Barak meant. 
</P>
<P>
	Erekat told The Associated Press the Palestinians understood  
that Barak was willing to resume the phased troop withdrawal in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Barak and his aides said that under the Wye timetable,  
the Palestinians first had to meet some of their security 
obligations, such as confiscating illegal weapons and reducing the 
size of their police force, and that the first withdrawal from 5 
percent of the West Bank would begin in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the day the process starts, there are all kinds of things  
that the Palestinians must do,'' said Barak's media adviser Yaakov 
Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Barak made it very clear in meetings with Arafat and  
Mubarak that the countdown to the withdrawal would take 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prime minister said this from the beginning, and that is  
why we are puzzled at the Palestinian reaction,'' Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak also has proposed that the third pullback be postponed  
until both sides have agreed on the broad outlines of a permanent 
peace accord. The Palestinians have rejected the proposal, noting 
that implementation of the Wye accord should have been completed in 
February 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we have a new government, we expect its immediate  
implementation,'' Erekat said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Palestinians have fulfilled most of their  
commitments under Wye and would do the rest once the troop 
withdrawal begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're willing to start today if the Israelis will start  
today,'' Erekat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiator said Arafat and Barak have not spoken since a  
meeting two weeks ago, further contributing to the atmosphere of 
distrust. 
</P>
<P>
	Erekat said Arafat's comment Sunday ``welcoming'' a September  
start date for Wye was based on an understanding that the 
withdrawal would begin then. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wye accord is an interim agreement en route to what are  
expected to be difficult final-status negotiations on issues such 
as the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Jewish settlements in 
the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, dozens of Palestinians burned tires and threw stones  
outside Joseph's Tomb, a site revered by some Jews as the burial 
ground of a son of the biblical patriarch Jacob. The Israeli 
enclave is located in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, which 
is under full Palestinian control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians were protesting a tin shack they said was  
illegal constructed inside the compound. Palestinian police 
dispersed the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority arrested two leaders of the  
Islamic militant group Hamas in a weekend crackdown and released a 
third, said Palestinian Police Chief Ghazi Jabali. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamas leaders Abdel Aziz Rantisi and Ahmed Nimer were arrested  
Saturday night, said Jabali, who would not say why the two were 
detained. Ismail Abu Shanab, also a senior Hamas official, was 
released Sunday after being questioned for a day and a half about 
an interview he gave to MBC Middle East television. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamas opposes peace talks with Israel and has killed scores of  
Israelis in attacks.

<HEADLINE> May Dept. Stores Earnings Climb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The May Department Stores Co. on Monday  
reported second-quarter earnings rose 17.6 percent as sales rose 
9.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	May earned $154 million, or 43 cents per share, in the quarter  
ended July 31. That compared to earnings of $131 million, or 35 
cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $3.07 billion, up from $2.81 billion last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The company, which generally makes few comments on its results,  
said sales were reduced 1 percent by the discontinuation of its 
consumer electronics business. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, May reported earnings of $276 million,  
or 77 cents per share, on sales of $6.01 billion. By comparison, 
for the first six months of 1998, May earned $241 million, or 64 
cents per share, on sales of $5.53 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	May has opened three new departments stores this year, and 15  
more are planned. May currently operates 395 department stores in 
32 states and the District of Columbia. Its stores include Lord &AMP; 
Taylor, Hecht's, Strawbridge's, Foley's, Robinsons-May, Filene's, 
Kaufmann's, Famous-Barr, L.S. Ayres, The Jones Store, and Meier &AMP; 
Frank.

<P>
	May shares fell 81 1/4 cents to $38.12 1/2 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Most HMOs in Red Again in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When health maintenance organizations make money  
they're often blamed for putting profits ahead of patient care. 
</P>
<P>
	But even when HMOs lose money, critics voice worries that  
consumers will be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Such concerns have become more prevalent as most health  
maintenance organizations lost money for a second year in a row in 
1998. The losses have prompted many plans to raise premiums and cut 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs lost a combined $490 million last year, compared to a $768  
million loss in 1997, according to a study released Monday by Weiss 
Ratings, an independent ratings service based in Palm Beach 
Gardens, Fla. Before 1997, the HMO industry was profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	About 56 percent of HMOs lost money last year, down slightly  
from the 57 percent in 1997, the Weiss study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not good news for the consumer,'' said Martin Weiss,  
chairman of Weiss Ratings. That's because HMOs that lose money are 
more likely to go out of business, quit unprofitable markets or 
raise premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO industry's financial health should improve again this  
year as a result of many plans raising premiums by more than 5 
percent and curtailing coverage of Medicare recipients, Weiss said. 
Higher rates led to the narrower losses in 1998, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 576 HMOs analyzed by Weiss, 100 failed to have enough  
fiscal reserves as called for under guidelines set by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners. The guidelines seek to 
ensure that the HMOs have enough money to pay claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has a long way to go before consumers are safe,''  
Weiss said 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs operated by United HealthCare lost $174.6 million last  
year, most among large HMOs, the Weiss study found. Prudential 
HealthCare, which last week was bought by Aetna, lost nearly $60 
million in 1998. Aetna's HMOs lost about $15.9 million. Aetna is 
now the nation's largest health insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The steep losses raise the question of whether plans will skimp  
on coverage to save money, said Peter Young, a consultant with 
Health Care Strategic Issues in Fort Myers, Fla. ``These numbers 
are not good, no matter how you look at it,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and hospital executives have complained for the past few  
years about problems getting HMOs to paying medical bills. They say 
HMOs' financial problems are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Few large HMOs have gone bankrupt in recent years, but when they  
do, consumers can be left scrambling for insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200,000 New Jersey residents last fall had to find a new  
health insurance coverage when HIP Health Plan of New Jersey went 
bankrupt in one of the biggest fiscal collapses in the industry's 
history.

<HEADLINE> Rare Twister Hits Long Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MATTITUCK, N.Y. (AP) -- A moderate tornado uprooted trees and  
capsized small boats on the eastern tip of Long Island, an area not 
accustomed to such storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado struck Sunday morning in Mattituck, about 100 miles  
east of New York City, then moved along a 4-mile path across water 
and into New Suffolk. 
</P>
<P>
	A boat with several people on board capsized in Peconic Bay, but  
no one was seriously hurt, the Cutchogue Fire Department said. 
Power outages affected about 2,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Harkoff said the wind was so strong that she couldn't  
close the back door to her restaurant in New Suffolk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pails and buckets were flying in the air, and things were even  
flying through the kitchen,'' said Harkoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The twister had wind up to 120 mph and was rated an F1 on the  
Fujita scale, which ranges from F0 to F5, the National Weather 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is rare to have a tornado on Long Island, but it's not  
unheard of,'' said meteorologist Kipp Hogan. ``At times, the 
strength of this one was a weak F2, and that is more rare to have 
around here.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Soccer Game Stab Victim Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 27-year-old man was in serious condition  
Monday, a day after he was stabbed during D.C. United's victory 
over the Tampa Bay Mutiny at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The stabbing marked the second time this season that violence  
marred a game between United and the Mutiny at RFK. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvadoran fans in the Washington area have been upset with  
United management since national hero Raul Diaz Arce was traded at 
the end of the 1997 season. When Diaz Arce and the Mutiny visited 
RFK in April, there were fights and reports of other unruly 
behavior among the record crowd of 35,167. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's attendance was 18,753, including thousands of  
Salvadorans who booed the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post on Monday identified the victim as Sergio  
Senteno of Arlington, Va. It said he was treated for stab wounds to 
his lower back and abdomen. No arrests have been made, although 
police are checking videotapes from surveillance cameras for 
possible suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such an isolated incident,'' D.C. United president and  
general manager Kevin Payne said. ``Generally, there were few 
problems. It's just an unfortunate thing. I don't know how you 
prevent something like that short of full body searches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Lawes, a spokesman for D.C. United, said fans in the area  
where the stabbing occurred cheered Diaz Arce when he was near the 
ball and booed United players Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno 
when they were near the ball. But he said team officials do not 
believe the stabbing was the result of extreme partisanship among 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe it was that way,'' Lawes said. ``This was  
not one guy wearing blue and white (the colors of the Salvadoran 
flag) and one guy wearing a yellow and green shirt (the colors of 
the Bolivian flag). It appeared to be nothing more than a random 
act of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawes said a knife was recovered but that it was not clear  
whether it was the weapon used in the stabbing.

<HEADLINE> Mothballed Reactor Finishes Journey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Pressure-wrapped in its royal blue  
weatherproof covering, an empty 1,000-ton nuclear reactor completed 
the 36-hour, 270-mile journey up the Columbia River amid little 
fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of environmental demonstrators, a handful of people  
captured the slow-moving funeral procession with video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks pretty harmless,'' said Linda Cave of Hermiston,  
Ore., who videotaped the reactor's arrival Sunday morning at the 
Port of Benton. She was videotaping for her husband, who was part 
of the transportation crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor's river voyage, skirting the edge of Portland, made  
it the first commercial reactor of that size and level of 
radioactive contamination to travel so near a major American city, 
according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor was then loaded onto a special trailer for a 20-mile  
trip to a burial site for radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm calling it a big success,'' said Kregg Arntson, a  
spokesman for Portland General Electric, the utility 
decommissioning the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, the largest 
commercial reactor ever taken off line in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone says everything has gone just as planned. Of course,  
there was a lot of planning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two tugs pulled the vessel from Rainier, Ore., 40 miles  
northwest of Portland, to the Port of Benton. The trip included a 
two-hour precautionary stop early Sunday at Pasco to wait for 
daylight on the last 10-mile stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The barge carrying the dumbbell-shaped reactor and its  
impact-resistant supports docked at the port at 9 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	From Benton, the reactor vessel was loaded onto a 16-axle  
trailer with 320 wheels to support its enormous weight, where it 
was towed, partially on public highway, to its burial site at the 
federal Hanford Nuclear Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 560-square-mile Hanford reservation is the nation's most  
contaminated nuclear site, after making plutonium from the 1940s to 
the 1980s for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor will be put in a 45-foot-deep trench at the burial  
site. It is scheduled to go into the trench on Tuesday and the 
burial process will take about three months, according to US 
Ecology, which manages the disposal site. 
</P>
<P>
	PGE already had shipped Trojan's contaminated steam generators  
upriver to Hanford since 1995, and the Navy often ships reactors 
from submarines and cruisers up the Columbia for burial at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it no longer contains its uranium fuel, the Trojan  
reactor vessel contains 15 times as much radioactivity as those 
objects, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after being filled with concrete and encased in  
6-inch-thick steel, the reactor was considered safe for shipment. 
Workers handling it wear no more protection than a hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojan plant operated for 16 years, generating enough  
electricity to supply all of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was shut down in 1993, two decades earlier than planned,  
after a series of problems including a faulty safety system that 
drew federal fines, an accidental release of radioactive gases and 
cracked steam tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 800 spent but highly radioactive uranium fuel rod  
assemblies removed from the reactor over the years remain in 
storage at the Trojan site.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Cleared in Casino Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- A judge has thrown out charges that two  
brothers, authors whose real-life gambling exploits provided fuel 
for their writings, cheated at blackjack in one of the state's 
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederick and Steven Barthelme were indicted in 1997, not long  
after the release of Frederick Barthelme's novel ``Bob the 
Gambler,'' about an architect with a gambling problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers, both faculty members at the University of South  
Mississippi in Hattiesburg, admit losing more than a quarter of a 
million dollars over two years at the casinos, which became legal 
in Mississippi in 1992. They wrote about their obsession earlier 
this year in The New Yorker magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Houghton Mifflin is expected to release soon a book  
co-written by the brothers about their legal troubles and 
addiction, titled ``Double Down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stemmed from casino surveillance tapes at the Grand  
Casino in Gulfport that authorities thought showed the brothers 
receiving signals from a blackjack dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, however, Harrison County Circuit Judge Robert H.  
Walker dismissed the charges after a Nevada gambling expert hired 
by the state testified he examined the tapes and found no proof of 
cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment today from the brothers, who have unlisted  
telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Frederick, 55, told The New York Times they were  
delighted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had carefully studied their evidence in a timely way,  
then they would have never brought the indictment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had faced up to two years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Mauresmo Withdraws From du Maurier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- France's Amelie Mauresmo withdrew from next  
week's du Maurier Open with an ankle injury, Tennis Canada 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo, a 20-year-old ranked No. 17 on the WTA Tour, was a  
finalist at the Australian Open in January. She sprained her right 
ankle at the French Open in May and attempted to return at last 
week's TIG Classic in San Diego, but withdrew after the problem 
persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``She discovered the ankle wasn't 100 per cent yet, so she has  
decided it needs more time to heal properly,'' tournament director 
Jane Wynne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo's withdrawal leaves the WTA Tour event with 16 of the  
top-20 women's players, including top-ranked Martina Hingis, who 
defeated Mauresmo in the Australian Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying rounds for the $1.05 million tournament begin  
Saturday with the main draw beginning Monday.

<HEADLINE> Oasis Guitarist Arthurs Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Oasis guitarist Paul ``Bonehead'' Arthurs said  
Monday he has quit the band after eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Arthurs apparently talked over his plans with  
the band and engineered an amicable split. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a lot of consideration I have decided to call it a day  
with Oasis,'' Arthurs said in a statement released through the 
band's label, Creation Records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a fantastic eight years in one of the best bands ever  
to come out of Britain, and now feel I have come to the stage where 
I'd like to concentrate on other things in my life, outside of the 
demands of being in a successful rock 'n' roll band,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhythm guitarist Arthurs -- dubbed ``Bonehead'' because of his  
thinning hair -- was a founding member of the band, which was 
originally formed as Rain in Manchester, England, in 1991 with 
drummer Tony McCarroll and bass player Paul ``Guigsy'' McGuigan. 
</P>
<P>
	A new singer, Liam Gallagher, suggested a change of name and the  
appointment of his brother, Noel, as lead guitarist/songwriter gave 
the group a new direction. Their successful debut album, 
``Definitely Maybe,'' followed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The band said there are no plans to replace Arthurs, who played  
on the new album due out next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a judge in London approved an 550,000 pound (dlrs  
880,000) payment to McCarroll to settle a lawsuit he brought 
against the band after he was fired in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Boy Attacked by Bear at Scout Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELL LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- A black bear attacked a teen-age boy  
Monday while he slept in a tent at a Boy Scout camp, seriously 
injuring him. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Murphy, 14, was attacked at about 6:30 a.m. at the  
Tomahawk Scout Reservation on the east side of Long Lake in 
northwestern Wisconsin, authorities said. A search was on for the 
bear, which will be destroyed if found. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy was in serious but stable condition Monday night after  
undergoing surgery. He had bite wounds to his head and shoulder 
area and was expected to make a full recovery, the family said in a 
news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy's father, Anthony, a leader at the camp, used a rock and  
a block of wood to drive the bear away after the animal had dragged 
the boy and his tent about 78 feet into the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Candy wrappers were found in the tent, but officials did not  
know if that was related to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Jonas, the wildlife biologist investigating the attack, said  
the incident was extremely peculiar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We normally don't get bears that attack people, and certainly  
not in this manner,'' Jonas said.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Wait for Work Permits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The same hurricane that filled the Honduran home  
of Isolina Banego's relatives with water and muck also provided her 
first opportunity to work and live legally in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet seven months after the U.S. government said it would give  
temporary work permits to Hondurans and Nicaraguans already in the 
United States -- allowing them to send money home to boost local 
economies and help rebuild after Hurricane Mitch -- Banego and 
thousands of others are still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	A backlog of work has put the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service behind in processing applications. Across the nation, 
immigrants and advocacy groups say the delay is costing people -- 
both in the United States and in Central America -- much-needed 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, I need to work,'' Banego said.  
</P>
<P>
	The temporary protected status program, announced last December,  
promises not to deport Nicaraguans and Hondurans before July 5, 
2000. Only those in the United States when the hurricane hit 
Central America last fall qualify. Most who have applied were in 
the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 people, left 2 million  
homeless and caused $10 billion in damages. The work program was 
designed to keep the two hardest-hit countries -- short on housing 
and jobs -- from being burdened with more people deported from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hondurans sent an estimated $220 million home in 1998, or 4  
percent of that nation's annual gross domestic product, while 
Nicaraguans sent back $158 million, or 7 percent of GDP, and the 
work program was aimed at helping immigrants earn even more money. 
</P>
<P>
	Illegal immigrants generally work marginal jobs for employers  
willing to skirt the law, making roughly $150 a week, said Patrick 
Young, program director of the Central American Refugee Center in 
Hempstead on New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are making that, you are barely able to feed yourself,  
let alone send money home,'' Young said. With a work permit, 
immigrants typically can earn $100 more a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, few -- if any -- of the 250 clients his organization  
helped with the application process have received the permits, 
which cost $175 to apply for. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty rare that I've seen any program administered as  
poorly as this one,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	By July 27, the INS had received 92,011 applications, with  
86,860 from Hondurans and 5,151 from Nicaraguans. Daniel Kane, a 
spokesman in Washington, said 12,700 work permits had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're strained to keep up with the flow of every type of  
application that is coming in,'' said Bill Strassberger, INS 
spokesman in Laguna Niguel, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	By INS estimates, 106,000 Hondurans and 75,000 Nicaraguans are  
in this country without proper documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS extended the deadline to file applications to Aug. 20 --  
45 days after the original deadline -- because it said many 
immigrants were having trouble obtaining necessary documents. 
</P>
<P>
	But after much early interest, many of the Central Americans  
have lost faith. ``The community has become convinced that the 
program is a fraud,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the temporary protected status is simply a way for  
the INS to get information to eventually deport people, said Juan 
Gonzalez, associate director of the Latin American Action Program 
in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santa Monica, Calif., immigration attorney Gloria Curiel said  
she has prepared only 20 applications -- even though those who don't 
apply could be subject to deportation if caught. ``They're 
scared,'' she said. ``No one knows what will happen after 18 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Information obtained in the temporary permit program could  
possibly be used in individual cases, Strassberger said. But he 
denied the INS would use it for mass deportations. ``We're not 
going to have a list and go out and say, `OK, on this block we have 
three people,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Adalberto Marquez said he worries about what will happen  
after the program expires, but he doesn't regret paying the $175 to 
apply for the work permit -- even though it hasn't arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	With a permit, he said, he could earn $9 an hour, $3 more than  
he makes now moving boxes at a warehouse, and he could send more 
money to his family in Honduras. The hurricane cost his father a 
job as a farm worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Although applications of all types often languish with INS, many  
people say they had expected this program -- touted by the Clinton 
administration as a way to help Hurricane Mitch victims -- to be 
relatively smooth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a little much,'' said Robert Cisneros, staff attorney  
at Central American Legal Assistance in Brooklyn. Each day, clients 
call or stop at his church basement office, wondering about their 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Becky Sharpless, supervising lawyer for the Florida Immigrant  
Advocacy Center in Miami, said, ``We doubt that people will even 
receive the work permits before the amnesty expires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Banego applied in February, she believed the program was an  
opportunity to work legally. Now, she's not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many months is it going to take?'' she asked.

<HEADLINE> 13 Die in Labor Van Crash in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FIVE POINTS, Calif. (AP) -- A van crowded with farm workers  
slammed into a tractor-trailer rig making a U-turn on a remote 
farming road early today, killing 13 people in the van and 
seriously injuring two others. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1983 beige Dodge Ram van smashed like an accordion on  
impact. Most of the people in the van -- 10 men and five women -- 
were sitting without seat belts on two carpeted benches installed 
on each side, said California Highway Patrol officer Brian Yokley. 
It is not illegal to transport farm workers that way. 
</P>
<P>
	The van's driver was among those killed.  
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, who was not injured, was turning his rig  
around on the two-lane road after parking on the shoulder to sleep, 
said CHP Officer Eric Erickson. The tractor-trailer rig included 
two empty trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The van ``couldn't avoid hitting the tractor-trailer,'' Erickson  
said. ``Their brakes locked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened shortly after 5 a.m., just southeast of  
this tiny town in Fresno County. The laborers had just gotten off 
work from sorting tomatoes in the fields, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two injured people also were in the van, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dona Portillo, 26, said the van's owner was her grandfather,  
Jose Lopez Rosas. He wasn't in the van, but she said her father was 
and was among those killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Portillo said she and her mother also had been working in  
the fields, and the two women had taken a different ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told my mom, `You go ahead and go with them, so you can  
rest and go to sleep,''' Ms. Portillo said, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured survivors were taken to University Medical Center in  
Fresno -- a 17-year-old girl in critical condition and a male in 
serious condition, said Michelle Van Valkenburg, a hospital 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's agricultural heartland, farm workers are often  
transported in crowded vans -- a problem that has contributed to a 
disproportionate traffic death rate among Hispanics in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	But while it's generally illegal in the state to have anyone  
ride without proper seats and seat belts, certified farm vehicles 
are excluded from this law. This particular van was certified as 
recently as 1997, according to a sticker on it, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
	CHP Sgt. Bill Esme said the CHP is checking the van's current  
certification status and trying to determine whether 14 passengers 
was too many, given the modifications done inside the van. 
</P>
<P>
	Yolanda Cervantes, who organizes an annual driver safety  
awareness program in nearby Mendota, said most farmworkers have no 
alternatives but to ride in crowded vans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people personally who have died in these accidents.  
Something has to change because every time you see these you don't 
have one death, you have multiple deaths. I've seen too many,'' Ms. 
Cervantes said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Zocor To Raise HDL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merck &AMP; Co.'s cholesterol-lowering drug Zocor  
has won federal approval to boast that it can also increase HDL, or 
``good'' cholesterol levels, the pharmaceutical company announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10.6 million of the 98 million Americans with high total  
cholesterol level, have too low a HDL cholesterol level, according 
to Merck. Zocor is the only cholesterol drug that the Food and Drug 
Administration says can raise HDL. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoting the HDL benefit of Zocor should have little effect on  
the drug's fight to maintain market share against Lipitor, the 
leading U.S. cholesterol drug that is jointly sold by 
Warner-Lambert Co. and Pfizer Inc. Analysts say the many doctors 
already know about the studies that show Zocor's HDL-raising 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor still would be given only to people with high levels of  
LDL, or ``bad'' cholesterol. The drug would not be available for 
people who wanted to raise HDL levels, if they have normal overall 
cholesterol readings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipitor controls about 41 percent of the U.S. cholesterol drug  
market, about twice the level of Zocor, based on the amount of new 
prescription orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipitor increasingly dominates the market because doctors see it  
as the most potent drug available. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approval will allow Merck to use the expanded claim in  
its physician and consumer advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really an incremental step for Merck,'' said Alex  
Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. But he added, ``Any 
traction Merck can get to go against Lipitor will be helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sidney Smith, chief of cardiology at the University of North  
Carolina Medical Center, said he is not sure if doctors will change 
prescribing patterns because of the HDL benefit of Zocor.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Insurance Issue Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- European insurance companies would pay about  
10 times the face value of Holocaust-era insurance policies to the 
families of Jewish victims of Nazi Germany under a formula devised 
by Lawrence Eagleburger, chairman of a claims commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reached Friday by the former Secretary of State and  
disclosed Monday followed requests for revisions by the German 
insurance firm Allianz and other companies after he reached a 
tentative decision a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It could clear the way for payment of claims beginning in  
October at about 10 times the face value of the policies purchased 
some 60 years ago. Eagleburger settled on the formula as a way to 
assign ``real value'' to the policies by taking inflation and 
interest into account. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allianz, in a statement, said differences remained and ``we  
look forward to the coming meetings of (the commission) in late 
August to sort out the differences and move forward in a 
constructive and timely manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Pomeroy, the North Dakota insurance commissioner, who was  
involved for 16 months in seeking a consensus among insurance 
companies, Jewish groups and American state regulators, cautioned 
the companies not to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memorandum obtained by The Associated Press, Pomeroy said  
he had heard ``speculation that one or more of the parties may 
consider leaving the commission if they find themselves in 
disagreement with one or more decisions of the chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they did, he said insurance commissioners of the states  
``would look with extreme disfavor'' and might take actions against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The five insurance companies involved with the commission have  
set aside $100 million for paying claims, including administrative 
costs. The payoff could be considerably larger, though, as more 
claims are registered with the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Sher, vice chairman of the commission, told The Associated  
Press that Eagleburger's decision was based on ``what he considers 
to be fair compromises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sher, who was the chief prosecutor of ex-Nazis in the Justice  
Department, said ``the expectation now is that we will move forward 
and launch our worldwide effort to attract claimants and to pay 
legitimate claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working groups will meet in London this month and the commission  
will then meet there Sept. 22-23 to finalize an outreach program to 
locate and arrange payments for victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress  
and a member of the commission, said ``we accept the good faith 
judgment of chairman Eagleburger and we will move forward to rapid 
payout of these policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Tewes, a spokesman for Allianz, said the compromise  
falls short. ``What we are looking for must be acceptable to the 
public and also give other companies not on the commission the 
opportunity to join the arrangement. I am not sure we have this,'' 
he said in a telephone interview from Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	Tewes said last week that all five European insurers, in varying  
degrees, were asking Eagleburger for revisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concerns are not only about the money, but about the  
process as well,'' he said. ``It would be a misunderstanding that 
the companies are only trying to save some money. The companies 
want to find a process that works and makes sense to the people who 
are waiting for the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger stepped in when the commission could not agree on a  
formula that would have determined current values on policies taken 
out some six decades ago.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Fans Boo J.D. Drew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- J.D. Drew learned a little something Monday  
night during his first appearance at Veterans Stadium: In the city 
where booing is an art form, decoys don't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew, the player who refused to sign with the Phillies after  
they made him the No. 2 pick in the 1997 amateur draft, received 
loud boos during batting practice before the St. Louis Cardinals 
played Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was the only chance to boo him. Drew's Philadelphia  
debut was nixed by a hand bruise that kept him out of the starting 
lineup, and the Cardinals beat the Phillies 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even though bullpen catcher Jeff Murphy wore Drew's  
jersey during BP, fans booed the right Drew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go back to the past,'' Drew said. ``I never had a  
problem with the people of Philadelphia. Hopefully, that clears it 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite. The Vet, perhaps the only stadium where Mark McGwire  
isn't he main attraction in batting practice, resonated with boos 
when the real Drew came up to bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a bandage on his bruised right hand, Drew laughed  
throughout his BP session. He homered once, a line drive to right 
that was thrown back onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting, Drew ran to the outfield and got his only cheers  
when he booted three straight grounders. When BP was over -- and 
fans finished gaping at McGwire's nearly half-dozen shots to the 
upper deck -- Drew walked to the dugout with Cardinals manager Tony 
La Russa. 
</P>
<P>
	``This town's been very tough on guys that put on the uniform of  
the home team,'' La Russa said. ``It isn't the first time the fans 
have been unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do remind myself that Mr. Lindros got here with a little  
contract dispute,'' he added, referring to hockey star Eric 
Lindros' refusal to play for the Quebec Nordiques. ``And they took 
him with open arms. They might as well take Mr. Drew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, Drew had a news conference in which he lamented  
the delay in his Vet debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be good to get it out of the way,'' said Drew, listed as  
day-to-day. ``I don't really know what to expect. It's just a 
matter of going out there and living it, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy's disguise was reminiscent of the time Phillies Hall of  
Famer Mike Schmidt played a half-inning with a wig after 
criticizing the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a beefed-up security and police presence at the  
stadium, and those on the field included Cardinals security 
director Joe Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	The stands were filled with signs, such as: ``J-Greed Drew,''  
``J.D. Who?'' ``Greed Will Be Your Demise,'' and ``Greed is a 
Cardinal Sin.'' Oddly, one sign read, ``Free Pete Rose.'' There 
were many profane banners, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Sajak, of the big-money game show ``Wheel of Fortune,''  
threw out the ceremonial first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the game, the Phillie Phanatic placed several  
money bags, painted with dollar signs, in front of the Cardinals' 
dugout. He then hid behind his all-terrain vehicle with a mock 
dynamite blaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals coach Rene Lacheman ran out of the dugout and  
confiscated the bags. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities were reminiscent of the night Albert Belle  
played his first game against the Indians in Cleveland after 
signing with the Chicago White Sox. Though Drew didn't play, at 
least he smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew said he went out to dinner in Philadelphia on Sunday night,  
but no one recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not like McGwire,'' Drew said. ``You can't miss him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would serve as Drew's bodyguard, McGwire said,  
``Absolutely not. No thank you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the fans had fun with it, Phillies players tried to  
downplay Drew's return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could care less,'' said Doug Glanville, who plays Drew's  
position -- center field -- and leads the National League in hits. 
``He's just another ballplayer. He did what he felt like he had to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure the Philly fans will definitely voice their opinion.  
It's sort of like when John Elway didn't go to the Colts. I expect 
Philadelphia fans will probably remember forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies lost their rights when they failed to sign him  
within 12 months of the draft. Drew and agent Scott Boras wanted 
$11 million, while the Phillies offered about $2 million guaranteed 
with options that could have made the deal worth about $6 million 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew went back into the draft, was picked fifth by the Cardinals  
in 1998 and got a guaranteed deal worth $7 million, including a $3 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's to the point where now I play in St. Louis, and I'm very  
happy,'' Drew said. ``I couldn't work things out here. Hopefully, 
there's no hard feelings.''

<HEADLINE> Cisco Systems Invests $1B in KPMG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cisco Systems, a leading maker of computer  
networking equipment, has agreed to invest $1 billion in KPMG LLP 
to aid the accounting and consulting firm's expansion onto the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal announced today, KPMG will use the money to hire  
4,000 engineers and service professionals to develop and deliver 
Internet-based data, voice and video services to its clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 18 months, KPMG will build six technology centers  
-- four in the United States and two abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, San Jose, Calif.-based Cisco will own a stake of less  
than 20 percent in KPMG, the U.S. unit of privately-held KPMG 
International, No. 3 among the big five accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from both companies said they believe there is a  
winner-takes-all prize for companies that win the race to 
incorporate the Internet into their business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a realization that you can be out of business in  
three years,'' John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive told The New 
York Times, which first reported the deal. ``Whoever moves quickly 
first are those who will benefit over the next 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Butler, KPMG chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the New York-based firm has been courting potential technology 
partners in recent months. One result was a joint venture announced 
in June with Qwest Communications International to provide order 
processing.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Rebound / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose today for the first time in  
four sessions as the yen's weakness against the dollar brightened 
the outlook for exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 106.21  
points, or 0.62 percent, to close at 17,190.45. On Friday, the 
average closed down 273.95 points, or 1.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.16 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 0.88  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York 
level of 114.73 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo stock exchange, the Nikkei rebounded as the dollar  
rose back above 115 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen is good news for exporters because when the  
Japanese currency rises, they face the tough choice of either 
raising prices abroad or accepting less in terms of yen when export 
revenues are brought back home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei lost 4.3 percent over the last week on worries over  
rising U.S. interest rates and a strengthening yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the Tokyo market were comments by Japan's  
Economic Planning Agency chief, Taichi Sakaiya, who suggested over 
the weekend that a planned second supplementary budget for the 
current fiscal year should be close to $8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The figure was positive news, but whether it will become a  
reality remains to be seen,'' said Kazunori Shimono, manager of the 
futures and options division at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders and investors are looking for a big spending package  
because earlier economic stimulus measures are set to run out later 
this year. Government spending was key to pulling Japan from 
recession in the first quarter of the year and economist fear the 
country will slide back unless the government continues to heavily 
fund the nascent recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.85 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,424.53. The 
TOPIX closed down 10.34 points, or 0.72 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading on the exchange's main section dwindled to an estimated  
323.16 million shares, down from 463.35 million shares Friday. 
Trading was subdued following the start of the ``obon'' Japanese 
summer holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising shares outnumbered declines 670 to 486 while 153 issues  
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar advanced against the yen today, partly on increasing  
tension over a possible North Korean missile test. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea said Sunday it would ignore U.S. appeals and  
warnings to scrap its expected missile launch. The statement was 
one of the strongest yet from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Military analysts say the country is poised to test an advanced  
version of a ballistic missile that it fired over Japan last year. 
North Korea claimed it launched a satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan said it might respond by severing one of the impoverished  
Stalinist country's only sources of hard cash -- money sent from 
Koreans living in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which is often regarded as a safe haven in times of  
international unrest, was quoted between 115.06 yen and 115.43 yen 
in Tokyo trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.03 yen, up from  
122.90 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8450 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8050 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.61 yen from 99.95 yen.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Zings Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said today during her  
``listening tour'' of New York that the $792 billion Republican 
tax-cut plan would jeopardize education programs affecting New 
York's public schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, a likely Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate,  
brought her summer tour to New York City today, visiting a Baptist 
church in a Brooklyn neighborhood where the discussion centered on 
overcrowded and violent schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Republican plan, she said: ``The city alone could lose  
as many as 4,000 desperately needed teachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton arrived late this morning at the Concord Baptist  
Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant for the 90-minute discussion attended 
by several hundred people. The audience received her warmly, giving 
her rousing applause and a partial standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk, Mrs. Clinton's first New York City stop on her  
statewide listening tour, centered on education problems facing 
inner-city students, including crime and overcrowding in the area's 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your candidacy is a great opportunity to re-vision  
education,'' the Rev. Emma Jordan-Simpson told the first lady. 
``We'd like to spend time creating after-school programs and not 
chasing money to fund those programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Brooklyn stop -- the first held in the  
backyard of potential Republican rival Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- 
Mrs. Clinton plans to hold another session in Queens on Tuesday to 
discuss balancing work and families. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bedford-Stuyvesant nighborhood is heavily minority and  
Democratic. Giuliani's name was never mentioned during the 
question-and-answer discussion by either the participants or Mrs. 
Clinton, the likely Democratic candidate for retiring U.S. Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady began holding the invitation-only events in  
various cities throughout the state in July. 
</P>
<P>
	As they waited in line before the meeting, participants said  
they wanted to talk to Mrs. Clinton about lack of health-care 
programs and unemployment in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Parsons Plow said crime was also an issue, saying: ``They  
still shoot 'em up here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Mrs. Clinton's recent comments in Talk magazine that her  
husband's past infidelities were caused by weakness, Sharon Burwell 
said: ``I feel so many people have sinned. We all have sinned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some were less concerned with talk about President Clinton's  
private problems than the social problems weighing on her 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has different economic possibilities and some people  
can't afford health care -- that's a social sin,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Nagasaki Prays for World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Residents of Nagasaki joined in a prayer for peace  
today, the 54th anniversary of the second atomic bomb attack on 
Japan in the closing days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our city of Nagasaki was instantly transformed into charred  
ruins,'' Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito said in a commemorative ceremony 
marking the bombing, which killed more than 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``From this hellish experience, we have gained the conviction  
that the existence of nuclear weapons cannot be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on the southwestern Japanese city on Aug. 9, 1945  
came three days after the United States carried out the world's 
first atomic bombing on nearby Hiroshima in an effort to force the 
Japanese into surrender. The Hiroshima blast killed 140,000 people. 
Japan surrendered unconditionally on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11:02 a.m., the exact moment of the bombing, people with  
hands clasped in prayer observed a moment of silence in Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Bells at churches and Buddhist temples echoed through the city,  
610 miles southwest of Tokyo. The wail of sirens at city fire 
departments went off at the same time, as white doves flapped into 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the only nation in the world to suffer atomic bombings, we  
must be determined never to repeat the tragedies of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said in a message delivered 
by one of his Cabinet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi praised a resolution adopted at a U.N. conference held in  
Nagasaki last November to make sure that it remains ``the last 
city'' to suffer atomic attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the survivors of the bombing who have died since the  
previous year's anniversary are added to an official list kept by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The list, which does not include those who died in the initial  
bombing, was started in 1968 with more than 26,000 names. The city 
acknowledges that some names are likely missing because of a lack 
of records. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the names of 2,733 people were added to the list,  
which now holds the names of 121,588 people. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a century later, even those who survived the  
blast continue to suffer physically and emotionally. Many of those 
who survived the initial blast suffered radiation sickness and fear 
their children might become sick or be targets of social 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people shun marriages with bomb victims or their  
descendants because of fears about radiation sickness being passed 
down over the generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of those who remain today live in a state of loneliness  
and anxiety,'' Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forever changed what  
mankind knew to be the destructive potential of warfare. And the 
bombings continue to be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide Asahi newspaper reported last week that the U.S.  
bomber was running out of fuel and dropped its load on Nagasaki 
without being able to visually confirm the target because of thick 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary target for the Aug. 9 mission was Kokura, another  
southwestern city, with Nagasaki the second choice. There were too 
many clouds over Kokura, so the B-29 changed course for Nagasaki, 
the Asahi quoted retired former Army Lt. Gen. Frederick Ashworth 
and co-pilot Fred Olivi as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders had required that the bomber return without dropping the  
bomb if the target could not be seen, the Asahi said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate anniversary ceremony in Nagasaki, more than 200  
people gathered to remember the 10,000 Koreans who died in the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Koreans who had been forcibly brought to Nagasaki during Japan's  
1910-45 colonization of the Korean Peninsula were working at 
factories or other projects when the bomb fell.

<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Telecommunications giant MCI WorldCom will  
allocate more than $100 million this year to build seven new 
Internet hosting centers and expand two existing centers, the 
company announced Monday.

<HEADLINE> Computer Hacker Fined $4,125 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, a computer  
vandal once on the FBI's most wanted list, was ordered Monday to 
pay ``token'' restitution of $4,125 to companies that suffered 
millions of dollars in damage from his exploits. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer said she doubts the  
37-year-old Mitnick can earn more than minimum wage. He has been 
prohibited for three years after his release from prison from any 
access to computers, cellular telephones, televisions or any 
equipment that can be used for Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also prohibited from working as a consultant to computer  
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea agreement reached in March, Pfaelzer also  
sentenced him to three years and 10 months in prison. With credit 
for time served, he will be eligible for release in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked that Mitnick be ordered to pay $1.5  
million, claiming his notoriety and intelligence will eventually 
give him the chance to earn money through book, film or TV 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge was required to consider what he could earn in the  
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing on the record by which the court can find that  
he can engage in anything other than a minimum-wage job,'' said 
defense lawyer Donald Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick admitted in March to federal accusations he broke into  
the computers of several high-tech companies, stole software and 
installed programs that caused millions of dollars in damage. He 
pleaded guilty to five felony counts as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfaelzer noted ``he's caused a lot of damage'' but said imposing  
a bigger restitution fee would be futile. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitnick was one of the FBI's Most Wanted fugitives when he was  
arrested in 1995 in North Carolina after a cross-country hacking 
spree that attracted worldwide attention from fellow hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	His victims included such companies as Motorola, Novell, Nokia  
and Sun Microsystems, and the University of Southern California. He 
was accused of breaking into a North American Air Defense Command 
computer, although the allegation was never proven. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Los Angeles County prosecutors dropped state charges  
against him for allegedly duping Department of Motor Vehicles 
workers into faxing confidential driving records to a copy shop in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was attended by a large crowd of Mitnick supporters.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed at Los Angeles Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMEAD, Calif. (AP) -- Gunfire erupted Monday night in a  
residential neighborhood where four people were found dead in a 
home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no arrests or suspects in custody, said Los Angeles  
County Sheriff's Deputy Carrie Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were injured, but no details were released. A report  
that a woman had been kidnapped from the home was not immediately 
confirmed, said Deputy Boris Nikolof. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting happened at about 8:30 p.m. in a home in Rosemead,  
northeast of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard multiple gunshots, about four, and then two minutes  
later another four or five more,'' said David Miranda, 21, who was 
reached by phone and said he lives next door to where the shooting 
happened. ``It was not a drive-by. Someone was emptying their 
gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Resident Phung Tran, 15, said she heard the gunfire but thought  
it was construction noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I heard a lady screaming,'' Tran said. ``I thought they  
were joking around, so I just left the room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tran said she also saw a man running down the street in a  
blood-soaked shirt. Leticia Ramirez said she was in her car as that 
man ran toward her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swerved not to hit him because I was going to run him over.  
Then I came back to see what had happened and he was already 
bleeding more,'' Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was unable to speak because his mouth was filled with blood,  
she said, and he then fell to the ground.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Gives Accounting Co. $1B Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cisco Systems, a leading maker of computer  
networking equipment, has agreed to invest $1 billion in KPMG LLP 
to aid the accounting and consulting firm's expansion onto the 
Internet, a published report said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose-Calif.-based Cisco was expected to announce the  
agreement Monday, The New York Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal, KPMG will use the money to hire  
4,000 engineers and service professionals to develop and deliver 
Internet-based data, voice and video services to its clients, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 18 months, KPMG will build six technology centers  
-- four in the United States and two abroad, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Cisco will own a stake of less than 20 percent in  
KPMG, the U.S. unit of privately-held KPMG International, No. 3 
among the big five accounting firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from both companies said they believe there is a  
winner-takes-all prize for companies that win the race to 
incorporate the Internet into their business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a realization that you can be out of business in  
three years,'' John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive told the 
Times. ``Whoever moves quickly first are those who will benefit 
over the next 10 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Butler, KPMG chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the New York-based firm has been courting potential technology 
partners in recent months. One result was a joint venture announced 
in June with Qwest Communications International to provide order 
processing.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Oil-Dumping Complaint Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent oil producers awaited word Monday  
whether their claims of unfair trade practices against major 
foreign oil producers would get a full government hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma-based oilmen filed a petition with the Commerce  
Department charging that Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Iraq 
have been selling oil in the U.S. market at artificially low prices 
in violation of America's anti-dumping trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department's Import Administration was to decide  
whether the oilmen have adequate standing for the case to be heard. 
Opponents, including the major international oil companies, have 
argued the case ought to be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	If the government decides to accept the petition by the  
Oklahoma-based group, Save Domestic Oil Inc., investigations will 
be triggered on whether the U.S. industry has been economically 
harmed by artificially low prices of oil imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade experts have been astounded by the use of the anti-dumping  
trade laws on oil imports because oil prices always have been 
viewed as highly volatile and determined largely by international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harold Hamm, chairman of the independent oilmen's coalition,  
said oil wasn't that much different from other commodities such as 
imported steel when it comes to price manipulation. ``Dumping did 
occur and it put 100,000 people out of jobs. ... Our only line of 
defense is the trade laws,'' said Hamm, an oil producer from Enid, 
Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition charged that the foreign producers sold oil in the  
United States in some cases for less than it cost to produce and in 
other cases for less than they sold it for in other markets such as 
Japan. They also charged that government subsidies to the 
government-owned oil companies violated U.S. trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign producers deny the charges. Mexico particularly has  
expressed outrage at the petition and recently said it would put on 
hold plans to cut tariffs on U.S. natural gas sent to Mexico until 
the matter is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition also has prompted strong opposition from the major  
U.S. oil companies. The American Petroleum Institute formally 
opposed the independent oilmen's petition, arguing that a favorable 
ruling would disrupt the international oil marketing system and 
lead to higher U.S. prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the long term, it's difficult to see who would benefit  
from this action,'' argued Red Cavaney, president of the American 
Petroleum Institute. More than 100 associations and major energy 
users from truckers to chemical companies also opposed the 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm discounted the opposition of the large oil companies, many  
of which have major international operations. ``They have totally 
separate interests from ours,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm said hundreds of small, independent producers joined in  
support of the petition, which sought to underscore that low-price 
foreign imports have driven down oil prices in the United States to 
a point where the domestic industry can't survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many trade experts found it strange to use the unfair  
trade laws in challenging oil prices, especially since intervention 
almost certainly would drive up U.S. gas and energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's absurd about this case is Americans have been opposed  
to higher oil prices for my entire adult lifetime and here we have 
a case where the effect could well be to raise prices,'' said 
Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution and a 
frequent critic of the anti-dumping laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Litan said a favorable ruling, resulting in steep tariffs on  
imported oil and higher prices at gasoline pumps, could result in a 
backlash against the anti-dumping laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Hutbauer, a trade expert at the Institute for International  
Economics, agreed. ``There are a lot of other users of the 
anti-dumping (provision) who do not want this case to go further,'' 
he said. ``It puts a real spotlight on it.''

<HEADLINE> HMOs Lost $490 Million Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most health maintenance organizations lost money  
for a second year in a row in 1998, prompting many plans to raise 
premiums and cut benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs lost a combined $490 million last year, compared to a $768  
million loss in 1997, according to a study released Monday by Weiss 
Ratings, an independent ratings service based in Palm Beach 
Gardens, Fla. Before 1997, the HMO industry was profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	About 56 percent of HMOs lost money last year, down slightly  
from the 57 percent in 1997, the Weiss study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not good news for the consumer,'' said Martin Weiss,  
chairman of Weiss Ratings. That's because HMOs that lose money are 
more likely to go out of business, quit unprofitable markets or 
raise premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO industry's financial health should improve again this  
year as a result of many plans raising premiums by more than 5 
percent and curtailing coverage of Medicare recipients, Weiss said. 
Higher rates led to the narrower losses in 1998, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 576 HMOs analyzed by Weiss, 100 failed to have enough  
fiscal reserves as called for under guidelines set by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners. The guidelines seek to 
ensure that the HMOs have enough money to pay claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has a long way to go before consumers are safe,''  
Weiss said 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs operated by United HealthCare lost $174.6 million last  
year, most among large HMOs, the Weiss study found. Prudential 
HealthCare, which last week was bought by Aetna, lost nearly $60 
million in 1998. Aetna's HMOs lost about $15.9 million. Aetna is 
now the nation's largest health insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The steep losses raise the question of whether plans will skimp  
on coverage to save money, said Peter Young, a consultant with 
Health Care Strategic Issues in Fort Myers, Fla. ``These numbers 
are not good, no matter how you look at it,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and hospital executives have complained for the past few  
years about problems getting HMOs to paying medical bills. They say 
HMOs' financial problems are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Few large HMOs have gone bankrupt in recent years, but when they  
do, consumers can be left scrambling for insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200,000 New Jersey residents last fall had to find a new  
health insurance coverage when HIP Health Plan of New Jersey went 
bankrupt in one of the biggest fiscal collapses in the industry's 
history.

<HEADLINE> NBC, Snap.com Link With Net2Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is taking a stake in Net2Phone Inc., a  
company that provides telephone service over the Internet, in 
exchange for prominent placement of links on the network's top Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the NBC.com, Snap.com and NBC Interactive  
Neighborhood Web sites will be able to search yellow and white page 
phone listings and click any listing to automatically dial the 
number using Net2Phone's service, the companies announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, NBC, the broadcasting unit of General Electric, and  
Snap.com would acquire an equity stake in Net2Phone, with NBC 
gaining the right to nominate a board member to Net2Phone's board 
of directors. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Net2Phone's stock jumped by 26.5 percent on the news, climbing  
$4.37 1/2 to $20.87 1/2 in afternoon trading today on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hackensack, N.J.-based company claims 30 percent of the  
Internet phone service worldwide, with 250,000 customers. While it 
has had some quarters of profitability, it has yet to turn an 
annual profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was founded in 1997 as a subsidiary of IDT Corp., a  
long-distance carrier which still owns two-thirds of the business. 
Net2Phone successfully raised $81 million in an initial public 
offering of stock on July 29. After an initial surge, the stock has 
drifted lower, toward the initial offer price. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the service to place long-distance calls requires the  
Net2Phone caller to have a computer with speakers and a microphone 
and the company's free software available at its Web site. The 
recipient does not need a computer and can pick up the call on 
their regular phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	Net2Phone charges under 5 cents a minute for domestic calls  
anywhere in the United States. Calls from the United States to 
Argentina or Japan would be 42 cents and 17 cents a minute, 
respectively, according to rates posted on the company's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Snap.com, a joint venture between NBC and online media company  
CNET, is slated to be merged with NBC.com and other properties 
later this year to form NBC Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement with Net2Phone will powerfully bridge NBC's  
Internet properties with the most ubiquitous consumer technology in 
the history of the world -- the telephone,'' said Martin J. 
Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive Media.

<HEADLINE> Long-Distance Price War Heats Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A price battle in long-distance calling heated  
up today when MCI WorldCom launched a nickel-a-minute plan for 
weeknights and weekends -- similar to a new Sprint promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom is offering the new consumer rate, which comes with  
a monthly fee, on state-to-state calls between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. on 
weekdays and all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Daytime calling rates on weekdays are 25 cents per minute for  
customers paying a monthly fee of $1.95, or 10 cents per minute 
with a monthly fee of $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
	The promotion, an extension of MCI WorldCom's popular ``5 Cent  
Sundays'' plan, comes just weeks after Sprint introduced a ``Nickel 
Nights'' plan with a 5-cent rate on long-distance calls from 7 p.m. 
to midnight and a 10-cent rate at other times. The Sprint plan 
comes with a monthly fee of $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Both initiatives sharply undercut the best off-peak rates  
advertised by AT&AMP;T, the overwhelming leader in market share in the 
residential market for long-distance calling. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's most prominent promotions are a flat rate of 15 cents a  
minute at any time with no monthly fee, and a 10-cent rate around 
the clock with a monthly fee of $4.95. AT&AMP;T provides a 5-cent 
option on Sunday calling by request only. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, the nation's second biggest long-distance company,  
said the lower rates were made possible by recent reductions in the 
rates they pay to local telephone companies to connect 
long-distance calls to the nation's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the price-cutting is seen by many observers as a bid to  
win as many customers as possible before local phone companies can 
gain government approval to offer long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baby Bell monopolies still need to prove that their markets  
are open to competition for local phone service, but some industry 
analysts expect a breakthrough in certain states within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Baby Bells enter the market, the distinction between  
long-distance and local calling may begin to disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
	Since voice traffic places marginal demand on the fiber-optic  
networks that are being built to carry floods of Internet traffic, 
regular phone service may be bundled with wireless communications, 
Internet access and television.

<HEADLINE> US Protest Marks A-Bomb Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Martin Sheen was among 400 anti-nuclear  
protesters who rallied outside Los Alamos National Laboratory 
Monday, the 54th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan. 
Sheen and 75 others were briefly detained. 
</P>
<P>
	The group protested the lab's production of a new plutonium pit,  
which is the core of a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the generation that brought the bomb in. We have got to  
be the generation that should take it out,'' Sheen said during a 
mile-long march to the lab before the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Lab officials allowed the crowd to protest in a parking area  
outside a lab building, Sheen was taken into custody after he 
stepped over a yellow cord into a restricted area. 
</P>
<P>
	He knelt and said the Lord's Prayer, then told security agents:  
``I'm all yours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheen, 59, and the others detained during the 45-minute rally  
were put on buses and driven a mile to a downtown park, where their 
plastic handcuffs were snipped off. The U.S. Attorney will not seek 
to prosecute any of the 76 people, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment on the protest, lab spokesman John Bass said:  
``There is nothing really the lab can say about it. Disarmament 
would be a good idea, except for the fact that the lab, along with 
the other labs -- the DOE complex -- have been mandated by the 
Department of Energy, the Congress and the president to make the 
nuclear weapons stockpile, and that's what we do. That's our 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Alamos was the birthplace of the atomic bomb, created during  
World War II under the Manhattan Project. Nagasaki, Japan, was 
bombed Aug. 9, 1945, to end the war.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Tests New, High-Speed Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) -- On a remote, brush-covered prairie in  
southeastern Colorado, what has been billed the fastest train in 
the country is being put to the test. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of engineers watch from a gravel road as the sleek,  
bullet-nosed train flashes through the landscape of sagebrush and 
sunflowers. Eventually it will reach 150 mph, with the capability 
to go even faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had it up to 167 mph a couple weeks ago,'' Ernie Chance,  
Amtrak's assistant chief mechanic officer, said from inside the 
engineer's quarters. ``And it felt like she still had more power in 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of 20 high-speed electric trains named Acelas that  
Amtrak is building as part of a $2 billion project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Acelas, unveiled in March, will be used along routes  
connecting Boston, New York and Washington, with the first 
passenger runs scheduled for November or December. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, one of the electric-powered trains is running in  
circles -- lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
	It is being tested for up to 16 hours a day on a 13-mile track  
at the Transportation Technology Center, which sprawls across 52 
square miles of land about 25 miles northeast of Pueblo. The center 
is a subsidiary of the Association of American Railroads, 
representing North American freight railroads and Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remote and we can do a lot of testing with relative  
secrecy,'' said Keith Hawthorne, the center's vice president of 
technology. ``Our customers like that. They want to be able to iron 
out their problems in private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Acelas are designed to tilt gently as the trains rush around  
curves. That doesn't promote speed as much as it prevents 
centrifugal force from throwing the passengers around. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the tilt mechanism deactivated for a test run at a  
mere 110 mph, the ride on the special test track is much smoother 
and freer of vibration than Amtrak's existing Metroliner service in 
the Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no need to grab the seats for balance while walking down  
the train's aisle. Filling in a crossword puzzle is easy -- if you 
know the answers -- and the quiet ride makes conversation easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bistro car will have standup tables with pedestal seating  
like a bar,'' said Chance. ``With this ride, especially with the 
tilt-system on, it should be as comfortable for people to stand up 
as it is to sit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two cars of the train that is being tested have been transformed  
into traveling laboratories, filled with computers, printers and 
miles of cable. A dozen engineers perform tests on the train's 
propulsion, endurance, acceleration, energy consumption, wheel wear 
and ride quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyday we have a problem that we fix the next day,'' said  
Gilles Losier, the supervisor of quality assurance and testing for 
Bombardier Inc., the train's Montreal-based manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	The most difficult problem encountered so far occurred when the  
wheel sets began shaking at speeds over 130 mph. The wheels, a 
French design, were reshaped to fit more closely with the 
American-made track. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, old tracks on the Washington-New York line will limit  
the Acelas to 135 mph, Chance said. That's still 10 mph faster than 
the Metroliners run now, and will slice 16 minutes off the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tracks are reconfigured, the trains will be able to  
run at 150 mph, cutting an additional 13 minutes off the trip, said 
John Wolf, an Amtrak spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-Boston leg will require new overhead electrical  
wires in addition to track improvements. Wolf says Amtrak hopes to 
trim that trip from 4 1/2 hours to three hours.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Activists Disrupt Gore Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LACONIA , N.H. (AP) -- Activists protesting U.S. opposition to a  
South African AIDS drug policy disrupted a campaign speech by Vice 
President Al Gore Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's greed kills,'' they chanted as Gore tried to address  
about 100 voters. ``AIDS drugs for Africa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said above the din, ``Let's hear it for free speech. ...  
I'd like to talk to you about the risky Republican tax scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore then offered to meet with the activists later. ``I'll be  
glad to talk to you all after the event if you want to have a 
conversation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several activists were escorted out of the building but were not  
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS activists from ACT-UP have been protesting U.S. trade  
policies toward South Africa at Gore events for months. They say 
administration policies increase the difficulty of getting 
affordable AIDS drugs to South Africans who need them. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants the Pretoria government to amend a 1997  
law giving it unspecified power to obtain cheaper, generic AIDS 
drugs for the country, where more than 3 million people have the 
virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa wants to import AIDS medicines from countries where  
they are sold more cheaply under patent agreements, or license 
production within South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 pharmaceutical companies worldwide are challenging the  
law in South African courts, fearing it may be used in a way that 
violates their patent rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus,  
Gore said in June that he does not oppose South Africa's attempts 
to produce or obtain generic AIDS medicines as long as those 
efforts do not violate laws protecting patents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he was trying to resolve the dispute with then-Vice  
President Thabo Mbeki, who is now South Africa's president. Mbeki 
and Gore co-chair a commission on U.S.-South African relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was the guest of honor at the Belknap County Democrats'  
picnic in Laconia and then at the Merrimack County Democrats' pig 
roast at a Hopkinton home. Nine AIDS activists confronted Gore 
inside St. James Episcopal Church in Laconia, where the picnic was 
moved due to rain. The group followed him to Hopkinton, but was not 
allowed onto the grounds of the home. The protesters chanted and 
handed out leaflets to passersby. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Gore outlined a $100 million initiative to fight  
AIDS in Africa. The spending proposals included $48 million for 
AIDS education, counseling and testing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. No Closer To Nabbing bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- One year after terrorist bombs  
ravaged its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and killed 224 people, 
the United States is no closer to arresting the man it believes 
masterminded the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has put suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden on its 10  
Most Wanted List, offered a $5 million reward for his arrest and 
tried to make international pariahs of his hosts, Afghanistan's 
Taliban rulers. The efforts have largely failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of fresh but unspecified terrorist threats, the United  
States is closing embassies and halting its popular public tours of 
FBI headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government has had no success winning cooperation from  
either the Taliban, who say bin Laden is a guest to be protected, 
or neighboring Pakistan, the Taliban's greatest ally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban offer several reasons for keeping bin Laden. They  
have no extradition treaty, and they say they have no proof bin 
Laden is involved in terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan denies aiding the Taliban -- although even the United  
Nations says it does -- and contends it has no leverage to get the 
Taliban to turn over bin Laden. Because the United States gives 
neither military nor humanitarian aid to Pakistan, it has little 
leverage itself to enlist Pakistan's cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial sanctions imposed by the United States against  
Afghanistan are ineffectual because the two nations have almost no 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban, who control 90 percent of the country and preach  
probably the harshest brand of Islam operating in the world today, 
seem unlikely to give up a man extolled as a hero by radical 
Islamic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, however, the Taliban did end their pretense of not  
knowing where bin Laden was, acknowledging he still lived in 
Afghanistan and still was a guest to be protected. They also denied 
reports he was planning to seek sanctuary in another Islamic 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	But they would not say precisely where he lives because they  
fear another Tomahawk cruise missile attack. Last August, the 
United States fired dozens of missiles at Khost, in eastern 
Afghanistan, where it believed bin Laden was running a terrorist 
training camp. The missiles killed 26 people but not bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, sightings of bin Laden were rare. The Saudi  
millionaire was reportedly seen in late June or early July near the 
eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, barely 45 miles from the border 
with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Afghans in the area say bin Laden is operating a training camp  
at an old communist-era collective farm known as Farmadda, about 3 
miles southeast of Jalalabad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bin laden is training his own people for terrorist activities  
around the world,'' said an Afghan who once trained with bin Laden 
at Tora Bora, also in eastern Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They include Sudanese, Algerians, Tajiks, Iranians and  
Egyptians,'' he said. ``Osama has dozens of camps. They train on 
anti-aircraft guns, explosives, chemical and biological weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same Afghan warrior, who didn't want to be identified  
because he feared for his life, said he had been trained to use 
chemical and biological weapons. The training was conducted by a 
North Korean. 
</P>
<P>
	His claim was impossible to verify independently.  
</P>
<P>
	Recent reports say bin Laden has tightened his security, with  
land mines planted around his training camps and his compounds 
protected by anti-aircraft weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely staying for more than a few hours in one place, bin Laden  
reportedly travels in a bulletproof vehicle with the barrels of 
automatic rifles poking through small holes. He is seldom 
accompanied by fewer than 100 guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are strong rumors of late that the United States will  
attack the base of Osama,'' said an Afghan living in Jalalabad who 
gave his name as Sher Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't believe the Americans would succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He protects himself,'' he said. ``He is a clever man.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's Los Angeles Times reported that Saudi officials reached  
a secret deal with Taliban rulers last summer for the surrender of 
bin Laden two months before the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agreement began to crumble during the same period that  
authorities now believe the attacks were being plotted, the 
newspaper said. The negotiations ended amid a flurry of 
recriminations in the aftermath of the Aug. 7, 1998, bombings.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games End After Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- They ended with Freddy Krueger winning  
the final gold medal and athletes dancing the merengue in the rain 
at the closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13th Pan American Games, plagued by seven positive drug  
tests and nine Cuban defections, but highlighted by the enthusiasm 
of the youthful competitors, concluded Sunday. Krueger, a water 
skier from Orlando, Fla., -- no, his address is not on Elm Street -- 
won the men's jumping event, giving the United States its 106th 
gold and 296th medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty cool to win the gold medal,'' Krueger said. ``You  
grow up watching the Olympics; this isn't the Olympics, but it's as 
close as we get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the hemispheric Olympics, and the United States ended it  
with the most medals, by far. The final count showed the U.S. team 
with 296 (106 gold, 110 silver, 80 bronze), followed by Canada with 
196 (64-52-80) and Cuba with 156 (69-40-47). 
</P>
<P>
	But Sunday's feature event, the men's basketball final, did not  
add to the gold rush. The U.S. men have not won the Pan Ams gold 
since 1983, and the collection of CBA all-stars sent this year lost 
to Brazil 95-78 -- its worst loss in men's basketball. The 
Brazilians ran their patterns to perfection and shot 60 percent in 
the first half to take control. They went inside to 6-foot-10 A.J. 
Santos to hold off the charging Americans in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played a great, great game,'' guard Damon Bailey said.  
``I'm not sure if we would have been together for 10 years we could 
have beaten them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States didn't fare so well in basketball, it  
won gold in women's softball and soccer, as expected. The world 
champion softball team outscored opponents 83-1 and had three 
no-hitters, two of them perfect games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also won in men's water polo to get an Olympic  
berth. The silver medal behind Cuba for a group of baseball minor 
leaguers also earned a spot in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The final day had no defections, but Cuba went home stung by  
nine members of its delegation leaving. And there were four more 
positive drug tests, costing two Cuban weightlifters their gold 
medals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem in Olympic sports is drugs,'' Pan American  
Sports Organization president Mario Vazquez Rana said after 
announcing that William Vargas, winner in the 136.4-pound 
weightlifting class, and Rolando Delgado, the 152-pound class 
winner, tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone. 
Baseball players Roberto Vizcarra and Hector Alvarez also tested 
positive for Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do not win over the drugs, drugs will win over us,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The others who failed drug tests were all gold medalists: Steve  
Vezina, the goalie on Canada's in-line roller hockey team, and high 
jumpers Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, the men's indoor and outdoor 
world record-holder and 1992 Olympic champion, and Juana Rosario 
Arrendel of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Mexican baseball player Ray Martinez refused to be  
tested, which was tantamount to testing positive. 
</P>
<P>
	At the closing ceremony, featuring a temporary reuniting of  
Winnipeg's contribution to rock music, The Guess Who, highlights of 
the competition played on the large screen at the far end of the 
stadium while some 2,500 athletes and coaches marched en masse. It 
was an unruly gaggle who danced and swayed and gyrated to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes and administrators did the merengue and cha cha in the  
rain, and even organized a wave in the stands while Vazquez Rana 
attempted to make his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guess Who, a 1960s band that long since split, performed  
``American Woman,'' ``These Eyes,'' ``No Time,'' and ``Undun,'' as 
athletes, volunteers and anyone who could get to the field huddled 
around the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	They left to a long ovation, and the Pan Ams headed to the  
Dominican Republic for 2003.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft in Wireless Internet Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Softbank Co. said Monday it is in  
negotiations with Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Microsoft Corp. on a 
joint venture in the telecommunications area. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments follow a newspaper report that the three companies  
have agreed in principle to set up a low-cost, wireless Internet 
connection service. 
</P>
<P>
	Softbank confirmed the talks but would not give details. An  
official at Tokyo Electric Power, or TEPCO, also confirmed that the 
joint venture is under consideration, but said details still were 
being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Monday that the firms will  
announce the plan on Wednesday. The newspaper said the service 
would be launched in the region around Tokyo in the middle of next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies would expand the network to other parts of the  
nation in cooperation with other electric power providers, the 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep monthly connection fees lower, the joint venture will  
establish a new Internet infrastructure rather than using the 
network of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners are in the final phase of deciding the  
capitalization of the joint venture, which is expected to be set at 
10 billion yen ($87 million), the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Softbank will put up the majority of the capital, and Yahoo!  
Japan, a subsidiary of the American company Yahoo! Inc., which 
provides an Internet portal service, also plans to invest, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will provide a low-cost Internet connection  
service through a wireless data transmission system. Users will be 
able to connect to the Internet using wireless transmitters via 
relay base stations to be installed on utility poles owned by 
TEPCO. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo Telecommunication Network Co., an affiliate of TEPCO, will  
provide the main network, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Columbine District Adds Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The school board that governs Columbine  
High School adopted 27 districtwide security measures Monday, 
including panic alarms in main offices and mandatory identification 
badges for all high school students and staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The only recommendation by the Jefferson County school  
district's Safety Task Force that was rejected, because of cost, 
was the addition of a second non-uniformed campus supervisor at 
each of the 16 high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the high schools and the district's 18 middle schools  
now have a uniformed school resource officer who is a policeman or 
sheriff's deputy, and all will have one under the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students will return to their school on Aug. 16 for  
the first time since the April 20 massacre. Columbine seniors Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with guns and pipe bombs, 
killed 12 students and a teacher, wounded 23 others, then took 
their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Other measures adopted Monday include: requiring visitors to get  
a school pass, the continued use of search dogs and the 
installation of a hot line and tip box to report incidents that 
might lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some task force members asked whether the measures would have  
stopped the shooting rampage had they been in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found all of our recommendations can create some kind of  
safety in the schools. I think some of these recommendations could 
have prevented what happened,'' said task force member and 
Columbine student Sergie Gonzalez.

<HEADLINE> Kan. School Panel Debates Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The State Board of Education is expected to  
vote this week on whether evolution should be left off a list of 
topics on statewide assessment tests in science for high school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of all six state universities have sent a letter to  
the board chairwoman saying the proposal ``will set Kansas back a 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some conservative members on the panel say they object to  
describing Charles Darwin's theory as one of the basic tenets of 
science, saying it cannot be proven. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators from around the country will be closely watching the  
board's vote, scheduled for Wednesday. The 10-member board has 
split 5-5 along philosophical lines in recent years, and it is 
unclear how much support there is for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going back to the 1880s,'' said Charlie Pierce of  
Hutchinson High School, who has taught biology for 18 years. ``It 
does make us look to the people in the rest of the country that 
we're a bunch of hicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that public  
schools cannot teach creationism -- the theory that a higher power 
created the universe. The proposal's opponents say the 
conservatives are trying their only remaining tactic -- trying to 
limit the teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas is one of a handful of states -- including Arizona,  
Alabama, Illinois, New Mexico, Texas and Nebraska -- where, in 
recent years, school boards have attempted to take evolution out of 
state science standards or de-emphasize evolutionary concepts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas school boards would not have to follow the proposed  
standards when they formulate curricula. But the standards would 
determine what students can be asked about on statewide assessment 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the state has no list of topics that should be on the  
tests. Educators are forming such a list -- it likely will require 
questions about parts of the atom, genetics and forms of energy, 
for example -- and the debate is over whether evolution should be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, three board members formed a committee to work out  
a compromise between educators who favor standards stressing 
evolution's importance and those who think schools should be able 
to decide what to teach about the origins of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's proposal mentions natural selection -- the idea  
that advantageous traits increase in a population over time -- but 
dropped from an earlier plan a section calling evolution by natural 
selection ``a broad, unifying theoretical framework in biology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's report says only that students should develop an  
understanding of evolution but makes no mention of whether they 
should be tested on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Board member Bill Wagnon said he plans to ask the board to vote  
on a different proposal, written by a committee of 27 science 
educators. Their standards call for students to be tested on 
evolution in 10th grade. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter the outcome, the debate has already drawn the interest  
of educators elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think other states are looking at what's going on in  
Kansas,'' said Molleen Matsumura, network project director of the 
National Center for Science Education in El Cerrito, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the National Academy of Sciences said evolution must  
be taught in public schools if children are to understand biology 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization issued a guidebook for teachers, parents and  
school administrators that asserted: ``There is no debate within 
the scientific community over whether evolution has occurred, and 
there is no evidence that evolution has not occurred.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks Continue To Remake Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Let's see who's left with the Atlanta Hawks.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith? Nope, he's in Portland. Mookie Blaylock? He's gone,  
too. Now, the roster is filled with names like Isaiah Rider, Jim 
Jackson, Jason Terry and Lorenzen Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger, quicker players. The kind of players the Hawks are  
counting on to get them past the second round of the playoffs for 
the first time since the franchise moved to Atlanta in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're closer than we've ever been to accomplishing our  
goals,'' team president Stan Kasten said Sunday, announcing the 
acquisition of Wright from the Los Angeles Clippers for two 
first-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup began after Atlanta was swept by the New York Knicks  
in the second round of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks traded Blaylock, their point guard since 1992, to  
Golden State for Bimbo Coles and the 10th pick in the draft, which 
was used to select Terry as Blaylock's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	On draft night, Atlanta also set in motion the trade that would  
send Smith, the team's leading scorer the last four seasons, to the 
Portland Trail Blazers for Rider and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta had three more picks in the first round, keeping forward  
Cal Bowlder and guard Dion Glover and trading Jumaine Jones for a 
future first-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks didn't keep that pick for long, using it Sunday along  
with their own first-round selection in 2000 in a sign-and-trade 
deal for the 6-foot-11 Wright, who adds much-needed depth at both 
center and strong forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that we had to supplement further,'' Kasten said. ``We  
did not know we would be able to trade Mookie for something 
terrific. We didn't know we could trade Steve Smith. We didn't know 
that we could go young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually overnight, the Hawks have changed the look of their  
roster from aging, slow and thin to young, quick and deep. Smith 
and Blaylock are both in their 30s; Rider, Jackson and Wright are 
in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the Hawks are taking some major gambles. They  
are hoping that Terry, a lightning-quick guard from Arizona but 
only 21, can run the offense right away. They are crossing their 
fingers with Rider, whose career has been overshadowed by numerous 
run-ins with the league and the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks and Clippers discussed a Jackson-for-Wright deal early  
last week, but Atlanta decided against it because ``that would 
trade one shortcoming for another,'' Kasten said, helping the 
frontline while hurting depth in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was kind of down a little because I thought the trade might  
not happen,'' the 23-year-old Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, when he contemplated a one-year, $2 million offer from the  
Lakers, the Clippers agreed to trade Wright to the Hawks for two 
draft picks. In addition to Atlanta's pick, Los Angeles gets a 
lottery-protected selection that originally belonged to Toronto, 
meaning it doesn't kick in until the Raptors make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to get to a winning situation, get to an  
established team that's already winning so I can win,'' said 
Wright, who agreed to a seven-year contract worth about $42 million 
after turning down a six-year, $30 million offer from the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, the No. 7 pick in the 1997 draft, averaged 6.6 points  
and 7.5 rebounds last season, splitting time at center with rookie 
Michael Olowokandi and at forward with Maurice Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright should fill a similar role with the Hawks behind Dikembe  
Mutombo and Alan Henderson, or he could wind up starting at forward 
with Henderson still recovering from an eye injury that kept him 
out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is over the salary cap, but took advantage of a trade  
exception worth $4.4 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting another big, young, strong, athletic, quick big man  
... was kind of a wish list item of ours,'' Kasten said. ``We feel 
sensational about this. We have added a real important piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers have already lost free agents Rodney Rogers and  
Darrick Martin without getting anything in return, although they 
did pull off a sign-and-trade deal with Cleveland in which they 
received Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman for Lamond Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very, very pleased with the outcome of this trade,''  
said Elgin Baylor, the Clippers vice president of basketball 
operations. ``The two first-round picks give us more flexibility

<HEADLINE> LA NFL Meeting Gets Mixed Responses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The president of the Los Angeles Memorial  
Coliseum Commission tried to put a positive spin on Monday's 
special meeting called to discuss the stalled effort to bring an 
NFL expansion team to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, there's a lot that was accomplished today,'' Sheldon H.  
Sloan said. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to tell you. We have better things to do than  
sit around and talk for two or three hours (if it's not 
productive),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see that there is support for ongoing discussions. I  
have cautious optimism. Right now, I have a confidence that 
everybody's going to sit down during this quiet time and think 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zev Yaroslavsky, another member of the panel, spoke in much  
different terms following the two-hour, closed-door meeting at the 
Coliseum offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fourth-and-long,'' Yaroslavsky said. ``It's a  
long shot at this point. Right now, we're farther away than we've 
ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, Yaroslavsky might have added, the clock continues to tick.  
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations focusing on a remodeled Coliseum as home to the  
NFL's 32nd franchise broke down last week, with the league saying 
it would consider other potential stadium sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point in negotiations was over public money the NFL  
wants for parking and other improvements to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL decided in March to grant Los Angeles an expansion team,  
but set a Sept. 15 deadline for details to be finalized, with 
Houston to be considered if that doesn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't bet the farm, if I owned it,'' Yaroslavsky said.  
``I wouldn't necessarily bet against it. This thing has more lives 
than a cat. There are a lot of keys, there are a lot of egos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he thought it was possible for the NFL to come to  
an agreement with another venue, Yaroslavsky replied, ``I don't 
know of any. I may be wrong. It'll be hard to do it here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yaroslavsky, a Los Angeles County supervisor, has spoken out  
against public money going to the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission issued a statement championing the cause of Los  
Angeles for an expansion team and expressing hope that the NFL 
``will come to recognize the benefits of a Coliseum-based solution 
as it continues to review its options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also mentioned a letter sent to NFL Commissioner  
Paul Tagliabue by Eli Broad, head of the Coliseum effort, last week 
that proposed some public funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I do not specifically endorse this, or any other  
proposal made since that date, the commission recognizes that 
aspects of the proposal have merit and deserve further 
discussion,'' Sloan said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has supported the  
Coliseum effort to house an NFL team for several years, also issued 
a statement, saying among other things that he had sent letters to 
Gov. Gray Davis and Tagliabue urging them ``to not abandon this 
effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley-Thomas called for a ``45-day plan'' to work out a deal  
before the deadline, despite the recent setbacks in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday night there were no new  
positive developments, and the league would have no response to 
either statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad's partner, Ed Roski Jr., appeared at Ridley-Thomas' news  
conference before the commission meeting and said his group planned 
to speak with the NFL ``until they tell us to go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has been without an NFL team since the  
Raiders moved back to Oakland and the Rams moved from Anaheim to 
St. Louis before the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders owner Al Davis has talked about returning his team to  
the area, and there appear to be other possibilities for the 
nation's No. 2 media market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a team playing in LA, one way or the other,''  
Roski said.

<HEADLINE> Crops Push Grains, Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures continued their rally  
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid worries weekend rains did 
little to relieve stressed crops. 
</P>
<P>
        Widespread showers fell over the weekend across bone-dry areas  
of the Midwest, but there were conflicting views about whether rainfall 
totals were adequate to relieve crops where soil moisture had fallen 
to critical levels. 
</P>
<P>
        The government last week reported a sharp downturn in crop  
conditions in key growing states, including Illinois and Indiana. That 
led many analysts to revise downward their expectations for bumper 
fall harvests. 
</P>
<P>
        Forecasters predicted only light rainfall this week, which  
some investors said would be inadequate for replenishing and reviving 
corn and soybean plants. 
</P>
<P>
        Investors were expected to closely watch the U.S. Agriculture  
Department's late release of its weekly crop update for signs of additional 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.97 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.36 a bushel; December oats rose 1 
1/2 cents to $1.19 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 5 cents to 
$4.88 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle fell .38 cent to 64.97 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle fell .07 cent to 76.85 cents a pound; October lean hogs 
rose .05 cent to 45.65 cents a pound; February pork bellies rose .10 
cent to 55.87 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> FTC Sues Over Illegal Pyramid Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission announced a  
lawsuit on Monday against a business operation accused of using 
illegal pyramid schemes to cheat consumers out of $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities from six states joined in the  
complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Nevada, against Equinox 
International Corp. and its affiliates, Advanced Marketing 
Seminars, Inc.; and BG Management, Inc. The companies are based in 
Las Vegas, and the suit also names their founder, William Gouldd. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission charged the operators of the business with  
misrepresenting the potential profits to be earned by participants. 
</P>
<P>
	While the companies purport to sell water filters, vitamins,  
nutritional supplements and skin care products, the real way 
participants make money is by successfully recruiting other 
distributors, not by actual retail sales, the FTC said. As part of 
this illegal pyramid scheme, new participants paid money to the 
company for the right to sell its products, according to the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also alleged that while recruits were expressly  
told they would receive substantial income from joining the scheme, 
only those managers at the ``top'' of the pyramid -- who profited 
from the sales of subsequent recruits -- found the venture 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the FTC, the scheme has caused more than $200  
million in consumer injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Jorgenson of Equinox said no one was available to comment  
on the case. BG Management also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Distributors used classified ``Help Wanted'' ads to entice new  
participants, implying that they would earn lucrative salaries, 
according to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a job interview, the recruits were given an hour-long  
sales presentation where they were told that they can make money by 
selling products to consumers, but the distributors indicated that 
real financial gains would come from recruiting others, the FTC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify as a manager and become eligible to sell products and  
recruit others, new participants had to buy $5,000 worth of 
products. They also were encouraged to rent desk space in the local 
office for several hundred dollars a month and spend several 
hundred dollars to attend seminars sponsored by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these expenses typically outweighed any money the  
distributor might make, the FTC said in its complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has granted a temporary restraining order against the  
company and placed it in receivership for the time being. The FTC 
is asking for a permanent injunction and consumer redress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gouldd has been the subject of law enforcement action before.  
California filed suit against him in 1990 for his work as a 
distributor of another multi-level marketing scheme. He signed a 
permanent injunction that barred him from future pyramid schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	The states that filed along with the commission are Hawaii,  
Maryland, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Giants Ink DE Strahan for $32M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Once Michael Strahan and the New York Giants  
agreed to take three years off their contract and drop the signing 
bonus by about $6 million, it didn't take long to make him the 
NFL's second-highest-paid defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan, the two-time Pro Bowl defensive end whose 29 sacks over  
the past two seasons led the NFL, signed a four-year, $32 million 
contract Monday, the largest in Giants' history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is a very modest guy,'' said Tony Agnone, Strahan's  
agent. ``He absolutely is the best defensive player in football, 
and they wanted to make him the highest-paid guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only Dallas cornerback Deion Sanders will make more than  
Strahan, averaging $10.3 million annually under terms of a complex 
contract. However, Sanders has to play more than 70 percent of the 
Cowboys' defensive plays to be No. 1, Agnone said. 
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't, Strahan will be the highest paid.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, recovering from toe surgery, is not in the Cowboys'  
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely happy. They made a commitment to me and I think  
we made a commitment to each other,'' Strahan said after signing 
the contract between practices at the University at Albany. ``I am 
happy to be in New York. I love New York and never wanted to go 
anywhere in the first place. So I'm glad they were able to get an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, Strahan will receive a $12 million  
signing bonus. The 27-year-old who grew up in Germany and didn't 
play football until his senior year in high school will earn 
$400,000 in salary this year. He will get $4.6 million in 2000 and 
then $7 million and $8 million, respectively, in the last two years 
of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Strahan's old contract with the Giants would have expired after  
this season, and he warned the team during the offseason to get it 
done before this season started. 
</P>
<P>
	Agnone and Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi met several  
times over the last month, discussing both long- and short-term 
contracts, as well ones with incentives, voidable years and other 
gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Their breakthrough meeting came last Wednesday at Giants  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we realized was, let's not try to make everything so  
complicated and make things more simple,'' Agnone said. ``As we 
simplified things, we started realizing we could make this 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a three-page contract, unlike some of the 35-page  
ones Accorsi has seen recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't get a contract any cleaner than this,'' Accorsi  
said. ``There isn't anything in it. There are five lines, each of 
the four years and the signing bonus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second-round draft pick in 1993 from Texas Southern, Strahan  
wasn't concerned about agreeing to a smaller signing bonus in 
return for a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather take that chance and see what I get negotiating a  
new contract instead of tying myself up for seven or eight years,'' 
Strahan said. ``I think I am young enough where I have enough 
confidence in my ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $8 million average salary makes Strahan the highest-paid  
defensive linemen, moving ahead of Minnesota's John Randle, who 
averages $6.5 million under a deal he signed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now entering his seventh season, Strahan blossomed the last two.  
He dominated up front and was selected to the Pro Bowl each year.

<HEADLINE> Underwood Said Divided on Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood spent the last week  
trying to decide between his love for football and his obligation 
to the ministry, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old defensive end walked out of training camp a week  
ago, leaving his family, his agent and team officials to speculate 
about his motive and whereabouts. The newspaper spoke with 
Underwood in a Philadelphia hotel lobby Sunday night while Vikings 
officials moved to cut ties with the first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deep down in my heart, I know I was not called to do that kind  
of work,'' Underwood said of the ministry. ``But recently, in the 
last month, I feel the Lord's been pulling me there. And I know 
that that is a huge conflict of interest, because what am I going 
to do in order to support my family?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has 16-month-old twins who live in Michigan with his  
former girlfriend. He also provides financial assistance to his 
mother, brother and sister in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also hesitant to return to Vikings training camp because  
he doesn't know how to approach the coaches he let down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I was man enough to confront coach (Dennis) Green and  
look him in the eyes and tell him what I've been going through,'' 
Underwood said. ``I hate to see the hurt in his eyes because of 
what I've done to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his first practice in Mankato, Minn., Underwood flagged  
down a motorist who took him to the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
International Airport. He flew to Cleveland, where his new black 
Lexus was parked. From there he headed to Philadelphia, where he 
has been since. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood spent four nights in the Marriott Hotel, checking in  
under his middle name, Paul. But he ran short of cash and spent 
Saturday night in his car. When interviewed, he had $8 in cash in 
his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year, $5.3 million contract he signed July 31 included a  
partly deferred $1.7 million signing bonus. The Vikings convinced a 
judge to freeze a half-million dollars. But part of the account 
remained liquid and Underwood said he took $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood said there is ``a real problem in his heart'' about  
taking money he didn't earn, and he doesn't plan to take more 
money. For their part, the Vikings are trying to dispose of 
Underwood's contract altogether, according to several reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Domann, Underwood's agent, said Sunday team officials told  
him they didn't want the former Michigan State player back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood realizes the implications of his action, but said it's  
more important to him to be humble. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want people to know is it's not about wasting a  
lucrative opportunity and the chance to become a star in the NFL,'' 
he said. ``It's not just about the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood also realizes that many will question his final  
decision -- whatever it may be. He wants to speak with people like 
Vikings receiver Cris Carter and retired Green Bay Packers star 
Reggie White about how to combine football and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if the Lord will have me come back to Minnesota.  
If I do -- if the Vikings will have me back -- that may very well be 
a humiliating experience,'' Underwood said. ``Not being part of the 
Minnesota Vikings goes against me, but doing the will of God also 
pulls me.''

<HEADLINE> Tulane Athletic Director Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Tulane athletic director Sandy Barbour  
resigned Monday, saying that recent talks with the university's new 
president convinced her it was time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become clear to me that the university was interested in  
different leadership,'' Barbour said. ``This is a business. And it 
has its ups and downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour, one of only eight female athletic directors in NCAA  
Division I-A, made her announcement after a year of major success 
for the school, including an undefeated football season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come as close as it comes to having it all,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The resignation was effective immediately. Senior associate  
athletic director Scott Devine was appointed interim athletic 
director. A search for a permanent replacement will begin in 
several weeks and could last four months, Tulane president Scott 
Cowen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowen said the resignation came after talks he had with Barbour  
over the last several months centering on the long-term future of 
Tulane's athletic programs and his expectations from an athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking for a different kind of leadership than she  
could provide,'' Cowen said. ``If you're looking for one simple 
explanation for this, the explanation doesn't exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to published and broadcast reports over the weekend,  
Barbour was criticized for failing to raise enough money at the 
private university and for her management style. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowen called the reports ``pretty good fiction ... some of which  
may be true and some of which not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour, 39, also declined to discuss the reports.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did the best job I think I could have done,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Barbour, who has been at Tulane since 1991, became athletic  
director on Sept. 13, 1996, replacing Kevin White. She was hired by 
former Tulane president Eamon Kelly, who retired in June 1998 and 
was replaced by Cowen. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first major move as athletic director was to fire Buddy  
Teevens as football coach after a 2-9 season in 1996. She hired 
Tommy Bowden, who turned around the program before leaving for 
Clemson in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the undefeated season, Tulane averaged only 27,944 for  
each home game in 1998 after selling about 5,000 season tickets. 
Bowden cited the lack of ``big-time'' atmosphere as the primary 
reason he left for Clemson.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Woman Allowed Off Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A federal judge has overturned the death  
sentence given to a 78-year-old woman believed to be the nation's 
oldest on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Ortrie Smith on Friday said Faye Copeland  
should be allowed off death row, said her attorney, Kent Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring appeal, Mrs. Copeland will remain in prison for the rest  
of her life, since Smith let stand her convictions for the murders 
of five transients. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were killed in an ongoing livestock swindle that  
involved her husband, Ray. Authorities said in the late 1980s the 
couple would hire transients as farmhands, get them involved in 
buying cattle with hot checks, then kill them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Copeland was also convicted and sentenced to death. He died  
in 1993 at age 78 while awaiting execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Copeland claimed she was an innocent bystander who was a  
victim of battered woman's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson filed the appeal because the jury that convicted Mrs.  
Copeland was not allowed to hear evidence of battered woman's 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson said he was happy that the threat of execution was  
removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is, she is a 78-year-old woman who is  
probably enjoying a better quality of life than what she had,'' 
Gibson said. ``She works in the greenhouse at the prison every day. 
She wouldn't hurt a fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came on Mrs. Copeland's 78th birthday,

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Rise for T-Bills / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills at  
a discount rate of 4.790 percent, up from 4.695 percent last week. 
An additional $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 
4.915 percent, up from 4.750 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Aug. 31, 1998, when  
the bills sold for 4.800 percent. The six-month rate was the 
highest since June 28, when the rate was 4.960. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.930 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,877.60, and 5.125 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,751.50. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.13 
percent last week from 5.07 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Suit Against Nation of Islam Tossed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing the Nation of Islam  
of discrimination for barring women from a public speech by leader 
Louis Farrakhan has been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Regina Quinlan ruled that the First Amendment guarantee of  
freedom of religion took priority over anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom of religion and freedom of religious expression, which  
traditionally will exempt a religion from certain discrimination 
laws, is applicable here,'' Quinlan said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marceline Donaldson, the Cambridge woman who filed the suit,  
claiming her civil rights were violated, said she was not ready to 
give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that you take a case to the court and the  
court errs. It's got my adrenaline going a little bit and we'll be 
back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She sought unspecified damages from Farrakhan, the Nation of  
Islam, and Minister Don Muhammad, head of the Nation of Islam 
mosque in Boston. John Rosenberg, her lawyer, said they were 
leaning toward appealing the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, who ran an antiques store at the time, closed early

<P>
	Muhammad said he was pleased with the decision. And he said the  
men-only speech on black-on-black violence had produced positive 
results. 
</P>
<P>

meeting is felt in the streets.''

	Rosenberg said the case was never about the content of the

building and should have been open to women.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Down 6.33 at 10,707.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks struggled to another loss today as fears  
of higher interest rates and soaring bond yields weighed on 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 6.33 at 10,707.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower.  
</P>
<P>
	With little fresh economic news or corporate mergers to  
stimulate trading on a summer Monday, prices stalled in a narrow 
range. Some Wall Street analysts had anticipated a mild rally 
today, as the Dow is 4.4 percent below its record high, set just 
last month, and the Nasdaq is 11 percent below its record, also set 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the protracted sluggishness of the stock market could  
signal the start of a correction, especially if the Federal Reserve 
confirms expectations that it will raise interest rates, hoping to 
slow the growth of the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co., said the  
market is unlikely to break out of its fitful trading range until 
the Fed's Open Market Committee meets Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their move is in the bag,'' he said. ``But until they make  
that move, we'll see a lot more of this sideways action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While stock prices shifted gears over the course of the day,  
bond prices plunged. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed 
to 6.23 percent, the highest level since November 1997. With yields 
rising, bonds are becoming an attractive, less volatile alternative 
to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks can no longer count on a strong economy and lower  
interest rates,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells 
Fargo &AMP; Co. ``Rising interest rates will damage economic growth and 
earnings expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin kept world markets slightly off  
balance today after he fired his prime minister and the entire 
Cabinet. It's the fourth time in 17 months he has fired the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	While the broad market sputtered, a flurry of deals and new  
products spurred some gains for computer-related companies. 
Advanced Micro Devices rose after releasing a new computer 
microprocessor it says can outperform Intel's high-end chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco rose after agreeing to invest $1 billion to help  
accounting and consulting firm KPMG expand onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Data General rose after agreeing to be acquired by EMC Corp., a  
larger rival in the computer data-storage business. EMC fell. 
</P>
<P>
	As companies complete their preparations for the Year 2000,  
computer businesses are likely to thrive, Hogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most industries have completed their preparedness, or they're  
close to doing so,'' he said. ``These companies are doing well 
because there's going to be a lot of demand once that hurdle is 
cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 2.45 to 1,297.84, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 28.76 to 
2,519.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,809 down, 1,202 up and 534 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 674.61 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
695.71 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.58 to 610.46, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.05 to 777.87. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.15 to 425.89.

<HEADLINE> Underwood Said Divided on Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood spent the last week  
trying to decide between his love for football and his obligation 
to the ministry, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old defensive end walked out of training camp a week  
ago, leaving his family, his agent and team officials to speculate 
about his motive and whereabouts. The newspaper spoke with 
Underwood in a Philadelphia hotel lobby Sunday night while Vikings 
officials moved to cut ties with the first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deep down in my heart, I know I was not called to do that kind  
of work,'' Underwood said of the ministry. ``But recently, in the 
last month, I feel the Lord's been pulling me there. And I know 
that that is a huge conflict of interest, because what am I going 
to do in order to support my family?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has 16-month-old twins who live in Michigan with his  
former girlfriend. He also provides financial assistance to his 
mother, brother and sister in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also hesitant to return to Vikings training camp because  
he doesn't know how to approach the coaches he let down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I was man enough to confront coach (Dennis) Green and  
look him in the eyes and tell him what I've been going through,'' 
Underwood said. ``I hate to see the hurt in his eyes because of 
what I've done to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his first practice in Mankato, Minn., Underwood flagged  
down a motorist who took him to the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
International Airport. He flew to Cleveland, where his new black 
Lexus was parked. From there he headed to Philadelphia, where he 
has been since. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood spent four nights in the Marriott Hotel, checking in  
under his middle name, Paul. But he ran short of cash and spent 
Saturday night in his car. When interviewed, he had $8 in cash in 
his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year, $5.3 million contract he signed July 31 included a  
partly deferred $1.7 million signing bonus. The Vikings convinced a 
judge to freeze a half-million dollars. But part of the account 
remained liquid and Underwood said he took $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood said there is ``a real problem in his heart'' about  
taking money he didn't earn, and he doesn't plan to take more 
money. For their part, the Vikings are trying to dispose of 
Underwood's contract altogether, according to several reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Domann, Underwood's agent, said Sunday team officials told  
him they didn't want the former Michigan State player back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood realizes the implications of his action, but said it's  
more important to him to be humble. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want people to know is it's not about wasting a  
lucrative opportunity and the chance to become a star in the NFL,'' 
he said. ``It's not just about the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood also realizes that many will question his final  
decision -- whatever it may be. He wants to speak with people like 
Vikings receiver Cris Carter and retired Green Bay Packers star 
Reggie White about how to combine football and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if the Lord will have me come back to Minnesota.  
If I do -- if the Vikings will have me back -- that may very well be 
a humiliating experience,'' Underwood said. ``Not being part of the 
Minnesota Vikings goes against me, but doing the will of God also 
pulls me.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Touts Weyrich Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Publisher Steve Forbes on Monday touted  
the endorsement of conservative leader Paul Weyrich and a new 
commercial on his behalf in which Weyrich declares Forbes as ``the 
only conservative who can win'' the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there are many good conservatives running for president  
in 2000, in my view Steve Forbes is the only economic, social and 
pro-life conservative in the race with the ability to win the White 
House,'' Weyrich said in a letter to conservative activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates competing for the votes of social conservatives  
include Forbes, activist Gary Bauer, commentators Pat Buchanan and 
Alan Keyes and former Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Forbes began airing a 60-second radio  
commercial around the state featuring Weyrich's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Forbes is a conservative with integrity, free from the  
corruption of Washington,'' said the commercial, which adds ``it is 
important for conservative voters to have a choice other than 
George W. Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich, who coined the phrase ``moral majority,'' helped make  
social conservatives a force in the Republican Party. He had a hand 
in creating the Heritage Foundation think tank and the Christian 
Coalition and now runs the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative 
Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	His backing is another sign that Forbes is making inroads with a  
group that caused him problems in the last election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	When Forbes sought the GOP nomination in 1996, he campaigned  
almost exclusively on his call for a flat tax and many religious 
conservatives were deeply suspicious of his commitment on issues 
like abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	That suspicion turned into outright opposition and contributed  
to his decline in that election. 
</P>
<P>
	Since that time, Forbes has worked overtime to build bridges to  
social and religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	While Weyrich cited Forbes' commitment on issues like opposition  
to abortion, he also made pragmatic arguments. Social conservatives 
are currently badly fractured among a number of candidates, and 
that's weakened their influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich argued conservatives need to unite behind a candidate to  
exert their influence, and he said it makes sense to coalesce 
around Forbes for pragmatic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forbes is the only candidate who has organizations is all of  
the key primary and caucus states through the end of March 2000 -- 
which is when 75 percent of all the Republican votes will be 
cast,'' Weyrich said. ``No other candidate besides George W. Bush 
can compete with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Weyrich warned that Bush has raised far more money  
than any of his rivals, and only Forbes can compete with him 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forbes is the only candidate who can level the financial  
playing field with Mr. Bush and compete with him on the airwaves as 
well as on the ground,'' Weyrich said. ``In plain simple terms, 
Forbes has more horsepower than all of the other conservative 
candidates combined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's spokesman grumbled about Weyrich using money as a  
primary reason for picking a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having that as a primary reason is disappointing,'' said  
Quayle spokesman Gary Geipel. ``One could rattle off long lists of 
candidates who had the biggest pocketbooks and never got elected.''

<HEADLINE> Saying No to `Andro' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fresh off his victory over the umpires, Bud Selig has a chance  
to make it two in a row. All he has to do is say no to ``andro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slugger Mark McGwire did that four months ago -- an admission he  
made so matter-of-factly last week it caused you to blink first, 
then wonder what the fuss last summer was about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like how it's portrayed,'' McGwire said, ``but young  
kids take it because of me. I don't like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letting andro go was courageous, but it was late in coming and  
self-serving, too. So take McGwire at his word, but remember 
performance-enhancers like androstenedione can be loaded into the 
system months earlier to build muscle and then forsaken once the 
season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also worth remembering that McGwire confessed just as he  
caught up to last season's home-run pace and just before he 
launched No. 500 of his career. And remember, too, that the same 
medical experts who praised him for stopping also hold McGwire 
largely responsible for causing sales of the testosterone booster 
to surge more than 1,000 percent over the past year, to more than 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all need to be aware that just because a superstar stops  
using andro, the problem doesn't just go away,'' said Barry 
McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countless young people still take this potentially dangerous  
substance -- banned by the NFL, the Olympics, the NCAA and 
professional tennis -- in order to improve their athletic 
performance. We must continue to focus on the risks at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the pill is now in Selig's court.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has always been a home-run hitter who abided by the  
rules and this latest move has only strengthened that perception. 
Baseball's greatest fear when the controversy first aired was that 
it would dim McGwire's monumental achievement. That hasn't 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	People clamoring for an asterisk next to the 70 home runs have  
turned silent, in part because the assault on the record books 
continues. They see McGwire still pursued by Sammy Sosa, Ken 
Griffey Jr., and a handful more and recognize now -- as the rest of 
us did then -- that putting big air underneath a baseball has more 
to do with a good eye and a grooved swing than pumping iron. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest obstacle to a ban now is a strong union and a weak  
boss. Clearly, Selig has grown into the job of commissioner during 
his yearlong tenure. But he is still the most deliberate of men, 
and mindful of the tenuous nature of labor peace in the game, still 
one of the most cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time he heard the word ``andro,'' Selig drove directly  
over to the pharmacist who had treated his family for years. His 
next step was a lot less folksy: Major league baseball commissioned 
a study by Harvard scientists that is due on Selig's desk sometime 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And until then, Selig insisted one more time Sunday, ``I won't  
make any judgments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just about everybody else, though, has weighed in. There is  
already considerable evidence that over the short term, it works 
like an anabolic steroid, helping players build muscle mass and 
recover from injuries quicker. There is also considerable medical 
opinion that it works like anabolic steroid over the long term, 
too; which is to say it could cause potentially fatal side effects, 
including heart attacks, cancer, liver dysfunction and severe 
disorders of mood and mental function. 
</P>
<P>
	But the only people who appear less troubled by andro than Selig  
at the moment are the people in charge at the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Orza, the No. 2 official, said during spring training he  
doubted the Harvard study would turn up enough proof that andro 
enhances performance or endangers players' health to convince them 
to agree to a ban. Reached at home Sunday, he refused to say 
anything about andro beyond, ``No comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collective bargaining agreement blocks baseball from  
instituting a ban of its own, but that doesn't mean Selig is 
powerless. Even when he was only acting as the commissioner, Selig 
displayed a willingness to try and do what was best for baseball. 
That same instinct should move him in the direction of a ban on 
andro, sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
	He will have to stir up public opinion and strong-arm some  
people along the way, much like NBA commissioner David Stern did in 
getting the players union to accept testing for marijuana. But in 
the long run, it could prove to be a valuable precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	We live in a time when the limits of human performance once  
again are being blurred. The time to start talking about what's 
safe for competition, what constitutes a level playing field and 
what kind of message the audience takes home is now. Because those 
issues are only going to get more complex from here on out.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Battle Nev. Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNEMUCCA, Nev. (AP) -- Firefighters struggled today to contain  
the last of more than 100 fires that had blackened 1.1 million 
acres of brush and grass in mostly uninhabited rangeland across 
northern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 20 largest fires had been contained by today, but no  
estimated containment time was being given for six others, said 
Forest Service spokesman Bob Dyson. Most had been started by 
lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping it's by Tuesday because that's when our  
meteorologists say the next round of thunderstorms will hit,'' he 
said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire spokesman Nick Zufelt said more than 4,000 firefighters  
won't be released until Wednesday at the earliest because of the 
weather threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the fires are pretty well in hand now, but there's  
concern we could get back into the same ballgame again with more 
thunderstorms,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames no longer threatened scattered ranches near Elko and  
Austin. On Friday, fires burned three homes and six ranch 
buildings, and killed 100 head of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the fires were burning along a 200-mile stretch of  
Interstate 80 between Lovelock and Elko. Smoke intermittently 
closed I-80 at several places Friday but no problems were reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire spokesman Mike Cassidy said the 180,000-acre Sadler complex  
fire 30 miles southwest of Elko was causing the most concern today. 
It was only 65 percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still has a way to go, but with enough winds it could get  
into some heavily populated subdivisions on the south side of the 
South Fork Reservoir,'' he said, adding some ranches also were in 
its path. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada's biggest fire -- actually a complex of 20 fires -- had  
burned about 361,000 acres along both sides of I-80 between 
Lovelock and Winnemucca. Some of the fires in that group had been 
contained.

<HEADLINE> Mo. Prosecutor Seeks Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Prosecutors have rejected the offer of a  
guilty plea from a man accused of killing a pregnant woman and her 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Darrell Moore said Monday he would take Richard  
DeLong to trial and seek the death penalty. Under DeLong's offer, 
which he made twice in letters, he would have been sentenced to 
life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had three kids, a baby and a mama killed, and in my  
judgment that warrants the death penalty,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLong has been ordered to stand trial on five counts of murder  
in the Jan. 19 death of Erin Vanderhoef, her three children, ages 8 
to 10, and her full-term fetus. According to testimony at a 
pretrial hearing, DeLong and two accomplices strangled Ms. 
Vanderhoef and her children after DeLong's girlfriend learned he 
and Ms. Vanderhoef had had an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	One of DeLong's lawyers, Tom Budesheim, did not return a call  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLong's girlfriend, Stacie Leffingwell, and a neighbor, Harold  
``Bobby'' Lingle, are charged with helping DeLong and also face the 
death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness testified at the pretrial hearing that Miss  
Leffingwell hated Ms. Vanderhoef over the affair and that the 
full-term fetus the woman was due to deliver was DeLong's.

<HEADLINE> Barge Spills Oil Into Ohio River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT VERNON, Ind. (AP) -- A barge collision spilled gasoline  
into the Ohio River on Monday, closing the waterway to traffic and 
forcing downstream communities to stop drawing water from the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 40,000 and 80,000 gallons of gasoline leaked after four  
barges carrying gasoline and a fifth barge carrying cumene, a 
chemical, collided. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out around the barges themselves, it's still a dangerous  
situation because of the gasoline vapor,'' said Tim Fleming, 
assistant fire chief of Mount Vernon Fire and Rescue. ``Any spark 
or ignition point and it can catch on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported, and authorities believed there was no  
spillage of the cumene, a chemical used to make plastics that can 
irritate eyes and skin and cause respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard closed off the river while authorities  
determined how to clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleming said foam would be brought in Tuesday to soak up  
gasoline, and officials hoped the river and water intake valves 
downstream could be reopened by Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Downriver communities that rely on the river for water supplies  
were quickly notified of the collision.

<HEADLINE> American Will Integrate Reno Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- With just weeks remaining before  
American Airlines completes merging Reno Air Inc. into its 
operations, the nation's No. 2 air carrier still is at odds with 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	American and the Allied Pilots Association have clashed  
continually over American's relationship with Reno, most notably in 
a pilots' sickout that stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, time is running out for American and the union to reach  
middle ground before the scheduled Aug. 31 merger of the two 
carriers' operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we had a deal when we left the table in early July.  
We're going to go ahead with the integration anyway. We've got 
about two and a half weeks to get that done,'' said Andrea Rader, a 
spokeswoman for American, owned by parent company Fort Worth-based 
AMR Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	American and union representatives had been meeting over several  
months with a federal mediator to try to settle the dispute over 
how Reno pilots will be absorbed into the bigger and better-paying 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Friday, the union's 18-member governing board announced it  
had accepted a mediator's proposal unanimously, but only after 
making ``certain amendments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amendments are too costly and unacceptable for American,  
Rader said Monday. The mediator overseeing the negotiations has 
scheduled a meeting with the company on Tuesday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls and pages to the union and its president, Rich  
LaVoy, were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Some changes the union made to the mediated proposal included  
the rewording of a provision to keep American from shifting routes 
to any low-cost carrier that is bought by the company. The pilots 
also said they will immediately bring in a mediator if the airline 
decides to buy or merge with another airline. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rader said the changes amount to the pilots trying to  
renegotiate the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she said AMR will follow most of the mediated proposal as  
it integrates Reno into its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we're not going to stray very far from that,'' she  
said. Rader declined to comment on any details the company may 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots union at this point could ask for arbitration, return  
to mediation or request an injunction from the court to halt the 
merger of operations from being completed. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR paid $124 million for Reno last December without an  
agreement with its pilots' union on how the low-cost carrier would 
be integrated into American. 
</P>
<P>
	Most labor groups were able to reach agreement with the company,  
but APA leaders, who represent about 9,400 pilots, said the merger 
violated part of the pilot contract guaranteeing all flying for 
American be done by pilots on American's seniority list. 
</P>
<P>
	The development is the most recent in a long-standing feud over  
Reno between the company and its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the unresolved problems began in 1993-94 when several  
hundred American pilots were furloughed after American pulled out 
of routes on the West Coast and created a marketing agreement with 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	The bitter feelings escalated in December when pilots said they  
were not alerted of the American-Reno talks. Then in February, 
about one-quarter of American's pilots decided to protest by 
staging an illegal sickout. The walkout resulted in the 
cancellation of about 6,700 flights and cost the company $225 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ordered the pilots back to work. When his order  
was ignored, he found the union in contempt and fined APA $45.5 
million for its role in the sickout, a decision that the union is 
appealing.

<HEADLINE>  Croatia Extradites Bosnian Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Succumbing to international pressure,  
Croatia today extradited a Bosnian Croat suspected of war crimes 
for trial before a U.N. war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinko Martinovic boarded a Croatia Airlines passenger flight to  
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where he will be handed over into the 
custody of the International War Crimes Tribunal based in The 
Hague. 
</P>
<P>
	The extradition of Martinovic was confirmed by Deputy Justice  
Minister Snjezana Bagic. Also known as Stela, Martinovic, 36, is 
charged with crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva 
Convention and violations of laws and customs of war. He was 
indicted by the tribunal in December. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a summary of the indictment, he and Mladen  
Naletilic, 52, were responsible for driving tens of thousands of 
Muslims from Mostar, the scene of some of the most savage fighting 
during the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war. The city remains divided between 
Bosnian Croats and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	Croatia's government, which has ceded jurisdiction over war  
crimes matters to the international court, was recently accused by 
prosecutors in The Hague of foot-dragging on its assurances that it 
would extradite Martinovic. 
</P>
<P>
	A Zagreb County Court already sentenced Martinovic to eight  
years in prison for murder in June for his activities while in 
Bosnia, and the government had insisted that he should serve his 
time in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, the Croatian Supreme Court ruled Martinovic's  
case a mistrial due to technicalities and ordered a retrial. 
Justice Minister Zvonimir Separovic subsequently said that decision 
opened the way for Martinovic's extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Naletilic was charged with 17 counts of war crimes during  
alleged command of a paramilitary unit called the Convicts 
Battalion. The unit is thought responsible for a string of 
atrocities committed against Muslims in and around Mostar from May 
1993 until March 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Naletilic is also scheduled for trial in Croatia, but that has  
been delayed while he recovers from tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinovic allegedly commanded a sub-unit of the battalion and  
acted as Naletilic's right-hand man in various crime rings run in 
Mostar during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour urged Croatia to  
extradite Naletilic as well to avoid the need to have separate 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prosecutor calls upon the government of Croatia to act  
promptly in the surrender of the co-accused Naletilic, so that the 
joint trial of both accused can proceed,'' she said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Army Grounds Fleet of Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army announced Monday it was temporarily  
grounding its entire fleet of CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters 
after a crack was found in a transmission gear in one being used by 
the British Royal Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fleet is grounded. It's a precautionary measure,'' said an  
Army spokeswoman, Nancy Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that 466 helicopters in the Army fleet were involved in  
the temporary grounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an overhaul, the Royal Air Force discovered a cracked gear.  
That gear has been traced diligently,'' Ray said. She said Boeing 
was working with the Army Aviation Center to see if the problem 
affected any of the Army Chinooks. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin-rotored Chinook helicopter is the military's medium  
tactical heavy-lift transport. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the British Ministry of Defense said Monday that it  
has grounded its fleet of Royal Air Force Chinooks also pending 
safety checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing Co., which manufactures the helicopter at its  
Philadelphia plant, requested the suspension of flights by about 20 
operators around the world to allow inspection of their 
transmissions, said company spokesman Jack Satterfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's subsidiary, Boeing Precision Gear in Chicago,  
manufactured the type of gear used in the aircraft, Satterfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the models should be suspending flight operations pending  
a check of records to determine if the aircraft contained gears 
from the suspect production lines,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army has the largest fleet of Chinooks. Between 300 to 400  
Chinooks are used in other countries, including Australia, 
Argentina, Spain, Italy, Greece, Morocco, Egypt, Taiwan and Japan, 
Satterfield said.

<HEADLINE> Friend: Truck Routes Led to Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The man accused of killing three people at  
two companies was angry because he thought a coworker was getting 
better trucking routes, a friend of one of the victims said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Eugene Miller, 34, of Billingsley, is charged with capital  
murder in the fatal shootings of the coworker, Lee Holdbrooks, and 
a second employee at Ferguson Enterprises, Christopher Scott Yancy, 
as well as a former coworker, Terry Jarvis, who was killed at Post 
Airgas. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not released any information on a possible  
motive, but have said they believe Thursday's killings were 
purposeful rather than random because two other workers at the two 
businesses were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	A close friend of Holdbrooks, Chad Ingram, said Miller thought  
Holdbrooks was getting the preferred longer driving assignments at 
Ferguson, a wholesale distribution company that serves the 
construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram told The Birmingham News he knew that Miller was angry  
with Holdbrooks over the routes before the shooting happened, but 
wouldn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess (Miller) felt Scott and Lee were in cahoots about  
(Holdbrooks) getting a better route,'' Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yancy was a dispatcher at Ferguson.  
</P>
<P>
	Shelby County District Attorney Robby Owens would not confirm or  
deny Ingram's information, but said it was consistent with what has 
been said in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram was a pallbearer Sunday at Holdbrooks' funeral.  
</P>
<P>
	A service was scheduled today for Yancy, 28, of Alabaster.

	Putin Named As Acting Prime Minster  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin fired his prime minister  
and Cabinet today for the fourth time in less than two years, 
raising new questions about his stability. Yeltsin named a former 
KGB agent, Vladimir Putin, as his acting prime minister and said he 
was choosing him as his hand-picked successor. Yeltsin gave no 
reason for firing Sergei Stepashin and even praised him ``for his 
good work'' during his three months as prime minister. The Russian 
media speculated that Yeltsin made the move in order to delay 
elections and extend his term, set to end next July.

	13 Die in Labor Van Crash in Calif.

	FIVE POINTS, Calif. (AP) -- A van overloaded with farm workers  
slammed into a tractor-trailer rig making a U-turn on a remote 
farming road early today, killing 13 people in the van and 
seriously injuring two others. Most of the passengers in the van 
were in the back, sitting without seat belts on two benches that 
were installed along the sides, police said. California farm 
workers often are transported in overloaded vans, a problem that 
has contributed to a disproportionate traffic death rate among 
Hispanics in the area.

	BERLIN (AP) -- The German Defense Ministry said today it has  
arrested two Germans accused of selling high-tech weapons secrets

support from Germany over such incidents. Prosecutors said last 
month they had arrested an engineer and his alleged accomplice, a 
salesman who was about to board a plane from Hanover to Moscow with 
military files. DaimlerChrysler Aerospace confirmed Monday that the 
52-year-old engineer, identified only as Peter S., worked at its

people and led to the end of World War II. On Aug. 6, 1945, 
Hiroshima felt the blast of the world's first atomic bombing, when 
140,000 people died. Then, three days later, a second American 
A-bomb hit Nagasaki. Japan surrendered unconditionally six days 
later, on Aug. 15, 1945. It was the end of World War II. The mayor 
of Nagasaki said the bombing showed the world that ``nuclear 
weapons cannot be tolerated.'' Officials said those who survived 
the blast still suffer physically and emotionally.

pests, a U.N. agency said today. The Food and Agriculture 
Organization said in a report that 10 million people in 16 
countries require emergency food aid. Angola is the worst off, an 
FAO official said, because a civil war has made aid delivery 
virtually impossible. Dozens of Angolan and foreign aid workers 
trying to deliver food have been killed in ambushes, reportedly

Dallas cornerback Deion Sanders will make more than Strahan, 
averaging $10.3 million annually, provided he plays more than 70 
percent of the Cowboys' defensive plays. Strahan will receive a $12

<HEADLINE> Activists Seek Solutions to Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although the U.S. economy is in its best  
condition in 30 years, antihunger activists said Monday that an 
estimated 35 million Americans will face the year 2000 hungry. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments were made at a conference where Agriculture  
Secretary Dan Glickman unveiled a multi-point plan to alleviate the 
``food insecurity'' of the nation's poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Food insecurity'' is a euphemism Agriculture Department  
officials use to describe a hunger problem that relief agencies, 
the U.S. Conference of Mayors and other groups say is endemic in 
the United States and getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're food-insecure, you don't have enough money to buy  
the food you need,'' said Lynette Englehardt Stott, a policy 
analyst with Bread for the World. The Silver Spring, Md.-based 
advocacy group contends that a growing number of Americans are 
going to bed hungry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a parent, you might be going to bed hungry so that  
your children can eat, or in more severe cases, you're sending your 
children to bed hungry,'' said Stott. 
</P>
<P>
	At a conference sponsored by the Share our Strength  
organization, 300 corporate executives, community activists, and 
social service providers are working this week to find fresh 
approaches to raising millions of dollars to fight hunger. The 
Washington-based organization has raised more than $50 million for 
anti-hunger programs in 80 American cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The group hopes to raise millions more by asking Americans to  
donate the earnings from the last hour they work in 1999 to a fund 
aimed at combating childhood hunger. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists cited Census Bureau statistics and increased requests  
for food aid in estimating that 35 million Americans will go hungry 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``One out of every five people in the souplines is a child,''  
said Deborah Leff, executive director of Second Harvest, a 
Chicago-based group that operates 188 regional food distribution 
facilities in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman noted that millions of people no longer be eligible for  
state welfare benefits may not know they can still get federal food 
stamps. ``Food stamp rolls have been declining five times faster 
than the poverty rate,'' the agriculture secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also is working to find ways of getting to needy Americans more  
of the surplus food that is discarded by producers, manufacturers 
and wholesalers. ``Upwards of 90 billion pounds of perfectly 
nutritious food is thrown away each year,'' said Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Conference of Mayors noted in a 1998 survey conducted  
in 30 cities that 78 percent of hunger relief agencies faced an 
increased demand for assistance. The survey also found that 47 
percent faced the possibility of having to reject requests because 
of a lack of resources.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Beats USA for Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Not enough time together, not enough  
top-notch players. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was another U.S. failure to win the gold medal in  
men's basketball at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A Brazilian team that honed its game through months of playing  
together won the gold Sunday with a 95-78 victory over a U.S. team 
that practiced for just two weeks before arriving in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experience plays a big factor in this game,'' U.S. guard  
Michael Hawkins said. ``But I'm not going to say any excuses that 
we haven't been together or they have been together. We didn't play 
well, they played well. Bottom line, they won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And won big. It was the worst loss in Pan Ams history for a U.S.  
men's team. The Brazilians didn't even need Oscar Schmidt, the 
retired superstar who torched the Americans for 46 points in a 
120-115 victory in the 1987 gold medal game at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	That, along with a 73-68 loss to Puerto Rico in 1991, had been  
the worst defeats for the United States in Pan Ams play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we definitely feel we're a better team,'' guard Damon  
Bailey said. ``But we weren't a better team today. Anytime you get 
to a situation where one game decides the gold medal, anybody can 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which hasn't won the Pan Ams gold since 1983,  
sent a collection of CBA players to these games. And it wasn't even 
the very best of that league, because many of the top players were 
at the Rocky Mountain Review, an NBA summer league for rookies and 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a lot of guys to the pros, where if we had those guys,  
I would like our chances,'' U.S. coach Mo McHone said. ``I would 
like our chances with this group if we stayed together four years 
and played four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we played this same team from Brazil four years later and  
we played together the whole four years, it would be a different 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	``They played a great, great game,'' Bailey said. ``I'm not sure  
if we would have been together for 10 years we could have beaten 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil beat the Americans by spreading the floor and driving to  
the basket, which led to layups or kickouts to the perimeter for 
wide-open jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilians shot 58 percent, including 8-of-14 from 3-point  
range, and led 59-39 four minutes into the second half. The United 
States rallied from 20 down to beat the Dominican Republic in 
preliminary play, but Brazil was too smart and too good to let that 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Americans started to close, Brazil went to 6-foot-10  
A.J. Santos inside and he delivered time after time, scoring all of 
his 14 points in the final 12:26. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, we've got to gamble,'' McHone said. ``We were  
just trying to create something, and he is a very good offensive 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santos delivered the knockout blow after the United States cut  
the lead to 78-70 on Carl Thomas' 3-pointer, making a turnaround 
shot from the left side while fading out of bounds. Brazil made a 3 
on its next trip, then closed it out with free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the game, the Brazilians celebrated every basket and  
often cheered when the United States missed free throws. But the 
real celebration began after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The players hopped up and down in a circle as coaches and  
trainers surrounded them, then did the same in front of their fans, 
who unfurled a large Brazilian flag. All the Americans could do was 
watch and solemnly collect their gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, being the Americans, are the team to beat,'' Hawkins said.  
``No matter who we play, no matter what we play, everyone wants to 
beat America. I don't know why. Maybe we were the best in 
everything and they get overly excited. That's how they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey led the United States with 14 points, Hawkins scored 13  
and Thomas 11. Rogerio Klafke led Brazil with 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico won the bronze with an 87-60 victory over Argentina.

visited RFK in April, there were fights and reports of other unruly 
behavior among the record crowd of 35,167. Diaz Arce was traded by 
San Jose to Tampa Bay in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's attendance was 18,753, including thousands of  
Salvadorans who booed the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post on Monday identified the victim as Sergio  
Senteno of Arlington, Va. It said he was treated for stab wounds to 
his lower back and abdomen. No arrests have been made, although 
police are checking videotapes from surveillance cameras for 
possible suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such an isolated incident,'' D.C. United president and  
general manager Kevin Payne said. ``Generally, there were few 
problems. It's just an unfortunate thing. I don't know how you 
prevent something like that short of full body searches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Lawes, a spokesman for D.C. United, said fans in the area  
where the stabbing occurred cheered Diaz Arce when he was near the 
ball and booed United players Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno 
when they were near the ball. But he said team officials do not 
believe the stabbing was the result of extreme partisanship among 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe it was that way,'' Lawes said. ``This was  
not one guy wearing blue and white (the colors of the Salvadoran 
flag) and one guy wearing a yellow and green shirt (the colors of 
the Bolivian flag). It appeared to be nothing more than a random 
act of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawes said a knife was recovered but that it was not clear  
whether it was the weapon used in the stabbing.

<HEADLINE> Disney: Possible Angels Sale a Rumor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. said reports it is  
considering selling the Anaheim Angels are rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not comment on rumor,'' Disney spokeswoman Chris Castro  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing an unidentified baseball source, the Los Angeles Times  
reported Monday that Disney is considering a sale but hasn't spoken 
with potential buyers. The New York Times published a similar 
report Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are some thoughts that they would like to  
sell,'' the Los Angeles paper quoted its source as saying. ``But 
I'm also not sure that they are not changing their mind day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are in the internal debate stage and haven't gone  
so far as to listen to offers or talk to prospective buyers. I 
think it is a situation that should be watched closely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels had high hopes entering the season and a high payroll  
as well -- a franchise-record $60 million. But they have fallen out 
of contention in the AL West during the last month and trailed 
first-place Texas by 20 games going into Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Bids for 2006 World Cup Presented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- From heart-rending appeals to cold  
hard facts, South Africa, England and Morocco made their pitches to 
soccer's top officials Monday to try to play host to the 2006 World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Each desperately trying to sway the outcome, the countries  
pleaded their cases to FIFA president Sepp Blatter and general 
secretary Michel Zen Ruffinen at the federation's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Presentations from Germany and Brazil were scheduled for  
Tuesday. The final choice will be made next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest South African delegation kicked off the presentations,  
livening the ceremony with a scantily-clad Zulu warrior howling and 
dancing, before bid members delivered a passionate plea for the 
continent's first World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country's isolation from international football denied  
generations of players the opportunity to parade their skill on the 
world stage,'' South Africa Football Association president Molefi 
Oliphant said. ``They understood the need for such sacrifice 
because it accelerated the collapse of apartheid and our return to 
the FIFA family. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Africa's time has come. This beautiful game is our game  
and this is our time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While it quickly ran down the financial, technical and  
infrastructure aspects of its bid package, the African nation spent 
extra time outlining planned security measures in an effort to 
overcome fears about crime and safety, particularly in cities like 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Opting for a more flamboyant campaign, England jetted a  
135-strong corps, including flag-waving school children, Football 
Association members and soccer greats Bobby Charlton and Geoff 
Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing attention to its modern facilities, financial stability  
and proven record as host of major international events, campaign 
director Alec McGivan called the English bid a ``real bid based on 
reality not promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	England, hoping to host the event for the first time in 40  
years, also called on history. 
</P>
<P>
	``England is the home of football. England gave birth to  
football,'' McGivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco, making its third bid, also hoped to be the first  
African nation to host the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two African bids,'' reminded Driss Benhima, the  
president of Morocco's 2006 bid committee. ``We are representing 
first Africa, then the Arab nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa is considered the front-runner, with Blatter  
repeatedly and openly announcing his support for the 2006 World Cup 
to go to the African continent, and with most believing that South 
Africa has a clear infrastructure advantage over Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany and England are its biggest rivals.  
</P>
<P>
	The 24-member FIFA executive committee will make its final vote  
on the 2006 host in July 2000.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Returns to Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Fourteen people discovered in Colombia  
after their plane was hijacked in Venezuela more than a week ago 
were safe and in good health, Venezuela's interior minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's two-man crew flew it into the Venezuelan border town  
of Guasdualito Sunday afternoon, Ignacio Arcaya told reporters. The 
twin-engine Beechcraft had been hijacked July 30 and taken into 
Colombia's Arauca state. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces  
of Colombia, or FARC, promised to free the passengers, although it 
insisted it had not hijacked the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers would be returned to Venezuela shortly, Arcaya  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman claiming to represent the FARC said one of its guerrilla  
units discovered the downed plane near the border with Venezuela a 
day after it disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's hijackers had fled the scene in Arauca, and the FARC  
held the passengers while it investigated the hijacking, said the 
woman, who did not identify herself as she read a statement from 
the group to Colombia's Radionet radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Adolfo Fuentes, legal adviser to Venezuela's Avior Airlines,  
told the Colombian TV news program TV-Hoy that the passengers were 
on their way to Venezuela, but he did not specify when they would 
arrive or how. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC statement blamed the hijacking on opponents of  
Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez. It said the passengers would be 
released unconditionally but did not specify when. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a Colombian police chief accused the 15,000 member  
rebel group of planning and carrying out the hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can't be attributed to any other group. The FARC carried  
out this execrable crime,'' said Arauca state police chief Luis 
Eduardo Tafur. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane disappeared during a 25-minute domestic flight from  
the southwestern Venezuelan city of Barinas to Guasdualito. It was 
originally said to have 16 people, all Venezuelan, on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Search crews had been unable to locate the aircraft. Colombian  
and Venezuelan military officials previously accused a different 
rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, of hijacking the 
flight. The ELN also denied any role. 
</P>
<P>
	The ELN is still holding 16 of 41 people it seized from a  
Colombian plane in April and is demanding ransom for them. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S officials have recently expressed concern that Colombia's  
35-year civil conflict was spilling over the nation's borders, 
posing a regional security threat.

<HEADLINE> 'Raymond,' 'The Practice' Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viewers for Quality Television for the first  
time in four years did not honor a network with one of its annual 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,000-member citizen watchdog group did name ABC's ``The  
Practice'' its best drama for the second year in a row. CBS's 
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' won four awards, including best comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The group skipped its Network Commitment to Quality award, which  
NBC has won twice and Fox picked up last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a stretch to justify giving it,'' Dorothy  
Swanson, the organization's founder, said Monday, when the winners 
were announced. It was the first time since starting the network 
award that the group did not name a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers for Quality Television usually gives out its awards at a  
banquet around the time of the Emmys. This year it is forgoing the 
banquet and having members deliver the trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillian Anderson of ``The X-Files'' and Dennis Franz of ``NYPD  
Blue'' were named top actors in dramas. Ray Romano and Patricia 
Heaton of ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' won top acting awards for 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Camryn Manheim and Steve Harris of ``The Practice,'' Doris  
Roberts of ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and Peter MacNicol of ``Ally 
McBeal'' won supporting actor awards. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace'' won the group's founders' award, which  
honors an individual or series that has made a significant 
contribution but received little recognition.

<HEADLINE> Jolly Green Giant Gets Voice Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- After eight years of silence, the Jolly Green  
Giant will once again offer his hearty ``Ho Ho Ho'' as the elder 
spokesman for the country's largest vegetable brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Giant is bringing the voice onto its Web site and putting  
the big guy back into its print ads in a $20 million campaign being 
announced Tuesday to boost brand awareness as the giant approaches 
his 75th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, Green Giant stopped using the giant in its  
advertising as it developed its Create-A-Meal line and tried to get 
consumers to view the products as more than side dishes. The Giant 
was seen only on package labels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially we've never walked away from the Green Giant, but  
he has receded for a while,'' said Heidi Thom, vice president of 
frozen foods for Pillsbury Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're refocusing on vegetables in a big way and want to  
leverage the equity we have with him. He stands for the 
freshest-tasting vegetables, goodness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Giant, a division of Pillsbury, part of British  
conglomerate Diageo PLC, is seeking to expand its 20 percent share 
of the U.S. vegetable market with the new campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a revamped Web site at www.greengiant.com, where  
a click on the giant triggers his ``Ho Ho,'' the campaign includes 
print ads featuring the Jolly Green Giant, coupon offers and store 
promotions. The in-store presence includes 8-foot-tall inflatable 
Green Giants and 4-foot plush giants who will say ``Ho Ho Ho'' and 
interact with grocery store customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant has developed a sense of humor in the new campaign,  
which may include TV ads. Taglines include ``Give peas a chance'' 
and ``Eat your vegetables and you'll grow up big and strong like me 
(actual results may vary).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Len Dresslar, who provided the deep voice of the Green Giant  
over the decades, is delighted that his voice has been brought 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find this the most wonderfully surprising situation,'' said  
Dresslar, 75, who provided a voice for the previously silent giant 
40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Giant has a long and colorful history. He was  
conceived in Le Sueur in 1924 to promote a new European variety of 
huge peas called ``Prince of Wales'' for Minnesota Valley Canning 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The oblong peas were wrinkled and ugly by pea standards, but  
they had more flavor, sweetness and tenderness than traditional 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	When Minnesota Valley's private label customers balked at the  
ungainly newcomer, the company decided to market the big peas under 
a new label and brag about their size. The peas subsequently were 
named ``Green Giants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, the first Green Giant figure was introduced to  
symbolize the giant peas. The scowling, hulking character, borrowed 
from Grimm's Fairy Tales, was white and wore a scruffy bearskin. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1931, a young copywriter from a Chicago advertising agency  
presented some ads to executives at Minnesota Valley and they were 
a hit. Four years later when Leo Burnett opened his own agency, the 
Minnesota cannery was one of his first three clients. The 
relationship continues today. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first things Burnett did was spiff up the giant. He  
straightened his back, replaced his bearskin with a green leafy 
toga and gave him a smile. He put the word ``Jolly'' in front of 
the giant's name on a whim and it stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began using the giant more frequently in print  
advertising during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s -- presenting him as a 
good, strong, natural-born protector watching over Le Sueur and the 
Minnesota River valley. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, the company decided to make the leap to television  
commercials. The commercials were first shot with men painted 
green, then puppet figures and later animation. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Giant kept its brand identity after it was purchased by  
Pillsbury in 1979, but the world of the Jolly Green Giant fell 
silent when the advertising focus changed in the early 1990s.

	Starr To End Probe Before 2000 Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years after taking office, Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr promised Monday to wrap up his investigation 
before the 2000 New York Senate election that is being eyed by 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Even if he brings no further charges, Starr 
has gathered evidence that includes billing records showing the 
first lady did legal work in the 1980s for a savings and loan real 
estate deal that federal regulators concluded was a ``sham.'' 
Before the records appeared, Mrs. Clinton testified she knew almost 
nothing about the deal. The prosecutor declined to say whether the 
president or first lady were out of legal trouble.

	Clinton Administration Backs Yeltsin

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After Russian President Boris Yeltsin fired  
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and the rest of his Cabinet, 
raising new questions about his -- and his country's -- stability, 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said, ``I don't think we 
should blow this out of proportion.'' Yeltsin named Vladimir Putin, 
a former KGB agent, as acting prime minister and as his successor. 
But few believe Putin has any chance of being elected president, 
and the Russian media has speculated that Yeltsin and his advisers 
are considering the possibility of canceling elections in a bid to 
extend his tenure.

	White House Hints at Tax Compromise

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a hint of movement, a White House official  
said Monday that if Republicans would agree to a $250 billion, 
10-year tax cut for the middle class, the Clinton administration 
would be open to negotiations over the package's details. President 
Clinton Sunday made conciliatory comments about his hopes for a 
compromise with Republicans this fall over tax cuts and spending. 
Remarks from Gene Sperling, chairman of the White House National 
Economic Council, suggest that the White House is not necessarily 
wedded to the targeted tax cuts for retirement savings, long-term 
health care and other expenses it has espoused so far this year.

into the Ohio River on Monday, closing the waterway to traffic and 
forcing downstream communities to stop drawing water from the 
river. Between 40,000 and 80,000 gallons of gasoline leaked after 
four barges carrying gasoline and a fifth barge carrying the 
chemical cumene collided. Authorities believed there was no 
spillage of the cumene, a chemical used to make plastics that can

German law, books espousing Nazi philosophy are banned from public 
display or sale, punishable by up to five years in prison. But 
while Amazon.de -- the German affiliate of Amazon.com -- does not

easily access the U.S.-based site and have the book delivered to 
Germany.

night. Brown won his fourth straight decision as the Dodgers took 
three out of four from the Mets. He struck out three and walked one 
in improving to 2-3 against New York. New York, which had led the 
NL East since Aug. 2, dropped one-half game behind Atlanta, which 
beat Houston 5-3. The Mets have lost three straight for the first 
time since an eight-game skid that ended June 6.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Rejects Oil-Dumping Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government rejected a complaint Monday by  
independent oil producers who accused four countries of dumping 
cheap imported oil on the American market and harming U.S. 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, after a review by its International  
Trade Administration, found that the Oklahoma-based group had 
``insufficient industry support'' to challenge the imports under 
federal anti-dumping laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition, aimed at government-owned oil companies in  
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Iraq, was filed by small 
producers operating in Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson applauded the decision as ``a  
win-win for U.S. consumers and domestic oil producers.'' He called 
the petition ``a distraction'' in developing a package of programs 
to help the U.S. oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Hamm, an Oklahoma oilman and chairman of the coalition  
that brought the petition, said he would appeal the Commerce 
decision to the Court of International Trade. Such appeals often 
take several years to resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the decision ``a classic example of government  
disregarding the rights of the `little guy' in favor of the greedy 
self interests of the wealthy'' and noted that more than 100,000 
oil industry workers have lost their jobs because of low oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Large American oil companies, supported by more than 100  
organizations and major energy users, also had opposed the 
independent producers' petition, claiming that the group did not 
represent a quarter of domestic oil production as required. 
</P>
<P>
	If the petition had been accepted, the government would have  
opened formal investigations into pricing of oil imports. Had it 
found violations of anti-dumping laws, about 60 percent of the oil 
imported into the country would have been subject to steep tariffs 
-- leading to higher energy and gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said in a statement that it decided  
against launching a further investigation because ``opposition to 
the petition from U.S. producers exceeded support for the 
petitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department made spot checks, direct inquiries and received  
comments from nearly 1,000 oil companies and producers and found 
that only about a third of those responding were in favor of the 
complaint, officials said. By law, at least half of those 
commenting must favor a petition to trigger a full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing that test, the government did not pursue whether the  
producers' coalition met the 25 percent domestic production 
criteria, agency officials said. ``Without adequate industry 
support, Commerce is prohibited by law from initiating 
investigations,'' the department said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent oilmen's petition, filed last month by a group  
calling itself Save Domestic Oil Inc., charged that the four 
foreign producing countries had sold oil in the U.S. market at 
artificially low prices in violation of America's anti-dumping 
trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade experts had been astonished by use of the anti-dumping  
trade laws on oil imports because oil prices always have been 
viewed as highly volatile and determined largely by international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is ``a triumph of sound economics over  
protectionism and the mumbo jumbo of trade legalism,'' said Guy 
Caruso, an energy specialist at the Washington-based Center for 
Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists doubted the law would be invoked in response to  
the petition that was filed on behalf of the domestic industry in 
43 of the 50 states -- excluding the West Coast, Arizona, Nevada, 
Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent oilmen had hoped that limiting the scope of the  
petition would mitigate the opposition of the large U.S. oil 
companies, whose domestic fields are concentrated in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	They had argued their industry, especially in the historic oil  
patch of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, had been severely harmed by 
the low prices of imported oil and that the anti-dumping trade laws 
should protect them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dumping did occur and it put 100,000 people out of jobs. ...  
Our only line of defense is the trade laws,'' Harold Hamm, an oil 
producer from Enid, Okla., and chairman of the coalition of oilmen 
said before the Commerce ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition charged that the foreign producers sold oil in the  
United States in some cases for less than it cost to produce and in 
other cases for less than they sold it for in other markets such as 
Japan. They also charged that government subsidies to the 
government-owned oil companies violated U.S. trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign producers deny the charges. Mexico particularly has  
expressed outrage and put on hold plans to cut tariffs on U.S. 
natural gas sent to Mexico until the matter is resolved. Richardson 
said Monday that Mexican officials had informed him that they now 
intended to go ahead with a tariff phaseout. 
</P>
<P>
	George Yates, chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association  
of America, which had supported the petition, said he was 
disappointed that Commerce would not at least investigate the 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our industry has been pushed to the precipice over the last 18  
months as a result of low oil prices,'' said Yates. He said the 
U.S. oil industry has shrunk 15 percent with 150,000 oil and gas 
wells shut down and production dropping from 6.4 million barrels a 
day 5.8 million barrels a day since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Starr Hails Decision on Clinton Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent counsel Kenneth Starr today  
praised an Arkansas judge's decision declaring that President 
Clinton gave false testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was very strong language,'' Starr said of the  
decision last month by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	While Starr wouldn't call her decision vindication in an  
interview with the NBC ``Today'' show, he did say: ``This is a very 
distinguished judge who looked at the facts and came to these 
conclusions. And I would just add that the system, did, in fact, 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has been investigating Clinton and his wife, Hillary, for  
over five years, and is thought to be winding down the probe. 
Clinton was impeached by the House last December in connection with 
the Monica Lewinsky case, but acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton White House has said that Clinton will pay the  
$90,000 fine levied by Judge Wright. The judge said in the July 29 
ruling she hoped that it might deter others ``who might consider 
emulating the president's misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which is in addition to $850,000 awarded Mrs. Jones  
in a settlement of her sexual harassment case, was aimed at 
covering legal costs related the president's denial that he had a 
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NBC interview today, Starr also said he ``was horrified''  
when Congress quickly released his report on Clinton to the public 
and allowed it to be posted on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the report contained many salacious details of  
Clinton's conduct, Starr said, ``Now, I have said and I will say 
again today, I don't think I did enough to warn the Congress, to 
say ... this is sensitive material. But I really did think, and I 
don't mean to criticize Congress, it made its decision and it was a 
broad bipartisan decision that that we're simply going to turn this 
information over to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he saw the telecast in which Hillary Rodham Clinton  
blamed her husband's problems on ``a vast right-wing conspiracy,'' 
and said that he ``simply took it as her sense of loyalty in light 
of the president denying the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr refused to comment on whether he might still seek  
Clinton's indictment. ``On that, I'm not going to comment at all,'' 
he said. ``It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting at all 
about the future of the investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Flirts With Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Commentator Pat Buchanan continued his  
tease of the Reform Party Monday, saying Republicans and Democrats 
``look like two wings of a single party'' and third parties are 
filling a natural void. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan spoke approvingly of the Reform Party when asked about  
it by an audience member after the GOP candidate for president had 
delivered a speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a vacuum in American politics and the third parties  
have begun to fill it, and I think that is a very natural and 
inevitable thing,'' said Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments caused a stir because reports last week said he had  
thought of a Reform Party bid. Buchanan has complained much of the 
GOP establishment is in line behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush and 
Buchanan's conservative message isn't being heard. 
</P>
<P>
	After delivering a speech Monday, Buchanan was asked by an  
audience members about the Reform Party and the election of 
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a win Buchanan described as 
``healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reform Party and the strength it showed in '92 and '96 is  
a reflection of the fact that the two national parties in 
Washington, D.C., are more and more coming to look like two wings 
of a single party, where the differences between them are almost 
inconsequential,'' said Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	With former wrestler Ventura in mind, Buchanan offered an  
analogy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, it's like a professional wrestling match where one  
fellow wins one night in one town and the other fellow wins the 
next week and they go out and have a couple of beers,'' said 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan argued that on issues ranging from trade to foreign  
policy, there's little difference between George W. Bush and 
President Clinton, and he said voters understand that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's on foreign policy or trade policy or immigration  
policy, Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton appear to be Xerox copies,'' 
Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	After his speech and question session, reporters pressed  
Buchanan to explain his remarks on the Reform Party. He discounted 
them, saying he's focused on the high-profile Iowa straw poll 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am running as a Republican in a very difficult straw poll,''  
said Buchanan. ``I'll stay with my speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said that Bay Buchanan, his sister and a close  
political adviser, had spoken with Reform Party officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``She talked to somebody three or four weeks ago,'' said  
Buchanan. ``My sister talks to everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan insists he's running as a Republican, while conceding  
that he's given thought to running under another banner. And he 
notes that makes it more difficult to organize for the straw poll 
among activists who could be leery of backing a candidate about to 
leave the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Gargan, who takes the reins of the Reform Party in January,  
said Buchanan ``would find a wide range of people (in the Reform 
Party) supporting him. He would also find a lot of people against 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan, who was elected to the chairmanship last month with  
Ventura's backing, said there is room for a wide ideological range 
in the party, and Buchanan might be frustrated if he tries to move 
the party's platform in line with his own political views, 
particularly on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reform Party is owned and paid for, so to speak, by its  
delegates, which is a wide range of people,'' Gargan said. ``I'm 
sure he'll consider that.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Case Taking Important Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The next important step in the government's  
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. happens early this week when 
the judge receives hundreds of pages of documents largely 
summarizing months of courtroom arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the sides to  
present by Tuesday their versions of the facts of the case, one of 
the final steps toward a possible verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who made an unorthodox appearance in Atlanta today at a  
panel discussion with a Microsoft attorney and a lawyer from the 
New York attorney general's office, could decide the case late this 
year or early in 2000 -- unless off-and-on settlement negotiations 
succeed. New York is one of several states suing the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antitrust cases are by nature more complex than most other  
civil litigation,'' Jackson said at the American Bar Association 
discussion. He said his approach to the complicated Microsoft case 
was ``to try to avoid the Vietnam morasses'' that other cases, such 
as the breakup of AT&AMP;T, became. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began last October, the sides have met several  
times outside the courtroom, including once in early June. Future 
talks are anticipated this summer, but outside legal experts 
consider settlement unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust case, which accuses Microsoft of illegally  
wielding monopoly power in the software industry to crush potential 
rivals, has been on hiatus for seven weeks, since courtroom 
testimony ended June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said its court filing this week will focus on what it  
considers the government's failure to prove that the company's 
actions hurt customers, which would be necessary to support a 
guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The company apparently hopes to capitalize on a potentially  
embarrassing slip by government witness Franklin Fisher, an 
economist. Fisher told Justice lawyer David Boies in January that 
Microsoft's behavior ``on balance'' hasn't harmed consumers ``up to 
this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher caught himself moments later and amended his answer to  
explain that he believed consumers eventually would feel an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft strongly disagrees, said a company lawyer who outlined  
arguments in Microsoft's court filing on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, Microsoft will reassert that it's not an entrenched  
monopolist in the fast-paced technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	It will argue it didn't illegally discourage the nation's  
largest computer makers and Internet providers from distributing 
Web-browsing software manufactured by rival Netscape Communications 
Corp., recently bought by America Online Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The government improperly focused on a few manufacturers of  
computer operating-system software to illustrate Microsoft's 
dominance, the company contends. Proving a company wields monopoly 
power is essential to winning an antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft said it will argue it doesn't charge prices as  
high as a monopolist would, and its massive spending on research 
and development of new software ``makes no sense if Microsoft had 
durable monopoly power,'' the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft wants the judge to consider an array of fledgling  
technologies as its competition -- including new types of software 
and devices developed by America Online and others. It hopes to 
show that even though its flagship Windows software runs most of 
the world's personal computers, Microsoft's future influence is far 
from certain. 
</P>
<P>
	In another of its arguments, Microsoft will challenge the  
government's allegation that it included browsing software free in 
Windows in 1995 to undermine Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers, citing e-mails, contend Microsoft spent  
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop its Internet software 
but gave it away only after Netscape emerged as a threat to Windows 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's lawsuit quotes Microsoft's senior vice  
president, Paul Maritz, saying: ``We are going to cut off 
(Netscape's) air supply. Everything they're selling, we're going to 
give away for free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz denied making the comment, and on Sunday, The New Yorker  
reported, in its edition on newsstands Monday, Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates' reaction to the alleged quotation: 
</P>
<P>
	``A great lie! An unbelievable lie. Did anyone utter those  
words? Our e-mail, every piece of it, has been searched. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we had found somebody who said it. Then we could take  
him out, and we could hang the guy, then we'd say OK, mea culpa. We 
found him -- the guy who said, 'I'll cut off your oxygen.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge will give the two sides one month to review each  
other's documents, then make revisions to their own filings and 
return them Sept. 10. Courtroom arguments are set for Sept. 21.

<HEADLINE> Watson Draws Praise From Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos won't resume practice until  
Tuesday after beating the San Diego Chargers 20-17 in their 
preseason opener in Australia Saturday night, but coach Mike 
Shanahan is already singling out one player for praise. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan was happy with rookie cornerback Chris Watson's pass  
defense and his work on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson returned a punt for 41 yards and returned three kickoffs  
for 61 yards. His longest kick return, 61 yards, was called back 
because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see his speed and quickness out there,'' Shanahan  
said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he saw some ``flashes'' from other players, but  
nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	One player Shanahan was not happy with after the game was  
cornerback Tory James. He appeared to be fully recovered from the 
knee injury he suffered during the Broncos' preseason opener in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan was pleased that James intercepted a third-quarter pass  
and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown. But he was not happy with 
James' showboating near the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made that big play,'' Shananan said. ``But I was very  
disappointed that he took the ball up in the air before he got 
across the goal line. That't not the way we operate. The 
quarterback almost got him. It was almost a perfect play, except 
for the celebration after he crossed that goal line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos returned to Denver from Australia Sunday night. They  
took today off and were scheduled to resume practice in Greeley on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos play the Arizona Cardinals at home Saturday night in  
their second preseason game.

<HEADLINE> Mickey Rooney Helps Oz Celebration </HEADLINE>

<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Minn. (AP) -- Mickey Rooney tossed gold foam bricks  
from a carriage as he helped Judy Garland's hometown celebrate 60 
years of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old actor, a childhood friend of Garland's and  
frequent co-star, rode in the town's annual Judy Garland Festival 
parade Sunday. He was carried in the same black carriage that took 
the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion and Garland, as 
Dorothy, into the movie's Emerald City. 
</P>
<P>
	Garland, who left the northern Minnesota town at the age of 4,  
later died of a drug overdose. Rooney played the wizard in a 
touring stage version of the show.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Zocor To Raise HDL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All cholesterol-lowering drugs help reduce LDL  
or bad cholesterol. Now Merck &AMP; Co.'s Zocor is now the first to get 
federal approval to say it can also raise HDL, or good cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not likely to change the balance the power in the  
cholesterol drug wars, analysts say. That's because most doctors 
already knew about Zocor's HDL cholesterol raising ability, and 
reducing total cholesterol levels remains the main goal for 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipitor, sold by Warner-Lambert and Pfizer, controls about 41  
percent of the U.S. cholesterol drug market, about twice the level 
of Zocor, based on the amount of new prescription orders. Lipitor 
increasingly dominates the market because doctors see it as the 
most potent drug available. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10.6 million of the 98 million Americans with high total  
cholesterol level, have too low a HDL cholesterol level, a Merck 
spokesman said 
</P>
<P>
	Zocor still would be given only to people with high levels of  
LDL, or ``bad'' cholesterol. The drug would not be available for 
people who wanted to raise HDL levels, if they have normal overall 
cholesterol readings. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approval, announced by Merck on Monday, will allow Merck  
to use the expanded claim in its physician and consumer 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really an incremental step for Merck,'' said Alex  
Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. But he added, ``Any 
traction Merck can get to go against Lipitor will be helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sidney Smith, chief of cardiology at the University of North  
Carolina Medical Center, said he is not sure if doctors will change 
prescribing patterns because of the HDL benefit of Zocor.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Insurance Issue Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- European insurance companies would pay about  
10 times the face value of Holocaust-era insurance policies to 
survivors and families under a formula reached by Lawrence 
Eagleburger, chairman of a claims commission. 
</P>
<P>
	This could clear the way for payment of claims against German  
and other European insurance policies, beginning in October, with 
payments reflecting inflation and interest since the policies were 
purchased some 60 year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The five insurance companies involved with the commission have  
set aside $100 million for paying the claims, including 
administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Sher, vice chairman of the commission, told The Associated  
Press today that the former secretary of state's decision was based 
on ``what he considers to be fair compromises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sher, who was the chief prosecutor of ex-Nazis in the Justice  
Department, said ``the expectation now is that we will move forward 
and launch our worldwide effort to attract claimants and to pay 
legitimate claims,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working groups will meet in London this month and the commission  
will then meet there Sept. 22-23 to finalize an outreach program to 
locate and arrange payments for victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger's decision, reached Friday but not announced, made  
some changes in his initial, tentative ruling of a week earlier 
that had been challenged by major insurers, Sher said. But the 
basic outline remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
	It provides for multiplying by about 10 the face value of  
policies taken out before the war, some 60 years ago. This is in 
line with past decisions by the commission that policies should 
reflect ``real value'' taking into account inflation and interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress  
and a member of the commission, said ``we accept the good faith 
judgment of chairman Eagleburger and we will move forward to rapid 
payout of these policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Pomeroy, North Dakota insurance commissioner, who headed  
the state regulators on the commission, reportedly warned insurance 
companies that if they carried out threats to quit the commission, 
they would be open to punitive action by state insurance 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the German insurance company Allianz said last  
week that all five European insurers, in varying degrees, were 
pressing the former secretary of state for changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concerns are not only about the money, but about the  
process as well,'' spokesman Nicolai Tewes said in a telephone 
interview from Munich. ``It would be a misunderstanding that the 
companies are only trying to save some money. The companies want to 
find a process that works and makes sense to the people who are 
waiting for the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger stepped in when the commission could not agree on a  
formula that would have determined current values on policies taken 
out some six decades ago.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Lost $490 Million Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most health maintenance organizations lost money  
for a second year in a row in 1998, prompting many plans to raise 
premiums and cut benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs lost a combined $490 million last year, compared to a $768  
million loss in 1997, according to a study released Monday by Weiss 
Ratings, an independent ratings service based in Palm Beach 
Gardens, Fla. Before 1997, the HMO industry was profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	About 56 percent of HMOs lost money last year, down slightly  
from the 57 percent in 1997, the Weiss study found. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not good news for the consumer,'' said Martin Weiss,  
chairman of Weiss Ratings. That's because HMOs that lose money are 
more likely to go out of business, quit unprofitable markets or 
raise premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO industry's financial health should improve again this  
year as a result of many plans raising premiums by more than 5 
percent and curtailing coverage of Medicare recipients, Weiss said. 
Higher rates led to the narrower losses in 1998, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 576 HMOs analyzed by Weiss, 100 failed to have enough  
fiscal reserves as called for under guidelines set by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners. The guidelines seek to 
ensure that the HMOs have enough money to pay claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has a long way to go before consumers are safe,''  
Weiss said 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs operated by United HealthCare lost $174.6 million last  
year, most among large HMOs, the Weiss study found. Prudential 
HealthCare, which last week was bought by Aetna, lost nearly $60 
million in 1998. Aetna's HMOs lost about $15.9 million. Aetna is 
now the nation's largest health insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The steep losses raise the question of whether plans will skimp  
on coverage to save money, said Peter Young, a consultant with 
Health Care Strategic Issues in Fort Myers, Fla. ``These numbers 
are not good, no matter how you look at it,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and hospital executives have complained for the past few  
years about problems getting HMOs to paying medical bills. They say 
HMOs' financial problems are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Few large HMOs have gone bankrupt in recent years, but when they  
do, consumers can be left scrambling for insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200,000 New Jersey residents last fall had to find a new  
health insurance coverage when HIP Health Plan of New Jersey went 
bankrupt in one of the biggest fiscal collapses in the industry's 
history.

<HEADLINE> 1921 Tulsa Race Riot Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Survivors of the 1921 Tulsa race riot who  
were invited to testify before a commission investigating the clash 
instead listened in silence Monday as a historian detailed the 
horrors. 
</P>
<P>
	The story stunned 90-year-old Joyce Walker Hill, who heard for  
the first time the extent of the attack by white mobs that forced 
her family to flee their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I knew is that we were in it,'' said the Kansas City,  
Kan., woman, who was 11 when whites torched her black neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tulsa Race Riot Commission invited more than 60 known  
survivors to share their stories, but the five who came already had 
videotaped their testimony and chose not to speak. The panel is 
trying to get a better picture of what happened when the fighting 
broke out May 31, 1921, and to determine if reparations should be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	It approved a plan Monday to do limited excavation at a downtown  
cemetery where archaeologists have narrowed a search for mass 
graves. State archaeologist Bob Brooks said examining samples of 
remains or artifacts is the only way to know for sure if race riot 
victims are buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, since we're working in a cemetery, this is a very  
sensitive matter,'' said Brooks, explaining that excavation will 
require city approval. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hope Franklin, head of President Clinton's national  
advisory board on race, also addressed the panel. His father 
survived the race riot, and as a lawyer, helped defeat a city 
ordinance that hampered efforts by blacks to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin, who grew up playing with children who survived the  
riot, called reparations a ``mere pittance'' to what victims 
suffered. But he said if they or a memorial are necessary, ``then 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever you do, it must be done in a spirit of good will,  
even love,'' Franklin urged the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature created the panel in 1997 to look into the  
facts of the riot after black lawmakers raised the issue of 
reparations. The details of what happened and how many died have 
long been disputed. 
</P>
<P>
	Historian Scott Ellsworth, who wrote a book on the riot, now  
believes that it was the worst single incident of racial violence 
in U.S. history. At least 200 to 300 people, mostly blacks, are 
believed to have perished. 
</P>
<P>
	Using new evidence gleaned in the commission's two-year study,  
Ellsworth walked the panel through the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 10,000 white men and boys gathered to attack the  
black community, he said. Police officers and the local unit of the 
National Guard also joined in the burning of 35 blocks of the 
once-thriving black business district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It all started when a white mob gathered to lynch a black man  
who had been accused of attacking a female white elevator operator, 
who later declined to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The whites confronted a group of black World War I veterans who  
showed up offering to help defend the courthouse jail, Ellsworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A struggle ensues, a shot goes off and the race riot is on,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivor George Monroe nodded as Ellsworth related his story of  
hiding under a bed as a white rioter set the home on fire. The man 
stepped on the 5-year-old boy's fingers and Monroe's sister stifled 
his cry with her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsworth pointed out survivor Kinney Booker who remembered  
hearing the bullets hitting his house. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsworth spoke of whites attacking with machine guns, burning a  
black church erroneously thought to hold an arsenal and of 
airplanes that fired down on those who fled. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Ellsworth's detailed account left commission members  
with more questions. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Don Ross, whose legislation led to the panel's  
creation, said the group had yet to hear why a ``conspiracy of 
silence'' had prevented full disclosure until now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business community, the political community and the media  
conspired to keep quiet,'' he said. ``It is significant, I think, 
that the coverup is exposed.''

<HEADLINE> UAW Negotiator Laskowski Dead at 59 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers vice president Jack  
Laskowski, who headed national contract talks with DaimlerChrysler 
AG, has died, the union said Monday. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Laskowski was attending a board meeting of Delta Dental of  
Michigan on Sunday when he apparently suffered a heart attack, the 
union said. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as director of the union's DaimlerChrysler department  
and had been selected in March to negotiate a new contract with the 
automaker's Chrysler unit. The UAW's triennial talks with Detroit's 
automakers began in June to replace the pact that expires Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Laskowski also oversaw negotiations with the former Chrysler  
Corp. during the last round of national bargaining in 1996. The 
department represents 75,000 UAW members at more than 50 locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brother Laskowski's leadership made a tremendous contribution  
to our union through his role as a UAW officer, as a member of our 
International Executive Board and as the director of many important 
UAW departments,'' UAW president Stephen P. Yokich said in a 
statement. ``Especially in view of his key role as leader of the 
team negotiating a new contract at DaimlerChrysler, he will be 
sorely missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laskowski's death was ``a tremendous shock'' to DaimlerChrysler  
as well, DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert J. Eaton said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Laskowski was elected a UAW vice president in 1995. He had been  
a regional director from 1992-1995. He was a UAW member since 1958, 
when he joined Local 362 after starting work at what is now the CPC 
Powertrain Plant in Bay City. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Sally and their three sons. Funeral  
arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Lukas, Baze Join Horse Racing Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- ``Lucky'' Lukas? No way.  
</P>
<P>
	D. Wayne Lukas has conditioned more champions than any other  
thoroughbred trainer, won a record 13 Breeders Cup races and 
amassed more than $200 million in career purse earnings -- but don't 
call him lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in the luck factor,'' Lukas said Monday,  
moments after being inducted into the National Museum of Racing's 
Hall of Fame. ``If you have to depend on luck in this game, you're 
gonna get beat a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also inducted Monday were jockey Russell Baze and thoroughbred  
racehorses Exceller, Miesque and Gun Bow. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of Lukas' achievements is long enough to line a  
racetrack. Highlights include receiving the Eclipse Award as the 
nation's top trainer four times, winning the Belmont Stakes three 
times and winning 12 Triple Crown races. His most recent Triple 
Crown victories came this year, when Charismatic won the Derby and 
the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas has led the nation in earnings 14 of the last 16 years,  
and his 1998 mark of $17.8 million is a record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
	With the ceremony spotlight centered squarely on him, Lukas, 63,  
chose to share the glory with a half-dozen assistants who gathered 
around him onstage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those records would never have happened without these guys,''  
Lukas said, his voice shaking. ``You guys have propped me up, 
carried me. And I know I wasn't easy to work for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tradeout here, and I got the best in the trade --  
just like I do every time I trade (horses) with you guys,'' he 
said, grinning at the other trainers in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	His assistants joked about Lukas' short temper and  
``expletive-laced tirades,'' but they were heavy in their praise. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many things have changed in our industry because of Wayne  
Lukas,'' said former Lukas assistant Mark Hennig. ``So many 
trainers never run multiple divisions, and he's shown us the 
reality that any race is just one flight away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his success, Lukas said it ``hasn't always been blue  
skies and clear sailing in my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been solidly criticized by certain people in the industry  
and the media who don't always agree with what we do. But I make no 
apologies for what we've tried to do,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my nature to push the envelope every time,'' he said.  
``If you want a coach who wants to walk the ball up the court, you 
better get another guy, because we're going to run and press all 
the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baze was short with his remarks and blushed as he accepted the  
honor, which he called ``an embarrassment of riches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 25-year career, Baze has ridden 6,662 winners and earned  
more than $94.5 million in purses. He has also been the only rider 
to record 400 or more wins in each of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past four years, Baze has been awarded the Isaac Murphy  
Award, presented by the National Turf Writers Association to the 
jockey with the highest winning percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I have been able to set those numbers that I have  
for the last couple of years is because I've been able to go out 
every day and do it,'' Baze said. ``I've been blessed that I 
haven't been injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exceller, who raced from 1975 to 1979, came from 22 lengths back  
to beat two Triple Crown winners in the 1 1/2-mile Jockey Club Gold 
Cup in 1978. Exceller won by a nose over Triple Crown winner 
Seattle Slew and Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Miesque, who was based in Europe for her entire racing career,  
made two starts in the United States, won two Grade I races, and 
was voted two Eclipse Awards. She also won a total of eight Group I 
races in France and England. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun Bow raised eyebrows in 1964 when he defeated Kelso by 12  
lengths at the Brooklyn Handicap, setting a track record of 1:59. 
That autumn, they split in two dramatic duels in the Aqueduct and 
Woodward Stakes. Gun Bow raced from 1963 until 1965 and earned 
$798,722.

<HEADLINE> Saying No to `Andro' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fresh off his victory over the umpires, Bud Selig has a chance  
to make it two in a row. All he has to do is say no to ``andro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slugger Mark McGwire did that four months ago -- an admission he  
made so matter-of-factly last week it caused you to blink first, 
then wonder what the fuss last summer was about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like how it's portrayed,'' McGwire said, ``but young  
kids take it because of me. I don't like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letting andro go was courageous, but it was late in coming and  
self-serving, too. So take McGwire at his word, but remember 
performance-enhancers like androstenedione can be loaded into the 
system months earlier to build muscle and then forsaken once the 
season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also worth remembering that McGwire confessed just as he  
caught up to last season's home-run pace and just before he 
launched No. 500 of his career. And remember, too, that the same 
medical experts who praised him for stopping also hold McGwire 
largely responsible for causing sales of the testosterone booster 
to surge more than 1,000 percent over the past year, to more than 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all need to be aware that just because a superstar stops  
using andro, the problem doesn't just go away,'' said Barry 
McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countless young people still take this potentially dangerous  
substance -- banned by the NFL, the Olympics, the NCAA and 
professional tennis -- in order to improve their athletic 
performance. We must continue to focus on the risks at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the pill is now in Selig's court.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has always been a home-run hitter who abided by the  
rules and this latest move has only strengthened that perception. 
Baseball's greatest fear when the controversy first aired was that 
it would dim McGwire's monumental achievement. That hasn't 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	People clamoring for an asterisk next to the 70 home runs have  
turned silent, in part because the assault on the record books 
continues. They see McGwire still pursued by Sammy Sosa, Ken 
Griffey Jr., and a handful more and recognize now -- as the rest of 
us did then -- that putting big air underneath a baseball has more 
to do with a good eye and a grooved swing than pumping iron. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest obstacle to a ban now is a strong union and a weak  
boss. Clearly, Selig has grown into the job of commissioner during 
his yearlong tenure. But he is still the most deliberate of men, 
and mindful of the tenuous nature of labor peace in the game, still 
one of the most cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time he heard the word ``andro,'' Selig drove directly  
over to the pharmacist who had treated his family for years. His 
next step was a lot less folksy: Major league baseball commissioned 
a study by Harvard scientists that is due on Selig's desk sometime 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	And until then, Selig insisted one more time Sunday, ``I won't  
make any judgments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just about everybody else, though, has weighed in. There is  
already considerable evidence that over the short term, it works 
like an anabolic steroid, helping players build muscle mass and 
recover from injuries quicker. There is also considerable medical 
opinion that it works like anabolic steroid over the long term, 
too; which is to say it could cause potentially fatal side effects, 
including heart attacks, cancer, liver dysfunction and severe 
disorders of mood and mental function. 
</P>
<P>
	But the only people who appear less troubled by andro than Selig  
at the moment are the people in charge at the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Orza, the No. 2 official, said during spring training he  
doubted the Harvard study would turn up enough proof that andro 
enhances performance or endangers players' health to convince them 
to agree to a ban. Reached at home Sunday, he refused to say 
anything about andro beyond, ``No comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collective bargaining agreement blocks baseball from  
instituting a ban of its own, but that doesn't mean Selig is 
powerless. Even when he was only acting as the commissioner, Selig 
displayed a willingness to try and do what was best for baseball. 
That same instinct should move him in the direction of a ban on 
andro, sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
	He will have to stir up public opinion and strong-arm some  
people along the way, much like NBA commissioner David Stern did in 
getting the players union to accept testing for marijuana. But in 
the long run, it could prove to be a valuable precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	We live in a time when the limits of human performance once  
again are being blurred. The time to start talking about what's 
safe for competition, what constitutes a level playing field and 
what kind of message the audience takes home is now. Because those 
issues are only going to get more complex from here on out.

<HEADLINE> Museum Exhibit for Lenny Bruce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Foul-mouthed, opinionated, too shocking for  
prime time -- Lenny Bruce has been called them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Now an exhibit at the Museum of Television and Radio is honoring  
the comedian as one of the foremost personalities and provocateurs 
of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two Five Letter Words: Lenny Bruce'' features the complete  
collection of the comedian's television appearances. There's his 
vaudeville act on ``Arthur Godfrey and Friends'' in 1949; his 
constitutional rights activism on the Steve Allen show; and his odd 
clowning on Canada's ``Close Up!'' in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``The liberal press wrote that Bruce represented a new approach  
to comedy, but the conservative press wrote him off as a waste of 
time,'' said writer Nat Hentoff, whose interview with Bruce is 
included in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The comic was hounded by authorities for his political and  
social satire and his use of obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to push the rules but he was clearly aware of his  
limits, and that didn't necessarily stop him,'' Robert Batscha, 
president of the museum, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit continues until Oct. 3.

<HEADLINE> Boston Coll. Gets $5M Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- A benefactor has given Boston College $5  
million for student spiritual retreats and volunteer programs, a 
gift school officials say is believed to be the largest that 
requires no bricks and mortar and no name etched above a building 
doorway. 
</P>
<P>
	John McNeice Jr. is a 1954 graduate of the Jesuit university who  
made his fortune by building an investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday he sees his gift as a way for young people to be  
``men and women for others'' -- and not just self-absorbed college 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The donation ``completes their education, not only their  
academic training, but their spiritual training as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The John and Margarete McNeice Student Formation Fund will help  
pay for the university's extensive volunteer and student retreat 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Each spring break, for example, some 450 BC students head to  
impoverished Appalachian communities to volunteer. Another 450 are 
on the waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	The university can only afford to send so many, and student fund  
raising only goes so far in running the $130,000 program. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 800 students participate in a program that combines  
academic work with service in Boston-area hospitals, shelters and 
prisons. Last year alone, about 150 students had to be turned away 
for lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
	``If college students are encouraged to make religious retreats  
and to work in volunteer efforts, that experience will carry over 
into their lives after college,'' said college President Rev. 
William P. Leahy. 
</P>
<P>
	This is just the latest gift for McNeice, who is estimated to  
have given away some $20 million to charitable institutions, 
including up to $10 million to his alma mater. His philanthropic 
focus has been on Jesuit education and Catholic endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	McNeice, 66, built the Colonial Group into a leading investment  
management companies before selling it to Liberty Financial in 
1994.

<HEADLINE> Report: Vikings' Underwood To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dimitrius Underwood said he will return to  
the Minnesota Vikings training camp after spending the last week 
trying to decide between his love for football and his obligation 
to the ministry, according to a report Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the Vikings' first-round draft choice, said he  
decided to return Monday after having a 75-minute phone 
conversation with former Green Bay Packer Reggie White, an ordained 
minister, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis said in its online 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood said he would accept whatever consequences he might  
face from the Vikings, including suspension or termination of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	White encouraged Underwood to return.  
</P>
<P>
	``I totally understand what this young man has been going  
through, and he is to be commended for having the strength to go 
through all of this,'' White told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old defensive end walked out of the Minnesota  
Vikings training camp a week ago, leaving his family, his agent and 
team officials to speculate about his motive and whereabouts. The 
Star Tribune spoke with Underwood in a Philadelphia hotel lobby 
Sunday night while Vikings officials moved to cut ties with the 
first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deep down in my heart, I know I was not called to do that kind  
of work,'' Underwood said of the ministry. ``But recently, in the 
last month, I feel the Lord's been pulling me there. And I know 
that that is a huge conflict of interest, because what am I going 
to do in order to support my family?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood has 16-month-old twins who live in Michigan with his  
former girlfriend. He also provides financial assistance to his 
mother, brother and sister in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	After his first practice in Mankato, Minn., Underwood flagged  
down a motorist who took him to the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
International Airport. He flew to Cleveland, where his new Lexus 
was parked. From there he headed to Philadelphia, where he has been 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood spent four nights in the Marriott Hotel, checking in  
under his middle name, Paul. But he ran short of cash and spent 
Saturday night in his car. When interviewed, he had $8 in his 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year, $5.3 million contract he signed July 31 included a  
partly deferred $1.7 million signing bonus. The Vikings persuaded a 
judge to freeze $500,000. But part of the account remained liquid 
and Underwood said he took $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood said there is ``a real problem in his heart'' about  
taking money he didn't earn, and he doesn't plan to take more 
money. For their part, the Vikings are trying to dispose of 
Underwood's contract altogether, according to several reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Domann, Underwood's agent, said Sunday that team officials  
told him they didn't want the former Michigan State player back. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood realizes the implications of his actions, but said  
it's more important to him to be humble. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want people to know is it's not about wasting a  
lucrative opportunity and the chance to become a star in the NFL,'' 
he said. ``It's not just about the money.''

<HEADLINE> A Multi-National English Dictionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The first new English dictionary in 30 years is a  
tickety-boo venture of ... 
</P>
<P>
	Tickety-boo?  
</P>
<P>
	That's a British and Canadian word meaning ``perfectly fine,''  
and it can be found in the Encarta World English Dictionary, the 
first lexicon to incorporate words and usages from the world's 74 
English-speaking countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the dictionaries of the future will have to include  
words from around the world, given the way things have changed,'' 
said Anne Soukhanov, the U.S. general editor of Encarta, referring 
to Internet use and wider international travel and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Encarta also is the first full dictionary of the computer age --  
it has been published in print and on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sea change in dictionary making,'' Ms. Soukhanov said.  
``This couldn't have been done five years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Encarta includes local words considered most likely to be  
encountered by a Web browser or traveler in Britain, Ireland, the 
United States, Canada, the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia, East 
Asia, Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Those expressions include the Canadian ``slob ice,'' the slush  
that forms as snow melts on roadways; the Australian ``tall poppy 
syndrome,'' relating to public figures who loom large and the 
tendency by the media to want to knock them down; ``bangbelly,'' a 
piece of fried dough in Canada; and ``toenadering,'' a gathering of 
political parties in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The informal and slang usages come from many areas of commerce,  
such as the stock market, which contributed the phrase ``dead cat 
bounce,'' meaning false signals of a stock recovery brought on by a 
group buying the stock to attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Encarta is the first new English dictionary since 1969, when the  
American Heritage Dictionary was published as a response to what 
was viewed as the too-liberal treatment of language by the 
Merriam-Webster's Third New World Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Encarta dictionary, published in three-column format over 2,074  
pages, was compiled on computers by 320 editors who communicated by 
e-mail as they combed usages in the 74 countries where English is 
spoken. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few years ago, such work was done on 3-by-5 cards.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as though I have moved from the Kitty Hawk to the space  
shuttle Columbia,'' said Ms. Soukhanov, who also is the ``Word 
Watch'' columnist for The Atlantic Monthly, based in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Encarta's print version is selling in the United States for $50  
and will cost $34.95 on CD-ROM, which will be available Aug. 27.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns of Kosovo Complacency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The remarkable NATO victory in the Balkans  
should not be allowed to breed complacency, President Clinton said 
on Monday. ``We must not indulge the illusion of a risk-free war,'' 
he told a military audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know not every conflict will be like Kosovo, not every  
battle can be won from the air,'' Clinton said at a ceremony 
marking the 50th anniversary of the creation of the office of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised the 14 admirals and generals who have served as  
Joint Chiefs chairman -- six of whom were in the audience -- as an 
indispensable link between the Pentagon and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can look forward to the 21st century with genuine  
confidence, in no small measure because of the 14 leaders we honor 
today. These people are unique,'' Clinton told the ceremony, held 
at nearby Fort Myer, Va., which abuts Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry Shelton, the present chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs, told the gathering, ``Where there is no vision, the people 
perish. These men on the platform today and their predecessors have 
provided a vision for the U.S. armed forces. I am proud to walk in 
their footsteps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called the 78-day NATO air war against Yugoslavia ``a  
truly remarkable military campaign. Over 30,000 sorties flown, no 
combat casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, we must not indulge the illusion of a risk-free war,''  
Clinton added. ``In Kosovo, our pilots risked their lives every 
day. They took enemy fire, faced enemy aircraft. Time and again put 
themselves in even greater danger just to avoid hitting civilians 
on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted the deaths of two Apache helicopter pilots in a  
training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our job from the top down is to reduce the risks of their  
service as much as we can, and to send our servicemen and women 
into harm's way only when we're certain that the purpose is clear, 
the mission is achievable and all peaceful options have been 
exhausted,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also used the occasion to prod the Senate to bring up  
for a vote a long-stalled treaty to ban nuclear testing worldwide, 
appealing to Senate Foreign Relations Committee to hold hearings on 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty when Congress returns from its 
month-long August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 treaty has been signed by 152 nations but so far  
ratified by only 18 of the 44 nations with nuclear capabilities 
that must ratify it for it to take effect. Russia and China have 
also not yet ratified the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in America's interest,'' Clinton said. ``Why? Because  
have already stopped testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has been held up by that panel's chairman, Sen. Jesse  
Helms, R-N.C., in a separate dispute with the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that four former Joint Chiefs chairmen -- Colin  
Powell, David C. Jones, William J. Crowe and John Shalikashvili -- 
had come out publicly in support of the pact, as has Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had broad praise for chairmen of the Joint Chiefs,  
including the three during his presidency -- Shelton, Shalikashvili 
and Powell. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will come a time in the service of every president -- in  
my time it has come, unfortunately, on several occasions -- when you 
have to have the honest advice of the chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs,'' Clinton said. ``And very often it is the last thing in 
the world you want to hear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Often the advice is ``that you can't achieve the objective you  
want to achieve for the price you're willing to pay or that you 
have to do something that you'd rather to go to the dentist without 
Novocain and do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Suit Against Nation of Islam Tossed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing the Nation of Islam  
of discrimination for barring women from a public speech by leader 
Louis Farrakhan was dismissed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Regina Quinlan ruled that the First Amendment guarantee of  
freedom of religion took priority over anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Freedom of religion and freedom of religious expression, which  
traditionally will exempt a religion from certain discrimination 
laws, is applicable here,'' Quinlan said from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	But Marceline Donaldson, the Cambridge woman who filed the suit,  
claiming her civil rights were violated, said she was not ready to 
give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that you take a case to the court and the  
court errs. It's got my adrenaline going a little bit and we'll be 
back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She sought unspecified damages from Farrakhan, the Nation of  
Islam, and Muhammad. John Rosenberg, her lawyer, said they were 
leaning toward appealing the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, who ran an antiques store at the time, closed early  
to attend the event at Boston's city-owned Strand Theater on March 
10, 1994, only to be turned away at the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Minister Don Muhammad, head of the Nation of Islam mosque in  
Boston and one of the defendants in the case, said he was pleased 
with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the men-only speech on black-on-black violence had  
produced positive results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel vindicated,'' Muhammad said. ``The purpose for the  
meeting is felt in the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said the case was never about the content of the  
message being preached, only that the event was in a public 
building and should have been open to women.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Up Slightly in Late Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were modestly higher on Wall Street today  
as rising bond yields and political uncertainty in Russia kept 
investors from making many new commitments to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 3.17 at 10,717.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators turned mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 1.19 at 1,301.48, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
down 5.17 at 2,542.80. 
</P>
<P>
	With little fresh economic news or corporate mergers to  
stimulate trading on a summer Monday, prices stalled in a narrow 
range. Some Wall Street analysts had anticipated a mild rally 
today, as the Dow is 4.4 percent below its record high, set just 
last month, and the Nasdaq is 11 percent below its record, also set 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the protracted sluggishness of the stock market could  
signal the start of a correction, especially if the Federal Reserve 
follows through on expectations that it will raise interest rates, 
hoping to slow the growth of the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 6.23 percent  
today, the highest level since November 1997. With yields rising, 
bonds are becoming an attractive, less volatile alternative to 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks can no longer count on a strong economy and lower  
interest rates,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells 
Fargo &AMP; Co. ``Rising interest rates will damage economic growth and 
earnings expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin kept world markets slightly off  
balance today after he fired his prime minister and the entire 
Cabinet. It's the fourth time in 17 months he has fired the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	While the broad market sputtered, a flurry of deals and new  
products spurred some gains for computer-related companies. 
Advanced Micro Devices rose 1 13/16 to 19 3/16 after releasing a 
new computer microprocessor that it says can outperform Intel's 
high-end chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco rose 13/16 to 63 1/16 after agreeing to invest $1 billion  
to help accounting and consulting firm KPMG expand onto the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Data General rose 4 to 17 3/16 after agreeing to be acquired by  
EMC Corp., a larger rival in the computer data-storage business. 
EMC fell 3 3/8 to 56 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 527.31 million 
shares, behind Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.27 at 611.31, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.25 at 777.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.68 to 427.36.

<HEADLINE> Starr To End Probe Before 2000 Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years after taking office, Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr promised Monday to wrap up his investigation 
before the 2000 New York Senate election that is being eyed by 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. He said he would deliver his final report 
``at the earliest practicable moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly ... and we  
are doing so,'' Starr told reporters in Atlanta where he addressed 
a lawyers' group, the Institute for Judicial Administration, a 
group affiliated with New York University. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor declined to say whether the president or first  
lady were out of legal trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if he brings no further charges, Starr has gathered  
evidence for a final report that political opponents could use to 
question Mrs. Clinton's credibility during any campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence includes billing records showing the first lady  
did legal work in the 1980s for a savings and loan real estate deal 
that federal regulators concluded was a ``sham.'' Before the 
records appeared, Mrs. Clinton testified she knew almost nothing 
about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also have gathered testimony from former associates  
at her former Arkansas law firm and from her former Whitewater 
partner, the late James McDougal, that could be used to call into 
question various statements she has made to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate television interview, Starr praised an Arkansas  
judge's decision to fine Clinton $90,000 for giving false testimony 
about his intimate relationship with former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was very strong language,'' Starr said of the  
decision by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who ruled 
Clinton had been in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very distinguished judge who looked at the facts and  
came to these conclusions,'' Starr said on NBC's ``Today'' show. 
``And I would just add that the system, did, in fact, work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr made clear in Atlanta that his report, which would be  
turned in to the panel of federal appeals judges who appointed him 
in August 1994, would not draw any conclusions about conduct and 
would simply lay out the evidence gathered by grand juries and his 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress did not want a final report to be an avenue for  
alleging that one or more individuals had engaged in criminal 
conduct,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would anticipate that the final report will come at the  
earliest practicable moment. It would need to be a comprehensive 
final report that is factually straightforward, that does not 
engage in characterization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not give a possible date for the final report. But when  
asked whether he plans to finish before the 2000 election, Starr 
replied, ``The answer is yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's declaration comes after incessant attacks on the length  
and $40 million-plus pricetag of his investigation. The inquiry 
began with the Whitewater allegations about the Clintons' business 
deal in Arkansas but was expanded by federal court to include a 
controversy about FBI files, possible lies by presidential aides in 
the White House travel office firings and the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Starr's investigation is widely unpopular with the  
public, and the prosecutor himself acknowledged recently that the 
perception of his investigation played a role in his decision not 
to try two figures whose first prosecutions ended in mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter, in the NBC interview, Starr said he ``was  
horrified'' when Congress quickly released his report containing 
graphic sexual detail of Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's report on possible impeachable offenses found  
``substantial and credible evidence'' of perjury and obstruction by 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I did enough to warn the Congress, to say ...  
this is sensitive material,'' Starr said. ``But I really did think, 
and I don't mean to criticize Congress, it made its decision and it 
was a broad bipartisan decision that we're simply going to turn 
this information over to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he saw the television interview in which Mrs. Clinton  
early on in the Lewinsky scandal blamed her husband's problems on 
``a vast right-wing conspiracy.'' Starr said that he ``simply took 
it as her sense of loyalty in light of the president denying the 
facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be up to the special appeals court that appointed Starr  
to decide on how much of his final report to make public. 
</P>
<P>
	But some details are known already about what investigators  
found about Mrs. Clinton's role in the 1,000-plus acre Castle 
Grande project south of Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Her law firm billing records pointing to her work on Castle  
Grande were reviewed during the 1992 presidential election by her 
and her law partners Webster Hubbell and Vincent Foster. 
Fingerprints and handwriting of the three people are on the 
records, which vanished after the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994 and 1995, Mrs. Clinton told federal regulators she knew  
almost nothing about Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	When the billing records were found in 1996, Mrs. Clinton said  
she had virtually no recollection of any of the events surrounding 
Castle Grande, which ended up costing the failing S&AMP;L owned by her 
Whitewater partner nearly $4 million.

<HEADLINE> Stevenson Begins Tuneup for US Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Alexandra Stevenson is having a  
blast this summer. The 18-year-old graduated from high school, 
reached the semifinals of Wimbledon and created a buzz about 
herself that she loves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be a young American woman and everyone's paying  
attention to you,'' she said. ``I'm having a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson strolled into the Acura Classic on Monday, set down  
her black Gucci backpack, smoothed out her white cotton slipdress 
with embroidered flowers on the front and looked out at the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to introduce myself,'' she said. ``Hi.''  
</P>
<P>
	She smiled, giggled and handled all questions with the aplomb of  
a well-practiced veteran. Including the ones about Hall of Fame 
basketball player Julius Erving being her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Erving acknowledged Stevenson as his daughter during her  
surprise run to the Wimbledon semifinals. He admitted he has 
supported her financially, although he hasn't seen her since she 
was 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know all you guys have had fun writing about it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said she hasn't spoken to Erving and she doesn't want  
to. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my mom and me and nothing else,'' she said. ``It's just  
not something that I need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's mother, Samantha, stood quietly in the back of the  
interview tent. 
</P>
<P>
	Samantha Stevenson created a stir during Wimbledon when she  
threatened to sue the WTA Tour in a dispute over her daughter's 
prize money. She also said her daughter had been subjected to 
racism at a junior tournament last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's great,'' Stevenson said of her mother.  
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said her father's identity is ``yesterday's news.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe more people recognize me because of the other subject,  
but I think it's mainly because of my tennis,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll be able to prove it Tuesday night when she plays  
26th-ranked Anke Huber of Germany in the first round of the Acura 
Classic, Stevenson's first U.S. tournament since Wimbledon. The 
winner faces top-seeded Lindsay Davenport in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson insists her life hasn't changed since her splash at  
Wimbledon. She still has the same friends and lives in the same 
apartment with her mother in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest difference is that she's recognized more, including  
being spotted at dinner Sunday by ``this average Joe guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man told Stevenson he had never watched women's tennis until  
seeing her at Wimbledon and now he's coming to watch her Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very happy, that made my night,'' she said. ``This is  
good for women's tennis by the way. We need a sponsor so maybe this 
will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, who received a wild card into the main draw, is  
ranked 41st in the world. She's spent most of the year slogging 
through qualifying tournaments, although she was a quarterfinalist 
at a WTA Tour event in Oklahoma City, where she lost in straight 
sets to Venus Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to go out and be tough every match. They're going to be  
gunning for me and I'm going to be gunning for them,'' she said. 
``I have a lot of work ahead of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she isn't worried about being labeled a flash in the  
pan if she doesn't make an impact at the U.S. Open, the year's 
final Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the beginning. I have a lot of years,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She won a bronze medal in tennis at the recent Pan American  
Games in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best part of the Pan Am Games was beach volleyball. I met  
two guys there,'' she said, her glossy red lips curling into a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson said she had a dinner date scheduled Monday night with  
one of the men, Collin Smith of Hermosa Beach, who played for the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm expecting a call from him today, so if the cell phone  
rings I have to answer it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	So she's got the guy. Now if she could just get a new car.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still looking forward to getting a BMW convertible or a  
Volvo convertible,'' she said. ``I have to go test drive those 
after the Open maybe.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Trainer Elliott Walden made all the right  
decisions and Menifee did the rest, roaring down the stretch to win 
the $1 million Haskell Invitation Sunday by a half-length at 
Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden, who is on a roll with victories in the Whitney, Haskell  
and Jim Dandy in the last week, scratched Ecton Park from the 
Haskell Friday and in favor of the Jim Dandy at Saratoga Sunday, 
which he won easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Menifee who went off as the 3-2 favorite, stalked  
Forestry and Cat Thief from the halfway mark. Then Menifee, ridden 
by Pat Day, rushed past his two rivals to win in 1:48.6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great performance,'' said Day. ``This was reminiscent  
of his races in the Derby and the Preakness (both seconds) after 
that disappointment in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been coming around and was even better today,'' added  
Day, who had a choice of riding either Menifee or second place 
finisher Cat Thief. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Cat Thief and Menifee have faced each other five  
times now and Menifee has won them all. The win was Menifee's third 
of the season.

	``He obviously likes this track,'' said Walden referring to the  
sire where Menifee broke his maiden in his first race last summer. 
``It was a good omen coming back to the me track for the first

<HEADLINE> Mets' Reed Placed on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets placed right-hander Rick Reed  
on the 15-day disabled list Monday with a strained ligament of the 
middle finger of his throwing hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed was shut down after being examined by hand specialist Dr.  
Andrew Weiland. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old started Sunday's game against Los Angeles but  
left in the second inning after delivering a pitch. The Mets lost 
14-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing,'' said Reed, who is 10-4 after his  
seven-game winning streak was stopped by the Dodgers. ``I wanted to 
help the team win and now I'm on the shelf for 15 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed has a 4.94 ERA in 21 starts.  
</P>
<P>
	Mets closer John Franco has missed the last five weeks with a  
partially torn tendon on his middle finger. Reed's injury was not 
as serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's was 100 times worse than mine,'' Reed said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mets recalled right-hander Dan Murray from Triple-A Norfolk  
to take Reed's spot on the roster. Murray was 11-7 with a 4.92 ERA 
with Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed first noticed the injury last Monday in Milwaukee. He also  
had a bump that developed on the finger, but it was unrelated to 
his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed will not pick up a ball for 10 days. He'll test the finger  
after the period of rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost Rick Reed, and he has has been a major part of our  
team for the last few years,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. 
``It might just be nature's way of telling Rick Reed he'll be 
rested at the end of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Reed out, Valentine said Masato Yoshii will return to the  
rotation and will start Friday in San Francisco. Yoshii was moved 
to the bullpen because the Mets had six healthy starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sidelined pitcher Bobby Jones made a minor league rehab start  
Saturday and could return from his shoulder injury soon.

	Yeltsin Fires Government Again  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Without explanation, President Boris Yeltsin fired  
his prime minister and Cabinet today for the fourth time in less 
than two years, plunging the country into more political turmoil. 
Yeltsin named a former KGB agent, Vladimir Putin, as his 
hand-picked successor to Sergei Stepashin. But few believe the 
politically inexperienced Putin has any chance of being elected 
president. Although the Constitution bars Yeltsin from a third 
term, the Russian media has speculated that he and his advisers are 
considering the possibility of postponing or canceling elections in 
a bid to extend his tenure. Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov 
predicted that Yeltsin would impose emergency rule as a pretext for 
remaining in office.

	Oil-Dumping Complaint Rejected  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A complaint from independent oil producers  
that accuses four countries of selling oil in the U.S. at 
artificially low prices was rejected by the Commerce Department 
today. The independent oilmen's petition, filed last month by a 
group calling itself Save Domestic Oil Inc., charged that Saudi 
Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Iraq had violated America's 
anti-dumping trade laws and harmed U.S. producers. If the petition 
had been accepted and violations had been found, about 60 percent 
of the oil imported into the country would have been subject to 
steep tariffs.

	White House Hints at Tax Cut Deal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a hint of movement, a White House official  
said today that if Republicans would agree to a $250 billion, 
10-year tax cut for the middle class, the Clinton administration 
would be open to negotiations over the package's details. ``As long 
as we agree on the size, and that it should be targeted to working 
families, we certainly would be willing to compromise with both 
Republican and Democratic members of Congress on its exact 
composition,'' said Gene Sperling, chairman of the White House 
National Economic Council. The comments still leave the White House 
way short of the $792 billion, 10-year measure Republicans pushed 
through Congress last week. Clinton has promised to veto the bill.

	Day-Trading Firms Called Misleading

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Day-trading firms mislead their  
investor-customers with promises of quick riches, fail to supervise 
their operations and make improper loans to customers to keep them 
trading, according to a report released today. The report by the 
North American Securities Administrators Association resulted from 
a 7-month investigation of the growing day-trading industry, which 
is made up of 62 day trading firms operating with 287 offices 
around the country -- catering to roughly 4,000 to 5,000 traders. A 
related analysis found that 70 percent of customers at one major 
day-trading firm lost money.

came to the Rockies on July 31 as part of a trade that sent 
outfielder Darryl Hamilton and relief pitcher Chuck McElroy to the 
Mets. He is in the final year of a multiyear contract that pays him 
$3.75 million this season. The 31-year-old outfielder is hitting 
.224 this season with 14 doubles, one triple, nine homers and 37 
RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Drought Good for Winemakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUEBOGUE, N.Y. (AP) -- While farmers across the Northeast are  
struggling to save their crops from the worsening drought, the 
region's grape growers can't get enough of the hot, dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if it doesn't rain until after harvest -- some six weeks  
away -- winemakers from Virginia to New England could wind up with a 
great 1999 wine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not popping out corks in celebration yet,'' said  
Charles Massoud, owner of Paumanok Vineyard in Aquebogue on Long 
Island. ``If these conditions continue until harvest, we will 
probably be tasting one of our best vintages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vintners list many reasons why hot weather is good for grapes.  
Sunshine produces sugar, and the more sugar as the fruit ripens, 
the better the wine. And heat causes the plant to perspire, forcing 
water to ooze through the plant that contributes to the intensity 
of the fruit flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	Less rain means fewer weeds and -- as Carol Russell of Westport  
Wineries in Westport, Mass., notes -- not having to fight mold and 
mildew as much. That means less spraying of vines, which saves 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	It all adds up: Dry heat equals better wine.  
</P>
<P>
	``The poets refer to it as liquid sunshine,'' said Massoud.  
``Wine is very sensuous. That is exactly what's in the air out 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though winemakers are conscious of the suffering that the  
drought is causing other farmers, they can barely contain their 
enthusiasm long enough to express sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can give everyone else my sincerest apologies, but every  
dog has its day and maybe this is mine,'' said Dr. Wilson Ward, a 
dentist who has produced wine for 23 years at his Fisher Ridge Wine 
Co. near Charleston, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Winemakers cannot help but boast about their grapes compared to  
other brown and shriveled crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fruit is basically picture-perfect. In the 15 years I've  
been here, it's the nicest I've seen it,'' said Robert Matarazzo, 
who owns the Four Seasons Winery in Belvidere, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	California produces 90 percent of American wine, but the  
Northeast has become a more important grape region as wine has 
grown in popularity with Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Every state in the region produces wine of some sort. New  
Hampshire has just one winery that uses only grapes grown in the 
state. Maryland has 11 wineries making wine with their own grapes 
and the state turns out 70,000 to 80,000 gallons a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Upstate New York has long produced wine. On Long Island, the  
first winery opened in 1973, and more than two dozen vineyards now 
dot the island's North and South forks. Among their products: 
Chardonnay, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir. Overall, New 
York State turns out 32 million gallons of wine annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Awards won by some Long Island winemakers prove their wines can  
compete with California. For example, Bon Appetit magazine selected 
Charles Massoud's 1995 Riesling as one of the best wines sampled 
the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	Massoud, 55, first made wine as a hobby in Lebanon and went into  
marketing after coming to the United States in 1960. He and his 
wife Ursula -- who is from a German winemaking family -- planted 
their first vines in 1983 on a former potato farm. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, guests sample his product from crystal glasses in a  
high-ceilinged, wood-paneled tasting room as the music of Vivaldi 
pours from loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's not to like? It's paradise,'' Massoud said, gesturing  
toward the vineyard beyond the picture window. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there could be trouble in paradise.  
</P>
<P>
	Both the crucial ripening season for grapes and the hurricane  
season are just starting, said Kip Bedell of Bedell Cellars in 
Cutchogue on Long Island's North Fork. A hurricane or even a big 
storm could yet mar what looks otherwise like a great year for wine 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The less water during ripening,'' said Bedell, ``the greater  
the quality of the crop.''

<HEADLINE> Powell Pushes Volunteerism Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell told the nation's  
governors Monday that his crusade for youth volunteerism is his top 
priority for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been building too many jails in America,'' said the  
former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. ``It's time to get 
back to the task of building children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, Powell has been courted by several political  
parties in the past as a possible presidential candidate. For the 
last two years, Powell has headed a campaign called ``America's 
Promise: The Alliance for Youth.'' The campaign has contributed 
more than $295 million to 10 million disadvantaged children 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Through various outreach programs, the alliance tries to make  
sure that children have an ongoing relationship with a caring 
adult, a safe learning environment and an opportunity to 
participate in community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The volunteer service should be required, Powell said, despite  
arguments by some that a law mandating such service would be 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, they made me do algebra against my  
will,'' he said. ``I see nothing wrong with service to community 
being part of a high school education curriculum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Powell's trip to St. Louis Monday to address the National  
Governors' Association meant that he missed a ceremony in 
Washington celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of 
his former position as joint chiefs of staff. Six of the 14 men who 
have served as joint chiefs chairmen joined President Clinton at 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell is best known for serving as chairman of the joint chiefs  
during the Gulf War. His brief flirtation with a presidential run 
in 1996 attracted interest across party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to his speech, Powell told The Associated Press he  
wouldn't run for president or vice president in 2000, but he isn't 
ruling out serving in the Cabinet if the next president asks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any president who asked me to consider a job, I would have to  
consider it,'' he said. ``When a president comes to you and says, 
`Would you do this for me? Would you do this for the nation?' you 
have to stop and take it under consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would likely be on a short list for key Cabinet posts if  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush were elected, the governor's associates 
say. Powell served under Bush's father.

<HEADLINE> White House Hints at Tax Cut Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the White House and congressional  
Republicans position themselves for an autumn tax showdown, 
administration officials say they are not necessarily wedded to the 
specific tax cuts they proposed last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	A top White House official said Monday that if Republicans agree  
to a $250 billion, 10-year reduction aimed at the middle class, the 
administration would be willing to negotiate the components. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always understood that once you've agreed on the size  
and principles of the tax cut, you have to compromise with both 
Republican and Democratic members of Congress as to its 
composition,'' Gene Sperling, chairman of the White House National 
Economic Council, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a measure would fall way short of the 10-year, $792 billion  
package the GOP-controlled Congress approved last week and that 
Clinton has promised to veto. Republicans have shown virtually no 
interest in settling for a bill less than one-third that size. 
</P>
<P>
	``It pales in comparison to what a majority of members of  
Congress have voted to put on the president's desk,'' said Pete 
Jeffries, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Sperling's remarks seemed to be the first explicit  
White House suggestion that for the right deal, it may be willing 
to live without its targeted tax cuts for retirement savings, 
long-term health care and other expenses that it has pushed all 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton previously has proposed a tax cut of about $250 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	As administration officials have said all along, Sperling said  
that before discussing tax cuts, the two sides would first have to 
agree on extending Medicare's solvency, providing a prescription 
drug benefit and financing other domestic priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Sunday made conciliatory comments about his  
hopes for a compromise with Republicans this fall over tax cuts and 
spending, saying, ``I am determined to try to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill includes a 1 percent reduction in all income-tax  
rates, an easing of the ``marriage penalty'' tax paid by many 
married couples, a capital gains tax-rate cut, elimination of the 
inheritance tax on large estates, and a slew of tax breaks for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	In an alternative that the Senate rejected, Senate Democrats  
proposed increasing the standard deduction for joint and single 
filers and the itemized deduction for married couples. They did not 
embrace universal savings accounts, federally subsidized retirement 
accounts for individuals that was the core of Clinton's tax-cut 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling said that if Republicans would agree to using $250  
billion in tax cuts for the middle class, ``we can save for another 
day whether you also have a broader, larger tax cut that affects 
well-off Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jacob Lew made a similar point Sunday  
on ``Fox News Sunday,'' saying, ``You know, there's actually a lot 
we agree on in terms of tax policy. ... Let's agree on a tax cut 
for working Americans and let's leave behind the tax cut for the 
most wealthy and special interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling said the GOP package had roughly $250 billion in tax  
breaks for the middle class, which he said should ease the two 
sides' effort to agree on such a package. But those remarks, and 
Lew's, seemed aimed at isolating out that portion of the Republican 
plan and making it harder for them to achieve the rest of their 
proposed reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	By largely partisan roll calls, the House and Senate approved  
the GOP tax package last week. Party leaders won't send the measure 
to the White House until after lawmakers return from their August 
recess for fear that Clinton could veto it and dominate the 
public-relations war in Congress' absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, GOP lawmakers are fanning out in their districts to  
try raising interest in their tax package. Most polls have shown 
that when asked how they would like to use projected budget 
surpluses, most Americans consider tax cuts a low priority.

<HEADLINE> Starr To End Probe Before Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Independent counsel Kenneth Starr said today he  
is moving rapidly to conclude his investigation of President 
Clinton and the first lady and plans to finish before Hillary 
Rodham Clinton would stand for Senate in the 2000 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters after addressing a lawyers' group in  
Atlanta, Starr would not speculate about possible prosecutions of 
either of the Clintons. Nor would he give a possible date for the 
final report on his five-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether he plans to finish before the 2000 election,  
in which Mrs. Clinton is eyeing a Senate bid in New York, Starr 
said, ``The answer is yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly in that  
respect, and we are doing so,'' he said. ``I would anticipate that 
the final report will come at the earliest practicable moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his final report will cover all aspects of his  
investigation including the Clintons' Whitewater real estate 
dealings and the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was impeached by the House last December in connection  
with the Lewinsky case, but acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would need to be a comprehensive final report -- that is  
factually straight forward, that does not engage in 
characterization,'' he said. ``It's clear that the Congress did not 
want a final report to be an avenue for alleging that one or more 
individuals had engaged in criminal conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Starr praised an Arkansas judge's decision  
declaring that Clinton gave false testimony in the Paula Jones 
sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was very strong language,'' Starr said of the  
decision last month by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	While Starr wouldn't call her decision vindication in an  
interview with the NBC ``Today'' show, he did say: ``This is a very 
distinguished judge who looked at the facts and came to these 
conclusions. And I would just add that the system, did, in fact, 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has been investigating Clinton and his wife, Hillary, for  
over five years, and is thought to be winding down the probe. 
Clinton was impeached by the House last December in connection with 
the Monica Lewinsky case, but acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton White House has said that Clinton will pay the  
$90,000 fine levied by Judge Wright. The judge said in the July 29 
ruling she hoped that it might deter others ``who might consider 
emulating the president's misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money, which is in addition to $850,000 awarded Mrs. Jones  
in a settlement of her sexual harassment case, was aimed at 
covering legal costs related the president's denial that he had a 
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NBC interview today, Starr also said he ``was horrified''  
when Congress quickly released his report on Clinton to the public 
and allowed it to be posted on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the report contained many salacious details of  
Clinton's conduct, Starr said, ``Now, I have said and I will say 
again today, I don't think I did enough to warn the Congress, to 
say ... this is sensitive material. But I really did think, and I 
don't mean to criticize Congress, it made its decision and it was a 
broad bipartisan decision that that we're simply going to turn this 
information over to the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he saw the telecast in which Hillary Rodham Clinton  
blamed her husband's problems on ``a vast right-wing conspiracy,'' 
and said that he ``simply took it as her sense of loyalty in light 
of the president denying the facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr refused to comment on whether he might still seek  
Clinton's indictment. ``On that, I'm not going to comment at all,'' 
he said. ``It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting at all 
about the future of the investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Stamps Can Now Be Bought Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now it's postage over the Internet. The Postal  
Service on Monday launched PC Postage, a stamp that can be printed 
through personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it's used by the average consumer mailing holiday cards  
or wedding invitations or a business sending correspondence, the 
system eventually could change the way many people put postage on 
their envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers would go online to one of the companies offering PC  
Postage. With an ordinary laser or inkjet printer, a barcode would 
be printed on each envelope to indicate mail processing information 
and postage payment. For packages, consumers would enter the 
weight, buy the appropriate amount of postage and print it on 
labels to be put on the packages. 
</P>
<P>
	``With PC Postage you can purchase and print postage 24 hours a  
day, seven days a week from the convenience of your home or 
office,'' said Pam Gibert, Postal Service vice president of retail. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellington Wilson, a San Francisco businessman whose Wellington  
E-Group is creating an online shopping mall, provided his own 
testimonial. ``This operation is so slick, so simple, so easy,'' 
said Wilson, who has been using the Stamps.com product as part of a 
pilot program since January. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, E-Stamp Corp. of San Mateo, Calif., began offering  
the computerized postage and Stamps.com of Santa Monica, Calif., 
started pre-registering customers for a limited release of the 
Internet stamps in September. Two other companies -- Neopost Inc. of 
Hayward, Calif., and Pitney Bowes of Stamford, Conn. -- are to begin 
offering the products in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can use those companies' Web sites to purchase and  
print postage for domestic first-class, Priority and Express Mail 
and for parcel post envelopes and packages. 
</P>
<P>
	With each company, the consumer goes to the company's Web site  
to register and download any required software. Some companies 
offer the software free while others require a fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers also will pay handling fees to the companies -- they  
will range from $1.99 to $19.99 a month depending on usage rates, 
according to companies' plans -- along with payment for the postage. 
Purchases can be made either by debit or credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure for usage can also vary. Some companies have  
hardware that can be purchased and used offline to print stamps. 
For others, the postage is downloaded directly off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three years of working on PC Postage, each company  
has had to meet requirements to ensure the security of the system, 
Gibert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with high-tech stamps, the traditional stamp isn't headed  
for extinction, Gibert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see that stamps are going away,'' she said. ``It's  
simply another choice.''

<HEADLINE> British Ranchers See Long Road Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD LE HOPE, England (AP) -- For farmer Ian Frood, the  
global ban on British beef exports due to fears of ``mad cow'' 
disease meant more than a plunge in profits and the forced 
slaughter of his herd of 100 cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year embargo, which ended this month, brought an  
additional hardship -- record-keeping rules that force Frood to 
spend two hours each evening in front of a personal computer, 
updating data on the weight, diet, health, movements and 
reproductive habits of each animal in his new herd. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't have them,'' he says of his three PCs, ``I'd just  
go out and shoot myself. I couldn't cope with the paperwork.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frood's bookkeeping chores multiplied after fears of bovine  
spongiform encephalopathy, the medical name for ``mad cow'' 
disease, led the European Commission to ban exports of British beef 
in March 1996. The commission, which enforces rules for the 
European Union, acted after medical researchers linked the cattle 
disease to a new strain of the fatal human brain ailment, 
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban may be over, but cattle farmers and other members of the  
British beef industry have little reason to celebrate. They say 
exports will take years to recover to their pre-embargo level of 
271,000 tons per year. Some argue that the additional steps they 
now must take to monitor their cattle make it too expensive for 
them to even bother trying to claw back overseas sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Each cow, bull and calf in Britain must now have a ``passport,''  
a barcode and two identification tags -- one attached to each ear. 
Farmers can't sell cattle more than 30 months old, yet smaller 
animals are more expensive to process. 
</P>
<P>
	Meatpackers can no longer sell organs and fat for use in animal  
feeds for domestic use, and slaughterhouses must get a special 
permit to prepare beef for export. 
</P>
<P>
	At present, only one slaughterhouse has such a permit, and last  
week it processed the first carcass of British beef destined for 
overseas markets since the export ban ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet relief at the official lifting of the ban turned to fury  
when the German government said it would not allow imports of 
British beef before the end of September, pending further 
assurances that the meat is safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's outrageous,'' Frood said, a military-style mustache  
quivering on his ruddy face. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's stance is just the latest humiliating setback for an  
industry that long prided itself on a tradition of quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Frood, 51, is the third generation of his family to farm. He's  
an official in the National Farmers Union, holds a PhD in 
agriculture and worked for several years as a nutrition consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	He took up cattle farming in 1978 at a farm called Old Hall, an  
800-acre spread with a 200-year old farmhouse near Stanford le 
Hope, 30 miles east of London. Today his wife Moira, daughter Helen 
and son Andrew all pitch in. 
</P>
<P>
	Frood used to sell many of his animals for export to Italy. The  
ban cut him off from this market, slashing his revenues by a third, 
or $48,000. It also created a glut of beef on the domestic market, 
depressing prices by about 30 percent and causing further strain 
for beef producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Frood's herd of black and white cattle had to be killed and  
incinerated, and he has had to rely ever since on sales of wheat, 
barley and peas for the bulk of his income. 
</P>
<P>
	He also bales hay for other farmers and raises sheep. And Frood  
receives about $160,000 in annual government subsidies, some of 
that a grant for protecting sensitive wetlands on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We 'duck and dive' to make a go of it,'' he said. ``We're not  
a traditional farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frood has survived -- so far -- but the export ban has squeezed  
untold numbers of farmers, cattle markets and slaughterhouses out 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Brassington, a livestock auctioneer, lost his last job when  
the cattle market that employed him closed due to low beef prices 
and the lack of exports. He found work in May at the Colchester 
Cattle Market, an hour's drive northeast of Frood's farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm moving to Canada, I think, if this one goes,'' he said of  
his current job. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaughterhouse owner Joseph Cheale said the export ban cost him  
40 percent of his sales overnight. Cheale Meats Ltd. in Brentwood, 
25 miles east of London, responded by processing only pork. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beef export will never be as it used to,'' Cheale said.  
</P>
<P>
	After the beef ban took effect, Frood bought 90 new breeder cows  
and three stud bulls to provide calves for local sale. But he plans 
to focus on the domestic market and sees only bleak prospects for 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of my colleagues are more optimistic,'' he said, ``but  
that's often from a position of ignorance.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Plan To Avoid Shutdown Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans say they're willing  
to fund the government at current levels for as much as a year 
until a budget agreement with the White House can be worked out, 
but they plan to pressure President Clinton into signing their $792 
billion tax cut package. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, meanwhile, bashed the GOP tax cut in a speech Sunday to  
the nation's governors in St. Louis, saying the proposal would 
automatically trigger billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare, 
veterans and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But he professed optimism that a compromise can be reached. ``I  
am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people are about the 
prospects of our reaching an agreement, and I am determined to try 
to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget talks and tax cuts are linked politically as each  
party strives for support from voters next year, when the 
presidency and House control hinge on the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the government shut down -- twice during the 1995  
budget standoff -- public blame landed squarely on the Republicans, 
and the party is eager to avoid a repetition if current talks 
collapse before the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders made clear they would be willing to continue to fund  
the government at current levels for as long as a year while an 
agreement can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way to avoid a train wreck,'' Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week,'' alluding to a 
possible shutdown. ``There's no need for that sort of thing. And 
it's irresponsible, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., suggested that stopgap spending legislation,  
known as a continuing resolution, could keep the government running 
``for two weeks or a month or for a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House's third-ranking Republican, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,  
has called the such a resolution ``a little trick'' that would put 
Clinton at risk of being blamed for a shutdown if he vetoed it -- as 
Republicans were during the 1995 shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	On tax cuts, meanwhile, voters might have to wait for a break on  
their tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (Clinton) vetoes it, then maybe we'll have to wait for a  
real president that wants to give the American family a tax 
relief,'' DeLay said Saturday on CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; 
Shields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton might reconsider his position on the tax cuts as  
Republicans sell it to voters during the current congressional 
summer break, GOP lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that public opinion is going to come out strong for  
this package as it's better understood and we believe the president 
will respond to that,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, 
said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton believes the GOP cuts, to be paid with a projected $1  
trillion surplus over the next decade, are too large and endanger 
the nation's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
	He told state leaders Sunday at the National Governors'  
Association meeting in St. Louis that the GOP tax cut proposal 
would automatically trigger billions of dollars in spending cuts 
from current programs, including $31.8 billion from Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the looming fight is sensitive for both parties as  
the 2000 elections near, with control of the White House and the 
House at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, DeLay has said, planned to spend next year's $14  
billion annual surplus all along, to force Clinton to pay for his 
spending programs from the Social Security surplus, which both 
parties have promised to protect. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay has made no secret he would relish such a scenario, saying  
post-veto budget negotiations would occur with Clinton ``on his 
knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all GOP leaders were as strident.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he shared that vision of a politically weakened  
president during budget talks, Armey said: ``No, of course not. We 
are all going to be sitting at the table together.''

<HEADLINE> Mustang Ranch Scheduled To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- In every other state, it's vice. In Nevada,  
it's capitalism. So the owner of a brothel just east of the state 
capital is looking forward to the closure of the Mustang Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take over where the Mustang left off, except in  
a classy manner,'' Moonlight Bunnyranch manager Dennis Hof said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mustang Ranch is scheduled to be forfeited -- and  
subsequently closed -- to the federal government today. About 75 
women will be jobless after the feds take the keys. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury last month ordered the brothel be turned over to the  
government following the conviction of former Mustang madam Shirley 
Colletti, who was found guilty of racketeering and conspiring to 
conceal the fact that fugitive Joe Conforte actually owned the 
brothel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hof has interviewed at least 40 Mustang Ranch girls, but has  
hired only four, because ``we don't want any part of that negative 
reputation the Mustang has.'' Still, he hopes to double his stable 
of prostitutes to 50 by fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hof expects the closing of Nevada's best-known brothel to boost  
his business off Route 50 about 15 minutes east of the state 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that the industry will survive only under the  
guidance of business-minded managers. That was the downfall of the 
current owners of the Mustang Ranch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to follow general accounting and business practices.  
If they were operating a Dairy Queen, they wouldn't be in business 
either,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One prostitute at the Moonlight Bunnyranch, who formerly worked  
at the Mustang, said she can't imagine what her former coworkers 
are going to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd probably just go be a waitress somewhere,'' said the  
woman, who gave her name as Jesi. ``I wouldn't go work at any other 
house. Been there and done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regina Winters of Wells, Nev., is a former prostitute and  
brothel manager who has teamed up with a partner in an effort to 
purchase the Mustang. She also worries about what will happen to 
the girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be out on the streets for a lot of them. There's  
going to be problems,'' she said. ``Some might get out of the 
business. And some will go to other houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or they could turn to Edwina Hughes, assistant director of the  
Center Street Mission in Reno. She has offered assistance to any of 
the prostitutes at Mustang Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, she doesn't have any takers, but the response from women  
she's talked to has been positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something we put our stamp of approval on, but we  
want to help them out,'' she said. ``This may cause some of them to 
change their lives. We're not here to judge.''

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia Upgrades Web Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Telecom Italia said Monday it has upgraded  
its Internet access to offer new services such as links to cellular 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade is the first of a series of initiatives aimed at  
boosting business for its TIN.it service, Italy's largest Internet 
service provider with 650,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Tuesday, TIN.it will offer electronic mail that can  
transmit graphics and photographs. In September it will offer 
services linking the Internet to GSM mobile phones, such as voice 
links to e-mail. At the end of the year, TIN.it will begin offering 
free international roaming and directory services. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy lags behind the rest of Europe in getting on-line, in part  
because few Italians own personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the industry are banking on mobile phone-Internet  
technology as Italy's gateway to the Internet age. Italy is 
Europe's largest cellular market with more than 25 million 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet services market has been heating up in Italy with  
key providers Tiscali and Infostrada switching to the free 
subscription model. Infostrada is owned by Germany's Mannesmann.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Judge Attends ABA Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The judge in the government's lawsuit against  
Microsoft Corp. said Monday one of his goals was to avoid the 
``Vietnam morasses'' of previous long-running antitrust cases. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson made an unusual  
appearance with other lawyers in the case at an American Bar 
Association discussion on how to handle complex antitrust trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Jackson on the panel were a lawyer for Microsoft and a  
lawyer for New York, one of the states joining the federal 
government's lawsuit against the computer giant. A Justice 
Department lawyer canceled his plan to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	The case accuses Microsoft of illegally wielding monopoly power  
in the software industry to crush potential rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial ran from last October until June 21. Tuesday is the  
deadline for the sides to give Jackson their written versions of 
the facts of the case, and the judge could issue a ruling late this 
year or early in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't pretend to be an experienced antitrust trial judge,''  
Jackson told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not discuss the merits of the Microsoft case. But he said  
that in planning for the trial, he looked at the handling of the 
government's long-running antitrust case against IBM, which was 
dismissed after many years, as well as the federal lawsuit that led 
to the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intended to try to avoid the Vietnam morasses'' those cases  
became, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said setting ``a firm trial date ... is the be-all and  
end-all of bringing a case to a conclusion. Allowing it to wander 
... virtually guarantees that it is not going to come to fruition 
any time soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said much of the pre-trial scheduling was negotiated by the  
sides in the case, and that limits on the number of witnesses were 
worked out at his suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer John J. Warden said preparing for the case  
``was an incredibly taxing process. It really was a helluva lot of 
work crammed into a very short time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson declined to comment on whether it is a good idea to use  
written testimony during a trial. During the Microsoft case initial 
testimony by witnesses was presented to the judge in written form, 
and the witnesses then were called to the stand for questioning by 
lawyers for each side. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen D. Houck of the New York state attorney general's office  
said the follow-up questioning gave the judge ample time to get a 
feel for the witnesses' credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates' videotaped deposition was shown  
at the trial, but he did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Panelist Bernard Nussbaum, a New York lawyer who was involved in  
a separate antitrust case, said, ``I think it would have been nice 
in Microsoft if Bill Gates took the stand and testified.'' 
Videotaped statements are much less effective than live testimony, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case involving Nussbaum, the government convinced a  
federal judge to halt two separate mergers of prescription drug 
wholesalers. The case was filed in March 1998, went to trial three 
months later before a federal judge in Washington D.C., and a 
ruling was issued that July. 
</P>
<P>
	Nussbaum, the lawyer for one of the wholesalers, said that even  
in complex cases, ``We try to paint a picture, and we try to keep 
it simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson praised the news coverage of the Microsoft trial as  
``extraordinarily good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, he added, ``I would encourage the press corps to pay  
less attention to questions asked by the trial judge and more 
attention to the substance of the testimony.'' He said he asked 
questions to get information, but the media sometimes appeared to 
take his queries as an indication of ``whether I liked the 
witness.''

<HEADLINE> Man Dies After Umbrella Strikes Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BREMEN, Ga. (AP) -- A man died from injuries he suffered when a  
large pool umbrella became dislodged by strong winds and struck him 
in the neck and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben S. Pipes died Sunday night after a storm earlier in the day  
caused the umbrella at the Hampton Inn in this west Georgia city to 
come loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``When officers arrived at the lobby, it appeared he was  
attacked,'' said Lt. Richard Harrison. ``But upon further 
investigation, we determined it to be the umbrella.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he was hit, Pipes, 58, managed to drag himself into the  
hotel's lobby as the umbrella blew about 100 feet across the 
parking lot. He didn't know what had hit him, Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said a satellite blew up on him,'' Harrison said. ``But the  
umbrella coming at him probably looked like a satellite dish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pipes, of Rayville, La., had been retrieving bags from his  
vehicle when the umbrella struck him in the neck and chest at about 
7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Pipes died at Higgins General Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	The hotel declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Boy Attacked by Bear at Scout Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELL LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- A black bear attacked a 14-year-old boy  
at a Boy Scout camp, dragging him into the woods and injuring him 
before his father drove the animal off by pelting him with rocks 
and wood. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Murphy, 14, had bite wounds to his head and shoulder  
area and was in serious condition at a hospital after Monday's 
attack. He is expected to make a full recovery, the family said. 
</P>
<P>
	A search was on for the bear, which will be destroyed if found.  
</P>
<P>
	The boy was attacked at 6:30 a.m. Monday at the Tomahawk Scout  
Reservation on Long Lake in northwestern Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The bear dragged both boy and tent into the woods. The boy's  
father, Anthony Murphy, threw a rock at the bear, which ran off but 
then came after him. 
</P>
<P>
	The father then threw a block of wood at the bear, and it  
climbed part up a tree, allowing the the boy to be rescued from the 
tent. 
</P>
<P>
	Candy wrappers were found in the tent, but officials did not  
know if that was related to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Jonas, the wildlife biologist investigating the attack, said  
the incident was peculiar: ``We normally don't get bears that 
attack people, and certainly not in this manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wildlife wardens on Monday patrolled the camp to protect the 800  
campers, many from Minnesota and Wisconsin. Camp fires were also 
lit for the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp has gotten about 40 calls from concerned parents, but  
no requests to pull children from the camp, said Jeff Sulzbach, 
director for Tomahawk Scout Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bear populations have increased to about 14,000 in Wisconsin,  
from the 5,850 estimated to be in the state in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Shotgun-Wielding Man Goes to Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HICKORY, N.C. (AP) -- A woman who had been shot fled into the  
terminal at Hickory Airport, where she and about two dozen 
passengers and staff members hid behind locked doors until her 
alleged assailant surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Dean Polk, 50, of Burke County was accused of shooting  
Patricia Ellis near the airport entrance Sunday morning and later 
going onto airport property armed with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport workers locked the terminal doors after Ms. Ellis ran  
inside. They took her and several passengers waiting for a US 
Airways flight to a back room. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Polk banged on the airport terminal door before  
officers persuaded him to put the gun down. Police praised terminal 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they hadn't acted quickly to lock the terminal and secure  
the people in it, it could have been a much more serious 
situation,'' Police Sgt. Steve Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. He was being  
held in the Catawba County Jail on $3,500 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Polk and Ms. Ellis were treated and released at Frye  
Regional Medical Center. She was shot in the arm, while he 
apparently had cuts and bruises. The two had a dispute over money, 
police said.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Could Suspend Sotomayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Javier Sotomayor, who tested positive for cocaine  
at the Pan American Games, still hopes to defend his high jump 
title at the World Championships this month. 
</P>
<P>
	But track and field's world governing body said Monday that it  
could ban Sotomayor from the Aug. 20-29 championships in Seville, 
Spain, if Cuban officials don't take any action by then. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sotomayor faces a possible two-year ban, no suspension has  
yet been imposed and his status for the World Championships remains 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am thinking about going,'' he told Cuban reporters over the  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Giorgio Reineri, spokesman for the International Amateur  
Athletic Federation, said it is up to the Cuban track federation to 
hold a hearing with the two-time world champion and world record 
holder and decide whether or not to suspend him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government, meanwhile, raised doubts about tests that  
showed two gold medalist weightlifters -- William Vargas, winner in 
the 136.4-pound weightlifting class, and Rolando Delgado, the 
152-pound class winner -- testing positive for anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has charged Sotomayor's positive test was part of a larger  
campaign to discredit the Communist government -- possibly by the 
CIA or Miami exiles. It has suggested that the track star's food or 
drink may have been laced with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the weightlifters, the National Institute of  
Sports, Physical Education and Recreation said Cuban sports 
authorities will launch an investigation ``aimed at clarifying 
whether this is another dirty trick against our country or if this 
anabolic substance really exists in the bodies of said athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The institute said that Cuban sports doctors never use anabolic  
steroids for athletes. ``In capitalist societies they are commonly 
used in professional sports and are distributed without any 
limitation,'' the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF is waiting to see what action Cuba takes, particularly  
in the case of Sotomayor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't act, if they don't suspend the athlete, the IAAF  
can suspend him,'' Reineri said in a telephone interview from 
Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the IAAF Council, the world federation's decision-making  
body, could suspend Sotomayor at its meeting in Seville next 
Monday. One of the Council members is former Olympic 800-meter 
champion Alberto Juantorena, head of the Cuban athletics 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
	The case gets more complicated if the Cubans hold a hearing and  
decide to clear Sotomayor. In that event, the IAAF could be forced 
to let him compete in Seville pending its own review of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, the IAAF can do nothing in the short term,''  
Reineri said. ``The only thing the IAAF can do is review the case 
later and maybe decide to go to arbitration. That takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, any suspension would be retroactive, meaning that  
Sotomayor would be stripped of any medal he won in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a situation occurred at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics when the  
IAAF allowed Australian sprinter Dean Capobianco and Italian high 
jumper Antonella Bevilacqua to compete after their national 
federations cleared them of doping violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two athletes were later found guilty and suspended by an  
IAAF arbitration panel. Their results from Atlanta, including 
Bevilacqua's fourth-place finish, were wiped off the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very political case,'' Reineri said. ``It's not a  
normal doping case. There are different sensibilities at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday in the Italian sports daily La Gazzetta  
dello Sport, Sotomayor continued to proclaim his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tests can be manipulated,'' he was quoted as saying from  
his home in Havana. ``Do you think I would need to take drugs, to 
dope myself to jump 2.30 meters? In warmups, I was jumping 2.25. 
Anyway, it would be crazy to dope myself at the Pan American 
Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor said he was continuing to train daily and would travel  
to Madrid on Aug. 14 to await word on whether he can compete in 
Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apart from the death of my coach Jose Godoy, the positive test  
is the worst thing that has ever happened to me,'' he said in a 
separate interview in the French daily L'Equipe. ``I have the 
impression that the sky fell on me.''

<HEADLINE> Anderson Plans To Meet With Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson, who  
has been holding out of training camp in a bid for a new contract, 
plans to meet with the Atlanta Falcons on Tuesday at Furman 
University, coach Dan Reeves said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Reeves downplayed the possible meeting, it could signal a  
major break in the holdout that has kept Anderson off the practice 
field since training camp began July 29. The player's agent, Jim 
Sims, who also would attend any meeting, did not immediately return 
a telephone message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he is under contract for this season, Anderson had  
accumulated $60,000 in fines -- $5,000 per day -- as of Monday. The 
running back, who is set to make $2.6 million in the final year of 
his current deal, has been seeking a new five-year contract with a 
signing bonus of at least $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said general manager Harold Richardson received a call  
from Sims asking for a meeting to discuss the impasse. Richardson 
has been handling the bulk of the negotiations, but the final say 
belongs to Reeves, who also holds the title of executive vice 
president of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves stuck by his demand that Anderson begin practicing before  
serious negotiations resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to hear it face to face,'' Reeves said after  
practice. ``I don't know what difference that makes. Visiting 
training camp is not good faith. Coming in here and working and 
living up to a contract, that's good faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Reeves sounded somewhat hopeful that a meeting would  
break the stalemate. Anderson has remained mostly at his Salt Lake 
City home during the holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just sit down and see what happens because you never  
know what will happen when you sit down face to face,'' Anderson 
said. ``Hopefully, something will work out and it will be 
positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was a key figure in the Falcons' Super Bowl season,  
rushing for a franchise-record 1,846 yards while setting an NFL 
mark with 410 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons have offered a $7 million signing bonus and,  
according to Sims, the two sides are at least $1 million apart in 
the guaranteed money of their respective proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves has said the Falcons can't meet Anderson's demands under  
the salary cap because they would be forced to cut back in other 
key areas. Anderson said he simply wants to be paid market value 
for being one of the top running backs in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims has returned from a European vacation but he was not at his  
California office late Monday afternoon. An assistant said he 
couldn't discuss the possibility of a meeting with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta plays its first exhibition game Friday night at the  
Georgia Dome against the Detroit Lions, who are coping with the 
loss of their own star running back since Barry Sanders announced 
his retirement a couple of weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Goes On the Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With Congress in summer recess, President Clinton  
blamed the Senate on Monday for straining the federal judiciary 
``to the breaking point'' with a nomination process that has grown 
``unnecessarily long and grueling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot expect our society to do justice without enough  
judges to handle the rising number of cases in our courts,'' he 
told the 121st annual meeting of the American Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's comments at the Atlanta gathering followed two events  
in Washington, during which he criticized the Senate for dragging 
its feet on a treaty that would ban nuclear weapons tests and took 
a jab at House appropriators for voting to dismantle one of his 
favorite domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive came as Republican who control Congress were in  
their home districts trumpeting a $792 billion tax-cut package. The 
president has promised to veto that package. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Senate's failure to speedily consider judicial  
nominees was thwarting the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst effects of the slowdown are making themselves felt  
across our country,'' he said. ``Exploding civil and criminal court 
dockets affect the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. They 
strain our justice system to the breaking point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five former presidents of the ABA released a letter to Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., during Clinton's appearance, 
urging that the Senate ``act promptly'' to fill the 65 vacant 
judgeships that ``threaten the efficient administration of 
justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton thanked Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch,  
R-Utah, for working with him to break a nomination logjam after the 
1996 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, only 11 of the 61 federal judges Clinton has  
nominated have been confirmed by the Senate, and the slowdown had 
been blamed in part on a standoff between Hatch and the 
administration over thr senator's wish to see former aide Ted 
Stewart appointed to the bench in Utah. Clinton nominated Stewart 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply cannot afford to allow political considerations ...  
to keep justice waiting,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Clinton on Sunday, Hatch said action on judicial  
nominations has proceeded ``in a balanced and thorough manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said more than a dozen judicial nominations were made  
within the last two months. He added that the Judiciary Committee's 
review of many of nominees cannot be started because the panel has 
not received the background material needed to assess their fitness 
for the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three-page letter, Hatch said the Senate's ``solemn  
responsibilities ... require that this committee review thoroughly 
the records of each nominee to ensure that he, or she, is capable 
and qualified to serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton touted the diversity of his nominees, saying that having  
people from different backgrounds on the bench was essential to 
equal justice. He noted that two of his recent nominees would 
represent the first black judges on the Fourth and Ninth federal 
appeals circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``But first them must be confirmed,'' the president said. ``And  
recent experience shows that can be an unecessarily long and 
grueling process that I believe serves neither the judiciary nor 
our national interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would again nominate Bill Lan Lee, the acting  
assistant attorney general for civil rights, for Senate 
confirmation. Lee has faced stiff opposition from GOP senators over 
the issue of affirmation action. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton started the day by urging the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee to hold hearings this fall on the comprehensive test ban 
treaty. The treaty has been signed by 152 nations but has not yet 
been ratified by the United States, Russia or China. 
</P>
<P>
	In a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff at Fort Myer, Va., Clinton said the treaty was in the best 
interests of the United States ``because we have already stopped 
testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the  
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has blocked action on the test 
ban because of a dispute with the administration over arms control 
agreements between the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also spoke at a ceremony for graduates of  
AmeriCorps before heading for the lawyers meeting in Atlanta. 
Clinton said a Republican effort to eliminate funding for the 
volunteer service program demonstrates that Republicans ``know they 
can't pay for their tax cut without big cuts'' in existing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations Committee voted to cut all funds for  
the program in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The domestic 
Peace Corps project has been one of Clinton's proudest 
achievements.

<HEADLINE> Gore Takes Shots at Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Without naming George W. Bush, his leading  
Republican rival for the White House in 2000, Vice President Al 
Gore took shots at the Texas governor Monday at the National Urban 
League's annual conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to close the opportunity gap in this nation,  
we're going to need a lot more than crumbs of compassion,'' Gore 
said, referring to Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' agenda. 
``We need leadership that will stand up and be counted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on the same podium as Bush did the previous night, the  
Democratic presidential hopeful called for a ``common American 
agenda'' ranging from a $1 increase in the minimum wage to 
tightened gun laws to a continuation of affirmative action 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore painted a dim picture of Bush's Texas, citing high dropout  
rates by black students, a tax system biased against the working 
poor and the nation's second-highest percentage of uninsured 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here in Texas, can be we be satisfied when African-Americans  
can be twice as likely to drop out of school?'' Gore said, 
referring to Bush's education policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president called for a 2000 census that corrects the  
omission of millions of blacks and Hispanics in past headcounts, 
urged passage of the Democratic-sponsored patients' bill of rights 
and suggested photo IDs for gun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bush have been stumping for minority votes across the  
nation. Although minorities have traditionally supported Democrats, 
Bush has been able to generate huge support from Hispanics in Texas 
and do better than his GOP predecessors in attracting black voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only rival for the Democratic presidential nomination,  
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, was to address the 4,000 Urban 
League delegates Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also speaking Monday was Jesse Jackson, who sat on a panel along  
with Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson urged Urban League members to focus their search for  
equality on money, not race, saying, ``We need to close the 
resources gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said blacks are essentially ``independent Democrats'' and  
that voters should not look to any of the candidates for 
deliverance from social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every great thing that happened this century happened from us  
up, not from the White House down,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Officially Sets Free Conoco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- DuPont Co. might have decided to get out of the  
oil and gas business, but many of its shareholders have opted to 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont announced Monday that it had accepted about 148 million  
shares tendered in exchange for 436.5 million Conoco Inc. Class B 
shares, or 2.95 Conoco shares for each DuPont share. 
</P>
<P>
	Because its shareholders oversubscribed to the exchange,  
Wilmington, Del.-based DuPont expects to accept only about 41 
percent of the approximately 355.1 million shares offered, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tender offer closed Friday. After the exchange, DuPont said  
it will have about 982 million shares of common stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange of 70 percent of Houston-based Conoco marks the  
final chapter in DuPont's 18-year ownership of the sixth-largest 
oil company. DuPont spun off the other 30 percent last October in 
the largest-ever initial public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most important day in Conoco's 124-year history.  
We are now a large independent, global energy company and a 
formidable competitor around the world,'' Conoco president Archie 
Dunham said Monday.

	ExciteAtHome Stock Drops on Report  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ExciteAtHome shares plunged more than 10 percent  
today following a report that AT&AMP;T Corp. was in talks with America 
Online Inc. to allow it to offer Internet services over the phone 
company's cable network. Such a deal would allow the two companies 
to combine their extensive technical and marketing expertise, while 
at the same time would diminish the role of ExciteAtHome by 
eliminating its exclusive rights to provide high-speed Internet and 
communications services through the AT&AMP;T network. ExciteAtHome 
shares were down 4 9/16 at 38. Reports of the talks appeared in 
today's New York Times.

	Gov't Rejects Oil-Dumping Complaint  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department today rejected a  
complaint alleging that major foreign oil producers violated 
American trade laws and caused economic harm to U.S. producers. The 
department, after a review by its International Trade 
Administration, found that an Oklahoma-based coalition of 
independent oil producers had ``insufficient industry support'' to 
challenge the foreign imports under federal anti-dumping laws. The 
large U.S. oil companies, supported by more than 100 organizations 
and major energy users, had opposed the independent producers' 
petition, claiming that the group did not represent a quarter of 
domestic oil production as required. If violations of anti-dumping 
laws were to be found, about 60 percent of imported oil would be 
subject to steep tariffs.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most health maintenance organizations lost money  
for a second year in a row in 1998, prompting many plans to raise 
premiums and cut benefits. HMOs lost a combined $490 million last 
year, compared to a $768 million loss in 1997, according to a study 
released today by Weiss Ratings, an independent ratings service 
based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Before 1997, the HMO industry was 
profitable. About 56 percent of HMOs lost money last year, down 
slightly from the 57 percent in 1997, the Weiss study found.

than Intel's fastest Pentium III, clocking a speed of 650 megahertz 
compared with 600 megahertz for Intel. Athlon also can outperform 
Intel chips operating at the same speed, AMD says. AMD said 
computer makers IBM and Compaq have committed to using the chip in 
some of their machines. AMD stock was up 1 7/8 to 19 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Testimony Called Too Emotional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Jeannie VanVelkinburgh was paralyzed while trying  
to save an African immigrant who was shot to death at a bus stop, 
and then she was the only witness to say an alleged skinhead took 
part in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Her emotional testimony helped convict the man of murder. But  
that same testimony has given the man a second chance at freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	In hours on the stand this spring, Ms. VanVelkinburgh, 37, cried  
from her wheelchair and screamed at the defendant, Jeremiah Barnum. 
She also belched loudly, threw a reporter's transcript and 
sometimes refused to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing Ms. VanVelkinburgh's behavior, a judge last month threw  
out Barnum's conviction and granted him a new trial on his role in 
the 1997 attack, which killed Oumar Dia and left a bullet in Ms. 
VanVelkinburgh's spine. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ruling that enraged prosecutors, jurors and the NAACP,  
District Judge Edward Simons wrote that Ms. VanVelkinburgh's 
testimony was too emotional and that the trial judge had failed to 
control her to ensure that Barnum got a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh ``exhibited contempt for defense counsel and  
a complete lack of respect for the court system,'' Simons wrote. 
``She was simply out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simons also said the trial judge, who has since retired, failed  
to let Barnum's attorneys adequately cross-examine Ms. 
VanVelkinburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Bill Ritter said he plans to appeal Simons'  
ruling, saying the decision to grant a new trial should be reserved 
for the trial judge. In the meantime, Barnum remains in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh has refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why the judge did this,'' said James Keller, who  
was the jury foreman. ``There's a possibility this guy may go free, 
and that would be a travesty. He should not be back on the 
street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late on Nov. 19, 1997, Barnum, 25, and Nathan Thill, 21, began  
harassing Dia at a dark downtown bus stop, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thill knocked a baseball cap from Dia's head and asked him  
whether he was prepared to die, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh, who called Barnum and Thill ``wannabe men,''  
testified that Barnum put Dia in a headlock and told him he did not 
belong downtown, which was ``white territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh said she walked over to hand Dia his hat,  
heard gunfire and felt a searing pain from the shot that left her 
paralyzed. Dia, a hotel bellhop from Senegal, was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Thill fired the shots. Barnum admitted being at  
the shootings, and Thill backed that up in a videotaped confession. 
Ms. VanVelkinburgh was the only witness to say Barnum helped in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Two witnesses who were near the bus stop did not see Barnum do  
the things Ms. VanVelkinburgh claimed -- they fled when the shooting 
started. Three defense witnesses testified about conversations they 
had with Barnum after the crime in which he admitted to being there 
as a bystander. 
</P>
<P>
	When Barnum's attorney asked Ms. VanVelkinburgh how Thill could  
have shot Dia if Barnum was holding him, she refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the jury convicted Barnum on March 15 of murder and  
attempted murder, which brought a mandatory sentence of life in 
prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller, the jury foreman, said Simons overestimated the effect  
Ms. VanVelkinburgh's behavior on the decision to convict Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime she ranted and raved, it reflected on the prosecution,  
not the defense,'' Keller said. ``She lost it entirely. Her 
language was not acceptable. But there were parts of her testimony 
that could be believed. There were certain things she saw, and we 
saw evidence to back it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sawaya, a Denver representative of the National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Simons 
``leaned too heavily towards a white defendant and did not take 
into account the effect on the black community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors would not say whether Ms. VanVelkinburgh would be  
called as a witness if Barnum is tried again, or whether she would 
be called at Thill's trial this year. He is charged with murder, 
attempted murder and ethnic intimidation.

<HEADLINE> GM Seeks New Trial After $4.9B Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- General Motors has asked a judge for a new  
trial in the product liability case that ended with a record $4.9 
billion judgment against the automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury in July awarded Patricia Anderson, her four children and  
family friend Jo Tigner $107 million in compensatory damages for 
injuries suffered during a 1993 crash with a drunk driver. They 
were also awarded $4.8 billion in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In a motion filed Friday at Los Angeles Superior Court, GM  
argued the jury was not allowed to hear evidence that the driver 
who caused the accident was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker also said trial arguments about GM purportedly  
putting profits ahead of safety ``took over the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motions seek a reversal of the jury award and a retrial. A  
hearing on the matter is scheduled for Aug. 26. GM had already 
asked a judge to overturn the judgment two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts say the judgment is the largest amount ever  
awarded in a defective product case but expected the penalty to be 
appealed or reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorneys argued in trial that the gas tank was  
placed too close to the rear bumper and better designs would have 
placed it over the axle or included a shield. They presented 
evidence showing a GM analysis that found relocating gas tanks 
would be more costly than settling lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's attorneys contended the location of the gas tanks was safe  
and that the drunk driver was responsible for causing the crash.

Clinton accused the GOP-led Senate today of dragging its feet on

Vladimir Putin, as his acting prime minister and said he was

<HEADLINE> Weather Affects Ohio Nuke Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The high temperatures and low water levels in  
Lake Erie have brought two nuclear plants close to having to shut 
down their reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The northern Ohio plants rely on Lake Erie's chilly water to  
cool down the facilities. But the lake has been warm this summer 
and came close to the 85-degree limit that requires the plants to 
stop generating electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	FirstEnergy Corp., which operates the two plants, has asked the  
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to raise the temperature cutoff to 90 
degrees at Davis-Besse plant near Toledo, spokesman Todd Schneider 
said Monday. The Akron-based company also may request that Perry's 
limit be raised to 88 degrees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Engineering studies show we can operate if the water  
temperature is higher than 85 degrees,'' Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRC will decide in the next few weeks whether the  
Davis-Besse plant's cooling systems could function properly with 
the warmer water, said spokesman Jan Strasma. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the last time a nuclear plant came close to passing the  
water temperature limit was four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't happen very often,'' he said. ``Our staff was on  
standby that weekend. We won't do anything to compromise safety but 
we try to keep the plants operating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two plants use Lake Erie water to run their emergency  
cooling systems, which can quickly shut down the plants in an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The lake's temperature near the Perry plant peaked at 84.7  
degrees on July 31, Schneider said. It was 83.7 degrees at 
Davis-Besse that same day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures that day were in the mid-90s along Lake Erie's  
shores. Because the lake is at its lowest point in 30 years, the 
water is warmer than normal, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's several unique circumstances coming together. It's  
usually not that hot and the water level is two to three feet below 
normal,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Touts Texas' Education Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush urged the National Urban  
League Conference Sunday to consider Texas a model for changes that 
can be made on a national level. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential front-runner touted Texas' success  
at improving public education, noting that student test scores in 
the state's public schools have risen across the board, 
``especially (for) African American and Hispanic students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Bush told the 4,000 black community and business leaders and  
activists about the abolition of social promotion of Texas students 
as a step toward ensuring that all students are able to ``access 
the American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen what works in this state. We've raised the bar of  
expectations,'' Bush said. ``We've aligned authority and 
responsibility where it belongs, at the local level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's appearance at the Urban League's annual convention is  
part of his drive to appeal to ethnic minority voters, who have 
historically supported Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance came two weeks after Bush's absence from the  
annual convention of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic 
advocacy group, drew sharp criticism from his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Bush turned down a chance to speak at a meeting of  
minority journalists in Seattle, though he was campaigning in that 
city at the time. He eventually made a brief appearance at that 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day Urban League conference is drawing top candidates  
from the 2000 presidential race. Bush was the first of several 
contestants slated to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for next year's  
Democratic nomination, is due to address the convention Monday. His 
closest Democratic rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, is 
to speak Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, advocating what he called ``the hard work of compassion,''  
told the group that government money should support groups with 
successful social-aid programs -- such as faith-based organizations, 
churches, synagogues and charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had success because they change lives by changing  
hearts, but they don't have the resources they need to continue 
waging the war,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Museum Exhibit for Lenny Bruce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Foul-mouthed, opinionated, too shocking for  
prime time -- Lenny Bruce has been called them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Now an exhibit at the Museum of Television and Radio is honoring  
the comedian as one of the foremost personalities and provocateurs 
of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two Five Letter Words: Lenny Bruce'' features the complete  
collection of the comedian's television appearances. There's his 
vaudeville act on ``Arthur Godfrey and Friends'' in 1949; his 
constitutional rights activism on the Steve Allen show; and his odd 
clowning on Canada's ``Close Up!'' in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``The liberal press wrote that Bruce represented a new approach  
to comedy, but the conservative press wrote him off as a waste of 
time,'' said writer Nat Hentoff, whose interview with Bruce is 
included in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The comic was hounded by authorities for his political and  
social satire and his use of obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to push the rules but he was clearly aware of his  
limits, and that didn't necessarily stop him,'' Robert Batscha, 
president of the museum, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit continues until Oct. 3.

<HEADLINE>  Most Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Monday on  
the back of expectations of a rise in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the key  
index rose after four straight sessions of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed  
106.21 points, or 0.62 percent, to close at 17,190.45. On Friday, 
the average closed down 273.95 points, or 1.58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei rebounded as the dollar rose back above 115 yen.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 115.16 yen, up 0.88 yen from late  
Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 114.73 
yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen is good news for exporters because when the  
Japanese currency rises, they face the tough choice of either 
raising prices abroad or accepting less in terms of yen when export 
revenues are brought back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the Tokyo market were comments by Japan's  
Economic Planning Agency chief, Taichi Sakaiya, who suggested over 
the weekend that a planned second supplementary budget for the 
current fiscal year should be close to 10 trillion yen ($8.7 
million). 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks tumbled on expectations of a rise in U.S.  
interest rates following last week's release of strong U.S. 
employment data. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator  
of blue chips, fell 221.59 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 
12,945.47. On Friday, the index lost 87.28 points, or 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said prices fell after strong U.S. employment data out  
on Friday raised new fears that the United States will raise 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares also plummeted despite an interest rate cut by  
the central bank on selling by foreign investors ahead of Sept. 1 
when they will be allowed to repatriate funds by paying less tax or 
without paying anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investment brought in before Sept. 1, 1998, the date the  
Malaysian government imposed capital controls, can be repatriated 
next month without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks  
100 blue-chip stocks, fell 34.88 points, or 4.9 percent, to 668.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower in line with weaker  
regional markets after Friday's fall on Wall Street. The main 
Composite Index fell 2.3 percent, or 13.726 points, to 594.109. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks were dragged lower by the peso's  
plunge to a five-month low against the dollar and a growing 
conviction that U.S. interest rates will soon rise. The 30-share 
Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 43.34 points, or 1.9 percent, 
to 2,255.30. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower amid uncertainty about the  
island's relations with China. The market's key Weighted Stock 
Price Index fell 21.73 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,028.01. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed flat for the second  
straight session. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index edged up 0.75 
point to 2,189.80. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower on a weaker futures  
market and market expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise 
later this month. The All Ordinaries Index at 2,976.9, down 30.1 
points, or 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher on expectations that creditor  
banks of the Daewoo Group are about to finalize a restructuring 
plan for the financially troubled conglomerate. The Korea Composite 
Stock Price Index rose 10.71 points, or 1.1 percent, to 948.97. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower. The Stock Exchange of

<HEADLINE> Geena Davis Aims for 2000 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Geena Davis is used to shooting for major roles in Hollywood.  
Now she's aiming for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscar-winning actress has qualified for the United States  
archery Olympic trials semifinals Aug. 22-24 in Bloomfield, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	What is most surprising about Davis' success is that the first  
time the 42-year-old picked up a bow and arrow was only two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	She watched the 1996 Olympics and became interested in the sport  
after 21-year-old Justin Huish won two gold medals. So she asked 
her manager to get a qualified teacher so she could learn the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to get someone good and she got the best. She got  
Justin,'' Davis said Monday in a phone interview from Los Angeles. 
``We met a couple of times, I went over to his home met his parents 
and he recommended me to Don Rabska.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis began competing in tournaments about six months later and  
was a natural. And through all the competitions, somehow she has 
managed to keep her other career a secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently.  
</P>
<P>
	``My family and friends knew I was doing it all along,'' Davis  
said. ``But I've been fortunate that we've managed to keep it out 
of the public knowledge. I'm so grateful that the archers kept it 
private so I was able to concentrate on improving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Davis wasn't able to keep her hobby private any longer after  
finishing 29th out of 300 women in the national championships last 
month in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 32 competitors advanced to the semifinals and that  
number will be trimmed to eight later this month. Only three women 
and one alternate will qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty pleased with how far I've come,'' Davis said.  
``I've been fortunate to discover in my adult life that I have a 
fair amount of athletic ability. As I child, I was uncoordinated 
and shy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if she makes the team and travels to Australia, which she  
admits may be a little far-fetched, archery won't be taking the 
place of making movies anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the best supporting actress award for the 1988 movie  
``The Accidental Tourist'' and her other credits include the 
baseball film ``A League of Their Own'' and ``Beetlejuice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis recently filmed a movie called ``Stuart Little,'' based on  
a children's book, which will be released around December. She was 
even given a target next to the stage in order to get in practice 
during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	But these days she is practicing about six hours a day in a  
private yard in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting because you get the adrenaline going and  
wonder if you can control the nerves,'' Davis added. ``But the way 
I'm approaching this is that I've already won. I had no idea that 
I'd be this good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with her success story, don't expect a movie about it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I already did a baseball movie,'' she said. ``But I don't  
think there's a huge demand for archery in Hollywood.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Starr Both Stop in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth  
Starr both stopped in Atlanta to meet with lawyers on Monday, but 
they didn't even come close to crossing paths. 
</P>
<P>
	The president gave the main address at the American Bar  
Association's annual meeting, getting a warm reception from 1,700 
lawyers as he asked members to pressure the Senate to speed up the 
confirmation of federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
	About eight hours earlier Monday and several blocks away, Starr  
addressed a different lawyers' group and told reporters he plans to 
wrap up his Whitewater investigation before the 2000 New York 
Senate election in which Hillary Clinton is a likely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to move forward very, very rapidly,'' Starr  
said. He gave his annual review of Supreme Court decisions to 
members of the Institute for Judicial Administration, a group 
affiliated with New York University that promotes judicial 
education and research and predictability in the law's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, speaking to his fellow lawyers at the ABA, was careful  
to note that Hillary Clinton once chaired the group's Commission on 
Women in the Legal Profession as well as the Legal Services Corp., 
a federally funded program providing legal aid to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	ABA President Phil Anderson is an old friend of Clinton's from  
Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I'm here is that I got beat for governor in 1980  
and I was the youngest former governor in the history of America,'' 
Clinton said. ``I had extremely limited career prospects and Phil 
Anderson was the only guy in Arkansas that offered me a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's either a great prognosticator or a good gambler,''  
Clinton added. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanying the president were Attorney General Janet Reno,  
outgoing White House counsel Charles Ruff and Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the guests introduced from the audience was baseball great  
Hank Aaron, whose name drew shouts and applause.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Appears at WWF Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura ducked out of  
the National Governors' Association convention Monday to return to 
his roots ---- pro wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	The former wrestling star flew from St. Louis, the site of the  
governors' gathering, to Chicago to put in an appearance at a 
televised World Wrestling Federation event to promote his 
appearance later this month as a guest referee at a WWF title 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have called on Jesse Ventura 'cause I'm the only one to  
deliver law and order,'' said Ventura, who will referee the Aug. 22 
match between federation champion Stone Cold Steve Austin and 
Triple H in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Austin and Triple H, Ventura had to break up the  
two wrestlers in what appeared to be a well-rehearsed exercise. The 
crowd shouted, ``Jesse, Jesse, Jesse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What this is is politics,'' Ventura said, referring to the  
pre-match scuffle between the two wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs in the crowd of more than 20,000 included those reading  
``Ventura for Prez'' and ``The People's Governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Lawrence, a heavy equipment operator from Chicago, said he  
went especially to see Ventura. ``He was great as a wrestler,'' 
said Lawrence, 41, who looked like a wrestler himself.

	High pressure lingered over the western Great Lakes early today  
while a cold front was expected to continue its push eastward and 
off the northern Atlantic Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The high pressure was expected to bring clear, dry conditions to  
much of the Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes states.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Plans To Meet With Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- All-Pro running back Jamal Anderson, who  
has been holding out of training camp in a bid for a new contract 
from the Atlanta Falcons, was expected to meet Tuesday or Wednesday 
at Furman University with coach Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	While Reeves downplayed the meeting, it could signal a major  
break in the holdout that has kept Anderson off the practice field 
since training camp began July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Jamal, `If they want to see you, you should go,'''  
Anderson's agent, Jim Sims, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
``He's not going to go to practice. If we don't get a deal done, or 
don't see they're committed, we'll turn around and leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves expected the meeting to take place Tuesday, but learned  
Sims may not be able to make it from Oakland, Calif. until 
Wednesday. Anderson arrived in Atlanta on Monday and could be at 
the camp Tuesday without his agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he is under contract for this season, Anderson had  
accumulated $60,000 in fines -- $5,000 per day -- as of Monday. The 
running back, who is set to make $2.6 million in the final year of 
his current deal, has been seeking a new five-year contract with a 
signing bonus of at least $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said general manager Harold Richardson received a call  
from Sims asking for a meeting to discuss the impasse. Richardson 
has been handling the bulk of the negotiations, but the final say 
belongs to Reeves, who also holds the title of executive vice 
president of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves stuck by his demand that Anderson begin practicing before  
serious negotiations resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to hear it face to face,'' Reeves said after  
Monday's practice. ``I don't know what difference that makes. 
Visiting training camp is not good faith. Coming in here and 
working and living up to a contract, that's good faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Reeves sounded somewhat hopeful that a meeting would  
break the stalemate. Anderson has remained mostly at his Salt Lake 
City home during the holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just sit down and see what happens because you never  
know what will happen when you sit down face to face,'' Anderson 
said. ``Hopefully, something will work out and it will be 
positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was a key figure in the Falcons' Super Bowl season,  
rushing for a franchise-record 1,846 yards while setting an NFL 
mark with 410 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have basically agreed on a five-year contract  
worth $28 to $30 million. The Falcons have offered a $7 million 
signing bonus and, according to Sims, the two sides are at least $1 
million apart in the guaranteed money of their respective 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves has said the Falcons can't meet Anderson's demands under  
the salary cap because they would be forced to cut back in other 
key areas. Anderson said he simply wants to be paid market value 
for being one of the top running backs in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Sims cut short a European vacation to meet with the Falcons.  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta plays its first exhibition game Friday night at the  
Georgia Dome against the Detroit Lions, who are coping with the 
loss of their own star running back. Barry Sanders announced his 
retirement a couple of weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> US Airways To Change Benefits Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- US Airways is planning to offer benefits to  
employees' domestic partners in addition to husbands and wives, the 
airline said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline is the third major carrier to announce such a policy  
within the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines announced it would extend benefits to domestic  
partners July 30. American Airlines followed suit on Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``The airlines have been looking at domestic partner benefits  
for a long time, said Kim Mills, education director for the Human 
Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay and lesbian political 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways is headquartered in the Washington suburb of  
Arlington, Va. It announced its intentions to employees in a memo 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be providing benefits to domestic partners of  
employees consistent with the company's overall philosophy of 
maintaining parity, it said. ``Senior Vice President of Human 
Resources Michelle Bryan will meet with labor leaders and 
representatives of non-union employee groups to discuss details and 
timing of the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills said about 2,800 U.S. employers extend benefits to  
domestic partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based United, the nation's largest airline, had been  
ordered by a federal judge in San Francisco to provide ``soft 
benefits'' such as travel privileges, bereavement leave and medical 
leave to both same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after an appeals court upheld that ruling, United  
announced it would offer all benefits, including health insurance, 
to domestic partners of employees and retirees nationwide beginning 
next May.

<HEADLINE> GOP Targets Defector Rep. Forbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- How much do Republicans want to unseat  
party-swapping Rep. Michael Forbes in 2000? Badly enough to take 
the unusual step of setting up a special fund in New York just to 
raise money to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, are lending their newest member a hand.  
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt has asked members of his 
Democratic caucus to ``make the maximum contribution possible'' to 
Forbes' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael's district is extremely competitive and this will be  
his toughest campaign ever,'' Gephardt wrote in a fund-raising 
letter to Democratic House members last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have a responsibility to help him with a smooth  
political transition,'' Gephardt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel, a Harlem Democrat and dean of the New York  
delegation, sent out a similar letter on Forbes' behalf. Forbes had 
$224,241 cash on hand at the end of June, according to the most 
recent federal campaign filing. He expects to need upward of $1 
million to be competitive in what is sure to be a bruising race 
that may be complicated by a Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who voted for the GOP's Contract with America and  
opposes abortion, swapped parties in July, blaming Republican 
``extremists'' running the House of Representatives. The move 
provided Democrats with a psychological boost and cut the number of 
seats they need to regain the majority in the House to five. 
</P>
<P>
	But the desertion outraged Republicans, who have vowed to make  
Forbes' defeat a top priority. His district on the eastern tip of 
Long Island is heavily Republican but is home to a large number of 
independents as well. Voters there supported Bill Clinton for 
president in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources with the National Republican Congressional Committee  
said that in the coming weeks a special fund would be set up in New 
York to gather several hundred thousand dollars for whomever 
emerges as the Republican candidate. NRCC Chairman Rep. Tom Davis, 
of Virginia, is expected to send out a fund raising letter in the 
coming weeks asking for donations to beat Forbes.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- From the time Al Lerner was named their new  
owner last September, the Cleveland Browns had just 11 months to 
get ready to play the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's fans have had three years to prepare.  
</P>
<P>
	And at a little after 8 p.m. tonight when they take the field at  
Fawcett Stadium to face the Cowboys in the Hall of Fame Game, the 
new Browns will be welcomed back by a city, the NFL and a national 
TV audience like a long lost relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns fans, who cried when their team was swept out of town by  
Art Modell in 1996, will finally be able to reconnect with 
Cleveland's glorious football past. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the bridge between the old Browns and the new Browns  
will be complete. Old memories will make room for new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know when I take the field, and see the fans and the  
Cowboys,'' said Browns rookie quarterback Tim Couch. ``Then I'll 
know I'm in an NFL game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So will the Browns, who after a three-year exile are being  
reborn in football's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Never has an exhibition game meant so much, and more than 17,000  
fans turned out for Sunday's walk-throughs for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In exhibition games on Saturday, Denver defeated San Diego 20-17  
in Sydney, Australia; Chicago beat Indianapolis 9-6; and the 
Raiders edged St. Louis 18-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's comeback isn't just for Browns fans, either. It's  
for every fan who had his favorite team moved whether in Baltimore, 
New York, St. Louis or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue talked with  
Cleveland's players about the hurt he felt as a child when the 
Brooklyn Dodgers moved out West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could relate to that, too,'' said Browns coach Chris Palmer,  
who felt similarly betrayed when the New York Giants went to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	But after wiping away their tears when Modell abandoned them,  
Cleveland fans fought back and convinced the NFL to bring a team 
back in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says a lot about Clevelanders,'' Browns linebacker Chris  
Spielman said. ``It says a lot for the NFL to bring a team back so 
quickly, and it says a lot for Mr. Lerner to put up a half-billion 
($530 million) dollars. There's a special relationship between the 
fans and the team here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Hall of Fame Game was moved from its traditional  
Saturday slot to Monday in prime time by the league to showcase the 
Browns' return as the first expansion team with a history. 
</P>
<P>
	The game will cap an unforgettable football weekend in northeast  
Ohio. Saturday, former Browns tight end Ozzie Newsome was enshrined 
in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to go down there and be able to play as a local team in  
that whole setting, coming back new ...,'' said Palmer, making his 
debut as an NFL head coach. ``I won't be the only one with 
butterflies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even America's Team is caught up in the excitement.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a hard time thinking the Cleveland Browns are new,''  
said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who became familiar with the Browns 
and their tradition while an assistant coach in Pittsburgh. ``That 
doesn't sound right. It seems like there ought to be some special 
name or exotic name for an expansion team. I'm struggling with them 
being a new team. They've got the same fans, I know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's new football era will begin the Tim Couch Era with  
the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	The rookie quarterback, taken No. 1 overall by the Browns in  
April's NFL draft, will make his pro debut midway through the first 
quarter. He'll replace Ty Detmer, who will run the Browns this 
season until Palmer and his staff think Couch is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch outwardly doesn't appear to be nervous.  
</P>
<P>
	``I played in the SEC and we played in the big game week in and  
week out,'' he said. ``I'll probably forget it's on TV once we get 
out there and start playing football again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer has had just seven months to put together a staff,  
assemble a team and have it ready by Monday. It's too early to 
worry about final scores yet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning takes care of itself,'' he said. ``All I'm looking for  
is improvement with my players, that we're getting better from week 
to week.'' 
</P>

</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots 	
</P>
<P>
	Tests confirmed New England linebacker Ted Johnson suffered a  
ruptured left biceps tendon in Saturday's scrimmage and is expected 
to miss four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots coach Pete Carroll said he will wait until after  
surgery to determine if Johnson would be placed on injured reserve, 
which would shelve the linebacker for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings will reportedly cut their ties with Dimitrius  
Underwood, the defensive lineman who left training camp after one 
practice and has not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Team attorneys informed Underwood's agent, Craig Domann, that  
the team doesn't want him back, according to a report in the Saint 
Paul Pioneer Press. The newspaper said the Vikings haven't decided 
how to part ways with the rookie, but most likely will place him on 
waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood signed a $5.3 million, six-year contract shortly  
before joining the Vikings at training camp. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles

<P>
	Eagles tight end Kaseem Sinceno is expected to be out for the  
next six weeks following ankle surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinceno, 23, underwent arthroscopic ankle surgery and had a  
stress fracture in his right foot repaired Friday at a Philadelphia 
hospital, team officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-year pro out of Syracuse played in 10 games last  
season, catching three passes for 42 yards and one touchdown. An 
ankle injury in the 12th game of the season ended his year. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Seahawks    	
</P>
<P>
	Jon Kitna threw for 236 yards and four touchdowns during a  
scrimmage Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like a game,'' said tight end Christian Fauria, who  
caught three passes for 55 yards. ``We ran out here all fired up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna completed 17 of 23 passes without an interception.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Visits Brooklyn Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton brought her summer  
listening tour in her campaign for the U.S. Senate to New York City 
today, visiting a Baptist church in a Brooklyn neighborhood where 
crime, unemployment and health care are key concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady arrived late this morning at the Concord Baptist  
Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant hours after several hundred residents 
started lining up outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooklyn stop was the first of two listening tours planned  
in the city. Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to hold another session at 
a union center in Queens on Tuesday morning. She began holding the 
invitation-only events in various cities throughout the state in 
July. This was the tour's first stop in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	As they stood in line waiting to claim their seat, participants  
said they wanted to talk to Mrs. Clinton, the likely Democratic 
candidate for retiring U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's seat, 
about lack of health care programs and unemployment in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Parsons Plow said crime was also an issue, saying: ``They  
still shoot 'em up here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's recent comments in Talk magazine about her  
husband's past infidelities were not a top priority for some in 
attendance, like Sharon Burwell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so many people have sinned,'' Ms. Burwell said. ``We  
all have sinned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burwell said she was less concerned with talk about  
President Clinton's private problems than the social problems 
weighing on her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has different economic possibilities and some people  
can't afford health care -- that's a social sin,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Boggs Caps Amazing Stretch in MLB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- A crystal ball would have ruined the  
moment for Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't want to know what it would be like to get his 3,000th  
hit, and wouldn't have believed it if anybody had told him he'd 
reach the milestone with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I just have a flair for the dramatic,'' Boggs said  
Sunday, reflecting on realizing a lifelong dream just 20 miles from 
where he grew up and played Little League ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire began a remarkable three days of baseball history  
Thursday night in St. Louis by becoming only the 16th player to hit 
500 career home runs. McGwire, who set the single-season mark of 70 
last year, added No. 501 later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night, Tony Gwynn, who broke into the major leagues three  
months after Boggs, got his 3,000th hit, lining a single in the 
first inning in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Saturday and Boggs, a classic contact hitter who  
became the first player to get to 3,000 on a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three milestones in three nights, that's pretty amazing,''  
Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before McGwire, Gwynn and Boggs, the closest two hitters have  
reached such milestones was in 1970 when Ernie Banks slugged his 
500th home run on May 12 and Hank Aaron got his 3,000th hit five 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, Eddie Collins got his 3,000th hit 17 days after Tris  
Speaker passed the milestone, until now the closest two players had 
reached that plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken could become the third player to reach 3,000 this  
season. The Baltimore star, currently on the disabled list, needs 
32 hits to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of people got caught up in the moment as Boggs stood in  
for the big at-bat. While the fans gave him a huge ovation, the 
public address announcer forgot to call the five-time AL batting 
champion's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all stood up and started cheering. I didn't know what to  
do,'' Boggs said of what was going through his mind walking up to 
the plate for the first time after singling for No. 2,999. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `This isn't the hit.' I thought they miscounted or  
something. They were going nuts. Then the realization set in that 
this is the moment I've waited for and all I need is one more hit. 
I don't need eight. I don't need 11. I don't need 15. I need one 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs, who also hit the first homer in Devil Rays history last  
year, hit a 2-2 pitch from Cleveland's Chris Haney and capped an 
emotional trip around the bases by getting down on his knees and 
kissing home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	His 12-year-old son Brett, whose godfather is fellow 3,000-hit  
club member George Brett, was the Devil Rays' batboy. His father, 
Win, and wife, Debbie, joined them on the field for the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was priceless for me to turn around and see my father's  
expression. That's something that I'll take with me the rest of my 
life,'' Boggs said. ``My dad made me the hitter that I am. ... He's 
been very instrumental in me reaching 3,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, just as McGwire added homer No. 501 before his game ended,  
Gwynn used his 3,000th hit as the beginning of another multi-hit 
contest. The San Diego right fielder collected four hits and left 
the game in the eighth inning with a career total of 3,003. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's big home run came against the Padres. And before Gwynn  
left St. Louis, McGwire made sure to collect a souvenir for his 
son, Matt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Gwynn and I swapped jerseys,'' he said. ``I don't get  
anything for myself. I do everything for Matt. So I had him sign 
it, `To Matt.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs' first thought after hitting the home run was that he'd  
never get the ball from the fan who caught it in the stands. But 
Mike Hogan, 32, of Tampa, didn't want to keep the slice of history. 
</P>
<P>
	``All he wanted was a picture, and I wound up giving him a  
jersey and a bat,'' Boggs said. ``He's the most gracious human 
being on the planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hogan, attending only his second Devil Rays game: ``To me,  
it's a baseball. To him, it's one of the highlights of his 
career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A career that Boggs, 41, doesn't want to end any time soon. He's  
hitting .299 and said he hasn't thought a lot about how much longer 
he'd like to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays hold an option on his contract for 2000, but  
haven't talked to him about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said 3,000 hits is not a termination point in my  
career. You're going to have to rip the shirt off of me. If I'm 
hitting .300 and still performing, and the game's still fun, I'll 
continue to play if they'll have me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs went home Saturday night to celebrate the milestone with  
50 to 60 close friends and family members. Tampa mayor Dick Greco, 
a neighbor, showed up at 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had tickets for (Sunday),'' Boggs said. ``I said: `Sorry,  
mayor. I did it last night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs walked into the clubhouse seven hours later, carrying a  
bat and a new pair of shoes to replace the ones he used on the most 
memorable night of an 18-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs, a superstitious person who joked that he may now change a  
well-known pregame routine that includes a meal with chicken, had 
worried that an injury or accident might prevent him from reaching 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He kept thinking about Roberto Clemente, who reached the  
milestone on the last day of the 1972 season and died in a plane 
crash that winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs got hit No. 3,001 on Sunday, doubling in his only at-bat,  
to move ahead of Clemente on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hit the pinnacle of where all great hitters try to go. Now  
it's just a number,'' he said. ``I want to put it behind me, leave 
it in the dust and continue to perform at a level I can leave it a 
long way back.''

<HEADLINE> NiSource Extends Tender Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERRILLVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- NiSource Inc. has extended its $5.7  
billion hostile takeover offer for Columbia Energy Group until Oct. 
15 after having received tender offers for more than 60 percent of 
Columbia's outstanding common shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's board has rejected the $68-a-share offer as  
inadequate, saying the company is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource chairman Gary Neale said today that the strong response  
to the offer is proof Columbia shareholders want the merger to 
proceed despite the board's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've sent a resounding message: They want the board to  
fulfill its fiduciary obligations and meet with us to discuss our 
offer,'' Neale said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NiSource is committed to acquiring Columbia and is  
willing to increase its offer price if Columbia's board negotiates 
a friendly takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	A Columbia spokesman said the tender offer results were not  
``particularly significant or surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``NiSource itself has stated that the tender offer is  
non-binding and poses no cost or risk for shareholders, and many 
shareholders who told us they would tender their shares also said 
they do not believe $68 per share is adequate compensation for 
their investment in Columbia,'' said Columbia spokesman R.A. Rankin 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrillville-based NiSource, the parent company of Northern  
Indiana Public Service Co. and Bay State Gas Co. in Massachusetts, 
would become one of the nation's biggest natural gas companies if 
it succeeded in the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	NiSource began the unsolicited buyout offer after Columbia  
officials refused to schedule merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Energy, based in Herndon, Va., had 1998 revenues of  
nearly $6.6 billion. It is involved in natural gas exploration, 
production, transmission, storage and distribution as well as 
propane sales and electric power generation, sales and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of NiSource were down 25 cents to $25.43 3/4, while shares  
of Columbia were trading unchanged at $60.25 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Burrell, Eschmeyer Sign With Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Scott Burrell filled New Jersey's  
need at small forward Monday, signing a one-year, $1 million 
contract to stay with the Nets for a second season. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also signed rookie center Evan Eschmeyer to a multiyear  
contact. He will earn about $350,000 next season, the minimum for a 
second-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell played in 32 games last season, averaging 6.6 points and  
3.7 rebounds. He scored in double figures eight times, getting a 
season-high 18 points against Seattle on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, who has averaged 7.1 points over his six-year career,  
had surgery on his right knee on April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Eschmeyer was the 34th pick in the draft and the Nets' only  
choice. He averaged 19.6 points and 10.1 rebounds last season at 
Northwestern.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Darkened theaters turned into mass seances as  
the summer's latest fright film, the tale of a boy who talks with 
the dead, debuted at No. 1 in North American theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The psychological thriller ``The Sixth Sense'' starring Bruce  
Willis and Toni Collette took in $25.8 million, according to 
industry estimates released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-budget horror hit ``The Blair Witch Project'' stayed in  
second place with $24.5 million. Last week's top movie, the Julia 
Roberts-Richard Gere comedy ``Runaway Bride,'' fell to third with 
$21 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' a Pierce Brosnan-Rene Russo remake  
of the Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway crime caper, opened at No. 4 with 
$14.6 million. The superhero comic-book spoof ``Mystery Men'' 
premiered in sixth place with $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iron Giant,'' an animated film about a robot who falls to  
Earth, took in $5.7 million to debut at No. 9. ``Dick,'' a satiric 
retelling of the Watergate scandal through the antics of President 
Nixon's teen-age dog-walkers and secret advisers, came in a 
disappointing 11th with $2.2 million in its first weekend, for a 
total of $3.4 million since opening Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a low-key ad campaign, ``The Sixth Sense'' managed to  
rise above a crowd of new releases, said Paul Dergarabedian, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks box office 
ticket sales. The movie ads used hushes and whispers to intrigue 
filmgoers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say when you whisper, it gets people to listen. They did  
listen in this case,'' Dergarabedian said. ``People are just hungry 
for horror movies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with four other major new releases, ``The Sixth Sense''  
had to contend with ``Runaway Bride'' and ``Blair Witch,'' which 
earned a combined $64.3 million last weekend. ``Runaway Bride'' has 
taken in $74.1 million in 10 days, while ``Blair Witch'' has 
grossed $80.2 million, most of it since going into wide release 10 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in the face of blockbusters like that, we were able to  
work through the clutter,'' said Chuck Viane, head of distribution 
for Disney, which released ``The Sixth Sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sixth Sense'' was the highest-grossing movie ever to open  
in August, surpassing ``The Fugitive,'' which took in $23.7 million 
in 1993. It was Willis' second-best opening ever, behind 
``Armageddon,'' which grossed $36 million in its debut last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in 2,161 theaters, the movie averaged $11,939 a screen.  
``Blair Witch,'' which did a stratospheric $26,528 a screen when it 
hit wide release last weekend, averaged $11,438 in 2,142 theaters 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan Entertainment, distributor of ``Blair Witch,'' and its  
filmmakers spent just $350,000 producing the movie. Artisan expects 
it to top $100 million at the box office by next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If 'Sixth Sense' wasn't out this weekend, we clearly would  
have been No. 1,'' said Steve Rothenberg, Artisan executive vice 
president of domestic distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' finally dropped  
out of the top 10 after 11 weeks. The movie came in at No. 12 with 
$2.2 million, for a domestic total of $412.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $25.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Blair Witch Project,'' $24.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Carpentier Withdraws From Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Patrick Carpentier will miss this weekend's CART  
race after further tests Monday revealed he sustained a small 
vertebra fracture in Sunday's crash in the Grand Prix of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injury will not require surgical care and Patrick will be  
convalescing and starting rehabilitation in Indianapolis,'' said 
Dr. Terry Trammell, CART's chief orthopedic consultant who examined 
the Canadian native in Indianapolis on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpentier's Player's team announced Monday that the driver  
would not be able to compete in this weekend's race at Lexington, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpentier was initially evaluated and treated at the Detroit  
Receiving Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Originally, I thought I would be cleared to drive at Mid-Ohio,  
but further tests showed that I sustained a small fracture in the 
accident,'' Carpentier said. ``It's an unfortunate situation, but I 
have to stay focused on the rest of the season and come back 
stronger than ever for all the guys on the Player's CART team who 
have worked so hard to give me a competitive care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carpentier was trying to pass Bryan Herta when the back of his  
car slid towards the course wall ``as a result of the contact with 
Mauricio (Gugelmin).'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I took a blow to the head and then two more hard knocks before  
coming to a stop. It was so violent that my head was almost thrown 
under the steering. It was totally unexpected and there was no way 
to avoid it,'' Carpentier said.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Schilling Has Bursitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies ace Curt Schilling has  
bursitis in his pitching shoulder and received a cortisone shot in 
hopes that he won't miss any more starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, who had made 117 consecutive starts before missing  
two in a row recently, received the cortisone injection Sunday. He 
told team doctor Michael Ciccotti that he felt immediate relief, 
and the Phillies expect him to start as scheduled Friday at 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're calling it mild to moderate, but it's obviously  
persisted,'' Ciccotti said. ``The cortisone injection helped soothe 
it and cool it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Schilling has played down his recent shoulder woes, it is  
not good news for the Phillies. In a rare playoff race, they'll 
need their ace if they're going to stay in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps us to play meaningful games if we have our best  
players,'' general manager Ed Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
	As if the news on the Schilling front wasn't bad enough, 13-game  
winner Paul Byrd was scratched from his start Monday night with 
back spasms. He was replaced by rookie right-hander Steve Schrenk, 
who won his first major league start against the Marlins while 
pitching in place of Schilling on July 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is, this is something he's had before and it  
dissipates in 12 hours,'' Wade said. ``I can live with 12-hour 
disabled lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling missed his first start in 118 tries July 28 due to  
biceps tendinitis in his pitching arm. He was scheduled to start 
last Tuesday at Florida, but had to rush back to Philadelphia 
because his pregnant wife was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first start back, Schilling was rocked for he allowed  
eight runs -- seven earned -- and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings of an 
8-2 loss to Arizona on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciccotti said Schilling will receive an X-ray to determine if a  
bone spur that was removed when he had shoulder surgery in 1996 has 
grown back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's very unlikely,'' Ciccotti said. ``It's very,  
very rare for that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, a renowned workhorse who led the NL with 15 complete  
games and 268 2-3 innings last season, is second to Randy Johnson 
with eight complete games this year. He had five grueling complete 
games in a row earlier this year, but Ciccotti couldn't say whether 
that streak was related to his sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's hard to say,'' Ciccotti said. ``He's done that before,  
though. We looked at his pitch counted, and he's not that far off 
what he's done in the past.''

<P>
	EUFAULA, Okla. (AP) -- Doris Hedges, publisher of the Indian  
Journal for more than two decades, died Saturday. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hedges and her late husband, Homer Hedges, established the  
Lawton Morning Press in 1932 and published the daily newspaper 
until 1944. In 1945 they moved to Eufaula where they purchased the 
Indian Journal, a weekly that is Oklahoma's oldest newspaper. They 
sold the newspaper in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple also merged two Tahlequah newspapers to create the  
Tahlequah Star-Citizen, where Mrs. Hedges served as managing 
editor. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a member of the Oklahoma Press Association and was  
honored for her regular columns. After retiring, she wrote a

coach who led Iowa to its only Big Ten men's tennis championship 
and wrote a book on tennis techniques, died Sunday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Klotz, who coached Iowa from 1947-71 and led the Hawkeyes to

	DETROIT (AP) -- Jack Laskowski, United Auto Workers Vice  
President who headed national contract talks with DaimlerChrysler 
AG, died Sunday of a heart attack while attending a board meeting. 
He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as director of the union's DaimlerChrysler department  
and had been selected in March to negotiate a new contract with the 
automaker's Chrysler unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's triennial talks with Detroit's automakers began in  
June to replace the pact that expires Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Laskowski also oversaw negotiations with the former Chrysler  
Corp. during the last round of national bargaining in 1996. The 
department represents 75,000 UAW members at more than 50 locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Laskowski was elected a UAW vice president in 1995. He had been  
a regional director from 1992-1995. He was a UAW member since 1958.

<P>
	GOLDSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- John Dortch ``Booty'' Lewis Sr., a  
Goldsboro insurance executive whose World War II exploits were 
chronicled in part in the movie ``The Great Escape,'' died Sunday 
of pancreatic cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Well before the United States entered World War II, Lewis joined  
the Royal Canadian Air Force and flew fabric-covered Hawker 
Hurricane fighter planes during Great Britain's darkest days of the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Wounded and with his plane badly damaged on a mission over  
France, Lewis managed to get the aircraft back across the English 
Channel and crashed in the British countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Grounded by the RCAF because of extensive injuries, Lewis  
transferred to the U.S. Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, leading a flight of P-39 Bell Airacobra fighters, he was  
shot down in North Africa and captured after eluding German troops 
in the desert for almost two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of the next two years in Germany's Stalag Luft  
III. That was the prison camp from which prisoners of war tunneled 
to freedom in an escape later to be made into a movie, ``The Great 
Escape,'' starring Steve McQueen. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the exploits portrayed by McQueen were based on escape  
attempts and other activities by Lewis.

<P>
	RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. (AP) -- Victor Mature, the brawny star of  
the 1940s and '50s who played Samson in ``Samson and Delilah'' and 
Doc Holliday in John Ford's ``My Darling Clementine,'' died 
Wednesday of cancer. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Tall, dark-haired and muscular, with heavy-lidded eyes and a  
full mouth, Mature earned the nickname ``beautiful hunk of man'' in 
films like ``One Million B.C.'' and ``Song of the Islands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While first making his name as a glamour-boy star with a  
devil-may-care attitude, he gradually gained more critical respect 
in the late 1940s in such films as ``Cry of the City'' and ``Kiss 
of Death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared in musicals, Westerns, comedies, historical epics  
and melodramas. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``My Darling Clementine,'' 1946, he was Doc Holliday to Henry  
Fonda's Wyatt Earp. The version of the fabled gunfight at the O.K. 
Corral is considered one of Ford's greatest films. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 telling of the saga of Samson and  
Delilah cast Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the title roles. It was a 
smash hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Mature's other films: ``The Shanghai Gesture,'' 1941,  
directed by Josef von Sternberg; ``My Gal Sal,'' 1942, with Rita 
Hayworth; ``I Wake Up Screaming,'' 1941, with Betty Grable; 
``Wabash Avenue,'' 1950, again with Miss Grable; ``The Robe,'' 
1953, as the slave Demetrius; a sequel, ``Demetrius and the 
Gladiators, 1954; and ``Chief Crazy Horse,'' 1954, with Mature in 
the title role.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BBC sports anchor Helen Rollason, who won  
admiration and respect for staying on the air during her two-year 
battle with cancer, died Monday at age 43. 
</P>
<P>
	After Rollason was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago,  
doctors gave her three months to live. But she turned up for the 
British Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Six O'Clock News'' until recently, 
and last month went to Buckingham Palace in a wheelchair to receive 
an honor from Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, the BBC aired a documentary about her cancer  
fight called ``Hope for Helen'' in which Rollason allowed cameras 
to follow her around. 
</P>
<P>
	Rollason started her career as a physical education teacher. But  
after she got a chance to go on air as a volunteer for an Essex 
radio station, she segued into sports reporting and never looked 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the first woman to serve as host of ``Grandstand,'' the  
BBC's weekend sports program, and received an award as sports 
anchor of the year in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Killed in Wall St. Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Police fired about 35 shots as they chased an  
armed bank robbery suspect down a crowded street in Manhattan's 
Wall Street area Monday, killing the suspect and wounding a 
passerby. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank teller recognized a man in the bank as the same person  
who held her up in June and told a security officer, who called 
police, said assistant police chief William Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
	When police confronted the man, the suspect pulled out a gun and  
refused to put it down, so officers began firing at him, Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, whose name was not released, was hit by a bullet, but  
ran out of the bank and through crowds of office workers on their 
lunch break, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blood flew everywhere, it was on the sidewalk in splatters,''  
said Donald Littlejohn, 53, who saw the shootout as he walked near 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not know how many times the suspect was hit, and said  
it was unclear whether he shot back. Littlejohn said he saw the 
suspect shoot several times at police. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect made no attempt to rob the bank while he was inside,  
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman was hit in the buttocks and hospitalized in stable  
condition.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Umpires May Still Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball umpires may still strike this season  
but their union head told them to wait until the National Labor 
Relations Board rules on their unfair labor practice complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``At about the same time that we withdrew the resignations,  
baseball engaged in a series of very, very serious unfair labor 
practices that could create a strike,'' union head Richie Phillips 
said Monday. ``The law is that if the unfair labor practices the 
other side is engaged in are of a very serious nature, that could 
legitimize a strike in the face of a no-strike clause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires, not waiting for the Dec. 31 expiration of their labor  
contract and wanting to force an early start to negotiations, 
announced July 14 that they would quit en masse. 
</P>
<P>
	But that plan collapsed 13 days later after 27 umpires either  
refused to resign or withdrew their resignations. The rest of 
umpires then withdrew, but baseball hired 25 new umpires from the 
minors and accepted 22 resignations, effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires then filed an unfair labor practice charge last week.  
The NLRB is not expected to rule until next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of a strike was first reported Monday by  
Newsweek, but Phillips said he has argued against a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of our members are interested in it. Many of our members  
just want to go home,'' he said. ``I've counseled them not to go 
home. I've counseled them to put their faith in the National Labor 
Relations Board and the National Labor Relations Act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips admitted the union was concerned that some umpires  
wouldn't go along with a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too soon to be talking about that,'' he said. ``I am not  
at all focused on an exacerbation of the situation. That doesn't 
mean that it won't happen, but first I have to try to get it 
resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires also filed a lawsuit against baseball in federal court  
in Philadelphia. Owners plan to file a motion to dismiss sometime 
this week.
