<HEADLINE> U.S. Economists Predict 3 percent Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The nation's leading business
economists predicted that the U.S. economy will slow in time to
avert an increase in inflation, the Wall Street Journal reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 34-member forecasting panel of the National Association of
Business Economists (NABE) said the U.S. economy will expand 3
percent in 1999, faster than 2.1 percent the forecasters predicted
in November, though slower than the 3.9 percent growth rate in
1998. For 2000, the forecasters see growth of 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NABE survey also noted that 23 percent of those surveyed
feel that current monetary policy is "too stimulative" for the
economy, while 75 percent think it is "about right". The slight
shift in pessimism didn't change the opinion of the majority of
panelists who neither expect nor prefer any change in short-term
interest rates in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than half of the NABE panelists believe the stock
market will rally further this year. In fact, only 11 percent
think the market will slide for the rest of 1999, which signals a
shift from the more pessimistic view evidenced in the NABE's
earlier survey.
</P>
<P>
NABE economists also expect unemployment to remain low,
averaging 4.5 percent in 1999, as was seen last year, and rising
to 4.7 in 2000. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price
index, is also expected to remain tame. Economists project an
increase to 2 percent in 1999 and 2.3 percent in 2000, compared
with the 1.6 percent rate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Almost 80 percent of the NABE forecasting panel also feels that
the current economic expansion, which has already lasted 96
months, will become the longest upswing in U.S. history. The
record for economic expansion took place between 1961 and 1969,
and lasted 106 months.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Welcomes Libya's Flexibility over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid Wednesday expressed welcome to Libya's flexible
stance on resolving the Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters about the issue, Abdel-Meguid voiced hope
that Libya's flexibility would lead to positive reaction from the
United States and Britain, which are involved in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said Tuesday that he is willing
to accept guarantees and assurances by Saudi Arabia and South
Africa over resolving the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said South African President Nelson Mandela's words are
sufficient and "stronger than a resolution adopted by the United
Nations Security Council" on resolving the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been disputing with the U.S. and Britain over the
trial of two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jetliner in
1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid stressed that Libya has the right to get
guarantees for a fair trial of the two Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
Libya was seeking guarantees for the two suspects' security and
fair trial after agreeing to let them stand trial in the
Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief said that he will discuss with Gaddafi
the Lockerbie issue during the Libyan leader's planned visit to
Egypt in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said that Gaddafi's upcoming visit will afford "a
good opportunity" for more cooperation between Libya and Egypt,
and Libya and the pan-Arab forum in resolving Tripoli's disputes
with the two Western powers.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Wednesday that
Gaddafi is due to arrive in Cairo on Friday for a two-day visit,
during which he will confer with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the prospects of handing over the two Libyans for trial.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan attorney general
filed a motion on behalf of the elections commissioner in the
Supreme Court Wednesday afternoon, seeking its permission to
postpone the polls to five provincial councils that are scheduled
to be held on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The move follows increasing protests from Christians who object
to the polls being held on the day before Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church said the curfew routinely declared once
polling is finished will affect church goers on Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
The church said it will file a fundamental rights case in the
Supreme Court on March 5 and hold a peaceful mass protest in all
parts of the country on Sunday, March 7.
</P>
<P>
Catholics said the polls can be held before March 29 if the
Supreme Court order and provincial council elections law which
bind the elections commissioner require him to hold them on or
before April 1.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Rally to Beat Jilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A scoring drought in the dying
minutes proved to be costly as Jilin Northeast Tigers squandered
the hard-fought lead and finally were squeaked by Liaoning Hunters
in the 17th round of China Basketball League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hunters, the runners-up last season, sparked a 11-0 outburst in
the last five minutes to edged the Tigers for their 13th win after
17 games.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 50-49 at halftime, Tigers managed to take the lead at
74-70 after the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Under the inspiration by the home fans, Jilin, who relegated
from the second division, kept the lead until Liaoning used a 11-0
run to seal the game.
</P>
<P>
"My players did try their best though they were beaten," said
Li Xiaojun, head coach of Tigers. "It was very normal thing that
Liaoning won over us becasue they were a strong and better team."
</P>
<P>
Hunters standed second on the league standings, three games shy
of Bayi Rockets, who recorded 16-1.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Sharks, which bowed to Zhejiang Cyclone in a 108-113
loss Wednesday, shared third with Hongyuan Guangdong Tigers, who
beat Jinan Army Pengusus 102-82.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Aoshen, who snapped a winning streak by reigning
champions Rockets in the 15th round, defeated Beijing Ducks 104-96
for their fourth win in a row.
</P>
<P>
Ducks wasted a chance to force an ovetime when they cut the
deficit to 96-98 with one minute left but a three-pointer in the
last second by Aoshen killed the hope of Ducks.
</P>
<P>
Bayi kept their authority in a one-sided matchup by routing
languishing Jiangsu Dragons 138-92.
</P>
<P>
In Chengdu, Sichuang Panda upset the visiting Shandong Flaming
Bulls 91-83 for their seventh victory of the season.

<HEADLINE> 1999 China Business Summit to Focus on Long-term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 China Business Summit, to
be held in late April, will focus its attention on issues like how
China can maintain the speed of its reforms and ensure the success
of long-term restructuring while cushioning the impact of economic
cycles, officials of the World Economic Forum (WEF) told Xinhua
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Other major topics to be discussed during the summit include
the challenges of financial security in the context of prolonged
recession in Asia, how the Chinese government plans to increase
the inflow of the foreign direct investment (FDI), and China's
employment and labor markets reforms.
</P>
<P>
The China Business Summit, sponsored by the Geneva-based WEF
since 1981, has attracted thousands of government officials,
intellectuals, businessmen and reporters from all over the world
to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Different from the previous summits, the venue of the 1999
summit will be extended from Beijing on April 25-27 to Shanghai on
April 27-28.
</P>
<P>
The WEF officials expected the 1999 summit to provide a
privileged framework to discuss the part private and public
sectors can play to boost domestic investment demand and consumer
demand and to present the most recent update on the economic
conditions and options open to the nation's decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
They also hoped that the summit will provide foreign
participants with an opportunity to expand their network and meet
the new generation of Chinese business leaders.

ANKARA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said here Wednesday that the economic cooperation will be the key
of peace in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks at the Ankara Esenboga Airport when
he returned from the second Developing Eight (D-8) summit held
in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that the basic targets of the D-8 summit which
can be defined as improvement of the economic cooperation and as
increasing the trade between the D-8 member countries were
confirmed once more in the Dhaka Declaration adopted in this
summit.
</P>
<P>
He added that the D-8 summit is a useful initiative which
helps Turkey to benefit from the opportunities of the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
Demirel believed that the economic cooperation movement will be
a significant investment for the future.
</P>
<P>
However, the 33-point declaration expressed concern over the
lack of progress in reforming and strengthening the international
financial system to protect the interest of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The D-8, an economic group comprising Bangladesh, Pakistan,
Iran, Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Malaysia, was launched
in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Blair Backs Calls for IRA Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
in an interview published on Wednesday, supported calls for the
Irish Republican Army or IRA to hand over arms before its
political wing, Sinn Fein, enters Northern Ireland government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to The Scotsman newspaper, the prime minister
dismissed claims by a Sinn Fein leader that the IRA could not hand
over its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says an IRA weapons handover is not required by the
April 1998 agreement as a precondition for their entry into
government.
</P>
<P>
"They can do it, if they wish to do it," Blair said, adding the
Irish republicans should "listen to the people." The pro-British
politicians in Northern Ireland have repeatedly called for the IRA
disarmament to guarantee a permanent peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
"We must also make sure that the whole of the agreement is
implemented, and that includes the decommissioning (surrender of
weapons) part of it," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for that is perfectly simple: people have got to
know if they are sitting down with people who have given up
violence for good," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for creation of an coalition provincial government
in Belfast falls on March 10 with fears that a peace agreement
signed in the British-ruled province last April could founder if
it is not met because of the arms deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The agreement brought a tentative halt to three decades of
conflict between Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to
remain British and Roman Catholic republicans who seek unification
with the Irish Republic.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blames Syria for Supporting Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe
Arens said on Wednesday that the situation in Lebanon will remain
unstable if Syria continues to support the Shiite Muslim
guerrilla group Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Arens said that "we
basically do not have a stable situation in Lebanon as long as
the Syrians continue to consent to activities of the Hezbollah
guerrillas."
</P>
<P>
Arens noted that it is Syria's strategy to make a linkage
between the demand for an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon
and the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
He said that by encouraging the Hezbollah guerrillas to attack
Israeli targets in south Lebanon, Syria wants to pressure Israel
to withdraw from both Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The tensions in south Lebanon have been escalated as seven
Israelis including a general were killed by the Hezbollah
guerrillas in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas. Since then, Lebanon's resistance
movement spearheaded by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, has been fighting to drive Israeli troops out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government insisted that only after the Lebanese
government agreed to disarm Hezbollah and deploy its troops in
south Lebanon to prevent cross-border attacks, Israel would
pull its troops out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria have rejected the Israeli proposal,
noting that Israel must withdraw unconditionally. Syria
maintains about 30,000 troops in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Sharon's Proposal for National Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli political figures across
party lines on Wednesday rejected Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon's
proposal for postponing the national elections and forming an
emergency national unity government.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman said it is too late to create such a
unity government because the election campaign is under way,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who the radio said had
earlier supported the idea, also rejected it.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition parties including Labor, the Center Party
and Meretz, also turned down the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's suggestion was termed by the Labor Party as another
proof that the Netanyahu government has failed to solve any
pressing problems.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Sharon told Israel Radio Tuesday night that
he had proposed to create a national unity government by Labor and
the Likud in order to resolve the issues of Lebanon and peace
talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"We need to set up an emergency government immediately... in
order to reach a decision on unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon
and on implementing the agreement with the Palestinians," Sharon
said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Sharon floated the idea in response
to Labor Party leader Barak's pledge made Tuesday that he would
withdraw Israeli troops from south Lebanon within a year if he
wins the prime ministership in the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Netanyahu rejected the idea only after it had
been denied by the Labor so as to put the blame of failing to form
a unity government on the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The mounting Israeli casualties in south Lebanon have led to
growing public pressure in Israel for a unilateral troop
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Again Meets Air Defense Commanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Wednesday met with military commanders to discuss air defense
issues, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In his capacity as commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed
forces, Saddam met with commander of air defense forces, head of
the military industry and other senior air defense officers, said
INA. But it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
This was the second day in a run that Saddam met with his air
defense lieutenants. Reports said he talked with them Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Saddam also received his ministers of oil and military
industry, air defense commander and some specialists in the air
defense field on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These meetings came after the U.S. and Britain had intensified
their air raids on "civilian and military targets" in the no-fly
zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday and Monday, U.S. and British warplanes bombed the
control and communications systems of the important sixth relay
station on the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline and Ein Zala oil field,
killing two civilians and wounding 11 others.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq, Saddam
has met a number of times with senior officials, military
commanders and specialists of air defense to counter allied air
superority.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Iraqi air defense units and U.S. and British
jets patrolling the no-fly zones have almost become daily
occurrence since the mid-December bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad suppression."

cooperation," said Solana, "and the time for finding a final
solution to the Kosovo crisis."
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief made the remark after being briefed by United
States Kosovo envoy Christopher Hill and European Union Kosovo
envoy Wolfgang Petritsch about the development of the peace
process after the Rambouillet negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Solana described the resignation of hardline ethnic Albanian
leader Adem Demaci on Tuesday as "a very important decision taken
by the ethnic Albanian side". The move was seen as to have
increased the possibility for the ethnic Albanians to sign up the
peace deal provisionally agreed at Rambouillet outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
Now it was up to the Serbian side to do the same to reach the
peace deal, added the NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Hill said after briefing the NATO
decision-makers that the Kosovo Liberation Army is ready to sign
the peace deal which it demanded at Rambouillet on February 24
extra time to consult within its own ranks.
</P>
<P>
Hill urged both sides not to abuse the situation in Kosovo nor
the time running up to March 15 after admitting that there had
been non-compliance and "ugly incidents" of late.
</P>
<P>
Both envoys stressed that the implementation of the peace deal
by international ground troops will benefit both the ethnic
Albanians and the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no political agreement without the
implementation," said Hill who is to return to Pristina, Kosovo,
to continue diplomatic efforts while Petritsch described the peace
implementation as "part and parcel" of the deal to be signed by
all sides.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are scheduled to resume on March 15 in a French
air base to focus on the implementation clause of the peace deal
proposed by the six-nation Contact Group.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Cuts Economic Dependence on Iraq: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has reduced its
economic dependence on Iraq by 50 percent in a bid to expand its
ties with the Gulf Arab countries, visiting Jordanian Foreign
Minister Abdul Ilah al-Khatib said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with local media before concluding his
two-day visit to Kuwait, al-Khatib said Jordan was going through
"a very difficult stage and is trying to benefit as much as
possible from the Gulf states."
</P>
<P>
"The volume of trade has been reduced from 400 million
U.S. dollars to 200 million dollars," al-Khatib was quoted as
saying by Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Jordan relys heavily on trade with Iraq and Iraq's oil which
Amman imports at preferential prices.
</P>
<P>
On his meeting last week with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad
al-Sahhaf, al-Khatib said he had told his Iraqi counterpart that
Baghdad should prove its good will toward Arab states by releasing
Kuwaitis still detained in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
"He (al-Sahhaf) said that there are no Kuwaiti prisoners of
war in Iraq," the Jordanian official said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib stressed that the Iraqi regime should "respect the
characteristics of the regional states and the aspiration of Arab
people."
</P>
<P>
He also urged Iraq to respect the leadership of neighboring
Arab states and refrain from attempting to destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-December U.S.-British air raids on Iraq, the Iraqi
leadership had appealed to Kuwaitis and Saudis to revolt against
their rulers, who allowed U.S. and British troops to use their
territories for attacks on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Revolution in Africa Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- ICO Global Communications, the
world-wide mobile telephone company, has predicted a major
telecommunication revolution in Africa in 1999 which will touch
not only urban centers but remote rural areas as well.
</P>
<P>
The African connection agenda drawn up by the ministers at
Africa Telecom '98 has clearly paved the way for a renaissance in
the telecommunications sector in Africa, Khaya Dlukulu, who is
regional general manager for ICO in Africa, said in a despatch
sent to Zambian News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the African telecom summit now underway in Ghana,
Dlukulu predicted that 1999 will mark the year that will see the
beginning of the GMPCS (Global Mobile Personal Communications
Services) via satellite.
</P>
<P>
Cellular and global telephony system will have a significant
impact on Africa. "We are looking forward to operating in an
environment in which there is fair and vigorous competition among
all players," he said.
</P>
<P>
ICO Global Communications has already won support from ten
African countries that have invested over 50 million U.S. Dollars
in the new system.
</P>
<P>
The company was established in January 1995 as a private
company to provide global mobile personal communications by
satellite, including digital voice, data, fax and messaging
services.
</P>
<P>
It has so far raised more than three billion Dollars in equity
contributions and has 60 investors comprising telecommunications
and technology companies from 50 markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU), the density of telephones in
Africa will only be two per 100 people in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This compares markedly with 35 per 100 in the Americas and more
than 40 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
ITU also calculates that the average distance between phones in
Africa is currently at about 50 kilometers and in some cases
country-dwellers may have to walk for several days to the nearest
telephone.
</P>
<P>
When fully operational, ICO's service will be based on a new
generation of pocket-sized mobile phones which will allow users
in Africa to make and receive calls at any time, and from any
where on the continent.

<HEADLINE> Ramadhan: Iraq Ready for Talks with Arab Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadhan on Wednesday said Iraq is ready for dialog with Arab
countries to find solutions that will rebuild Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan made the remarks in a speech delivered at the
National Defense College, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said the U.S. and Britain always appeared to
advocate democracy, but in fact they themselves trampled on
democracy when interfering in the internal affairs of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He added that this phenomenon did not exist 15 years ago, but
it exists now because of the weakness of some Arab governments in
confronting the American tyranny.
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan said that the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes
against Iraq would not have been stopped if it had not been for
the Arab masses' anger against this aggression.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations that took place in Arab capitals at that
time proved that the U.S. and British schemes against Iraq
failed, he added.
</P>
<P>
In mid-December, the U.S. and British launched air strikes on
Iraq to retaliate what they claimed the Iraqi failure to fully
cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors in charge of eliminating
Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ramadhan slammed the imposition of the no-fly
zones on Iraq, saying it is an illegal U.S.-British unilateral
action which is not based on the international legitimacy and has
no authorization from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The no-fly zones aim at interfering in Iraq's internal
affairs and national sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones in the wake of
the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's
suppression."
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December bombardment, clashes between U.S. and
British jets patrolling the restricted zones and the Iraqi air
defense forces have almost become daily occurrence.

He was addressing participants at the on-going three-day
seminar on environmental management by manufacturers, organized
by the Conference of Environment Management of Zimbabwe in
Victoria Falls in west Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said environmental issues were now a fact of conducting
business and were shaping policies in governments worldwide as it
becomes imperative to use natural resources sustainable.
</P>
<P>
International standards reduced trade barriers and those
standards were practical tools to help developing countries manage
the impact of their activities on the environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
British environment expert Mike Johnson told the seminar that
damage from mining, manufacturing and other industries was still
an issue of international concern.
</P>
<P>
The world around us, said Johnson, was still subjected to
intense environmental pressure but, at the same time, it was now
benefitting from an improved environmental performance by
industries.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said improved technology underpinned by tougher
legislation as well as share-holder and public expectations was
environmental friendly benefits.
</P>
<P>
About 200 officials from government departments and
international environmental organizations are attending the
meeting whose aim is to sensitize participants on the need to
have environment friendly methods in industrial production.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook arrived in northern Russia Wednesday on a three-day visit
intended to help Moscow utilize its nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
He landed in the town of Murmansk on the northwestern Kola
Peninsula, home to the Northern Fleet and one of the largest and
potentially most dangerous concentrations of nuclear waste in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Murmansk is mired in a growing financial and ecological crisis
as more and more nuclear-powered submarines are taken out of
service.
</P>
<P>
Russia's nuclear processing industry is facing grave
difficulties as much of the waste is either badly stored in
disintegrating containers or simply abandoned.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Murmansk, Cook will visit an Atomflot plant,
which processes liquid nuclear waste, and Lepse, Russia's only and
Europe's largest barge used for storing radioactive waste, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cook was scheduled to fly from Murmansk to Moscow on the
evening later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with his Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov,
and meet with Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cook will also meet with British businessmen working in Russia.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he and Ivanov will fly to the Black Sea resort city
of Sochi for a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who is currently vacationing there.

<HEADLINE> WB Finances Uganda's Rice Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) arm of the World Bank, will lend 2.4 million
U.S. dollars to help finance Uganda's rice growing and processing
facility.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Wednesday afternoon by the World Bank
(Uganda) said that the project, Tilda Uganda Ltd (TUL) ,
privatizes and rehabilitates the bankrupt kibimba rice scheme
which was established in eastern Uganda in 1973 by the
governments of Uganda and China as a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The TUL , a privately owned company established for the
implementation of the project, acquired the rice operation in
1997 through Uganda's privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to produce 3,000 tons of milled rice, 2,400
tons of maize and 200 tons of soya each year. The rice mill will
have a capacity of five tons per hour, processing rice grown by
small holders in the area as well as the farm's crops.
</P>
<P>
IFC's Director for Sub-Sahara Africa Cesare Calari said the
project will produce high quality rice for the first time in
Uganda and reduce imports. thereby saving foreign exchange for the
country.
</P>
<P>
It will also increase employment where it is much needed in
rural eastern Uganda, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
IFC fosters economic growth in the developing world by
financing private sector investments, mobilizing capital in the
international financial markets, and providing technical
assistance and advice to governments and businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Wednesday met Burundian President Pierre Buyoya's
special envoy and discussed with him the peace process in the
country, Mandela's office said.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Burundian Justice Minister Terence
Sinunguruza, Mandela said he supported the peace efforts of
Burundians and that there was always a peace resolution to any
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The president is of the view that no conflict is above
peaceful resolution through negotiations, and that a resolution of
this particular conflict would send a powerful message to the
troubled Great Lakes region, and indeed other parts of the world,
that divisions which many view as intractable are indeed capable
of resolution."
</P>
<P>
"A sustainable settlement in Burundi can give a lead to the
other states in the region," the office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mandela emphasized the need to promote peaceful processes in
Africa as a whole. "Conflict in any one part of Africa affects
Africans everywhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the image of Africa as "a continent imprisoned by
conflict and famine" had kept away foreign investors and tourists.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the peace process in Burundi had been
nurtured and supported by African initiatives, and reflected the
commitment of African states to assume responsibility for
fostering peace, prosperity and democracy in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The statement said South Africa supported the peace process in
Burundi facilitated by former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's legal adviser, Fink Haysom, currently presides over
the committee of Burundians seeking agreement on constitutional
arrangements for Burundi.
</P>
<P>
General Andrew Masondo of the South African National Defense
Force is assisting the committee in dealing with a cease-fire and
related military matters.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa will continue to support this important process."
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been plagued by constant coups d'etat and civil
wars.

statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The government hopes that this project will serve as a model

<HEADLINE> Protein in Brain Could Help Cure Baldness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- German scientists have suggested
that substances which make brain cells grow might lead to
treatments for baldness, New Scientist magazine reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ralf Paus and his colleagues at Humboldt University in Berlin,
Germany, who made the discovery, said it may also help people get
rid of unwanted body hair.
</P>
<P>
Experiments with shaved mice showed that just before
shrivelling phase, hair follicles of the mice are awash with two
growth factors, and the two genes producing them are abnormally
active, which suggested the chemicals actually trigger the
shrinking of follicles.
</P>
<P>
To confirm this, the researchers engineered mice to churn out
too much of one of the growth factors. As expected, their hair
fell out earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, hair took longer than normal to fall out in
"knockout" mice that could not make either protein.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first evidence that growth factors previously
thought to be important for the development of brain cells are
also important for the growth of hair follicles," said the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
They also found that the two substances work by binding to a
receptor on a cell, which suggested that drugs blocking the
receptor could prevent hair loss, while others that mimic the
brain proteins and bind to the receptor might help shed unwanted
hair.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientists pointed out that it is too early to say
whether the mouse results are relevant to humans, as their hair
growth is much more erratic than in mice.

<HEADLINE> Hani's Killer to Marry in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Janusz Walus, a killer of
former South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani, will marry
his girl friend next Wednesday in jail.
</P>
<P>
Walus, 47, will marry Berril Roy, his girl friend, at Pretoria
maximum security prison, where he is serving a life term for the
murder of Hani, South African Press Association reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The South African Correctional Services Department confirmed
Wednesday it had granted permission for the couple to marry in a
prison office under strict conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, the couple would not be allowed to consummate their
marriage, as "there were no conjugal rights in South African
prisons", a correctional services spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Walus and his collaborator, South African Clive Derby-Lewis,
have applied for amnesty for killing Hani in 1993. The Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) had not yet delivered its verdict
on the amnesty application.
</P>
<P>
In terms of prison regulations, the only guests allowed during
the wedding ceremony were the bride and groom's parents or
guardians and the children of either of them. The bride and the
guests would have to leave after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Roy, 32, was a qualified church minister and gospel singer and
had campaigned for several years for the release of political
prisoners, a close friend of Walus said.
</P>
<P>
She is divorced and has two children from her first marriage.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the Pretoria High Court granted Walus a
divorce from his Polish wife Wanda. The couple were married in
1976 but she and their daughter stayed behind in Poland when Walus
left that country for political reasons in 1981.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police to Work Better: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Within three years South
Africans would have the best equipped and trained police service
possible under the circumstances, South African Police Services
Chief Executive Officer Meyer Kahn said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a security protection exhibition near Johannesburg,
Kahn said the police was redirecting 400 million Rand (67 million
U.S. Dollars) annually from non-productive activities to improve
equipment and resources.
</P>
<P>
The efficiency of the police force was growing as the battle
against the malaise in the police was being won, South African
Press Association quoted Kahn as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 200 local and international companies are showcasing
their latest hi-tech security systems and products at the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Kahn said there was a 21 percent drop in police absentee levels
and 27 percent drop in incidence of the "blue flu" - police
officers reporting sick on Mondays, Fridays and public holidays.
</P>
<P>
He said most kinds of crimes in South Africa were stabilizing
or decreasing. But he admitted street crimes such as robbery,
residential break-ins and car hijackings have shown an increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa's opposition parties Wednesday launched
a new round of attacks on the government for its failure to curb
crime.
</P>
<P>
In parliament, the National Party (NP) and the African
Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) slammed the government for its
"appalling" performance on crime. They said crime levels had gone
up since the African National Congress (ANC) came to power in
1994.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reasonable place in this country where crime is
not taking place: Parliament, the president's residence, churches,
schools and the national intelligence premises have become
targets," ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that South Africa has one of the worst rates of
murder and rape in the world.

JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A woman said to be 114 years
old died Tuesday after she was allegedly raped at her home in
southern South Africa, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Dina Boesaka, was alone at home in Kwanonzamo
township, in the Eastern Cape province, when she was allegedly
assaulted by a 29-year- old man Tuesday evening, South African
Press Association quoted police as saying.

<P>
The two held the man until the police arrived. Boesaka was
taken to hospital and died there that night, police said.
</P>
<P>
"Family members say Mrs Boesaka was 114 years old and was to
turn 115 next month, but we cannot confirm that until we have

</P>
<P>
Expressing shock at the incident, chairman of the safety and

<HEADLINE> Russian Lawmaker: Corruption Erodes Executive Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian lawmaker said
Wednesday that corruption "has reached an unprecedented scale,
with the executive branch and law enforcement agencies infested to
a large extent."
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kulikov, chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission
of the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, told a press
conference that the Prosecutor General's Office, the Interior
Ministry, the Federal Security Service and regional law
enforcement had opened 45 criminal cases to follow up on his
commission's findings.
</P>
<P>
He said 51 reviews are underway concerning complicity in
corruption of various senior officials, in particular former prime
ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergei Kiriyenko, deputy prime
ministers Yegor Gaidar, Anatoly Chubais, Boris Fyodorov and Boris
Nemtsov, foreign economic relations ministers Pyotr Aven and Oleg
Davydov, Deputy Finance Minister Andrei Vavilov and CIS Executive
Secretary Boris Berezovsky, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Another member of the commission, Yuri Schchekochinkhin, said
"corruption is the engine of our society."
</P>
<P>
He called for an investigation into the disappearance of 7
billion rubles (about 304 million U.S. dollars) appropriated
through a commercial bank in 1997 for paying the ransom of Russian
servicemen held prisoner in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry is the most corrupt agency, said another
commission member, Nina Zatsepina of Popular Rule.
</P>
<P>
The commission's investigation into Black Sea and Sea of Azov
ports has resulted in the establishment, on the orders of Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, of an interdepartmental regional group
of over 140 members which has opened over 160 criminal cases, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 30 have been brought to court, over 200 people
brought to criminal justice and all the senior officials of the
Novorossiysk customs office fired, Zatsepina said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Firms Hide Safer Cigarettes Patents: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco firms have developed 57
ways to make cigarettes safer but have chosen not to use them,
according to a new report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by UK's Imperial Cancer Research Fund and
Action on Smoking and Health, showed that the tobacco industry had
57 U.S. patents approved for modifications that could have reduced
the chemicals in cigarettes that cause cancer, heart disease and
emphysema.
</P>
<P>
It reviewed 25 years of patents for designs to reduce some of
the cancer-causing compounds in cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes fitted with catalytic converters similar to those
used on cars were patented by the tobacco industry but never
developed, the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
Other patents included chemical filters to remove hydrogen
cyanide and hydrogen sulphide and acetaldehyde which could have
reduced respiratory illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes incorporating this technology would present less of
a heart disease risk than currently-available brands, it was
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, manufacturing processes that reduced the level of
chemicals called nitrosamines in smokers' lungs could have reduced
the incidence of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
However, the tobacco firms never used those technologies
because producing safer cigarettes would have been expensive and
also an admission that the existing ones were "unsafe", the report
said.

<HEADLINE> 6 Killed After UNITA Shells N. Angolan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and another
four injured Wednesday after troops of the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) shelled Malanje City in
northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
Houses at the provincial broadcasting station and a hospital
were hit by the shellings, which resulted in the most serious
casualties in 10 days, the official news agency Angog reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people have been killed or injured when UNITA
intensified its military actions around Malanje with long-range
artillery since the government forces recaptured Mbanza Congo,
capital city of Zaire Province on February 12.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the aim of UNITA's intensifying actions on
Malanje is to try to link up its forces in the north to those in
the central part of the country, where UNITA's headquarters in
Andulo and Bialundo are surrounded by the government forces.
</P>
<P>
UNITA men destroyed an important bridge Saturday 60 kms south
of Malanje, in order to prevent the advance of the government
forces.

<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Rolls-Royce Plc is involved in six
of eight Defense and Aerospace Research Partnerships (DARP)
launched Wednesday by the Government's Foresight Defense and
Aerospace Panel.
</P>
<P>
The company will also generate closer collaboration between
existing Rolls-Royce university technology centers (UTCs),
involving the universities of Birmingham, Swansea, Cambridge and
Oxford.
</P>
<P>
During a speech at the launch, Mike Goulette of Rolls-Royce,
said the UTC network has played an important role in forging the
strong links between industry and the academic community.
</P>
<P>
The collaboration is set to become even more precisely targeted
and managed through the formation of DARPs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The eight DARPs will research topics as varied as turbulence
modelling and advanced materials, and will each involve a
partnership of companies and universities.
</P>
<P>
The design DARP is based on the Rolls-Royce/British Aerospace
university technology partnership announced at last year's
Farnborough Air Show.

<HEADLINE> European Main Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- European Markets closed lower
Wednesday despite a strong dollar, with talk of a U.S.
interest rate rise and the unchanged UK rate leaving the
share prices deprived of buyers.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 Index peaked at 6116 before noon, but was
soon falling and eventually closed down 13 points at
6048.3.
</P>
<P>
The strong start on the London markets was stopped in
its tracks by the Bank of England's decision to leave
interest rates unchagned.
</P>
<P>
Germany's share prices slid as a general reluctance to
enter the market was coupled with concern over the
government's planned tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax closed 129.32 points lower at 4688.52.
However, Insurers' share prices rose. This was due partly
to Morgan Stanley upgrading its performance forecasts for
Munich Re and Allianz.
</P>
<P>
French stock prices finished weaker, closing 37.60
points lower at 4011.03, as Wall Street slid into the red
towards the end of the European session.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Praises Young People for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on
Wednesday praised the country's youngsters for their brave actions
against the Israeli aggression on the country, the official
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon will never die as long as there are such young people
like those who participated in the campaign to liberate the
village Arnoun from Israeli occupation," Lahoud said when meeting
with representatives of those youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The young people achieved by their bare hands what the
diplomatics failed to do, Lahoud said, apparently referring to
the return of Arnoun on Saturday which was annexed by Israeli
forces into its so-called security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The village, three kilometers from northern Israel, was
cordoned off with barbed wire and earth moulds by Israeli forces
and its allies South Lebanon Army on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, always used the village as a launching pad for
attacks against a nearby Israeli outpost at the crusader-era
Beaufort Castle.
</P>
<P>
Last week, hundreds of university students flocked to Arnoun
and removed all fencing around the village despite that Israeli
soldiers fired warning shoots into the air.
</P>
<P>
The students' move came when the Lebanese government's
diplomatic efforts appeared to be rapidly losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said he would always stand by the young people and
support their cause which is the cornerstone for Lebanon's
liberation process and democratic reform.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.

MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed in Russia
has soared to 8.9 million, or 12.4 percent of the work force, the
Labor Ministry said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 1.1 million were made redundant in the aftermath of
the financial crisis that hit the country last August, when the
government devalued the ruble.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the jobless rate is likely to further rise to
12.7 percent by the end of the year, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The employment offices around the country had 1.9 million, or
2.7 percent of the economically active population, on register at
the end of last year. Women accounted for 64.6 percent of
registered unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The average job-seeker will need seven to eight months to get
reemployed.
</P>
<P>
There are six applicants for every job vacancy in the
employment service and manual jobs account for 65.6 percent of all
the vacancies, the ministry said.

CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Health Minister of the Palestinian
National Authority Riyad Za'noun said here Wednesday that more
than 600,000 Palestinians have been detained by Israel since its
occupation of Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Za'noun said in a report submitted to the Arab Health Ministers
Council that Israel still jails 2,800 Palestinians despite accords
on releasing Palestinian prisoners, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A number of agreement signed between the Palestinians and
Israel require that Israel set free Palestinian prisoners. But the
Jewish state procrastinated the implementation of the agreements,
a move that angered the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 prisoners are suffering from various kinds of illness,
50 of whom have heart diseases and kidney failure, the Palestinian
official said.
</P>
<P>
Za'noun accused Israeli authorities of using sick Palestinian
detainees in medical experiments, adding that humanitarian and
legal institutions have demanded the issue be referred to
international and judicial organizations.
</P>
<P>
Israel detains 100 children and 130 adults from Algeria, Iraq,
Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Sudan and Syria, who are above the age
of 45, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 267 prisoners have spent 10 to 26 years behind bars, he
said.

Health Ministers Council, which opened on Wednesday.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday urged an
immediate end to U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq's
targets, according to a U.N. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the United Nations Security Council was
briefed by a U.N. official on the damage to Iraq's Kirkuk pipeline
which was caused by U.S. and British airstrikes in the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, said the no-fly zones establish by the United States and
Britain were not authorized by the Security Council, and therefore
they were illegal, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Qin, who is also the Council president for the current month,
urged all parties concerned to cease immediately all military
actions so that the humanitarian programs in Iraq could be
implemented, the diplomat said.

Russia and some other members of the Council supported China's
position, the diplomat added.

PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The French National Assembly
approved on Wednesday with 447 votes for and 75 against the
Amsterdam Treaty which will bring about greater political and
economic integration among European states.
</P>
<P>
Those who voted against were parliamentarians from the
Communist Party, the Greens and the Citizens' Movement party led
by Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
Some rightwing politicians, including former Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua who will lead a list of candidates in the European
Parliament elections in June, also voted against.
</P>
<P>
The opposers of the treaty said that France would have to
abandon a great part of its sovereignty to the European Union (EU)
if the treaty is adopted.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, the signing countries will hand over
decision-making powers over a series of issues from border control
to political asylum and immigration to the European Commission,

LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A team of agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation of the United States have arrived in
Zambia to help probe the series of bombings which rocked the
capital city of Lusaka Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day the Zambian government invited the U.S.
government to provide expert assistance in the investigation of
the explosions, which took place in six places around the city
including the Angolan embassy.
</P>
<P>
A main pipe supplying water from Kafue to Lusaka was damaged.
</P>
<P>
Asking the Unites States to send experts to Zambia to
investigate the acts of terrorism, the government also said that
it will leave the door open to other countries of goodwill to send
in experts to help in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The bombings left one Angolan security officer dead and another
Angolan national wounded and the embassy building wrecked badly.
</P>
<P>
The explosions have also caused water shortages in most part of
the city, sending many people to fetch water from afar.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Angola has repeatedly accused Zambia of supplying
arms to the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) rebels and threatened to take military actions against
those countries backing UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Arab Committee on Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf said on Wednesday that Iraq rejects the Arab
Committee on sanctions imposed on Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf made the remarks in a statement after member states of
the committee decided to hold a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the committee is imbalanced and
has many contradictions in its aims and its nature, and that many
Arab countries have voiced rejection of the committee.
</P>
<P>
"These contradictions are reflected in the attitudes of some
members of the committee," Sahhaf said, adding that Saudi Arabia,
one of its members, provided facilities for U.S. and British
warplanes to commit daily aggressions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed after Arab foreign ministers meeting in
Cairo on January 24 and entrusted with the mission of studying
how the sanctions imposed on Iraq can be lifted, is composed of
Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Yemen in addition to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers meeting fell short of Iraq's demand
of condemning the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes against
Baghdad and lifting the U.N. sanctions by Arab countries
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf argued that the committee was born under the current
weak Arab situation, therefore it cannot support Iraq's just
demands and will blur Iraq's efforts to achieve its right in
lifting the sanctions which was imposed on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"This committee was born dead," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for holding another Arab meeting as soon as
possible, saying a successful Arab meeting will serve the
interests of the Arab nation.

BUCHAREST, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Romania will continue its
efforts to strengthen cooperation among the members of the
Cooperation of States in Southeastern Europe (SEE) after taking
over the presidency of the organization, said spokesperson for
Romania's Foreign Ministry Carmen Podgorean Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Beginning March 1, 1999, Romania holds the presidency of the
Cooperation of States in SEE, with Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu
as the current president. Turkey was the last holder of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
During its term, Romania will organize the meeting of foreign
ministers, the meeting of heads of state or government and four
meetings of political directors, Podgorean told a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antalya (Turkey) recommendation by heads of
government last October, the Charter of Good Neighborliness Ties
and Stability in Southeastern Europe will be adopted at the 1999
summit.
</P>
<P>
As a current president, Romania will find new forms of
strengthening political and economic cooperation among the
participating states and will continue its efforts to strengthen
cooperation between SEE and other regional initiatives, stressed
the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The organization was set up at the end of 1996, with the
participating states being Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,

</P>
<P>
Carlos do Rosario, Minister of Agriculture and Fishery made the
call on behalf of the government at a brief ceremony, attended by
diplomatic communities and business representatives in Maputo,

It is said that 15 people have been killed by the flood, which
are destroying many of the country's infrastructure facilities,
with many roads cut off in central and southern parts of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Retailers Against Price Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Retailers Association of
Zimbabwe (RAZ) Wednesday said they are against introducing price
controls on goods as this will result in distortions.
</P>
<P>
RAZ chairman Bill Clarke told reporters that price control
would not resolve anything. What needed to be corrected was
management of the economy,

he said.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said the increase of 12.5 percent on the price of
cooking oil was reasonable and likely to have been too small
although it ignored the plight of consumers.
</P>
<P>
He said the increase was unavoidable due to the devaluation of
the local currency caused by "government mismanagement".
</P>
<P>
The issue of price controls, he said, was complicated because
manufacturers needed to have reasonable returns on their
investment.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarire announced
Tuesday that the government would gazette the prices of flour and
bread if millers refused to reverse the increases which they
already affected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students of University of Zimbabwe expressed concern
 Wednesday over cooking oil price hike.
</P>
<P>
They said in a statement that consumers would suffer more as
salaries continued to be eroded.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, students at tertiary institutions are placed in
dire straits because the increase in the price of cooking oil will
inevitably lead to food price increase," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Student leader Takura Zhangazha asked the government to review
the position it has taken for the benefit of all.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan-Kuwait Ties Turn a New Page </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral relations between
Kuwait and Jordan turn a new page following the official visit to
Kuwait by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib, the highest-ranking Jordanian official to visit
Kuwait in nine years, arrived here Tuesday with the aim of
restoring ties damaged by Amman's siding with Baghdad in the 1990
Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay here, al-Khatib met with Kuwaiti Emir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, to whom he conveyed a message
from Jordan's new King Abdullah on issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah on improving bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Sheikh Sabah, also Kuwait's first deputy
prime minister, said that relations between Jordan and his
country are back to normal.
</P>
<P>
"They (bilateral ties) are back to their horizons, and the
first fruit of that is the visit of my brother Abdul Ilah," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the visit will "strengthen bilateral ties and
expand them to more cooperation and coordination."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Sheikh Sabah said that Kuwait will lift its ban
on Jordanian workers. Thousands of Jordanians lost their jobs in
Kuwait as the price paid for their government's sympathy with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"There is no objection on any Jordanian willing to come to
Kuwait if he is employed here," Sheikh Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
Before concluding his visit, al-Khatib said his country's
normalization of relations with Kuwait was "a great achievement
for inter-Arab ties."
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of developing ties in all fields
beyond exchanges between governments.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian official expressed hope for dialog between
parliaments and social organizations in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war (POWs), allegedly
still held in Iraq, al-Khatib said that Jordanians are
sympathizing with the plight of those people.
</P>
<P>
"Jordanian people and government will spare no efforts to
support the Kuwaiti brothers in putting an end to the sufferings
of the Kuwaiti POWs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reopening of the Jordanian embassy in
Kuwait, al-Khatib said "We do not say that the resumption of the
embassy work was a restoration of bilateral ties" which he said
have never been severed.
</P>
<P>
The embassy was closed "due to security circumstances that
prevailed during Iraq's invasion and occupation of this sisterly
state," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Jordan were almost cut off
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. A
rapprochement process began only in May 1997 when Kuwait declared
it "likes to improve ties with all Arab countries except Iraq."
</P>
<P>

KAMPALA, March 3 (xinhua) - British High Commissioner to Uganda
Michael Cook said Wednesday autopsies and identifications of the
British victims of

the Bwindi rebel attack have been completed and preparations are
being made to fly them home.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference here Wednesday
afternoon, adding that formalities are almost over for those who
were rescued to be repatriated.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who declined to release the names of the dead,
said however that there were three men and one woman.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commission has looked after even those
survivors whose countries do not have embassies in Uganda . These
people are currently receiving counseling from professionals and
comfort from each other.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the attack by Rwandan Hutu Interahamwe rebels was an
organized action. He also confirmed that the killings were not a
result of cross fire between Ugandan troops and the rebels because
there was no military contact between them.
</P>
<P>
A gang of about 150 fully armed Interahamwe rebels attacked
tourist camps in the famous Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in western
Uganda early Monday morning, abducting 32 tourists after killing
the forest warden.
</P>
<P>
Eight foreign tourists including four Britons, two Americans
and two new Zealanders were killed.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni has condemned, in the strongest terms
possible, the brutal attack on the tourists and has ordered
Ugandan troops to pursue the rebels and kill them.
</P>
<P>
 Those countries whose nationals were killed in the incident
also condemned the barbaric act of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A team of secret agents have arrived here from the United
States to help investigate the incident.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Briefs Council on Damages to Iraq's Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Kirkuk pipeline had
been shut down since Sunday evening following damage to a
communications repeater station, a U.N. official said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the United Nations Security Council on the damages to
Iraq's pipeline which was caused by the almost daily confrontation
between the United States, Britain and Iraq, Benon Sevan,
Executive Director of the United Nations office of the Iraq
Program, said oil had not flowed to Ceyhan of Turkey since late
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
But because there were some 2.4 million barrels of oil in
storage at Ceyhan, there had been no interruption in loading it
aboard ships, Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to start loading tomorrow another ship with 1.8
million barrels, and on the Iraqi side, they are trying very hard
to expedite the repairs to the repeater station," Sevan said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi technicians were working on restoring the
communications links severed by damage to the repeater station.
</P>
<P>
"If communications links are restored, pumping of oil could
resume almost immediately," Sevan added.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline from Iraq's Kirkuk to Turkey's Ceyhan carries half
the oil Iraq is permitted to export under the terms of United
Nations Security Council resolutions establishing the oil for food
program.

JERUSALEM -- The Israel Electric Company and the Environment
Ministry have jointly inaugurated an innovative facility that uses
solar and wind energy to desalt sea water.
</P>
<P>
With a budget of 120,000 U.S. dollars, the facility at Kibbutz
Ma'agan Michael produces enough drinking water to meet 50 people's
needs.
</P>
<P>
The system is able to produce drinking water at locations
connected to electricity grids, or those undeveloped areas, as in
many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's metals and electrical sector registered a
4 percent drop in local sales in 1998, totaling 28.5 billion
U.S. dollars, while exports increased by 14 percent, reaching 3.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports of engines and electrical equipment grew by
20.6 percent as compared with those of the previous year,

</P>
<P>
However, the ministry predicted a recovery in the diamond
industry, including an increase in purchases in the world's
diamond exchanges and a 43 percent increase in the imports of
rough diamonds in February compared to February last year.

<HEADLINE> Dumas Accused by Ex-Girlfriend of Sharing Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Former French Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas was accused Wednesday by his ex-girlfriend, Christine
Deviers-Joncour, of sharing the bribes she received from the Elf
oil company.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Joncour to formally charge Dumas
since the scandal involving the present president of France's
highest legal authority, the Council of State, erupted one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
During a testimony with two judges in charge of investigating
the alleged acts of corruption of Dumas when he was foreign
minister under President Francois Mitterrand, Joncour said that
she used the money from Elf to buy Greek antiques for Dumas in
1990.
</P>
<P>
She and Dumas went to an auction sale in a Parisian hotel in
December 1990 and spent 300,000 francs (50,000 U.S. dollars) in
buying 12 Greek statuettes.
</P>
<P>
The money was sent by former Elf president Alfred Sirven, who
asked Joncour to buy these antiques as "gifts" for Dumas, said
Joncour.
</P>
<P>
Sirven is believed to be hiding in Switzerland and is under two
international arrest mandates.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Rene Farthouat, a defense lawyer of Dumas, immediately
denied the accusation and said that Dumas was not aware of the
origin of the money used in purchasing the statuettes.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Dumas only got five statuettes and Joncour
kept seven others for herself.
</P>
<P>
Joncour was suspected to have received 66 million francs (11
million U.S. dollars) of bribes from the Elf from 1989 till 1993.
</P>
<P>
She was believed to have played a role in the agreement by the
French government to sell three fregates to Taiwan in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Elf reportedly paid her commissions for arranging the deal on
behalf of the producer of the fregates, state-owned defense and
electronics group Thomson SA.

<HEADLINE> WHO Places Health Central for Development in 21st </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that it will place health
central in the program of development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The director general of WHO, Gro Harlem Brundtland, told a
seminar here that "my vision is that to put the issue of health
at the core of international development agenda," which will
attract more world attention to women's health.
</P>
<P>
"There is no development without sustainable development," and
it is crucial to educate young women and their children and to
better the environment for the future of humanity, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The 20th century has been a century of remarkable progress for
the rights of women, progress in political rights, progress for
the right to take responsibility for our own lives," she said.
</P>
<P>
But there is also other side for the rights of women at the
moment, she said.
</P>
<P>
Millions and millions of women are denied the political right,
the fundamental human rights, the right to take responsibility for
their own lives, and "millions and millions of women lack the
right to lead a healthy life," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Too many women are infected with HIV, and too many women died
of AIDS," she said. "Too many women do not control their own
lives, do not have the means or environment to take control of
their lives and that of their children."
</P>
<P>
At present, "poverty still has a gender bias," she said. "More
than two out of three of the 1.3 billion living in poverty are
women."
</P>
<P>
Brundtland took office on July 21, 1998. Over the past six
months since her election to the position of WHO's
director-general, she has introduced structural changes in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was co-organized by the Global Alliance for Women's
Health and the International Council of Women.
</P>
<P>
The Global Alliance for Women's Health, a non-governmental
organization in special consultative status with the U.N. Economic
and Social Council is committed to advancing women's health in all
stages of life and at all policy levels through health promotion,
education, advocacy and program implementation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Its Military Actions in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
defended its military actions in Iraq, saying it was acting to
protect the vulnerable population of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council Wednesday morning was
briefed on the damage to Iraq's pipeline caused by the almost
daily airstrikes against Iraq's targets by the United States and
Britain. China, Russia and other Council members condemned the two
countries and urged an immediate end to the military actions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, U.S. Ambassador to the Untied Nations
Nancy Soderberg said, "U.S. forces in the region are acting to
protect the vulnerable population of Iraq and any action we take
is aimed simply to protect our own forces. U.S. pilots have been
increasingly targeted."
</P>
<P>
Soderberg denied her country targeted Iraq's pipeline and said
neither it nor pumping station had been hit.
</P>
<P>
"The area that was hit was in our belief part of the Iraqi air
defense system, the communications area. The Iraqi command and
control is part of the area that is threatening our pilots and we
will continue to move in our self-defense," she added.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline from Iraq's Kirkuk to Turkey's Ceyhan has been
shut down since Sunday due to damage to a communications repeater
station. The pipeline carries half the oil Iraq is permitted to
export under the terms of the United Nations Security Council
resolutions establishing the oil-for-food program.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Encouraged by Progress on Kosovo Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it was encouraged by good progress the ethnic
Albanians had made toward approval for a peace deal on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
""there's good progress with the Kosovars," White House
spokesman David Leavy said. "There's indications that they are
going to officially embrace the political settlement and we are
encouraged by that and we're going to move forward to lock that
in."
</P>
<P>
"I'm told that there has been a very positive session,"
involving special U.S. Kosovo envoy Christopher Hill and the
ethnic Albanians, Leavy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said there had been preliminary discussion about inviting
a delegation representing Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas to
Washington for talks.
</P>
<P>
Washington's strategy is first to persuade the ethnic Albanians
into accepting a peace deal that would give Kosovo substantial
autonomy but would fall short of the independence they seek.
</P>
<P>
It would then increase pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to agree the deployment of NATO peacekeepers in the
province for implementation of the peace accord. If Milosevic
disagrees, NATO would launch air strikes against Serbian military
targets.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to come into compliance and end this crisis is
for Milosevic to sign a new peace agreement... and allow a NATO
military presence," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
About 430 NATO strike and support planes, including 260 U.S.
jets, are poised to carry out orders for military action once
Belgrade refuses NATO's coercive demand for its military presense
in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Strives to Improve Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal Government
launched the second stage of its anti-air-pollution campaign by
proposing a set of 28 measures today in an effort to reduce the
volume of air pollutants in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital is one of the world's ten most polluted
cities. Government officials at all levels in Beijing, including
Mayor Liu Qi, today signed a letter of responsibility promising a
significant improvement in air quality by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting today, Mayor Liu said the city has
achieved successful results in the control of air pollution thanks
to the introduction of 18 measures since last December to control
local air pollution caused by coal burning, auto exhaust emissions,
and dust and suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
A test has shown that the amount of nitride and oxide in
Beijing's air dropped by 10 percent this January compared with the
same month last year, and the sulfur dioxide density fell 17
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The second-stage objective for pollution control aims at
consolidating the achievement of the first stage. The new measures
will emphasize construction site management, the increased use of
natural gas, and auto-exhaust emissions control, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Joins in Discussions of CPPCC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- To promote the rule of law is a
state policy set at the 15th National Congress of the ruling
Communist Party of China (CPC) and to protect the rights and
interests of women and children is an important part of the
socialist legal system.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made the
remarks here today when taking part in panel discussions of
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from science and women
circles who are here to attend the current Second Session of the
Ninth CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
At the discussions, the CPPCC members put forward their
comments and proposals on a number of issues including development
of social sciences, promotion of the rule of law, amendments of
the Constitution, reform of state-owned enterprises, protection of
women's rights and interests, women's the participation in
political affairs, and development of community services.
</P>
<P>
After hearing what the CPPCC members said, Li Peng, also
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, said the political consultation is a unique political
system in China, and he hoped that the CPPCC members would
continue to play their role of political consultation, democratic
supervision and participation in political affairs, so as to push
forward the country's economic construction and various social
undertakings onto a new stage.
</P>
<P>
The amendments of the Constitution is a major event in China
and the Party Central Committee has attached great importance to
the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress, which was held in 1997, set the
goal to develop a socialist market economy in the country and made
Deng Xiaoping Theory and Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought
the country's guiding ideology, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"These principal issues must be reflected in the fundamental
law of the country," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Experience that has been proved successful in our
practice over the past few years should be affirmed through
legislative procedures, in order to constantly improve the
socialist legal system."
</P>
<P>
History has made it clear that China must adhere to the
strategic principle of promoting the rule of law and the will of
the Party and the people should be shown through legal procedures,
he said, noting all the political parties including the ruling CPC
should implement the principle in an all-round and serious manner.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the development of social sciences, Li said social
sciences play an important role in the reform and opening-up drive
as well as in the development of the economic and social fields. "
Social sciences should have due respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Joining in the women CPPCC members, Li said that China has
established a complete legal system to protect the rights and
interests of women and promote gender equality with a number of
laws with the Constitution as the basic law and the Law on
Protection of Women's Rights and Interests as the main body.
</P>
<P>
To protect the rights and interests of women is one of the
symbols of civilization, he said. "Governments at all levels will
redouble their efforts to crack down on criminal activities
against women," he said.

related facilities in its attacks on Iraq.

<P>
"We can state certainly that we don't intentionally target
infrastructure associated with the oil-for-food program, but this

<HEADLINE> Pay Phones Appearing on Cairo Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of red and yellow
telephone booths are appearing on Cairo's streets, the Egyptian
Gazette newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Two private firms, Menatel and Nile Telecom, have won 10-year
renewable licenses from state-owned Egypt Telecom in early 1998 to
install at least 20,000 units respectively in four years time.
</P>
<P>
While mobile telephones are all the rage among Egypt's elite,
the companies say there is an untapped market for card phone
booths for less wealthy users to supplement Egypt Telecom's
coin-operated telephone boxes.
</P>
<P>
"Independent research said Egypt needs 100,000 public pay
phones, so there is a lot of room for expansion," Hesham Gabr,
managing director of Nile Telecom, said.
</P>
<P>
Nile Telecom, which started installing public phones last June,
three months earlier than Menatel, focused initially on Cairo,
Gabr said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are targeting the whole Delta line and Alexandria," a
Mediterranean port city 220 kilometers northwest of Cairo, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Menatel's managing director, Aime Brial, has also said that his
company is confident that it can complete the 20,000 units in
three years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Ethnic, Religious Affairs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called for greater efforts today in ethnic and religious work,
saying correct handling of the ethnic and religious issues has a
direct bearing on the national unity, social stability, economic
development and strong border areas.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang made the remark this afternoon when calling on
some of the National Committee members of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), who are also
representatives from the ethnic groups and religious circle and
are here to attend the on-going Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Also present on the occasion was Li Ruihuan, Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Committee and Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We should unswervingly carry out the ethnic and religious
policies, and improve our work in all fields including the ethnic
and religious field," said Jiang who is also the General Secretary
of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"This is of great significance to maintaining the solidarity
and stability of the nation, to consolidating and furthering a
relationship of equality, unity and mutual assistance among all
nationalities, and to advancing the cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century," he added.
</P>
<P>
Immersed in heated discussions, the CPPCC National Committee
members present at the meeting put forward opinions and
suggestions on topics such as the economic development of the
regions inhabited by ethnic groups and implementation of the
policy of freedom of religious belief.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the discussions of the CPPCC members, Jiang said
the Party and the central government have always attached great
importance to the ethnic and religious work, and have come up with
a correct way to handle the ethnic and religious issues by
implementing ethnic and religious policies with Chinese
characteristics that have the support of the Chinese people of all
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
China is a large family composed of 56 nationalities, and in
socialist China and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party, all nationalities have forged a new relationship, the
ethnic regions have achieved autonomy of ethnic groups, and all
the nationalities enjoy genuine unity and equality, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's B.C. Premier Denies Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Glen Clark, the Premier of Canada's
British Columbia province, denied any wrongdoing Wednesday night,
a day after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided his
east Vancouver house, local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The raid is a part of an investigation into the conditional
grant of a casino license to a man now accused of running an
illegal gambling operation.
</P>
<P>
After spending the day huddled in cabinet offices with advisors,
Premier Clark emerged to admit that a man charged with running an
illegal gambling den was a friend and neighbor.
</P>
<P>
But Clark said he did not influence a government decision that
awarded Dimitrios Pilarinos a license to run a lucrative casino.
</P>
<P>
Dimitrios, who has been charged with keeping a common gaming
house, had close ties to the premier.
</P>
<P>
Not only did their children play together, but Dimitrios did 16,
000 Canadian dollars (10,560 U.S. dollars) worth of renovations to
Clark's home last year, shortly before winning provincial approval
for a casino, said the National Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
That link may explain why commercial crime investigators
searched the premier's home Tuesday night, just three hours after
more than 40 RCMP officers raided the North Burnaby Inn during an
undercover investigation into illegal gambling. It was that raid
that led to Dimitrios' arrest.
</P>
<P>
Clark released a copy of a memorandum prepared by his staff,
confirming his instructions to be insulated from any decision on
the application by Pilarinos for a charity casino license.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Clark's statement, the RCMP issued a brief
statement confirming that their raid on the Premier's home was
connected to their continuing investigation of an application for
a charity casino license.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the search warrant involved did not
allege any criminal activity on the part of Clark.

"Forging and advancing a socialist relationship among all
nationalities have always been a basic principle of our Party in
dealing with ethnic problems, and all the Chinese nationalities,
either the Han nationality or the ethnic groups live together
harmoniously and enjoy equality," the Chinese leader pointed out,
calling for the people of all nationalities to continue to hold
high the banner of nationality unity, adhere to the ethnic
policies of the Party, improve the autonomy of ethnic groups,
oppose activities of any form aimed at splitting the nationality
unity and contribute to the social stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged the areas inhabited by ethnic groups to speed
up their economic development and social progress to enhance the
unity of all nationalities.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and social development in the areas inhabited by
ethnic groups has a direct bearing on the modernization drive of
the whole country," he said, adding that "only when the
development in these areas is accelerated, could the whole Chinese
nation be revitalized."
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of work to do in order to accelerate the
development of the areas inhabited by ethnic groups," Jiang said,
pointing to the fact that the central government has already taken
and will take more special policies and measures in that regard.
</P>
<P>
On the religious issue, Jiang said: "We should first fully
carry out the religious policies of the Party, improve the
handling of religious affairs, and guide the religion to adapt
itself to the socialist society of China."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that respecting and protecting the freedom of
religious belief is a basic policy of the Party and government,
and the Party members should unite with the religious people, and
help them contribute to the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He explained that there are two aspects about guiding the
religion to adapt itself to the socialist society of China. First,
the religious people should abide by laws of socialist China;
secondly, the religious people should contribute as much as
possible to the unity of the motherland and the nationalities and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the important role of the CPPCC members in this
regard, Jiang said their active participation in state affairs
vividly reflects the policies of equality among all nationalities
and freedom of religious belief in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
"In the coming year we need to further stabilize and strengthen
the agricultural sector, deepen reform of state-owned enterprises,
make financial reform a success, as well as boost domestic demand
and ensure social, political stability," the article says.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it says, the general guiding principle for this year'
s work is to unify thinking, boost confidence, seize opportunities
and face up to challenges, and work hard with one heart and one
mind.
</P>
<P>
"This should also become the guiding principle of the Second
Session of the Ninth NPC," it says.
</P>
<P>
It continues to say that over the past two decades since the
Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which started
China's reform and opening-up, the people's congress system has
played a vital role in building China's socialist democracy and
legal system and ensuring a smooth development of the country's
reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, this system has constantly made self-improvement
and has become more and more powerful," says the article, adding
that the Ninth NPC has done a lot of work and achieved new
progress in fields like legislation and supervision since it
convened its first session in March, 1998.
</P>
<P>
It finally calls on people of all ethnic groups across China to
"hold higher the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory", "rally
more closely around the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at its core", and unswervingly march forward along the path of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Friday issue of the People's
Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial hailing
the opening of the Second Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), the country's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
"People are the owners of our country, and the NPC session,
held once every year, is an occasion for people to exercise state
power," says the editorial, titled "People's interests rule
supreme."
</P>
<P>
Describing the upcoming NPC session as "a very important
meeting", the editorial says that the session is of great
significance for greeting the 50th founding anniversary of the
People's Republic of China on October 1 and the return of Macao at
the end of this year, as well as for further promoting the great
cause of China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
"It will also help mobilize, organize and encourage people of
all ethnic groups across the country to do a good job in various
aspects this year," it says.
</P>
<P>
The NPC session, scheduled to open in Beijing tomorrow morning,
will hear and examine a Government Work Report to be delivered by
Premier Zhu Rongji, discuss a draft amendment to the Chinese
Constitution, and deliberate some other draft laws and documents.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that 1998 was a year of great triumphs for
the Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), withstood the strong impact of the Asian
financial crisis, won the battle against the worst flooding in
decades and maintained a steady growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that 1999 will turn out to be a year of
particular significance in the Chinese history, as many major
events are expected to happen this year and the country will have
many difficulties to overcome.

<HEADLINE> Japan's 15 Major Banks Seek 60 Billion U.S. Dollars in Public Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan's 15 major banks on Thursday
applied a total of 7.46 trillion yen (60.8 billion U.S. dollars)
in public funds to replenish their capital bases.
</P>
<P>
The financial Reconstruction Commission (FRC), a government
body charged with recovering the health of the country's ailing
banking sector, is expected to give the go-ahead to the
applications on March 12 and infuse new capital into the banks on
March 30.
</P>
<P>
Under the Japanese government's banking sector bail-out program
enacted last October, 25 trillion yen (203.8 billion dollars) in
public money has been made available to recapitalize banks whose
coffers have been depleted by writing off non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks had shown reluctance to lend to small and medium-
size companies, which constrained the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
By helping the banks, the Japanese government hopes to rebuild
a healthy financial system, in which small and medium-size
companies will be able to borrow funds more freely.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's applications followed the FRC's preliminary approval
February 12 for the financial institutions to take out public
money under the bank clean-up scheme.
</P>
<P>
The fund injections will take the form of the government's
purchasing of preferred shares exchangeable for common stock and
taking out subordinated loans from the 15 banks.
</P>
<P>
The 15 banks include eight "city" banks with nationwide
networks -- Asahi Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Daiwa Bank, Fuji
Bank, Sakura Bank, Sanwa Bank, Sumitomo Bank and Tokai Bank.

SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Dazhong and Ping'an insurance
companies decided today to issue property insurance in the amount

The two insurance companies will insure the bridges and their

<P>
This indicates that the insurance industry is now playing a

project official.
</P>
<P>
The Yangpu Bridge, one of the three construction projects, will
be the cable bridge with the largest cable span in the world.
Another bridge, linking Nanshi and the Pudong New Area, will be
the longest cable bridge in the world.

millions of Americans were focused anew on the lurid details of
the president's past.
</P>
<P>
-- The chief of the United Nations arms inspectors said
Wednesday night allegations that the U.S. used his organization to
spy on Iraq could jeopardize arms control by making governments
suspicious whether ostensibly independent verification is a cover
for espionage.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States heated up two politically contentious
trade disputes with Europe, slapping 100 percent tariffs on 520
million U.S. dollars in European products and threatening to ban
Concordes from American airports.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration told the Court that foreigners
who commit serious nonpolitical crimes outside the United States

</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:

Serbia has broken its October pledge to keep its army in barracks,

MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Thursday signed into law a measure allowing incumbent officials of
the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to serve their
full three-year terms in a drive to accelerate development in the
south.
</P>
<P>
The law postpones the date of elections for ARMM governor, vice
governor and the regional legislative assembly, from March 8 to
the second Monday of September 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the law will help put on the fast track the
development of Mindanao because ARMM officials will no longer be
distracted by politics from doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremonies of the law, Estrada praised the
congress for the speedy passage of the measure, which he said,
comes at a time when his administration is vigorously pursuing a
lasting peace agreement with Muslim rebels in the south.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that a stable political environment in
Mindanao is critical for the island to attain peace and progress,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban, Opposition to Meet on March 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi said here Thursday that the Afghan
Taliban militia and the opposition will hold a meeting in
Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, on March 10.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Thursday afternoon, Brahimi, who
arrived here last week on his fresh peace mission, urged the
militia and the opposition to go to the Ashgabat meeting in a
spirit of "compromise and constructiveness."
</P>
<P>
"This is the real chance and I hope they will not waste it," he
said. "On behalf of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, I appeal to
the two parties to go to the talks with the spirit of compromise,
understanding, patience and constructiveness."
</P>
<P>
"I very much hope that they will give this opportunity a chance
and explore the possibility of achieving peace and indeed
achieving their ends through peaceful means rather than resorting
to war," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the war has not led to the solution of their
problems and the two Afghan delegations should capitalize on the
new opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the Afghan rival parties is to take place
in the capital of Turkmenistan against the backdrop of hectic
diplomatic efforts by the United Nations and the Organization of
the Islamic Conference backed by Afghanistan's immediate
neighbors, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is encouraging the Six Plus Two group to
hold its proposed meeting in Uzbek capital of Tashkent later this
year for the restoration of durable peace in the war-torn
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The group comprises Afghanistan's six immediate neighboring
countries -- Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and China -- plus the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The group has been holding discussions in New York on how to
help restore lasting peace in Afghanistan, Brahimi said,
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the neighboring countries to extend their
wholehearted support to the Ashgabat negotiations and encourage
the Afghans to achieve a positive conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the U.N. staff's return to
Afghanistan, Brahimi said negotiations with the Taliban on
security concerns are under way and he hoped the assessment of the
report about the talks will be positive.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. staff will go back to Afghanistan if the result of the
discussions with the Taliban is positive, he added.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi made a one-day visit to Afghanistan on Sunday and held
talks with Taliban leaders in the capital of Kabul. He later
described the talks as "very constructive."
</P>
<P>
The special envoy will leave here Friday for Tehran, Iran, and
he will also go to Central Asian states. He is expected to have
discussions with leaders of these countries with the focus on the
Afghan issue.

After hearing what He and other CPPCC members said, Zhu, also
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), thanked
the CPPCC members for their support to the government in its work
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China made achievements that attracted world
attention in its reforms, opening up and modernization drive
despite severe domestic and international conditions last year and
this should go to the people of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
"These achievements fully demonstrated that the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core is strong, powerful and
absolutely capable of handling various complicated situations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If the whole nation earnestly implement policies and strategic
plans of the CPC Central Committee, we will definitely be able to
overcome all difficulties and obstacles on our road of advance,"

</P>
<P>

reforms and do a better job in every field this year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on HK's Prosperity &AMP; Macao's Return (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang went on to praise the government of the Hong Kong SAR
headed by Tung Chee-hwa for its outstanding work in preserving
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and running government
affairs in accordance with the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law, the region'
s mini-constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The central government and people of all ethnic groups across
the country will continue to give full support to the work of the
SAR government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that, while still faced with quite a few
difficulties, Hong Kong also enjoys a lot of favorable conditions
for maintaining its prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Sustained economic growth in the interior areas, the central
government's strong support for Hong Kong enterprises investing in
interior areas and its support for various measures taken by the
SAR government to promote local economy will serve as a reliable
guarantee for a thriving and stable Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in Hong Kong's development prospects,"
he said. "It is the common aspiration of all Chinese across the
world that Hong Kong maintain its long-term prosperity and
stability, and no difficulty can prevent this beautiful wish from
coming true."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Chinese government's resumption of its exercise
of sovereignty over Macao on December 20 this year, Jiang said
that this will be another significant event in the history of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Macao to its motherland marks a complete ending
for the history of foreign occupation of and rule over a piece of
Chinese territory, and the resolution of the Macao issue will set
another successful example for seeking motherland reunification
according to the principle of 'one country, two systems'," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that he has full confidence in Hong Kong's long-term
prosperity and stability, as well as in a smooth return of Macao
to its motherland at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"'One country, two systems' is a fundamental principle which
the central government will unswervingly adhere to," Jiang, also
general-secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, told government advisors from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and Macao during a meeting this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China'
s top advisory body, was also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong and Macao members of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee are here for the ongoing second session of the committee,
which opened Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that over the past 20 months since Hong Kong's
return to its motherland and the founding of the Hong Kong SAR,
the principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong
have been fully implemented in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Today's Hong Kong has witnessed no changes to its original
social and economic systems or way of life, and the legal system
there has remained basically unchanged," said Jiang. "Facts have
proved that the principle of 'one country, two systems' is both
pragmatic and feasible, and has great vitality."
</P>
<P>
"In both interior areas and Hong Kong, we must conscientiously
safeguard this principle when we do anything or handle any
problems, and must not do any harm to it," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Quits European Table Tennis League Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will withdraw from next
season's European Table Tennis League to protest the way the
competition is run, a senior table tennis official said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to change the way the league's competition system so
far, but the European Table Tennis Federation(ETTF) turned a deaf
ear to our opinion, so we have to opt to quit the league next
season," said Orjan Nilsson, president of Sweden National Table
Tennis Management Committee, Wednesday night,
</P>
<P>
Nilsson said the Sweden Table Tennis Association made the
decision a month ago for the ETTF declined to take its proposal of
adopting the knockout system to slash the number of games in the
league.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the league have to put themselves through the
group stages and then qualifiers before they finally reach the
finals.
</P>
<P>
The league profile has been lowered for the big number of games,
which scared many well-known players withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Big guns such as Jan-Ove Walderner and Joegen Persson, both
from Sweden, have skipped the event since last year, while Germany
and France are sending their second-string players to take part in
the tournament.

<HEADLINE> International Pirate Gang Uncovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have cracked a
murder case masterminded by international pirates.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 people have been arrested on charges of killing 23
Chinese seamen, said a spokesman for the Guangdong Provincial
Public Security Department at a press briefing held here today in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Police also seized seven guns, two iron-clad ships and other
booty.
</P>
<P>
A cargo ship belonging to a Hong Kong shipping company left the
port of Shanghai on November 12 last year after being loaded with
14,000 tons of slag at the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex. The
ship was manned by 23 Chinese sailors. No information was received
on the ship's whereabouts after it reported its location at sea
near Dongshan Island in east China's Fujian Province on November
16.
</P>
<P>
Seven bodies bound up and weighted with iron ingots were
spotted on the surface of the sea near the city of Shanwei and
Lufeng and Huilai counties between December 2 and 22. A few days
later, three more bodies were seen in the region. Preliminary
investigations revealed they were the bodies of Chinese seamen who
had been aboard the cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
A suspect was detained on January 3, and he confessed and
related the entire story to authorities including the whereabouts
of the two chief criminals, one an Indonesian. Police later
arrested more suspects in Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, Liaoning and
Shaanxi provinces and in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed the murders belonged to an
international gang of pirates whose ringleaders were from
Southeast Asia. They recruited more than a dozen criminals in
Henan and Sichuan provinces and provinces in northeast China, and
purchased guns and ships.
</P>
<P>
On November 16, they robbed the cargo ship, killed all 23
Chinese seamen on aboard and threw their bodies into the sea. On
November 26, the pirates handed the ship over to a dozen foreign
seamen who then sailed it out into the high sea.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Writer Bids Farewell to Century-Long Literary Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The death of veteran Chinese
writer Bing Xin, who passed away for heart failure after spending
four years and five months in hospital on February 28 at the age
of 99, has hit the headlines in all the major Chinese media.
</P>
<P>
An activist among the students in the May 4th Movement in 1919
which called for democracy and freedom in China, Bing Xin began to
impress literary circles with her novels questioning the
unfairness of society and the way out for her generation.
</P>
<P>
As one of the earliest translators of Tagore's poems, she began
to write the free lyrical verses with a sentimental and beautiful
style and soon many followed her example.
</P>
<P>
Another masterpiece of hers is To Young Readers, a series of
letters covering nearly half a century, including memories of her
time in Wellesley College in the States as a literature
postgraduate, her meditations on the everlasting themes of life in
the Chinese Anti-Japanese War, and her advice on finding a better
future after the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Bing Xin returned to New China in 1951 with her husband Wu
Wenzao, a Ph.D. of Columbia University and one of the pioneers of
Chinese sociology and anthropology.
</P>
<P>
Wu was tagged a "rightist" in 1957, a derogatory name for anti-
socialist intellectuals and died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"Now only you can help him to survive this difficult period,"
Premier Zhou Enlai once said to Bing Xin.
</P>
<P>
Bing Xin was ordered to clean the toilets for the Chinese
Writer's Association for two years.
</P>
<P>
"Life is never free of setbacks," Bing Xin often told her
daughters Wu Qing and Wu Bing, who are now professors with
Beijing Foreign Studies University.
</P>
<P>
Just before US president Richard Nixon's historical visit to
China in 1972 Wu Wenzao and Bing Xin were called back from the
countryside and took part in translating Six Crises by Nixon and
later Outline of History by H.G. Wells.
</P>
<P>
Bing Xin was applauded by intelligentsia and the public for her
outspokenness when she was in her 80s. She wrote quite some social
critiques calling for more input into education and better
conditions for intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Many readers responded by writing to her saying they were in
tears, praising her as the conscience of society, according to
Bing Xin's eldest son Wu Ping, an architect and a graduate from
the prestigious Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Bing Xin once donated 90,000 yuan (about 10,800 U.S. dollars to
a foundation for the education of Chinese rural women. And in her
will she donated all her savings to help the schooling of rural
children and the Contemporary Chinese Literary Museum.
</P>
<P>
Heart-broken by the flood victims last summer, she donated 12,
000 yuan (about 1,400 US dollars) to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
A long-cherished wish of Bing Xin was to write a novel on the
Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, when her father, a general on a
Qing Dynasty warship, swam back home after the miserable defeat of
China.
</P>
<P>
Bing Xin couldn't help crying, thinking of the pains and
humiliations that her father and all the nation had endured and
had to cancel the writing plan because of her deep emotional
involvement.
</P>
<P>
As a supporter of euthanasia, the veteran writer had always
regarded death as a natural thing. "I came to this world silently,
and I also want a quiet good-bye," said this prestigious writer
who has eyewitnessed the vicissitudes of the whole century.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Holds First Press Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) --The Second Session of the National
People's Congress will be held between March 5-15 in Beijing,
according to the session's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important session to be held at an important time and
a major event in the political life of the Chinese people,"
Spokesman Zeng Jianhui said at the session's first press
conference held here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Zeng briefed reporters on the session's agenda and the
legislative work of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee of this term pays special attention
to the quality of legislation and has introduced new ways for the
enactment of laws, he said. It solicits views and opinions about
laws from all social circles and publishes law drafts on
newspapers to get people's views on them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Law makers, including NPC Standing Committee Chairman Li Peng,
have made frequent fact-finding tours to grassroots units, where
they have done research and obtained first-hand materials that
have a bearing on legislation.
</P>
<P>
"Now drafts for some important laws and decisions have to go
through three rounds of examinations and deliberations by the NPC
Standing Committee before their enactment,compared with two rounds
in the past," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the legislature's supervisory role, the NPC
Standing Committee sent six work groups to localities in the past
year to check on the implementation of six laws and decisions. A
feed-back mechanism has been put in place to end non-enforcement
or slack enforcement of laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee will speed up drafting a law on
supervision, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a subordinate institution of the National People's Congress,
the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative
Region (PCMSAR) is working at high gear and in good order.
</P>
<P>
The just concluded PCMSAR's 6th meeting produced a namelist of
candidates for a Selecting Committee for the first Macao SAR
government. The Selecting Committee will be officially voted into
being at the preparatory committee's next meeting, Zeng said.

various parts of the country today stood on the rostrum of a
meeting focusing on their achievements, and demonstrated women's
modern image of self-esteem and self-confidence.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Second Resettlement Program On Yangtze River under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 4(Xinhua) -- China has started its second
population resettlement program along the Yangtze River to make
way for the Three Gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
The first one is still going on along the upper reaches of the
river. The second involves moving nearly twice the number of
people, or about 2 million. Premier Zhu Rongji calls it "a
strategic move that follows the laws of nature".
</P>
<P>
The filling in of wetlands for farm use has been cited as the
main cause of the flood disasters on the river in recent years by
the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering,
who have explained that, since the 1950s, the amount of arable
land has grown by 9,000 sq km, 6,700 sq km of that from filled in
lakes. The present size of these catch basins along the river is
just 40 percent of their size in 1949, the year of national
liberation.
</P>
<P>
When the program is completed, the floodwater capacity of the
Yangtze will increase by over 10 billion cu.m., nearly half of the
projected storage capacity of the Three Gorges Dam. Eighty percent
of the 940,000 people that were left homeless by the disastrous
floods last summer have moved to new homes. In the next three to
five years, more than a million people in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu,
Anhui and Jiangxi provinces will be moved out of low lying areas.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new settlements are just a few kilometers away from
the old residences. One farmer explains that he can still do farm
his land as usual, but during the flood seasons it will be covered
with water. Then it can be used again when the water recedes.
</P>
<P>
"One of the program's primary aims is to deal with the threat
to people's lives," says Li Antian, director of the Water Resource
Ministry's Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most flood control efforts involved reinforcing
embankments. The central government has used 4 billion yuan for
that over the past four decades and a great deal of labor, but
with little effect, Li says. Last year's floods alone caused 200
billion yuan worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
Farmers were aroused and organized to mend and reinforce dykes
in the cold winter time and to fight floods in the hot summer
almost every year and it cost a great deal of manpower and money,"
says Yang Daozhou, an official in a village at Shenhuangzhou on
the outskirts of Shishou city, where more than 1,000 residents
have been displaced. He says that the new village is taking the
shape of a small town.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated 2.5 billion yuan for this
program, or 15,000 yuan per household.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprise Reform Must Rely on Working Class, Wei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the ruling
Communist Party of China (CPC) called for relying wholeheartedly
on the working class when reforming and developing state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC
Central Committee Political Bureau, made the call here today at a
group discussion attended by members of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference in session here since yesterday.
</P>
<P>
A major task in 1999 is to push ahead with reform and
development of state-owned enterprises, he said. "The Party's
principle of depending on the working class wholeheartedly should
be carried out unswirvingly" in the process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei is also a member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat
and president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
This year, Wei said, efforts will be made to reinforce the
workers' conference system with emphasis to be placed on making
factory affairs public. The system is a basic one with Chinese
characteristics and is one of the political advantages of the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The leading unionist said that workers have the right to be
informed, a right that belongs to them as masters of the
enterprise. "Being informed is a precondition for the promotion of
enterprise reform through relying on workers and staff," he said.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the principle of relying wholeheartedly on
the working class should be combined with efforts to build a
modern enterprise system for state enterprises, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the deepening of state enterprise reform
should be integrated with the strengthening of a supervisory
mechanism in such firms. Representatives of workers and staff
should sit on the board of directors and board of supervisors, he
said.

SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A newborn baby girl weighing only
755 grams has survived for a week, the longest time ever for an
infant of this size.
</P>
<P>
The tiny infant was born on February 26 at the Shanghai No. 1
People's Hospital after a pregnancy of 33 weeks. The 30-year-old
mother, Liu, became pregnant six times since she married eight
years ago, but all previous pregnancies ended in miscarriages.

Hong Jianguo, a local pediatrician, said, "Seldom has medical
history recorded a case of a newborn weighing under 1,000 grams
surviving. Survival of low-weight newborns after preventing
miscarriage is even rarer."
</P>
<P>
The girl is living in an incubator and nurses are monitoring
her around-the-clock, and her parents can look at her through a

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Suggest Rules for Gov't Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Second Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) said that China has to
establish a legislation governing government procurement as soon
as possible so as to meet the need of the socialist market-driven
economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongli from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences said
that the current practice of allocating purchasing funds to
various government institutions has caused such problems as blind
and duplicated purchases and unfairness in competition.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Chinese government administrative
institutions spend 700 billion yuan on procurement every year.
</P>
<P>
The practice of allowing individual institutions to decide what
to buy incurred losses to government funds, according to Lu Xueyi,
director of the Sociology Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said that the practice lacks transparency and leaves
loopholes for a small number of people to pocket government money
when they handle the procurement.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Chongqing city, Hebei and Shandong provinces have
initiated government purchases in certain fields on a trial basis.
Now a dozen provincial governments in China have introduced the
way of government purchase.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from Shandong province said that the provincial
government is to expand the scope of government purchase from cars
and computers to most other fields.
</P>
<P>
They said that China needs a law or regulations governing the
government procurement.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen city, a special economic zone in south China's
Guangdong province, has passed a set of regulations governing its
procurement earlier this year, the first of its kind in the
country.

MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Thursday that his administration is not resorting to a

"We are exhausting all remedies to see the peace process will

Earlier, some politicians, including former President Fidel V.
Ramos, advised Estrada to refrain from resorting to a military

But Estrada said Ramos did not need to give him that advice
since he is resolved to ensure the success of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> China to Protect Northeastern Black Soil Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China will make further efforts to
protect the fertile black soil area in the northeastern part of
the country, legislators from northeast China's Jilin Province
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The northeastern region each year produces some 35 million
tons of commercial grains and is therefore reputed as China's 'big
barn'. The black soil area in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces
provides the region's best farmland," said Liu Xiang, a Jilin
deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a research fellow with the Jilin Provincial Institute of
Agricultural Sciences, is here for the upcoming annual session of
the Ninth NPC, scheduled to open tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, Liu said, the Chinese government has
taken a series of measures, such as planting trees to form shelter
forest belts, to maintain natural conditions in the black soil
area.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, part of the land in this area has
shown signs of deterioration as a result of long-time cultivation,
with the land's content of organic substance and its fertility
level keeping on dropping, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, natural shields for the black soil area,
which mainly refer to natural forests in the Changbai Mountains to
the east of the area and the large area of grassland to its west,
have gradually diminished due to excessive logging and
desertification.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shaoming, another Jilin lawmaker, said that his province
is now making active efforts to persuade local farmers to abandon
traditional farming techniques and turn to an ecology-friendly
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage farmers to adopt crop rotation and replace
chemical fertilizers with organic manure," said Yang, who is also
head of the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to plant more trees in the shelter
forest belts, gradually cut the size of the logging industry in
the Changbai Mountains and improve the ecological environment in
the western grassland area to prevent any further loss of land to
desert, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Once these measures take effect, grain production in the black
soil area can be further raised," he said. "We expect that grain
output in northeast China will increase by at least 18 million
tons by the year 2005, which can feed half of the 90 million
people to be born in China over the same period."

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains, Stocks Inch Up in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar climbed against the
yen in Tokyo on Thursday due to the fall in Japanese interest
rates and increasing expectations that the Bank of Japan (BOJ)
will take steps to further ease monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 122.57-60 yen, its lowest point
so far this year, at closing, up from 121.93-96 yen at opening and
from 121.80-90 yen in New York late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the overnight call rate to near zero persuaded
market participants, particularly overseas players, to sell the
yen against the dollar, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the stock market, share prices moved marginally higher, led
mainly by exporters, which were bought on the U.S. dollar's
advance against the yen.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 13.09 points, or 0.09
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 14,183.45.

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, added 5.30 points or 0.48 percent to 1,105.

Turnover on the major section declined to 389.33 million shares

<HEADLINE> China Closing More Mountain Areas For Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China plans to close off 48
million ha of mountain areas for afforestation in the next 12
years, according to the National Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2010 the country will have added 33 million ha
of forests. This method has been used traditionally in China
because of the low cost and quick yield. It is used especially in
remote areas of severe water and soil erosion, according to an
administration official.
</P>
<P>
China has already put more than 30 million ha of mountain areas
under restrictions, but the official admitted that, because of a
lack of awareness and investment by local governments, some closed
off areas have not been protected well and there are still 48
million ha of mountain areas that need to be closed.
</P>
<P>
To make certain the plan takes effect, the NAF will designate 3.
2 million ha of mountain areas as key areas, where forests, bushes,
and wasteland will be closed.

<HEADLINE> Fund Collects 120 Million Yuan for Tibet's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Aid Tibet Fund has collected
over 120 million yuan (14 million U.S. dollars) in the past 11
years for launching some 420 cultural, educational and welfare
projects within the autonomous region and some other areas
inhabited by Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman at the fund's headquarters here, the
non-government fund collected 23 million yuan (2.7 million dollars)
in 1998 for the building of over 30 social development projects.
</P>
<P>
Those funds focused on eye-sight restoration for Tibet's
cataract patients last year during which more than 2,000 Tibetans
had their eyesight restored thanks to 12 million yuan (1.4 million
dollars) provided by the fund.
</P>
<P>
It also offered funds for building primary schools in the
region's most remote counties, the protection of cultural relics,
rural clinics and running technical training courses for rural
women and launching aid-the-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
When the Ngari, Xigaze, Nagqu prefectures were hit by
snowstorms last winter and southern Tibet was hit by heavy floods
last summer the fund managed to collect over 1.7 million yuan (200,
000 dollars) for disaster relief, on top of relief funds from the
central government.
</P>
<P>
The new funds will be spent on aid-the-poor and eye-sight
restoration programs this year.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong 1999-2000 Budget Wins Wide Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The 1999-2000 Budget unveiled
Wednesday by Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen
received wide applauds from different sectors of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Trade Development Council welcomed the
Budget's focus on strengthening Hong Kong's fundamental and long-
term competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"It's Hong Kong facing reality, standing up and telling the
world in very specific terms how we're going to make ourselves
more attractive as the region's international business hub," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the measures and initiatives announced would
lobster Hong Kong's lead in traditional areas of strength, such as
financial services and help move the economy into new business
frontiers.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) fully supports the
Government in its radical reform of Kong Kong's securities and
futures market. The Financial Secretary announced Wednesday that
Hong Kong will merge its two exchanges, the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, and their associated
clearing houses, into an eventually listed commercial entity.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sheng, SFC chairman, said: "In the face of global
competition, we need to consolidate and upgrade our competitive
capacity. The SFC believes that through implementation of this
reform Hong Kong's market infrastructure will be well placed to
meet the competitive challenges of the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Futures Exchange,
and Hong Kong Clearing all welcomed and supported the proposed
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Retailer &AMP; Tourism Services of Hong Kong
applauded the government's plan to build a Disney theme park, a
major initiative to boost Hong Kong's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
"It will enhance the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a tourist
destination and stimulate the retail and restaurant industry. It
will also benefit Hong Kong's economy in the long term," said the
Association's chairman Frank Lee.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Henry Tang, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries,
said: "We are particularly pleased that the Government will set up
a special Task Force to consider how best to remove restrictions
on mainland scientists and highly-skilled technologists entering
Hong Kong to work."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the reduction in re-export declaration by half,
from 0.05 percent to 0.025, as well as a 10 percent rebate on the
1997-1998 final assessments of salaries, profits and property
taxes," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Both measures will help to relieve the present credit crunch
experienced by many of Hong Kong's small and medium enterprises
and should also encourage more investment into Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary Wednesday presented to the Legislative
Council the Budget, putting forward a string of bold initiatives
to help relieve immediate economic pain, strengthen economic
foundations and prepare Hong Kong for the new millennium. The
budget is the second one of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region.

Trade Organization, and hoped that goal could be realized this
year.

JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday rejected
a proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon to delay
the general elections for the sake of forging an emergency
national unity government. Netanyahu stressed that he wants the
elections to be held on time.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz
</P>
<P>
-- Senior officers of Israeli army Wednesday sharply
criticized the candidates who are campaigning for Israel's prime
ministerial elections on May, for "using the recent casualties in
Lebanon for political gain."
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern that turning the unilateral
withdrawal from Lebanon into a central issue in the election
campaign will greatly weaken Israel's deterrent power against the
Hezbollah guerrillas and lower the soldiers' morale.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon Wednesday was
questioned by the police for eight hours about suspicions that he
may have peddled favors to retired general Avigdor Ben-Gal in
exchange for favorable testimony in a libel suit.
</P>
<P>
During the questioning, Sharon denied that he had offered
bribes to Ben-Gal for his testimony against the local daily
Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
Sharon had sued Haaretz for stating that, as defense minister
in 1982, he led Israel into a full-scale war in Lebanon without
the consent of the then prime minister Menachem Begin.

HANGZHOU, March 4 (XINHUA) -- The second Sino-United States
Security Seminar, jointly sponsored by China's Foundation for
International Strategic Studies (FISS), the US-based Harvard
University and Stanford University, was held over the last four
days in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was attended by such VIPs from both countries as
FISS's senior consultant Wang Daohan, ex-Chinese ambassador to the
US Li Daoyu, and top US military officials headed by former
defense secretary William Perry. The first was convened in Hawaii
last year.
</P>
<P>
All the delegates agreed that in 1999 Sino-US diplomatic ties,
which were established 20 years ago , have entered a new era of
development as both countries are making efforts to enhance
bilateral dialogues through various flexible channels, and seeking
common ground while reserving divergence, so as to play
constructive roles in stabilizing bilateral ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese delegates pointed out that at the present stage,
factors affecting stability and security are far from being
diminished either within the regional or the global sphere.
Moreover, regional turmoil and conflicts are deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The key to solving these problems is to establish a kind of
active and equal multi-lateral security co-operation so as to
dissolve contradictions through mutual trust and understanding.
</P>
<P>
The resort to unilateral efforts and brutal interference are
not helpful to the fundamental solution of any hostility or crisis,
they noted.
</P>
<P>
The delegates stressed that the Taiwan issue is the center of
Sino-US relations. Both the arms sales to Taiwan and the inclusion
of Taiwan into the theater missile defense system will severely
harm the stability of the region, and finally threaten bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side called on the U.S. to pay full attention to
the issue and take appropriate measures to achieve a final
solution.
</P>
<P>
The US delegation holds that consensus exceeds divergence, and
co-operation surpasses contradictions between the two countries.
China is getting increasingly constructive and responsibility-
conscious in both regional and international affairs, and the U.S.
is not willing to - in fact it is impossible - to sever its co-
operation with China. Also, a sound U.S-China relationship is
conductive to the reform and development cause that China is now
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
They affirmed that the U.S. will neither participate nor
interfere in relations across the Taiwan straits, and welcome any
efforts that are conducive to a peaceful reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> 48 Parties to Contest June Election in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Commission on
Elections Thursday announced that it is recommending 48 political
parties to contest in the June 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
Commission chairman Nurcholis Madjid made the announcement
after a meeting with Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid here to
submit the results of the team's verification of the registered
parties' qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The 48 parties include the ruling Golkar (Functional Group),
the Indonesian Democratic Party, the United Development Party, the
Indonesian Democratic Party for the People's Struggle, the
National Awakening Party, the Justice and Unity Party, and the
National Mandate Party.
</P>
<P>
Nurcholis said his team had carried out the factual and
administrative verification of more than a hundred parties which
had registered at the Attorney General's Office on February 22-27
and March 2-3.
</P>
<P>
To determine party eligibility, team members visited provinces
set as the verification targets from February 22 to March 3.
</P>
<P>
The new political laws determine that political parties
eligible to take part in the June 7 general election must have
chapters in at least 9 provinces with executive boards, as well as
having regional boards in at least 50 percent of the provinces'
regencies or municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The June election will elect a new House of Representatives,
whose members will be part of the 700-strong People's Consultative
Assembly, the nation's highest legislative body, which will select
the next president.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party elections are one of the political reforms
launched by President B.J. Habibie's administration.
</P>
<P>
Under former president Soeharto, who was forced down on May 21
last year, only three parties were allowed to contest the
elections.
They were the Golkar, the United Development Party and the
Indonesian Democratic Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Juan Somavia of Chile took office
here Thursday to become the first representative from the southern
hemisphere to head the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed internationally to promote open societies and
open economies," said Somavia, who was elected by the ILO
Governing Body on March 23, 1998. "That consensus will not hold if
real benefits for ordinary people and their families are not put
into the equation."
</P>
<P>
Unlike other United Nations agencies, ILO has a tripartite
structure involving governments, employers and workers.
</P>
<P>
"I have the responsibility to modernize and help steer the
tripartite structure to make ILO values prevail in the new global
realities," said Somavia, the ninth Director-General of the Geneva-
based ILO since its founding in 1919,.
</P>
<P>
ILO has been the source of such industrial society hallmarks as
the eight-hour working day, maternity protection, child labor laws
and a whole range of policies promoting workplace safety and
peaceful industrial relations.
</P>
<P>
Born on April 21, 1941, Somavia earned degrees in law and
economics from the Catholic University of Chile and the University
of Paris. He is an attorney by profession and has had a long and
distinguished career in civil and international affairs.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollars Weighed Down by Yen Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A struggling Japanese yen and
historically low commodity prices weighed down on the Australian
dollar Thursday, with the domestic currency shedding nearly half a
U.S. cent.
</P>
<P>
MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's currency strategist Alex Douglas said
commodity prices stuck around 24-year lows continued to drag the
local unit down and a rally in U.S. dollar/yen helped erode
Wednesday's GDP-inspired gains.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading the Australian dollar was buying 62.09
U.S. cents, from Wednesday night's close of 62.53.
</P>
<P>
During the day it hit a high of 62.30 U.S. cents and fell to a
low of 62.06.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the U.S. dollar during afternoon trading rallied
to a high of 122.78 Japanese yen, closing at 122.34 yen from
121.00 previously. "That was what triggered a bit of selling in
Aussie," he said.
</P>
<P>
Douglas also noted that a continued slump in a leading
commodity index was having an ongoing impact on the Australian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index closed Wednesday
night at 184.05 points, down 0.41. "In historical terms it's at
its 24-year lows," Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 0.5713 euro from 0.5724 and
the local note was also trading at 75.89 Japanese yen from 75.53.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The trial of Dinko Sakic, 77, former head of the
concentration camp of Jasenovac under the fascist regime of
Croatia during World War II, is due to open on Thursday in Zagreb.
Sakic, who was held responsible for the death of tens of thousands
of Serbs, Jews and Gypgsies, regrets nothing, while Croatia
remains a country which has difficulty in facing up to its past.
</P>
<P>
-- NATO has welcomed the announcement by Kosovo Albanians,
including the Kosovo Liberation Army, to sign the peace agreement
presented by the six-nation Contact Group. NATO secretary general
Javier Solana also appealed to the Serbs on Wednesday to follow
the suit, and warned that the remaining time before the resumption
of talks on Kosovo in France on March 15 is not for preparing war
but for cooperation and the search for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The sex scandal of the White House involving Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky has turned into a real business, as the former
White House intern has earned at least two million U.S. dollars by
granting interviews and biographies to television, the press and
publishers in both America and Europe. The French television
channel TF1 will also have an exclusive interview with Lewinsky
Thursday evening with the title ``Monica Lewinsky: My Truth.''
Europeans and Americans are provided with different products by
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations special commission on human rights in
Geneva has recommended the trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders by
the International Tribunal for ``crimes against humanity.'' But in
Cambodia, people are more concerned about food than revenge. In
Phnom Penh, the government is more and more inclined toward an
amnesty, but the call for the prevention of a return of terror
like that of the Khmer Rouge era is on the rise.

<HEADLINE> ILO Governing Body Meets to Determine Priorities in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The policymakers of the
International Labor Organization (ILO) met here Thursday to
discuss plans to sharpen the strategic focus of the organization's
activities in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The plans are at the heart of a program and budget proposal
presented by the new ILO Director-General, Juan Somavia, who
officially took office on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 481-million-dollar biennial budget proposal for 2000-2001
set out four strategic objectives for ILO at the turn of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
They include the promotion and realization of fundamental
principles and rights at work; the creation of greater
opportunities for women and men to secure decent employment and
income; the enhancement of the coverage and effectiveness of
social protection for all; and the strengthening of tripartism and
social dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other United Nations agencies, ILO has a tripartite
structure involving governments, employers and workers.
</P>
<P>
The new director-general described the budget proposal as "an
integral part of a wider process of change that will include the
establishment of clear priorities, reallocation of resources and
adaptation of the organization's management structures and program
activities to translate these priorities into action".
</P>
<P>
A special meeting will be held here on March 19-20 to discuss
the situation in Asia in detail.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Not Decided on WTO Chief Candidate Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday eased Thailand's concern about the
U.S. stand on Thailand's bid for the World Trade Organization
(WTO) top post.
</P>
<P>
The United States has not "publicly" announced its endorsement
for any of the four candidates for the post, Albright told a joint
press conference with Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is seeking U.S. support for its Deputy Prime Minister
and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, one of the four
candidates vying for the WTO top post.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Supachai was facing obstacles because the
United States snubbed his bid. U.S. officials traveling with
Albright to Thailand said Supachai is not Washington's first
choice for the job.
</P>
<P>
"We've indicated a preference for Canadian Roy Maclaren and New
Zealand's Mike Moore based on the fact that their policy views and
their vision of the WTO are more 'compatible' with ours," said a
senior U.S. state department official traveling with Albright.
</P>
<P>
"We have told the Thais we have very high regards for Supachai,
but it's a question of policy," he said as Albright arrived in
Thailand on Wednesday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Asked by Surin at the press conference to clarify the U.S.
stand, Albright said, "We have not publicly endorsed any candidate
and have not ruled out any of the four candidates." The fourth
candidate is Moroccan former trade minister Hassan Abouyoub.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand and the United States agree on the importance of the
WTO and the need for a strong leadership in world trade system.
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Thailand also agree that the WTO should
choose a new director-general as soon as possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the United States wants to choose a candidate who has
"the policy position and vision for the WTO that could most
closely correspond to our own."
</P>
<P>
Members of the largest world trade body have been busy choosing
a new director-general to replace Italy's Renato Ruggiero, whose
term expires at the end of April. Supachai is reportedly the
front-runner but the decision has been delayed by lack of
consensus.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among WTO members have been going on for months
and the members are to establish which candidate can be appointed
by consensus. Only if that cannot be established could a formal
vote be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer
avoiding such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general
has to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure
whose appointment is opposed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
The world trade body chief will have to steer the organization
to the expected launch in December of fresh global trade
organizations, and to last until 2003.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the WTO and its predecessor, the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, have been headed by a European, and
developing countries have been increasingly vocal in calling for
appointment of a figure from their midst.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has promised to bridge the gap between developing
economies and richer nations if he wins the position.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has already won backing from Japan and other Asian
countries and has earned international respect for his role in
ensuring that Thailand resisted pressure to put up trade barriers
in reaction to the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Government Policy on Minorities' Education Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- In recent years, governments at
all levels have attached unprecedentedly great importance to and
given the strongest-ever support to education for the people of
ethnic minorities, said Ma Guochang, a deputy to the National
People's Congress and headmaster of the Hui People Middle School
in Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Ma's view is shared by many other deputies who are here to
attend the upcoming Second Session of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
The Hui People Middle School recruits over 1,200 students from
several ethnic groups including Hui, Dongxiang, Tibetan and
Mongolian. Over the past few years, the city government has
allocated special funds to help the school build a number of new
facilities and purchase advanced equipment.
</P>
<P>
"With these new facilities and equipment, I would feel guilty
if the quality of teaching cannot reach required standards," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jin Zhuhua, an ethnic Korean NPC deputy from Liaoning Province
in the northeast, is the principal of the Central Primary School
for Korean People in Lishizhai Zhai Town. She told Xinhua that her
school has been equipped with modern facilities including
computers and many other pieces of hi-tech teaching equipment.
</P>
<P>
"We want our students to be capable of competing in the 21st
century," the 31-year old woman said. Lishizhai Town is densely
populated by ethnic Koreans, a minority group in China that has
paid greater attention to education.
</P>
<P>
China has 55 minority groups, whose combined population
accounts for about eight percent of the country's total. The
Chinese government has made strenuous efforts to develop local
economy in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities through
invigorating education there.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhirong, an NPC deputy from the southernmost province of
Hainan, is a first- generation university student of the Li ethnic
group and now a leading government official in his hometown, the
Baisha Li Autonomous County.
</P>
<P>
Chen's forefathers had to memorize things by making knots on a
string. "Ethnic minority people must rely on education to bring up
their new generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, currently, there are more
than 15 million students and over 700,000 teachers of ethnic
minority origin in different schools throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
During the period of 1998-2000, the government plans to invest
more than five billion yuan in building or rebuilding more than 10,
000 middle and primary schools in provinces and autonomous
regions inhabited mainly by ethnic minority people.

<HEADLINE> Biggest Cypress Attracting Visitors to Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A 2,500-year-old big cypress in
Nyingchi Prefecture in east Tibet, has become one of the most
famous scenic spots in the region.
</P>
<P>
The cypress, is 50 meters high and 5.8 meters in diameter, and
is the biggest of its kind in China. Local people built a one-
meter-high wall around the cypress to protect the "Sacred Tree".
</P>
<P>
The tree is growing in a cypress woods, about four kilometers
away from the Bayi (August 1) Town, where the Nyingchi Prefecture
Government is located. The tree is attracting people young and old
both in and outside the region to "pay homage".
</P>
<P>
"I wish the tree would bring good luck to my business this year,
" said Xia Yi, a merchant from Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged Tibetan woman, authorized as a "Tree Guard",
stood beside the cypress and collected five yuan as protection fee
for the tree from every group of visitors.
</P>
<P>
The big cypress and other trees in the woods, which are listed
under the second category of state protection, often receive "
medical checks" from experts and would be carefully treated if any
disease and insect pests infected them.
</P>
<P>
Nyingchi is located on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo
River, with a lower sea level than other local areas and a mild
and moist climate, which allow more kinds of trees to grow.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that Japan will honor
its commitment and keep on pursuing peace and development, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today at a weekly
press conference.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the new Japan-U.S. defense guidelines,
Zhu said that China has maintained a clear and consistent stance
on the security cooperation between Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Japanese-US defense cooperation is a bilateral
arrangement made against the special historical background and it
should be strictly confined to the Japan-U.S. bilateral ties, or
it will disturb the Asian neighboring countries and complicate the
regional security situation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cholera Deaths on Increase in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has recorded 870 cases of
cholera with 100 people having died since the outbreak of the
disease in early January, according to Health and Child Welfare
Minister Timothy Stamps.
</P>
<P>
Updating parliament Wednesday on the current situation, Stamps
said cholera outbreak had been reported in all Zimbabwe's
neighboring countries except Botswana and South Africa during the
last six months.
</P>
<P>
The situation, he said, was under control in some of the
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
" Besides the normal treatment activities in hospitals and
clinics, we have set up mobile and static treatment camps whose
main functions are to educate the public and to provide
treatment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We admit we were initially slow in disseminating information
particularly in clinics. Staff morale was and still is slow
because there was no financial allowance for health workers in
cholera areas although we have repeatedly approached the labor
ministry," he added.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the convening of a caucus next Wednesday to
discuss some of

the issues which are too sensitive to be discussed in parliament.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Prices Likely to Be Static </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco prices for 1999
are likely to remain at the 1998 levels of 1.72 U.S. dollars per
kilogram when the auction floors open on April 21, said Tobacco
Trade Association President Jim Van Heerden.
</P>
<P>
Heerden told this season.
</P>
<P>
He said the prices are likely to be determined by the Malawi
tobacco auction floors which will be opening earlier than
Zimbabwe's auction floors.
</P>
<P>
The demand for burley tobacco is likely to rise as the
commodity is popular in America, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is a main tobacco trade market in the world. Tobacco
is also the country's biggest foreign currency earner. Total
earnings from tobacco exports this year is forecast at 8.5
billion Zimbabwean dollars (223 million U. S. dollars), 10 percent
less than 9.5 billion Zimbabwean dollars realized last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here Thursday that her country will build
a stronger partnership with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Albright told a joint press conference with Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan that friendship between the United States
and Thailand "is firm" and "I am confident we will build an even
stronger partnership in the future."
</P>
<P>
She said she visited Thailand to "reaffirm America's deep
friendship with our long-time ally Thailand and our strong support
for its political and economic reform initiatives." Albright
arrived in Thailand on Wednesday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
She urged Thailand to spur recovery through overhaul of
economic legal framework and bank recapitalization and
restructuring of corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
She said, "although there remains a great deal of work to be
done in these areas, Thailand is increasingly serving as a model
for others in this region."
</P>
<P>
She said her country was working bilaterally with many partners
in this region to address the problems caused by the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States, she said, "is prepared to work with Thailand
towards the purchase and use of U.S.-made F16 fighter aircraft.
This will enforce our strong bilateral security relationship."
</P>
<P>
Surin said Thailand and the United States will cooperate in
various fields, including the fight against drugs and
mine-clearing operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S.-funded law-enforcement school in Thailand
would help boost the fight against international crimes,
particularly drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The school is slated to take in the first class of students
from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and China next week.
</P>
<P>
Albright said: "We respect this joint Thai-U.S. institution to
help bolster cooperation throughout the region in the fight
against trans-national crime."
</P>
<P>
Surin disclosed that the United States would provide Thailand
with 3 million dollars in a two-year program to remove the mines
along Thailand's border with Cambodia. There are reportedly
700,000 land mines along the Thai-Cambodian border.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Y2k Awareness, Strategy Urged for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending the Second Global
Year 2000 (Y2K) Summit, which concluded here Wednesday, called on
developing countries to raise awareness and work out plans against
the millennium bug of computer systems.
</P>
<P>
With the Y2K problem impending, the experts at the summit said
high-quality public information is one of the most powerful tools
in the fight against the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
that uses two digits to mark dates, causing them to recognize
January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900.
</P>
<P>
A total of 40 percent of companies worldwide will experience a
critical information technology failure due to the Y2K computer
problem, they said.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank report showed that many developing countries are
unprepared for the impact of the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
In a recent World Bank survey of the Y2K preparedness in 139
developing countries, only 54 had initiated national Y2K policies,
21 were taking concrete remedial steps to safeguard their
computing systems and 33 reported high-to-medium awareness.
</P>
<P>
The majority of developing countries, even the poorest, have
computerized essential services such as power generation,
telecommunications, food and fuel distribution and the provision
of medical care, it added.
</P>
<P>
Cases in developed countries have already shown the
significance of sharing information on the Y2K problem among the
public and businesses, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
John Koskinen, chairman of the U.S. President's Council on Year
2000 Conversion, said that before the sharing of information was
increased in the United States, about one-third of small
businesses around the country had no plans to take action.
</P>
<P>
"People with access to such information will know how the
problem-solving is progressing as they move in the same process,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
If the Y2K problem in the developing countries remains unsolved
on January 1, 2000, contingency plans must be prepared, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The countries could create a governmental Y2K coordinating body

that issues advice and directives, and receives reports of
compliance
from government agencies and private sectors, they said.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the developing countries divide up their
economies into such different sectors as finance, energy,
telecommunications, transportation, and medical care, and then
assign
small teams to work with these sectors.

...these sectors.
</P>
<P>
Some of the experts briefed at the meeting about their
countries' efforts against the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
Japan formed an advisory board consisting of representatives
from government ministries and major industries as a Y2K organ
under the prime minister, said Masanori Yoshikai, a Japanese
expert.
</P>
<P>
An action plan was adopted in Japan in September, 1998,
requesting related agencies to survey and announce the Y2K
progress of the government systems and critical sectors, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Amable Aguiluz, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Y2K
Compliance of the Philippines, said the Philippine government
would draw up a national contingency plan in a few months to
provide foolproof safety measures against the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
His commission will require government agencies this month to
submit their contingency plans so it can formulate a master plan
to fortify the country's defense against the millennium bug, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many experts believe that efficient global
cooperation is another critical factor in the assurance of
successful response to the potential consequences of the Y2K.
</P>
<P>
"While wealthy countries and large companies have the money and
skilled technicians needed to immunize computers and their
operating software from the millennium bug, many of our developing
country clients cannot muster the resources to tackle a problem,"
the World Bank report said.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the summit, Y2K regional Asian
coordinators said in a declaration that they would work together
and intensify their efforts in the sharing of information across
borders and minimizing adverse Y2K effects.
</P>
<P>
They called on the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and
other financial and multi-lateral organizations to review and
increase their level of support for national and regional Y2K
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the inter-connected nature of systems, regional
cooperation across borders and the participation of international
sector organizations is essential to assure the continued
functioning of critical sectors," they said.

JAKARTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- At least four South Korean
nationals, crewmen of MV "Am Nok Gong", died by consuming
alcoholic drinks and 12 others are in serious condition following
a party on board their ship, Antara News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. has filed
lawsuits against 20 U.S. companies for selling counterfeit Windows
software to consumers and businesses, according to reports from
the software giant Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Redmond, Washington-based software-maker has filed lawsuits
against 10 Southern California companies that allegedly offered
counterfeit copies of Windows NT and other Microsoft products over
the Internet, a growing problem area for software piracy.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits come after law enforcement officials shut down a
major counterfeiting operation in Southern California last month
and seized pirated Microsoft software worth some 30 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has also filed lawsuits against another 10 companies
in Chicago, Illinois. Eight of the companies are accused of
distributing counterfeit copies of software, including Windows 95,
Windows 98 and Windows NT. Two of the companies are accused of
installing pirated software in computers and selling them to
customers.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, seeking an injunction to stop the alleged practice
as well as damages, has filed hundreds of similar lawsuits against
companies in other states in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say that while Microsoft itself has expanded
efforts to sell legitimate copies of its software over the
Internet, the network also makes distribution of illegal versions
easier to do and harder to detect.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Regulations To Get More Multinationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China's capital Beijing announced
today that it has new regulations to attract more multinationals
to set up headquarters in the city.
</P>
<P>
They give companies 3 percent exemptions from local income tax
and preferential treatment in exports, equipment imports, transfer
of foreign currencies, and setting up their own finance companies.
</P>
<P>
They can also set up bonded warehouses or factories and will be
encouraged to establish investment companies which will have fewer
limitations. Regional headquarters will be given preferential
treatment in land acquisition for construction if they set up
their own research and development, training, and technical
facilities in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Regional headquarters will also be allowed to set up marketing
companies to sell goods when they are licensed by industrial and
commercial administrative departments.
</P>
<P>
Public security departments will also facilitate the exit and
entry of regional headquarters employees and their business will
be given priority in water, power, gas, heating, and
telecommunications and they will be charged at the same rate as
Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government recently announced that it will permit
overseas investors to purchase or merge with poorly-performing
Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 of the world's top 500 multinationals have
investment in China, over half of that in Beijing. More than 80
multinationals have moved their regional Asia headquarters here.

<HEADLINE> hke030427-Vietnam Takes Measures to Strengthen State Corporations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has decided to take measures
to build state corporations into strong business groups to serve
as the backbone of the national economy, official media reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has 91 state corporations, including 74 set up under
the Prime Minister's decision 90 in 1994 and controlled by
ministries and people's committees of centrally-run cities and
provinces, and 17 set up under the Prime Minister's decision 91
the same year and controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, they owned more than two thirds of the combined
capital and produced more than half of the total turnover of all
state-owned enterprises in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam news agency said the new measures were adopted at a
two-day conference of senior business officials of state
corporations that ended Tuesday in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The government will strengthen the existing 17 state
corporations under the direct control of the government, with
priority given to a number of corporations having great capital,
advanced technology and important position in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The government is to accelerate the re-structuring and
equalization of the corporations' subsidiary businesses.
</P>
<P>
It will also seek uniform solutions to remove obstacles in the
legal environment, mechanism and policy to facilitate the
corporations' development.
</P>
<P>
Ministries will stop the interference into business activities
of state corporations and their subsidiaries, while strengthening
state management on them.
</P>
<P>
Party building work in state corporations was also stressed at
the conference, which was chaired by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
and Deputy Prime Minister Ngo Xuan Loc.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Strengthen Ties with Albania: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
has stressed that Turkey will further strengthen its ties with
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks in a statement issued late Wednesday
night after his meeting with visiting Albanian Prime Minister
Pandeli Majko.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said Turkey has decided to attach great importance to
peace in Albania and to continue all kinds of support for the
development of democracy and economy in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Demirel expressed great concern over the situation in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, saying that as a member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Turkey will attend the
measures to be taken by the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Kosovo have been on rise since February 1998 when
bloody clashes erupted between Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
who demand independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened military intervention if the two warring
sides fail to reach a ceasefire soon.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Majko, who arrived here Wednesday on a two-day
visit, said that Albania is also keen on further developing
Albanian-Turkish relations in every field.
</P>
<P>
Terming his talks with Majko as "very productive," Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said Wednesday Turkey and Albania
will step up cooperation in the defense industry and economy.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Passes New Constitution to Create Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National Assembly
ended its three-day special session and passed a constitutional
amendment Thursday, paving the way for the creation of a
controversial and long-awaited senate.
</P>
<P>
Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh presided over the
session attended by more than 100 out of 122 parliamentarians. Sam
Rainsy, president of his self-named opposition party, was not
present.
</P>
<P>
The process of amending nearly all the chapters of the
Constitution in order to create a senate was over smoothly. Prime
Minister Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh both expressed satisfaction
with the proceedings, saying they were carried out "in a good
atmosphere and in a democratic way."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he expected the senate would be formed next week.
</P>
<P>
After the amending, the new constitution is expanded to include
158 articles while the old one, adopted in 1993, had 139 articles.
</P>
<P>
Under the amended constitution, the senate will comprise half
of the members in the National Assembly, that means there will be
61 senators.
</P>
<P>
Under a proportionate system of representation, the Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) will have 31 senators, FUNCINPEC party 21 and
the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) 7. The remaining two will be appointed
by the King.
</P>
<P>
CPP President Chea Sim will be the president of the Senate and
will take the role of acting head of state during the absence or
illness of the King.
</P>
<P>
The senators will have parliamentary immunity and their term
will be five years. At the same time, the senate, along with the
National Assembly, has the right to initiate law and plays the
role of coordinating between the government and the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC and CPP reached an agreement on creating a senate in
November last year as part of a compromise to form a new coalition
government to end months of post-election deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Failure to create the senate had been cited as a reason for
Cambodia's delayed admission into the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Although the opposition SRP, which holds 15 seats in the
assembly, opposes forming a senate, saying the body is to be set
up for power-sharing between the ruling party and FUNCINPEC and
will spend money uselessly, but it made no barrier during voting.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Resumes Oil Export Through Iraqi-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Thursday morning resumed
pumping oil through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline after repairing a
communications repeater station damaged by U.S. and British
warplanes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, which runs from the northern Iraqi
field of Kirkul to the port of Ceyhan in south Turkey, was cut in
the raid and oil transfer halted, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline carries half the oil Iraq is allowed to export
under the United Nations-Iraqi oil-for-food program which allows
Iraq to use its oil revenues to pay for food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones in Iraq
have intensified their bombardments on Iraqi targets recently.
</P>
<P>
United States Defense Secretary William Cohen said on Monday
that attacks would continue on a widening range of Iraqi air
defense targets in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S.-led western allies
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."

COLOMBO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
killed nine Tamil rebels Tuesday and Wednesday during
confrontations in the north and east of the country, a military

operation and confronted a group of rebels at Akkaraipattu in the
eastern Ampara area, killing two rebels.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Stable Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling was stable
against the U.S. dollar in quite trading Wednesday at the Nairobi
Exchange Market, supported by dollar inflows from the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Four banks including the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) posted the
shilling at an opening means rate between 63.45 shillings and
63.70 shillings against the dollar, little changed from Tuesday's
closing rate between 63. 40 shillings and 63.75 shillings.
</P>
<P>
The CBK Wednesday posted the shillings at an opening mean
indicative rate of 63.58 shillings to the dollar compared to 63.63
shillings at Tuesday's open, the East African Standard newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The shilling was lower against the pound and the euro with the
CBK quoting it at 102.66 shillings and 69.41 shillings
respectively, from 102. 43 shillings and 69.72 shillings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers at the market said that there were improved dollar
inflows from the tea and coffee sectors and the inflows were
mainly taken up by importers, adding that dollar demand was
fairly subdued.
</P>
<P>
Local financial analysts held that the shilling is likely to
hold stable around 63 shillings and was unlikely to return to the
61 shillings level before the cabinet reshuffle in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The shilling dropped just after two hours when former Finance
Minister Simeon Nyachae resigned from the government in the
cabinet reshuffle ordered by President Daniel arap Moi on
February 18.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's National People's Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), is to open here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 is the 45th anniversary of the establishment of
the people's congress system, which is the fundamental political
system of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the
organizational form of the state power of the Chinese people's
democratic dictatorship and the political form of government of
China.
</P>
<P>
The system is the most direct reflection of the nature of the
PRC, indicating the status of the Chinese people of various
nationalities as masters in the country's political life.
</P>
<P>
The NPC is the highest organ of power through which the
Chinese people exercise their state power.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, China held people's congresses at different levels,
based on the formation of grass-roots governments through popular
elections.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, the First National People's Congress was convened,
which marked the establishment of the people's congress system.
</P>
<P>
The NPC exercises the state legislative power, amends the
Constitution and supervise its enforcement, formulates and amends
basic statutes and other laws; elects and decides on leading
personnel of the state-level administrative, judicial,
procuratorial and military bodies, and has the right to recall
them; examines and decides on fundamental, long-term and key
issues.
</P>
<P>
All the administrative, judicial, procuratorial and military
organs and other state-level institutions are responsible to the
NPC and supervised by it.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee, the executive organ of the NPC, is
elected by the NPC and exercises the state legislative power
together with the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine terms of the NPC, eight have special committees
except the Fourth NPC which was in sessions during the "Great
Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC has established nine special committees: the
Ethnic Affairs Committee, Law Committee, Committee for Internal
and Judicial Affairs, Financial and Economic Committee, Education
Science, Culture and Health Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee,
Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Environment and Resources
Protection Committee and Agricultural and Rural Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
These committees are permanent bodies under the leadership and
supervision of both the NPC and its Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The NPC's delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is
known as "the NPC Delegation". On December 8, 1983, the Third
Meeting of the Sixth NPC Standing Committee decided to join the
IPU. In April 1984, the IPU Council's 134th meeting made an
official announcement to accept the NPC Delegation as its member.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Delegation's motto is to promote mutual understanding
and friendly exchanges with parliamentary members of different
countries, develop friendship and cooperation with the people of
different countries, and safeguard world peace.

<HEADLINE> Imelda to Be Back in Court for 5 Graft Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Imelda Marcos will be back in court
on March 15-16 for a pre-trial hearing of five criminal cases of
graft, four of which involve her former management of four Marcos
dummy foundations.
</P>
<P>
Imelda allegedly used the four foundations to hide 590 million
U.S. dollars of her family's loot in Swiss banks from 1968 to
1971.
</P>
<P>
A local court Wednesday set the pre-trial hearing after making
public a February 23 order resurrecting the cases against the
widow of late president Ferdinand Marcos. The cases have been
dormant for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
In a third legal strike against the Marcoses this year, the
anti-graft court denied Imelda's second appeal seeking to dismiss
the graft charges against her.
</P>
<P>
Imelda allegedly committed the crimes while she was a member of
the Interim National Law Making Body from 1978 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
In a nine-page resolution, the court gave the green light for
trying Imelda for directly and indirectly managing Maler, Palmy,
Rayby and Trinidad, four of the 12 Swiss foundations which
controlled the family's Swiss accounts.
</P>
<P>
The 590 million dollars are now held in escrow at the
Philippine National Bank.
</P>
<P>
The fifth graft case arose from her "securing and heavily
recommending" an approval by the then central bank governor for a
25-million-dollar loan applied in 1982 by Asian Reliability Corp,
owned by a Marcos crony.
</P>
<P>
All the five cases were filed on December 16, 1991 by Ombudsman
Vasquez with the court.

<HEADLINE> 862 Firms to Participate in UAE Defense Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 862 firms from 43
countries have confirmed participation in the 4th International
Defense Exhibition to be held in Abu Dhabi on March 14-18.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, in terms of space, the Index '99 was 33 percent over
booked" despite the global economic slowdown and mergers between
big companies which affected exhibitions, Al Suwaidi, chairman of
the Military Committee for International Defense Exhibitions and
Conferences said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 862 firms, "765 were individual entities and the rest
subsidiaries or affiliates," Al Suwaidi said to the press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The participants include some of the world's biggest defense
manufacturers, such as British Aerospace, Marconi Electronic
Systems, GIAT, Dassault Aviation, Thomson CSF, Siemens, Lockheed
Martin, and Ratheon Industries.
</P>
<P>
In the forefront of participating countries are the U.S.,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
According to Al Suwaidi, major deals will be announced during
the show.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE will not interfere with any country wishing to
announce deals here or anywhere. Index is a stage for such
announcements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of the Idex '99 for the Gulf, the
chairman said: "for the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) and Arab
countries, it is an event that can not be missed and they look to
it as an excellent venue to see the latest technology in defense
equipment."
</P>
<P>
As a special event held every two years with government
support, the defense show has put the UAE on the top of the world
exhibition map.
</P>
<P>
A total of 725 defense manufacturers participated in the 1997
exhibition, which attracted around 25,000 visitors, including 65
official delegations.

<HEADLINE> hke030425 - Albright Reaffirms Security Partnership with Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here Thursday that her country will build
a stronger partnership with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Albright told a joint press conference with Thai Foreign
Minister Surin Pitsuwan that friendship between the United States
and Thailand "is firm" and "I am confident we will build an even
stronger partnership in the future."
</P>
<P>
She said she visited Thailand to "reaffirm America's deep
friendship with our long-time ally Thailand and our strong support
for its political and economic reform initiatives." Albright
arrived in Thailand on Wednesday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
She urged Thailand to spur recovery through overhaul of
economic legal framework and bank recapitalization and
restructuring of corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
She said, "although there remains a great deal of work to be
done in these areas, Thailand is increasingly serving as a model
for others in this region."
</P>
<P>
She said her country was working bilaterally with many partners
in this region to address the problems caused by the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United States, she said, "is prepared to work with Thailand
towards the purchase and use of U.S.-made S16 fighter aircraft.
This will enforce our strong bilateral security relationship."
</P>
<P>
Surin said Thailand and the United States will cooperate in
various fields, including the fight against drugs and
mine-clearing operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S.-funded law-enforcement school in Thailand
would help boost the fight against international crimes,
particularly drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The school is slated to take in the first class of students
from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and China next week.
</P>
<P>
Albright said: "We respect this joint Thai-U.S. institution to
help bolster cooperation throughout the region in the fight
against trans-national crime."
</P>
<P>
Surin disclosed that the United States would provide Thailand
with 3 million dollars in a two-year program to remove the mines
along Thailand's border with Cambodia. There are reportedly
700,000 land mines along the Thai-Cambodian border.

<HEADLINE> NPC Spokesman on NPC Session Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) is an important event in the
political life of the Chinese people as it will discuss and decide
on many issues that are important for the general public,
according to an NPC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters on the session's agenda at the first news
conference held by the NPC Second Session prior to its opening
tomorrow, Spokesman Zeng Jianhui said the government work report
to be heard and examined by NPC deputies will list a series of
reform and opening-up measures.
</P>
<P>
The session will deliberate and vote on a draft contract law,
he said. It will be one of the fundamental laws having a close
relevance on the establishment and development of a socialist
market economy in China, he said. "When enacted, the law will play
a major role not only in people's daily life, but also in
safeguarding a healthy growth of the country's market economy,"
Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The session will examine a draft method for the election of
deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress from the Macao
Special Administrative Region to be established later this year,
he said. This is of great significance for Macao's return to the
motherland and the implementation of the "one country, two systems
" policy in the future Macao SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
The session will also examine a draft amendment to the
Constitution, whose passage will provide a constitutional
guarantee for China's further reform, opening-up and modernization
drive, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC session will hold six news conferences covering the
subjects of foreign affairs, state-owned enterprise reform,
foreign trade, financial work and legislation, Zeng said.

<HEADLINE> China Voices Concern Over Iraqi Air Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua)-- Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao today voiced China's deep concern over the recent air
strike against Iraq by the U.S. and Britain, which resulted in the
damage of oil pipeline installations and the death of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of "no-flying zone" in Iraq runs counter to
the UN Charter and international norms, Zhu said when asked about
China's response to the latest air raid at today's routine press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Military actions taken by the U.S. and Britain would only
escalate the tension instead of helping break the stalemate, the
spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's stance, saying that the national
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of Iraq
should be fully respected, and that the Iraqi issue should be
settled through peaceful means based on relevant UN resolutions
and international norms.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Benefit from "100 Lamps" Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Colin Mackeras, a scholar from
Australia on his third visit to Tibet, is surprised that women no
longer carry water in buckets from the outskirts of Xigaze city.
</P>
<P>
But thanks to a recently completed 45 million yuan water
project, financed by China's leading economic powerhouse Shanghai,
gone are the days when the city's 80,000 people were forced to
drink water from rivers, ponds and even ditches.
</P>
<P>
Mackeras, Director of the Institute of the Asian Culture
Studies of the Australian Griffith University, said that each time
he came to Tibet he could see the great changes that have taken
place.
</P>
<P>
The water project in Xigaze is just one of the 62 projects
being carried out with aid from 31 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions in China, in line with the decision of a
central government work conference on Tibet in 1994.
</P>
<P>
By 1985, 43 earlier projects had already been completed with
support of other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Now the total of 105 projects, known as "100 lamps" among
Tibetan people, span energy, transportation, telecommunications,
industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, water
conservancy, education, culture and medicine, as well as
broadcasting, television and urban construction.
</P>
<P>
The central government has planned to invest some 2.3 billion
yuan on the latest 62 projects. So far, 4 billion yuan in total
from all sources has been injected. Now most of the projects have
been completed and are operational apart from the Manla Water
Conservancy Project and the Woka Power Station.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi Norbu, a herdsman from Xanza County in northern Tibet,
just bought a 29 inch color TV before the Tibetan Lunar New Year,
which also falls on mid February this year.
</P>
<P>
His long-cherished dream of watching TV is finally realized due
to the operation of the Jiagang Power Station in the county, which
is 4,600 meters above the sea level. The power station was built
with the help of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million people in the southwestern Tibetan
Autonomous Region have benefited from the "100 lamps" project
built over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa, the capital of the autonomous region, urbanites now
can watch 35 satellite TV programs every day.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate of the region, which ranked low before the
construction of the projects, increased to 17 percent in 1995 and
has kept growing at above 10 percent for five successive years,
exceeding the national average growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the "bottlenecks" that restricted local development have
been done away with. The region's installed generating capacity
rose to 3.1 billion kilowatts with the operation of the region's
largest power station Yamzho Yumco last year and a group of power
stations at the county level, doubling that of five years ago.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the projects, Tibet now takes on a new
image. Highways stretching 22,000 km link all counties in Tibet
except Medo. So far, 25 out of 100 people in the autonomous
regional capital have telephones and all 71 counties in Tibet have
access to telephones, realizing the goal set for the year 2000
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 366 additional medical institutions have been set up
throughout the region since 1985, improving the health of local
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the 105 projects have greatly
improved Tibet's infrastructure facilities and investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regional government also adjusted the industrial
structure over the past few years and listed forestry, mining,
building materials, tourism, the processing of farm and animal
husbandry products and local handicrafts industry as the region's
five pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the autonomous region Legqog said: "The
projects built with the aid of the whole country epitomize the
warmth of the big family of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the century," he added,"Tibet aims to achieve
self-sufficiency in the supply of food grain, edible oil and meat
and basically become better off."

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Farmers Find Rare Turtle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A rare turtle was recently found
by farmers digging in the sand in Weishan Yi Autonomous County in
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Trionyx Steindachneri, from the turtle family, weighs 8.75
kg and is 71 cm long. Experts estimate that it is several hundreds
years old.
</P>
<P>
This kind of turtle is mainly found in Viet Nam and Myanmar and
is under state-level protection in China.
</P>
<P>
The turtle was confiscated by forestry department officials who
discovered the farmers trying to sell it. It has now been sent to
the local nature reserve protection center.
</P>
<P>
Yang Datong, a researcher at the Kunming Animal Research
Institute, believes that this kind of turtle, rarely found in the
western parts of the province, is worth studying if more can be
located in the area.

<P>
BRASILIA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay fought back from behind
to score a 3-2 victory over Guatemala in Guatemala City on
Wednesday in the first Copa de la Paz tournament.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala dominated most of the game, but couldn't prevent
Paraguay from tying and taking the lead in the last five minutes
of the game.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala opened the scoring in the 19th minute when Cesar
Alegria converted on a pass from Jorge Rodas.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay tied it in the 70th minute when Juan Peralta, who had
just entered the game, scored on a pass from Tomas Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala retook the lead in the 76th minute on a goal by
Everaldo Valencia.
</P>
<P>
But Paraguay's Juan Carlos Centurion tied it again in the 86th
minute after German Ruana was expelled for aggression. Minutes
later, Mauro Caballero scored the winning goal, converting a long-
distance pass.
</P>
<P>
In the first game, a surprisingly strong Jamaican team held
tournament favorite Bolivia to a scoreless draw.

<HEADLINE> Official Addresses Forestry Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to introduce
strong measures to protect forestry resources and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, director of the State Forestry Administration,
said Wednesday that China will place increased emphasis on
protecting and developing forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
Plans of the State Council for 1999 call for initiating a
natural forest conservation project and a number of major forestry
projects on ecosystem protection.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed to the wide gap between the performance of
forestry police agencies and the increasing demands for protecting
the resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that strong measures will be taken to crack down on
illegal logging, poaching of wildlife and illegal occupation of
forests.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country's forest police agencies have
handled 1.36 million forestry and wildlife cases since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the administration instructed related
departments at all levels to strictly limit approvals of
construction projects which encroach on forest areas and firmly
curb illegal reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Stipulations and regulations governing implementation of the
Forestry Law require provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities to submit applications and related documents to the
State Council prior to approving related construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The administration is responsible for approving projects
involving tracts of land covering less than 70 hectares and is
required to submit relevant documents involving larger tracts to
the State Council for final approval.
</P>
<P>
A recent investigation revealed that 830 land development
projects in 98 cities and counties involved the illegal occupation
of forest land.
</P>
<P>
The investigation also revealed that various local officials
exceeded their authority by approving 90-odd projects.

<HEADLINE> Flawless Diamond Discovered in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have discovered
a flawless diamond using their new geo-prospecting theory in
Longyou of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Such diamonds are one of the ten most rarely seen minerals in
China and it is the first time that one like this has been
discovered in the Zhejiang region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from Nanjing Geological and Mineral Research
Institute claim that using the new techniques they have also found
clues which could lead to diamonds being discovered in southern
China.
</P>
<P>
A test made by a state lab - the Structural Research Center of
the Chinese University of Science and Technology - indicated that
the recently found diamond is of high grade purity.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists declined to reveal either its size or
weight.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent tests on nearby minerals found alongside the diamond
indicted that it was formed 400 kilometers deep under the earth's
crust.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Nanjing Geological and Mineral Research
Institute Attached to the Ministry of Land and Resources said
their investigations showed that diamonds are usually formed about
400 kilometers underground, with temperatures around 1,800 degrees
centigrade and with a 135,000 barometric pressure.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, the diamond is only brought to the
surface layers under certain conditions where it is between two
rock plates which force it up as though in a volcanic eruption. As
such "eruption" opportunities are rare, diamonds are thus very
precious and valuable.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Call For Protection of River Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Second Session of
the National People's Congress (NPC) from northwest China's
Qinghai Province seem determined to cash in on the upcoming NPC
session to amplify their appeal for protecting ecological
environment of the sources of Yangtze and Yellow rivers, the
nation's first and second longest rivers.
</P>
<P>
They are to submit a suggestion to the NPC annual session
scheduled to convene on March 5-15, according to Bai Enpei,
governor of Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
"The Yangtze and Yellow rivers originate from Qinghai and run
across most parts of the country. Therefore protection of the two
major rivers need concerted efforts of the whole country," Bai
said.
</P>
<P>
To protect and improve ecology in the sources areas of the
rivers, the local and central governments have carried out a
series of afforestation projects which have seen millions of trees
planted in the areas to reduce soil erosion and halt the spread of
desertification, Bai said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, six counties on the upper reaches of the
Yellow River are designated as the key areas for ecological
improvement and the first stage of the project to improve ecology
around Qinghai Lake is proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Despite the protection measures and initial success, forests
and vegetation in the river source areas have fast disappearing in
the past years. Excessive use of pastures for animal husbandry,
increasing assaults of sand and desertification have pushed up the
snow line, which results in drastic drop of water on the upper
reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
"The situation could go worse if we don't take prompt actions,"
said La Bingli, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Qinghai Provincial People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Former National Center Shan Kicks Cameraman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Former Chinese national center
Shan Tao kicked a cameraman here on Wendesday during a Chinese
first division basketball match when his Beijing Ducks club lost
to Beijing Aoshen 96-104.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Shan kicked down Jiang Li, a cameraman from
Beijing Television, in a row during a timeout in the first quarter,
the local newspaper Sports Express said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The brawl errupted when Shan pushed Jiang aside when
approaching the bench from the court which offended Jiang that had
a camera on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
The Sports Express said that Shan turned back and kicked Jiang
down after he expressed anger towards the 2.15-meter giant.
</P>
<P>
"I was very anxious to listen to the instruction of the coach,
but this man was right in the way. You know this match was very
important to us," Shan was quoted by the China Sports Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"I know I was wrong. I will accept any punishment by the
Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). But the cameraman was not
kicked down by me. He fell to the ground after someone else pulled
him away from me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's colleagues submitted their protest to CBA after the
match. Xin Lancheng, a top official of CBA, told reporters that
CBA will make a decision on this matter after studying the report
from the technical representatives of the match.
</P>
<P>
The Sports Express said that the Duck Club's general manager
Sun Minzhi and head coach Sun Fengwu had apologized to Jiang by
phone last night after the match.
</P>
<P>
Shan was selected into the national squad at 19 but lost the
place in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Sector Enjoys Funding Bonanza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Today's overseas edition of People'
s Daily reported that China's rapidly growing tourism sector has
been a focal point of investment over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The sector has attracted total investments of over 370 billion
yuan (44.58 billion US dollars) since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The hotel industry pioneered the nation's effort to attract
foreign investment. The sector used foreign direct investment (FDI)
totaling five billion US dollars between the late 1970s through
the late 1980s to build a number of tourist hotels in major cities
and economically developed areas.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds have since been used to develop resorts, tourist
products, scenic sites and modern entertainment venues.
</P>
<P>
The hotel industry has attracted foreign investment totaling 15
billion US dollars, with an additional two billion dollars
earmarked for the development of resorts, one billion dollars for
scenic sites and two billion dollars for villa and apartment
complexes.
</P>
<P>
The 734 foreign-funded hotels currently have over 178,000 rooms.
</P>
<P>
The focus of foreign investment has shifted from highly
developed coastal areas to inland regions with abundant tourism
resources and from new projects to upgrading older facilities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pacific Chief: China Threat Hyped Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 3 (Xinhua) - The chief officer of the U.S.
Pacific forces said that some people in Washington are
exaggerating the threat by China's missile program, according to
the latest issue of Defense News to be published here next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Adm. Joseph Prueher, outgoing commander in chief of the U.S.
forces in the Pacific, also called for continued military-to-
military contacts between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
"We've gone from zero dialogue in 1996 to our ability to talk
to them meaningfully about a number of preventive issues," Prueher
was quoted as saying in his last official interview as head of the
100,000-strong U.S. force stationed in the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Prueher made the statement at a time when some lobbyists in
Washington are hyping up the threat by China as a way to involve
Taiwan in the proposed Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, a
move that has been strongly criticized by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"There is not some incipient missile deployment in China,"
Prueher said, but he declined to give details of a secret report
drafted by the Pentagon for Congress, which focuses on China's
missile deployment that some Americans have alleged would tilt the
balance in favor of Chinese mainland against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Prueher said he is hopeful that the talks between the two sides
across the Taiwan Strait "will yield some sort of productive way
to move along together".
</P>
<P>
While urging the United States to continue its policy of
cooperative engagement with China "from a position of strength",
Prueher stressed that "what we need is more discussion."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary William Cohen, in an interview in
Hawaii following the induction of Adm. Dennis Blair as the new
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, also expressed his
hope for continued engagement with China, Defense News reported.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who paid a visit to Beijing about a year ago, said that
during his upcoming trip to China, he will push forward bilateral
military ties through computerized exercises involving the two
militaries in cooperative humanitarian operations.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ted Stevens, a republican from Alaska, backed up Cohen'
s emphasis on the expansion of military-to-military links between
the United States and China, according to Defense News.
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to get into a confrontational relationship
with China. We must recognize they are a growing power in the
region and conduct ourselves accordingly...That requires
understanding, sensitivity and reciprocity from both sides,"
Stevens was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stevens said that he and other members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee will visit China this month with an aim of
seeking opportunities to advance bilateral relations, including
the eventual drop of sanctions against China.
</P>
<P>
The senator said that the time is not yet ripe for the lifting
of the sanctions, but, "I think it's coming."

<HEADLINE> China Undertakes Rational Urban Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China's urbanization strategy has

<HEADLINE> Rubber Market Faces Increasing Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The price for rubber price
continued to rise in January but no dramatic increases are
expected through the remainder of the year due to falling
international prices.
</P>
<P>
A recent issue of China Chemical Industry News reported that
the rubber supply dropped sharply to 100,600 tons in January due
to controls placed on production of synthetic rubber, the end of
the rubber tapping season and the anti-smuggling campaign. However,
the declining export volume and expanded scale of construction led
to a 45 percent surge in demand and rising prices for rubber.
</P>
<P>
No sharp price rises for rubber are expected due to the
oversupply on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that major rubber producers such as Thailand and
Malaysia face a sluggish market as they enter their peak
production seasons.
</P>
<P>
They also note that falling rubber prices will widen the gap
between domestic and international prices and place greater
pressure on China's rubber imports.

MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The anti-government Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) said Thursday that a meeting between
President Joseph Estrada and MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat could
push through in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, such initiative of confidence-building measure should
come from the government as the MILF leaders are merely
"respondents" to the proposal, MILF Vice Chairman Al Haj Murad
said in Cotabato city, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"If the government decides to push through with the meeting, we
are always ready for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as far as he is concerned, plans to get on with
the proposed meeting is still intact as government
representatives led by Economic Affairs Adviser Robert Aventajado
are still on constant contact with them with regard to the
matter.
</P>
<P>
"It was just temporarily called off," Murad said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada and Salamat were scheduled to meet in Cotabato city
last Saturday, but the meeting was canceled due to disputes over
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"Both the government and the MILF recognize the existence of a
'third force' out to sabotage the government-MILF peace process so
we should be very careful of this as any untoward incident
inflicted on our leaders might ignite a full-scale war in
Mindanao," Murad said.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, the MILF has been fighting for an
independent Islamic state, but the government has firmly rejected
the demand.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wool Output to Drop 8 Percent: AWPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wool production is
forecast to drop eight percent this year because farmers have
reduced their flocks due to the poor market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Production Forecasting Committee (AWPFC)
this week slightly revised up an original estimate of 629 million
kg of wool to 636 million kg for the 1998-1999 season with a range
between 626 million kg to 646 million kg.
</P>
<P>
But while the forecast has improved because of better weather
conditions in many wool growing areas, the overall estimate
represents a fall of three percent, or 19 million kg, on the
previous season, with production in the 1999-2000 season expected
to fall another five percent.
</P>
<P>
"Wool market conditions have been terrible and were
particularly bad last year which has seen an increasing decline in
sheep numbers," said Peter Morgan, acting chairman of AWPFC.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had 155 million sheep, and this year we are
expecting 147 million sheep and lambs to be shorn but the lower
numbers have been partly offset by better seasonal conditions
which have led to an increase in fleece weight."
</P>
<P>
The AWPFC estimates 147.1 million sheep will be shorn with an
average cut of 4.32 kg per head in 1998-1999 but that only 143.6
million sheep will be shorn in 1999-2000 with an average cut of
4.21 kg/head.
</P>
<P>
The first estimate for the 1999-2000 season is 605 million kg
with a range between 585 to 625 million kg.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated fall in 1999-2000 season reflects an expected
further decrease in sheep numbers as well as increased mating to
fat lamb sires.
</P>
<P>
The AWPFC estimates also reflect a growing trend in Australia
towards finer wool production with the clip expected to show a
continuing increase in the proportion of wool measuring less than
19.6 microns in both years at the expense of broader wools.
</P>
<P>
"Most reductions in the significant falls in the sheep
populations in the 90s occurred in broader wool sheep so finer
wool sheep are now a higher proportion, but the estimates also
reflect attempts to grow finer wool," Morgan said.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Warns Against Fallout From Tribunal of KR Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen asked U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan Wednesday to caution
to decide a tribunal of Khmer Rouge leaders, warning it could
cause panic and war if not properly conducted.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks in his letter to Kofi Annan responding
to a report carried out by the New York Times which said a U.N.
panel had recommended that a new international tribunal be
convened to try about a dozen senior Khmer Rouge officials on
charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Hun Sen reiterated that "We have never rejected
the accountability of the Khmer Rouge leaders for the crimes of
genocide in Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"We just want, however, to caution that any decision to bring
the Khmer Rouge leaders to justice must also take into full
account the Cambodia's need for peace, national
reconciliation...," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, if improperly and heedlessly conducted, the trials
of Khmer Rouge leaders would panic other former Khmer Rouge
officers and its rank and file, who have already surrendered, into
turning back to the jungle and renewing the guerrilla war in
Cambodia," Hun Sen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. experts came to Cambodia last November to investigate
the Khmer Rouge issues and made the report to Kofi Annan. Now they
are awaiting for the final decision from Annan on whether Khmer
Rouge leaders be tried or not.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said: "It is quite obvious that peace and national
reconciliation are the important condition for rehabilitation,
socio-economic development and alleviation of poverty of the
Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
"From our most bitter experience in the past, whenever a war
break out, we are not only unable to find the justice for the
people, but also unable to protect the people from death," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also said in his letter that "with this objective in
mind, we are now studying the South African case and the
experience of the South African Truth and Reconciliation
Commission in dealing with justice for the Cambodian people as
well as peace and national reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
But Prince Ranariddh, president of the National Assembly and
FUNCINPEC Party, told the reporters Thursday that in his opinion
the tribunal of Khmer Rouge leaders would not cause panic. "I
think we have to start a fair and just trial of Khmer Rouge," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party leader Sam Ransy, meanwhile, also
expressed his support Wednesday to set up an international
tribunal of Khmer Rouge leaders.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka At Odds With India Over Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's business community has
expressed displeasure at the turn of events in the implementation
of the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, business sources said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose and concept of this free trade agreement
have been lost," said Nimal Samarakkody, chairman of the Ceylon
National Chamber of Industries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed last December when President Chandrika
Kumaratunga visited India, holds a deadline of March 1 for
finalizing the negative list of goods for which concessionary
tariffs will not be granted in line with the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that India has included tea, rubber, coconuts
and garments in its negative list, which will be a big blow to Sri
Lankan exports as these four sectors are areas where Sri Lanka
holds a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement has become a one-sided affair benefiting
only India, Samarakkody said.
</P>
<P>
Rohan Perera, chairman of the Foundation of Small and Medium
Industries, said the agreement should have been compiled in
consultation with the trade chambers.
</P>
<P>
"We are not on equal terms with India. India's negative list is
unfavorable," he added.
</P>
<P>
As trouble grew in Sri Lanka over the agreement there were
official attempts at the diplomatic level to salvage it. Officials
are hopeful that they could sort out matters in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, they insisted that India including tea and rubber in
their negative list was unacceptable to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
A private sector official said, "The Indians have very clearly
displayed bad faith. This has led to the virtual collapse of the
treaty."

<HEADLINE> WB to Provide Loan for Bangladesh's Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) --The World Bank (WB) has proposed a
600-million-U.S.-dollar loan for Bangladesh's power sector reform,
press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made on Wednesday, ending a nine-year suspension
slapped after the country's power authorities failed to cut down
high system loss that once was as high as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that only 15 percent people of Bangladesh are now
getting power... we have taken steps to generate more electricity
to cover more areas and meet growing demand for our
industrialization process," Commerce and Industries Minister
Tofail Ahmed told a visiting WB power delegation.
</P>
<P>
The government is implementing a project at the cost of 1,050
million taka (21.65 million U.S. dollars) for the rural
electrification in eight districts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has privatized the energy sector and "we want to
involve the private sector in the distribution system in addition
to generation of electricity," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The installed capacity of power generation in Bangladesh is
3,091 megawatt, but the available power generation capacity is
only 1,900-2,000 megawatt against a peak hour requirement of 2,300
megawatt.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Suffers Turbulence in Foreign Exchange Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's foreign exchange market
has experienced continuing turbulence recently with the local
currency, the sucre, reaching exchange rates as high as 12,500 to
one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's record high exchange rate, rising by 25 percentage
points from Tuesday's 10,000 sucre to the dollar, has resulted in
an increase in major exchange rate points in all currencies
throughout the country, which have also been out of control for
some time.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the turbulence to Ecuador's unstable
political situation, a weak economy, poor revenues, tight taxes, a
discredited local currency, and the outflow of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Since the devaluation of the sucre by the government last
September, Ecuador has experienced panic buying of the green back.
</P>
<P>
In January, a one-percent tax on bank transactions was imposed,
which caused further turbulence in the exchange market and
encouraged an excessive amount of foreign capital to leave the
country. The exodus of foreign capital was estimated at more than
one billion dollars in the past two months, said press reports.
</P>
<P>
Since the central bank allowed the sucre to float freely in
February, the dollar has continued to climb and has created chaos
in the market. The sucre has lost over 140 percent of its value in
the 5.5 months since last September, the statistics confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Keen to Increase Exports to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A Thai trade delegation has showed
keen interest in expanding trade by exporting more to Bangladesh,
an English-language newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to boost our exports here. Our main objective is to
increase Thai exports to South Asian countries including
Bangladesh," said Pisit Kijviriya, leader of the delegation, at a
meeting with local business leaders on Wednesday, The Daily Star
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member Thai mission, which earlier visited India and
Nepal, arrived in Dhaka Tuesday on a two-day business tour, which
is part of their 10-day South Asian trip.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade between the two countries is not yet
significant although they have been enjoying good trade relations
for long, said M.A. Mumin, vice president of the Federation of
Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI).
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year, Bangladesh imported goods worth
107.03 million U.S. dollars from Thailand and exported 16.51
million dollars of goods to the Southeast Asian nation, suffering
a trade deficit of 90.52 million dollars, according to Mumin.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi business leaders called upon the Thai entrepreneurs
to invest in joint-venture projects in the country to improve the
buying capacity of people.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Thai investment here could help increase
Bangladesh's exports to other countries," Mumin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Ambassador to Bangladesh Pithaya Pookaman said
that the embassy would issue multiple visas to Bangladeshi
businessmen to help promote bilateral trade between the two
countries, at the request of the FBCCI for relaxing visa
formalities for Bangladeshi businessmen and for introducing
multiple visas with one or two years' validity.

<HEADLINE> Dell Opens Online Superstore To Sell Computer-related Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Dell Computer Corp. Wednesday
said it plans to introduce an online superstore for consumers to
buy computer-related products.
</P>
<P>
The store will initially offer more than 30,000 computer-
related products from many leading brand manufacturer's, including
printers, digital cameras, scanners, games, software and business
products, according to a report from the company.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other online stores, which force buyers to consider only
selected goods -- making it difficult to comparison-shop -- Dell
promised to allow shoppers to search for products by category,
manufacturer, product model, features and price. It also promised
to offer extremely competitive pricing on popular products.
</P>
<P>
Dell is the world's top direct seller of personal computers and
currently sells more than 14 million U.S. dollars in computers
each day over the Web, 25 percent of the company's business.
</P>
<P>
Dell's online superstore will "offer online shoppers a
convenient way to buy the software and accessories they need for
their computers," said Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive
officer of the company.
</P>
<P>
The Internet superstore is part of Dell's commitment to
generate 50 percent of revenues through the Internet within one
and one-half years.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts see a shift in the personal computer business
to sales of consumer electronics and other low-cost commodity
goods instead of high-powered, costly PCs. Online hardware sales
are expected to rise to 15 billion dollars in 2003 from one
billion dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Petrochemical Export Down China Witnesses Declining Petrochemical Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua)-- China's 1998 import and export of
petrochemicals fell 8.05 percent to 55.17 billion U.S. dollars due
to the adverse impact of the financial crisis engulfing Asia.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical sector imported products valued at 32.57
billion dollars, down 8.86 percent on 1997, with exports falling 6.
8 percent to 22.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the import of crude oil and oil products was
part of the factor for the declining trade of the sector,
according to trade officials.
</P>
<P>
Last year, crude oil and oil products import amounted to 53.23
million tons, down by 9.13 million tons or 14.6 percent from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Automobile tires, pesticides and caustic soda ranked as the
sector's leading export items.
</P>
<P>
Exports of automobile tires surged 79.32 percent to 13.43
million sets, with pesticide exports rising 21.9 percent to 106,
900 tons and caustic soda growing 14.16 percent to 262,100 tons.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Attends Regional Environment Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is sending a judicial
delegation, led by Chief Justice U Aung Toe, to attend a Southeast
Asian regional symposium on judiciary and law concerning
environment conservation to be held in Manila, the Philippines,
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will last until this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar delegation includes a supreme court justice, two
officials of the National Commission for Environmental Affairs
(NCEA) and the Attorney-General's Office.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, Myanmar participated in the Environment
Ministers Meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during which it coordinated
with other ASEAN members measures to deal with recurrence of
forest fires and haze in the region under a regional haze action
plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar NCEA has since last October been seeking
ideas and recommendations for a national framework environmental
legislation and an environmental impact assessment legislation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar adopted a national environment policy in late 1994 with
the aim of achieving harmony and balance between the environment
and development through integrating environmental consideration
into the development process.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the NCEA formulated and published Myanmar Agenda 21, a
plan of action for sustainable development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Presently, Myanmar has altogether 57 environment-related laws,
but most of which are incidental environmental laws and not
specifically intended for environmental protection.

Minister Anatoly Gorbunov on how to further economic and trade
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Peru Rejects U.S. Request for Use of Air Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Peru again rejected the United States'
request to use its air bases for anti-drug operations, according
to press reports here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
John Dickson, U.S. Information Services (USIS) chief in Peru,
said Tuesday after a teleconference that Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori had ruled out the possibility the second time.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been planning on using Peruvian air bases
for interception of drug transport from Bolivia and Peru to
Colombia, and further to North America.
</P>
<P>
But even before traveling to the United States early February,
Fujimori made his position clear on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Search for air bases for U.S. anti-drug planes is gaining
special importance since the United States is to hand back the "
Howard" base to Panama in May.
</P>
<P>
The request to use the Peruvian air bases was made last year by
General Charles Wihelm, chief of the U.S. army's South Command.
Dickson said further talks with other countries on the topic will
take place.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Government Debt Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' foreign debt
increased to nearly 17.5 billion U.S. dollars in January, from
16.5 billion dollars at the end of 1998, as the National
Government started borrowing abroad early this year to fund its
pump-priming activities.
</P>
<P>
Data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Treasury showed that
the increase in foreign debts pushed the government's total
obligations to 1.538 trillion pesos (38.45 billion dollars) at the
end of January from 1.496 trillion pesos (37.4 billion dollars)
last December.
</P>
<P>
A government source said the increase in foreign debt was due
to the one billion dollars the National Government raised through
a global bond floating, and analysts expected this trend to
continue for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the global bonds, the government is also
planning to float 340 million dollars in Eurobonds this month, and
is eyeing a 500-million floating of 30-year Yankee bonds.
</P>
<P>
With the economy still reeling from the Asian economic crisis,
analysts said the National Government will have to take the lead
in fueling economic growth through heavy deficit spending. The
government expects to overspend and run up a 68-billion-peso (1.7
billion dollars) budget deficit in 1999, they said.
</P>
<P>
National Treasurer Leonor Briones has said the government will
avoid heavy domestic borrowing to avoid putting pressure on
interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Reform of EU Common Agricultural Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema on Wednesday urged a strong reform of the European Union (EU)
's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), saying that maintaining the
current status quo of CAP for Italy would be "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
In a letter to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who is now
holding the EU rotating presidency, made public as EU agriculture
ministers prepared to resume their work on CAP reform in Brussels,
D'Alema warned against negotiations aimed at consolidating the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
If there are attempts along these lines, he said, Italy will
find the German compromise package "totally unacceptable" and will
not agree to an EU budget which would finance a "CAP which is
still the cause of distortion of competition and products, regions
and farming enterprises."
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said priority in these negotiations must be "a re-
balance of agricultural spending towards products which are not
favored and a re-defining criteria for the use of structural funds
to foster regional prosperity and employment".
</P>
<P>
The work opened by the agricultural ministers, who ended four
days and four night of marathon talks in Brussels last Friday,
must be continued with determination, he added.
</P>
<P>
Also on last Friday, the EU leaders ended informal talks in
Petersberg of Germany, deeply divided on the Agenda 2000 package
of reforms to apply to the EU budget.

RIO DE JANEIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coffee production
for the 1999-2000 harvest is expected to plunge 25 percent from
the previous harvest to 26.6 million bags (60 kilograms per bag),
said the Association of Coffee Exporters of Brazil (ACEB).
</P>
<P>
The output of the highest quality Arabic style coffee, mainly
for export, will drop by 26.5 percent and robust coffee, most
popular with the industry, may register a fall of 14 percent, the
ACEB predicted.
</P>
<P>
The ACEB also attributed the drastic fall to the bi-annual
cycle of the coffee harvest and estimated the available coffee
reserves at 2 million bags at the beginning of this harvest.
</P>
<P>
ACEB figures showed the country's coffee bean production during
the last harvest was 35.35 million bags, the highest in the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the largest coffee producer in the world. Analysts
said 30 to 32 million bags would be needed for both export and

</P>
<P>
After three hours of debate, 57 senators voted in favor and 20
against the appointment of the 41-year-old Fraga as the new
president of the Central Bank. Fraga, has been an associate of
billionaire financier George Soros.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the nomination of Fraga was no surprise and was
awaited as much by the government as by the markets.
</P>
<P>
The new president of the Central Bank, who will take the
position officially on Thursday, is considered as a "liberal and
modern" economist.
</P>
<P>
Many Brazilians are frustrated at the apparent lack of progress
at fixing the country's battered economy. Talks with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on an agreement for a 41.5
billion U.S. dollar loan package have dragged on longer than
expected.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is awaiting the next installment of the aid package
arranged by IMF. An announcement on a 9 billion-dollar credit is
expected Friday, which will help boost Brazil's 35.6 billion
dollars in hard currency reserves.

Before Fraga's appointment, Brazil's currency rallied late
Wednesday. Traders said the Central Bank moved to prop it up.

The real closed at 2.14 to the dollar, after slipping to 2.20
earlier in the day. It had closed Tuesday at 2.17.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's State Oil Company to Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 12,000 employees of the state-
owned oil company Venezuelan Petroleum (VP) will be made redundant
in the next six months, in line with a strict program of cost
reduction, local reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the company were quoted as saying that employees
would be cut from the present 42,000 to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
The reduction is believed to affect other operations of the
Venezuelan oil industry, including exploration, production,
refining and sales.
</P>
<P>
The company said the reduction measure was a direct consequence
of the prolonged decline of oil prices which began in November
1997 and continues without signs of picking up.
</P>
<P>
The average price of oil exports from Venezuela stood at 10.76
U.S. dollars per barrel in 1998, dropping 5.56 dollars compared to
the 16.32 dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is the second largest oil producer in the Western
Hemisphere, following Mexico, with more than 2.8 million barrels
produced per day. About 75 percent of the country's oil is
exported.
</P>
<P>
Due to the decline of oil prices, Venezuela's foreign exchange
earnings decreased by more than 7 billion dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> China Launches War against Smuggled Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China's ongoing campaign against
smuggled films is crucial if the country is to establish a healthy
domestic film market, says a senior official from the Ministry of
Culture.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quotes Liu Yuzhu as saying that the
campaign is also important for the protection of foreign film
exporters' legitimate interests.
</P>
<P>
Strict measures will be taken to crack down on film smuggling,
said Liu. Films shown in Chinese mainland cinemas, which were
neither imported by the China Film Co. (CFC) nor passed
examinations of the Administration of Films under the State
Administration of Radio, Films and Television (SARFT), are
considered to have been smuggled.
</P>
<P>
Ministry and SARFT officials asked governments at all levels,
in an announcement last year, to do everything possible to
eliminate film smuggling, which has had a negative impact on China'
s movie market.
</P>
<P>
The anti-smuggling campaign is a comprehensive program which
requires support from judicial departments, customs and business
circles, Liu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yu, an official with the administration of films, agrees
with Liu in saying that China's film industry cannot develop
normally unless the smuggling blockbusters is stopped.
</P>
<P>
Smuggled films first appeared in China in the early 1990's, but
have become a nuisance on the mainland in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
China's general box office income was less than 1.5 billion
yuan (180 million US dollars) last year, a drop of 500 million
yuan (60 million US dollars) compared with the highest annual
income recorded earlier this decade, SARFT official announced.
</P>
<P>
China must both produce and import higher-quality films to
satisfy customers' demands, Mao said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Starts Inspection on Italy's Economic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A team of five inspectors from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) began a round of talks Wednesday
to shed some light on the reasons for Italy's poor economic growth
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team, which will be in Italy until March 16, will meet
ministers, employers, unions, financial institutions and other
experts with a list of 12 questions regarding the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the IMF would like to know to what degree Italy'
s poor growth rate can be attributed to macro-economic factors
such as the crises in Asia and in Russia and to what degree it is
a result of "structural" flaws.
</P>
<P>
In December, the IMF revised its 1998 growth forecast for Italy
from 2.1 percent to 1.3 percent and the 1999 forecast from 2.5
percent to 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who is still
expressing confidence over Italy's potential performance for 1999,
has admitted that the growth rate may be closer to 2 percent than
to the planned 2.5 percent, while the Italian Statistics Bureau
recently announced growth for 1998 at 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The team will also seek to find out why the reduction in
interest rates last year failed to translate into a boost for the
economy.
</P>
<P>
They will also gather opinions on the effects of the end of
government incentives to the auto industry and the minimal impact
of falling world fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
On the structural side, the inspectors, led by Jacques Artus, a
Frenchman, are expected to focus on the privatization process,
which is underway, the possible impact of slower growth, and an
aging population on the pension system.
</P>
<P>
The team is also scheduled to go to Naples to look into
government plans to boost the southern economy.

and 10 percent said "out of towns/villages".
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the poll was conducted by the Resource
Productivity Center for the Jakarta Post and the D and R news

</P>
<P>
When asked about what it would take to restore their sense of
security, 48 percent of those surveyed said the establishment of a

<HEADLINE> Democratic Reform Helps Tibetan Serfs Shake Off Fetters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Four decades ago, as evening fell
over Palha Manor in Gyangze County in Tibet, Mima Toizhub, a 19-
year-old serf, prayed for his freedom in a shabby room and wished
he could lead a proper life.
</P>
<P>
Mima Toizhub's prayer came true on March 18, 1959 when the
Chinese Central Government decided to carry out democratic reform
in Tibet to abolish the serfdom system which had been practiced
for more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Like his fellow serfs, Toizhub was assigned 21 mu (15 mu is
equal to one hectare) of land and two cows after the democratic
reform.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, a leading official of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said,
"the democratic reform smashed the yoke on the Tibetans." Raidi,
now chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Regional
People's Congress, was also one of millions of serfs in old Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In Tibet's feudal serfdom society, the serfs were the private
property of aristocrats, lamaseries and manors. The law prescribed
that serfs and women were not permitted to be involved in
political and military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since 1959, the unequal system imposed on the overwhelming
majority of Tibetans has been removed and they are enjoying their
basic rights in various fields.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 7,000 deputies to the people's congress at
county and regional levels which are made up of workers, farmers,
herdsmen, teachers, private businessmen, government officials and
lamas.
</P>
<P>
Of the deputies, Tibetans and the people from other ethnic
groups account for 80 percent and women deputies take up 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Gyain Tsong, a 67-year-old woman, has been elected as deputy to
the People's Congress in Nedong County for nine terms. Over the
past 30-odd years, she could never forget March 2, 1963 when the
First Session of Nedong County People's Congress was held.
</P>
<P>
Nedong County was the first one in the Tibet Autonomous Region
to set up a people's congress. Gyain Tsong recalled that on the
day the congress opened, people wore new clothes and went on the
streets to take part in singing and dancing parties, adding, "the
celebrations lasted for three days."
</P>
<P>
Daga, a 65-year-old fisherman at Zhuinba Village on the Lhasa
River, said that since 1959, he and his Tibetan villagers have
enjoyed the right to fish.
</P>
<P>
He said that in old Tibet, fishermen, blacksmith and butchers
were looked down upon as "the untouchables".
</P>
<P>
The annual income of Daga's family is now more than 10,000 yuan
and ranked about average in his village. He said, "Now nobody
despises us, and we can freely choose our jobs and enjoy the
fruits of our labor thanks to the motherland."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Dole to Kosovo for Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States, in an effort
to push diplomatic solution to Kosovo, is sending former Senator
Bob Dole to the Serbian province, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said Dole will go to
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, on Thursday to meet with a
variety of Kosovar Albanian leaders, hoping to win their decision
to sign a peace accord that grants the province complete self-rule,
but short of independence.
</P>
<P>
Other administration officials said veteran diplomat Richard
Holbrooke, the chief architect of the Kosovo cease-fire reached
last October, may make a return visit to Belgrade for talks with
the Yugoslav leaders in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, now nominated for U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, has a long track record in dealing with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, dating from the Dayton peace talks
on Bosnia over three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is eager for a settlement to be
reached before the time peace talks resume in Paris on March 15.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Washington was encouraged by signs that the Kosovar
Albanians had been moving toward accepting the peace deal. Once
the ethic Albanians formally agree, Foley said, "pressure on the
Serbs to do so will mount."

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A recent spate of industrial
accidents is urging the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC)
to take measures to enhance employee's safety awareness at work,
today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The commission designated May 9-15 as "safe production
publicity week". Various measures will be adopted during the week
to spread knowledge of safety at work, said Shan Chunchang,
director of SETC's Work Safety Management Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Activities include awareness campaigns in the media, public
quizzes and speeches.
</P>
<P>
Special fund will be allocated to ensure the week's campaign
brings about good results, according to SETC sources.
</P>
<P>
As rural workers make up the majority of workplace accident
victims, and in many cases are held responsible for the accidents,
it is vital to provide them with safety education, Shan said.
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the week-long publicity campaign, nationwide
accident-prevention inspections will be conducted to plug safety
loopholes and rectify loose management and discipline, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets up Team to Make Asiad Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) plans to establish a small team next week to
prepare Jakarta's proposal to host the 2006 Asian Games, the
Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The team will only prepare arrangement of a proposal for our
bidding offer. We'll submit it to the Olympic Committee of Asia.
After that, KONI will set up another team to conduct further steps,
" KONI outgoing vice chairman Arie Sudewo said.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Committee of Asia has yet to announce the bidding
deadline. In its constitution and rules chapter 38, it is
designated to open the bidding six years before the Games.
</P>
<P>
Despite controversy surrounding the planned bid for the
quadrennial event at a time of debilitating crisis, Arie was
optimistic long-term preparation could make Indonesia a good host.
</P>
<P>
"This event won't take place next month. We still have seven
years to prepare ourselves. By 2002, hopefully Indonesia will
overcome the economic turmoil", he said.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie has thrown his weight behind KONI's idea,
despite criticism from several sports organizations that it was
unrealistic due to the country's crisis of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Bidding for the Asiad is part of KONI's ambitious Golden Garuda
project, aimed at making Indonesia the host and earning a minimal
sixth-place medal tally finish.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia last hosted the quadrennial event in 1962 in which it
finished in second place behind Japan.
</P>
<P>
Twenty eight years later, during Beijing 1990, Indonesia
launched a bid for the 1998 Asian Games, but was edged out by
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is braced for tight competition against the United
Arab Emirates, India and neighboring Malaysia, all three
reportedly having applied their bidding.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The struggling New Jersey Nets
tried to add some depth to their depleted roster by signing free
agent Doug Overton, who began the season with the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
Overton played only 33 minutes over six games with Orlando,
averaging 3.0 points, before he was waived on Friday. He entered
the season with career averages of 5.0 points and 2.3 assists over
seven seasons with Washington, Denver, Philadelphia and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
"Doug will give us additional depth in the backcourt," said
Nets coach John Calipari. "He is an NBA veteran who will provide
us with experience at both guard positions."

<HEADLINE> Sonics Olden Polynice Fined $5,000 for Obscene Gesture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Seattle SuperSonics center
Olden Polynice was fined $5,000 today by the NBA for making an
obscene gesture toward the fans after Monday's game at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Polynice offered his gesture at the Arco Arena crowd following
Seattle's 105-102 victory. Polynice and Billy Owens were making
their return to Sacramento after leaving the Kings as free agents
prior to the season.
</P>
<P>
Both players were booed repeatedly by the crowd, but while
Owens flourish, Polynice managed just three points on 1-of-5
shooting.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth set of fines this season handed out by NBA
vice president of operations Rod Thorn.
</P>
<P>
The first set came down on Charles Barkley of the Houston
Rockets, Steve Smith of the Atlanta Hwaks and Kendall Gill of the
New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers' Isaiah Rider and Chicago Bulls
coach Tim Floyd was victimized on the second round of fines and
Penny Hardaway of the Orlando Magic was the latest casualy before
Polynice.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United took a giant step
towards the semi-finals of the European Champions Cup by defeating
Inter Milan 2-0 in the first leg of their quarter-final on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both goals were from Dwight York, who received passes from
David Beckham during 90-minute play.
</P>
<P>
Inter still have a chance of saving the tie in the second leg
in Milan in two weeks but will have to show a huge improvement
after being caught out by Yorke after seven and 45 minutes. Both
goals were created by accurate right-wing crosses from David
Beckham.
</P>
<P>
United had a lucky escape after 66 minutes when Diego Simeone
headed the ball into the net from a corner but German referee
Hellmut Krug had already blown for a foul by a team mate.
</P>
<P>
United keeper Peter Schmeichel made one outstanding save to
prevent Ivan Zamorano scoring with a diving header after 49
minutes and substitute Henning Berg blocked a shot from Francesco
Collonese on the line in injury time.

Manchester United blanked Inter Milan and Bayern Munich
trounced Kaiserslautern at home ties.
</P>
<P>
However, reigning champions Real Madrid had to come from behind
to force a 1-1 home draw with Dynamo Kiev while Juventus, bidding
to make their fourth successive final, conceded an injury-time
goal as they edged Greek outsiders Olympiakos Piraeus 2-1 in Turin.
</P>
<P>
United's game against Inter was the most glamorous tie of the
round -- even without the injured absentee Ronaldo -- and it got
off to a flying start when Dwight Yorke was left unmarked to head
home a David Beckham cross after six minutes.
</P>
<P>
Inter Keeper Gianluca Pagliuca made a brilliant reaction save
with his foot to deny Andy Cole but could do nothing about Yorke's
second, a carbon copy of the first, in first half injury time.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Static Electricity First Station for Detecting Static Electricity Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China has built up its first
static electricity station in Shijiazhuang City of northern China'
s Hebei Province in which all static electricity discharge-related
products and materials can be detected.
</P>
<P>
The state-level metrological station is equipped with five
world advanced devices for static electricity detection developed
by a Chinese military scientist.
</P>
<P>
It also introduced advanced devices from the U.S., Britain,
Japan, the Netherlands and some other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Scientists here believe it is of great importance in the fields
of space travel, aviation, petro-chemicals and electronics, as
well as for ammunition storehouses and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Static electricity can cause fires and explosions in filling
stations, ammunition storehouses, or other petroleum or military
installations.
</P>
<P>
Such electric discharges are worldwide headaches in the storage,
usage and development of modern information facilities and
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhonghe, a professor at the Mechanical Engineering
Institute of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said in an
interview with the Science and Technology Daily that his station
was making tests for a kind of U.S.-made static electricity
prevention coating material that is about to be available on the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Liu has led the development of world advanced devices in the
electrostatic induction level of electrostatic energy.
</P>
<P>
He also discovered a basic rule for conducting electricity in
high-pressure electrostatic mediums and suggested how to separate
places by grades of electrostatic-fire risk.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Attack on Iraqi Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
defended its bombing of Iraq's pipeline, saying it did not
"intentionally target" oil-related facilities in its attacks on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We can state certainly that we don't intentionally target
infrastructure associated with the oil-for-food program, but this
matter is being looked into," State Department spokesman James
Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to criticisms from Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel, who earlier said Ankara could not accept U.S. strikes in
northern Iraq that led to the closure of a pipeline carrying crude
from Iraq to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes dropped 30 laser-guided bombs on communications
sites, radio relay sites and anti-aircraft guns in northern Iraq
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad said a communications center used to monitor crude
flows through the pipeline had been destroyed in the attack. Iraq
was working around the clock to repair the facilities.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said it has lost some 30 billion dollars in trade with
Iraq due to the imposition of sanctions on its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Foley said U.S. aircraft patroling over Iraq on Feb. 28 and
March 1 hit targets "that were associated with Iraqi attempts to
engage our aircraft."
</P>
<P>
"We are targeting not only air defense radar and weapon
systems, but also other parts of the Iraqi air defense command and
control, early warning, and communications network," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We targeted these facilities because we believe that they
serve a function in the operation of Iraq's air defense system in
that part of the country," he said. "As I said, we're conducting
further analysis of those strikes, and we're cooperating with the
Turkish government in the investigation of this matter."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Supports Breast-Feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Breast-feeding has declined
worldwide with devastating consequences for infant and mother
health, women organizations in many countries have alerted.
</P>
<P>
The organizations, with the support of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), will launch a joint project to produce a
popular global fact sheet on the economic value of human milk and
of the work of breast-feeding for worldwide distribution.
</P>
<P>
The project aims at uncovering the social contribution of women
in time, energy and money by doing this work, and at informing the
public of the long-term results of breast-feeding, such as savings
in health-care and protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
Breast-feeding is vital to the health and well-being of infants
and young children, yet the work of breast-feeding is not
recognized as an economic contribution.
</P>
<P>
According to fact findings, infants-fed-formula have times the
risk of incurring bacterial infections, four times the risk of
meningitis, and three to four times the risk of middle ear
infections and gastric ailments.
</P>
<P>
Women who do not breast-feed have a higher risk of breast and
ovarian cancers, it was found.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA Orders More 737 Fuel Tank Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Wednesday ordered Boeing 737 operators to
conduct new inspections of the plane's center fuel tank for
potential wiring problems that could spark a fire inside the fuel
tank.
</P>
<P>
The FAA issued an airworthiness directive, requiring operators
of Boeing 737-100, -200, -300, -400 and -500 series aircraft to
inspect the wiring of the direct current powered float switch, a
device which automatically closes the fueling valve when the fuel
tank is nearly full. That prevents overfilling.
</P>
<P>
The agency order, effective on March 18, requires the removal
and inspection, or deactivation, of the float switch before an
aircraft accumulates 30,000 total flight hours or within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Operators must remove the float switch from the center fuel
tank and inspect the wiring for evidence of chafing, such as
electrical arcing or worn insulation.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the findings, operators may reuse the float switch
and install protective Teflon sleeving and wiring, or install a
new float switch with Teflon sleeved wiring.
</P>
<P>
The cost for deactivation of the float switch and installation
of a caution sign is estimated at 180 U.S. dollars per aircraft,
212,580 dollars for the domestic fleet. The cost for inspection,
removal and reinstallation or replacement of the float switch is
estimated at 1,080 dollars per aircraft, 1.3 million dollars for
the U.S. fleet.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine Boeing 737 is the most common passenger
aircraft in the world. There are 2,984 planes in the worldwide
fleet that fall within the scope of the airworthiness directive,
of which 1,181 are registered in the United States. Most major
American airlines fly the plane.
</P>
<P>
While the order doesn't apply to foreign carriers, their home
civil aviation authorities tend to follow FAA guidance on safety
matters.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Attacks Degrade Iraq' Air Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been
substantially degrading Iraq's air defense system by U.S. and
British warplanes's more than 50 attacks since last December's
bombing raids, President Bill Clinton said Wednesday in a report
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
"On over 50 occasions since December, U.S. and coalition forces
have engaged the Iraqi integrated air defense system," Clinton
told Congress. "As a consequence, the Iraqi air defense system has
been degraded substantially further since December."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's report was the latest in a periodic updating of U.S.
action in Iraq. In December, the president sent Congress a letter
about the December 16-19 "Desert Fox" air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the December bombing, Baghdad has denounced no-fly
zones over northern and southern Iraq, claiming that it would be
seen as violation of its air space for Western warplanes to invade
the area, and would be challenged with Iraqi fires.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that since Dec. 23, "we have seen a significant
increase in the frequency, intensity and coordination of the Iraqi
air defense system to counter enforcement of the no-fly zones."
</P>
<P>
The two no-fly zones have been forcefully imposed by the United
States and Britain since the Gulf War in 1991. Washington has been
conducting patrols there to keep Iraq in containment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States would deepen its ties with
Iraq's opposition groups in an effort to overthrow Saddam
Hussein's regime.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congressional Democrats Proclaim Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
stood Wednesday with Democratic lawmakers who stood with him
during his impeachment trial and said "we are organized and we are
united" as the Republican-controlled Congress gets down to
business.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Democratic leaders pledged
support for a "Families First" agenda of protecting Social
Security and Medicare, improving education and health care and
raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
But as much as trumpeting their proposals -- most of which
Clinton highlighted in his State of the Union address in January
-- party officials sought to project an image of unity at a time
when Republicans are still struggling to formulate detailed
legislative plans of their own.
</P>
<P>
The event was the first of its kind since Clinton's impeachment
and trial and coincidentally came on the day that former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky's televised interview was airing on
the American Broadcasting Cooperation (ABC).
</P>
<P>
On February 12, the U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial
against Clinton and declared acquittal of the president. Clinton,
who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, was charged with
perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of impeachment
in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The two
articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was greeted warmly by House Democratic leader Dick
Gephardt, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and others who
recently had been sharply condemning his behavior with Lewinsky
and seeking his formal censure rather than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
And onetime rivals Gore and Gephardt embraced in a public
display of unity -- the vice president running for president in
2000, and the other forsaking a White House campaign in hopes of
leading Democrats back into the majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called for a "new energy" in Congress this year and
urged Democrats to look beyond what seems at times "to be
excessive partisanship."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Takes Further Step on Sanctions in Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government ordered
Wednesday importers of selected goods of the European Union (EU)
to post bonds to cover 100 percent duties that may be imposed due
to a trade dispute with Europe over bananas.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Trade Representative Office said the U.S. customs
service beginning Wednesday would require importers of EU goods
ranging from Scottish cashmere sweaters to Italian cheese to post
bonds to cover the threatened duties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action followed an announcement Tuesday by arbitrators
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), who had been due to set a
figure for the value of the sanctions, that they needed more
information, and effectively more time.
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped that the arbitrators would complete their work
within the 30 day time schedule called for by WTO rules," U.S.
special trade negotiator Peter Scher said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are taking steps to protect our interests while the
arbitrators complete their deliberations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Scher told a news conference the arbitrators needed the
additional information from the United States and the EU by March
15 and that they hoped for a decision shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The row centers on the EU's banana regime -- a complicated
system of quotas and marketing arrangements that the EU says is
designed to protect small producer countries mainly in the
Caribbean whose economies are dependent on the fruit.
</P>
<P>
The United States says it actually favors EU-based marketing
companies and is robbing its own big firms of around 520 million
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration has drawn up a list of EU goods
worth 520 million dollars which would be hit by the tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Enhancement of African Peacekeeping Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Wednesday that further progress in the enchancement of
African peacekeeping capacity would only be possible with the
determination of the African states themselves.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, issued here Wednesday,
Annan said, "However, non-African member states will continue to
play a crucial role in the process."
</P>
<P>
"In this context, I welcome the international community's
renewed focus on Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The intensive discussions that have taken place over the past
two years have contributed to a greater political awareness of
needs, brought clarification of a number of vital principles, and
established a conceptual framework for action to build African
peacekeeping capacity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, 22 African countries are contributing almost 2,500
troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations," he said. "I am
grateful for their efforts, which show clearly that enhancement of
African peacekeeping capacity can help advance the cause of peace,
not only in Africa, but around the world."
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan suggested a number of additional steps to
enhance African peacekeeping capacity.
</P>
<P>
These include: the formation of a working group on training,
scholarships and funds that would allow African military officers
to participate in short-term exchanges with U.N. peacekeeping
staff, deployment of U.N. liaison officers to regional
organizations, and the establishment of a special peacekeeping
program for African police officers.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations' experience in resolving African conflicts
attests to the significant role which could be played in Africa
through peacekeeping," Annan said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"The recent setbacks that we have experienced in peacekeeping
efforts in Africa and the recent emergency of new threats to
stability within the continent should not be seen as grounds for
discouragement or disengagement," he said, referring to the
Security Council's recent decision to close down the U.N.
peacekeeping operations in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"Rather, they should be viewed as a call for renewed
cooperation by all state members of the United Nations in favor of
Africa's search for peace, development and democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A combination of determination, perseverance and vision on the
part of African leaders and commitment by the international
community to support their efforts is vital for peaceful progress
within Africa as well as for enhancing Africa's contribution to
the maintenance of international peace and security," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes Election Outcome in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said here
Wednesday that the presidential elections in Nigeria represent a
significant step on the way to the installation of a
democratically elected civilian government.
</P>
<P>
This occurred after 15 years of military rule, which will be
ended by the handover of power to President-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
In a presidency declaration, the EU said it welcomes the fact
the voting procedures were held on democratic principles, and
congratulates the people of Nigeria on an election held in the
spirit of openness.
</P>
<P>
The EU "appeals to all parties concerned to accept and honor
the results that generally reflect the wish of the Nigerian
people."
</P>
<P>
"The European Union is aware that the newly elected president
and his government have a major task before them" and "assures the
Nigerian people and government of its willingness to continue to
promote political and economic reforms and its readiness to
cooperate with the elected authorities towards strengthening the
rule of law," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European bloc in its declaration hopes that "the
new government, in the interest of the entire country, will be
able to succeed in reconciling all those who opposed each other in
the past and will thus lead Nigeria to a better future and enable
it to assume its due role in the international community of states
and peoples."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges U.N. to Stop U.S. Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Wednesday called on
the United Nations Security Council to carry out its
responsibilities and stop the U.S. aggression against it.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council, Iraqi Minister for Foreign
Affairs Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf said the American aggression on
February 28 and March 1 caused serious damage to the Iraqi oil
facilities in the northern part of the country and led to the full
cessation of pumping operation of crude oil through the
Iraqi/Turkey pipeline.
</P>
<P>
"This meant a daily loss of financial resources under the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) of 1 million barrel a day, which
equals 9 million U.S. dollars a day, in addition to the
humanitarian and material serious damage," Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
"This aggression by the American planes which attacked the
Iraqi oil operation system in addition to the practices of the
representatives of the Untied States in the 661 Committee aiming
at hindering the contracts of oil sector under the MOU stands as a
clear evidence to the American decision to destroy Iraqi
capabilities of exporting oil, in order to achieve the suspicious
objectives of the American Administration that go beyond these
strikes and try to stop the implementation of the MOU signed
between Iraq and the United Nations," Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said this aggression was also part of the American
practices against Iraq in order to destabilize its security and
stability by interfering in its internal affair.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf urged the Security Council to carry out its
responsibilities under the U.N. Charter to maintain international
peace and security and stop this aggression against Iraq which
represents a serious threat to peace and security in the region
and in the whole world.
</P>
<P>
U.S. airstrikes on February 28 damaged Iraq's Kirkuk pipeline
in the northern part of the country. This pipeline carries half
the oil Iraq is permitted to export under the terms of the
Security Council resolutions establishing the oil-for-food
program.

LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United and Bayern Munich
each took a giant step towards the semifinals of the Champions Cup
with respective 2-0 victories in the first leg of quarter-finals
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United blanked Inter Milan and Bayern Munich
trounced Kaiserslautern at home ties.
</P>
<P>
However, reigning champions Real Madrid had to come from behind
to force a 1-1 home draw with Dynamo Kiev while Juventus, bidding
to make their fourth successive final, conceded an injury-time
goal as they edged Greek outsiders Olympiakos Piraeus 2-1 in
Turin.
</P>
<P>
United's game against Inter was the most glamorous tie of the
round -- even without the injured absentee Ronaldo -- and it got
off to a flying start when Dwight Yorke was left unmarked to head
home a David Beckham cross after six minutes.
</P>
<P>
Inter Keeper Gianluca Pagliuca made a brilliant reaction save
with his foot to deny Andy Cole but could do nothing about Yorke's
second, a carbon copy of the first, in first half injury time.

<HEADLINE> "Artificial Skin" Brings New Hope for Injured Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- British veterinarians have
successfully carried out animal surgeries using a new
"artificially growing skin" that helps deep wounds to heal.
</P>
<P>
The material is made from pig intestine, a by-product of the
food industry which is purified to make a collagen membrane, BBC
One's Tomorrow's World reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The collagen membrane acts as a framework or scaffold that
provides a structure above which new tissue can grow, the TV
program said.
</P>
<P>
When it is sewn into a wound, growth proteins contained in the
membrane encourage cells and blood vessels to grow. As the wound
heals, the collagen dissolves away to leave an even layer of new
skin.
</P>
<P>
The new treatment has so far been tried in a cat and a dog with
encouraging results, and it was reported that the new material
will shortly be available on the UK market.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves to Increase Petrol, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament Wednesday
approved tax increases for all forms of energy from April as part
of the government's so-called environmental tax reform.
</P>
<P>
Petrol tax will rise by 0.04 dollars to a total of 0.61 dollars
per liter, meaning that motorists will have to pay a minimum of
0.88 dollars at the pumps.
</P>
<P>
Electricity tax is to rise by 0.01 dollars per kilowatt-hour,
heating oil tax will increase to 0.07 dollars per liter, up from
0.02 dollars, and natural gas tax will jump to 0.40 dollars from
the current 0.19 dollars per kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
The tax increase, which is aimed at reducing energy use, will
yield 4.94 billion dollars to the government during the coming
year after its April 1 introduction. In 2000 it will cost
consumers 7.29 billion dollars in extra taxes.
</P>
<P>
Funding will be used to reduce contributions to state pensions
to 19.5 percent from 20.3 percent of gross wage or salary.
</P>
<P>
The energy tax rise vote in the Bundestag, the parliament's
lower chamber, was 332 for and 299 against. Approval for the bill
is not required from the upper house, the Bundesrat.
</P>
<P>
Opposition conservatives attacked the tax increase. "This will
have severe consequences for the German economy and divert
investment and jobs abroad," said Hans Michelbach, a member of the
Christian Democratic alliance (CDU/CSU).
</P>
<P>
Michelbach said German businesses and consumers were already
suffering under energy taxes that were 15 to 25 percent higher
than in other European Union countries and up to 30 percent higher
than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
This was rejected by the government which pointed out it had
arranged special exemptions for industry, farmers and the public
transport sector, which reduced the energy tax increase burden.

million people by 2020 from killing 4 million today if the control
measures are not taken.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries may account for 70 percent of the tobacco
deaths as tobacco multinations are shifting their focus to these

According to the WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative study, smoking
already accounts for 75,000 deaths a year in China. The figure
will rise to 3 million by the time today's young smokers reach
middle age.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has started exploratory talks with international donor
agencies to assist farmers during the period of transition from
tobacco to other crops.
</P>
<P>
The WHO believes that the world's current 1.2 billion smokers
could crop to between 800 million to 1 billion in the medium term
under good control measures.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Not to Change Planned Tax Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
told German insurance executives Wednesday he would not change
planned tax reforms but held out the prospect of some form of
relief if industry predictions on total costs of closing tax
loopholes turned to be true.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had agreed to examine the actual costs imposed by
the tax reform at the end of the year, government spokeswoman
Charima Reinhardt said on the same day.
</P>
<P>
"There is a promise we can examine the case again should it
turn out -- and we don't believe it will -- that the insurance
sector's estimate was more precise than the government's," a
Finance Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
There is a gulf between what the Finance Ministry says the tax
reform will cost insurance companies and what the companies
themselves say they will wind up paying.
</P>
<P>
The additional tax will total 5.2 billion dollars, while the
insurance sector predicts it will pay 8.24 billion dollars,
according to the German government.
</P>
<P>
Germany's biggest insurance company, Allianz, has threatened to
move its headquarters, or at least some of its operations, from
Germany due to the tax increase.

<HEADLINE> Cohen to Discuss Iraq, Peace Process with Mideast Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen
will discuss issues concerning U.S. security interests, including
Iraq and the Middle East peace process with leaders of Middle East
nations during his visit there, a senior U.S. defense official
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a briefing ahead of Cohen's eight-day visit starting on
Friday, the senior official added that the defense secretary would
also discuss ways to solidify bilateral military ties with them.
</P>
<P>
He will go to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait in the Gulf and complete the trip with
high-level meetings in Jordan, Egypt and Israel before returning
home on March 12.
</P>
<P>
"We will obviously talks about Iraq. We have gotten very, very
good support from all our friends in the Gulf. We will continue to
discuss overall strategies on how to deal with Saddam Hussein,"
the official said, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's bombing raids against Iraq, the United
States and Britain have launched a series of attacks on Iraqi air
defense sites in both northern and southern no-fly zones they have
imposed since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has ever since the December bombing proclaimed it would
no longer recognize the no-fly zones and would challenge any
Western warplanes invading its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had no
objection for increasing raids against Iraq's air defense system.
"The Gulf countries are quite comfortable with what we are doing,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, Egypt and Israel, Cohen will hold talks with their
leaders on bilateral military ties and the deadlocked peace
process there, the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"We will talk about the peace process and emphasize the
importance of having that go forward," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of reported neo-Nazi and
far-right crimes in Germany dropped slightly last year, but
anti-Semitic crimes rose, according to Interior Ministry figures
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There were 7,414 reported right-wing extremist crimes in
Germany during 1998, a drop of almost 5 percent over the previous
year, said the ministry in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Reported violent neo-Nazi crime dropped by 19 percent to 257
cases in 1998 and racist violent crime fell by 6 percent to 434
cases, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitic crimes rose by 1.5 percent last year with 991
reported incidents, said the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Violent anti-Semitic crimes in Germany rose by 45 percent to a
total of 16 last year, compared with 11 in 1997 and six cases in
1994, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Extremist crimes were up almost 4 percent to 3,201 in 1998, but
violent leftist crime fell by 10 percent to 626 reported cases,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Adding figures for politically motivated crimes by foreigners

<P>
Countries in line to take them are the United States, Canada,
New Zealand, Australia and Scandinavian countries, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mindful of its relations with Namibia, Botswana immediately
after granting asylum to the 15 leaders, requested the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to settle them
outside Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Posing a bigger problem for both Botswana and Namibia was what
to do with the remaining 2,486 Namibians who also crossed into
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"The only durable solution is voluntary repatriation," Botswana
 government spokesman Andrew Sesinyi was quoted as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Namibia and the UNHCR were hoping that the ball would
start rolling when Namibian President Sam Nujoma made an expected
appeal to his countrymen to return home.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma is due in Gaborone on March 10.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still not clear at this moment whether the issue
would be on the agenda when Nujoma meets Botswana President Festus
Mogae, according to SAPA.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Dominates World Pyrethrin Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya exported 7,000 tons of the
pyrethrin derived from pyrethrum, out of the 13,000 tons required
by the world market in 1998, Director Tom Kibisu of the Pyrethrum
Board of Kenya (PBK) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kibsu said that Kenya exported 80 percent of world's pyrethrin
-- a chemical extracted from dry pyrethrum flowers, according to
a local media.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrin is used for the manufacture of insecticides and is
preferred to other chemicals because it is environment-friendly.
</P>
<P>
The PBK also said in a report that pyrethrum farmers in Nakuru
District in central Kenya, a leading pyrethrum grower, earned 414
million Shillings (about 6.7 million U.S. Dollars) for the 4,016
tons of the commodity they delivered to the Pyrethrum Board of
Kenya last year.
</P>
<P>
The district, which posted the largest yield nationally,
produced 3,323. 9 tons in 1996/97 and earned 320.4 million
Shillings (some 5.2 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the adverse effects of the El Nino rains in early 1998
which led to a decline in pyrethrum production, the pyrethrin
content remained constant at 1.49 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hundred Billion Dollars of Africa's Money Locked up Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The figure represents one-third of Africa's 350 billion-Dollar
annual gross domestic product, Ken Kwaku, Director of the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World
Bank, said this, when he presented a paper on "Private Sector
Development through the Promotion of Direct Foreign Investment",
as part of activities to mark Investment Day at the on-going
second ECOWAS Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
Kwaku noted that the situation is precarious, saying, "there is
capital shortage in Africa and, particularly, this sub-region,"
according to a special story reaching here Wednesday night from
the Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He called on African business executives and others outside
the continent to invest their monies at home and assured them of
security and guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Kwaku said it would be difficult for foreign nationals to invest
their monies in Africa when Africans themselves are not doing
it.
</P>
<P>
He suggested to investment promotion agencies, particularly,
foreign embassies, to effectively market investment opportunities
in the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Kwaku further urged west African economies to take advantage of
the Information Technology and promote partnerships and
investment.
</P>
<P>
He pledged MIGA's support for ECOWAS in the search for
investment.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Urges German Greater Industry Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 3 (xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
is to meet with the bosses of leading industrial companies next
week in a bid to get better support by corporations for the Expo
2000 in Hanover, according to sources of the German government
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Economics Minister Werner Mueller said the government remains
worried about what it sees as insufficient corporate support for
the world exposition set for June 1 to October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Additional efforts of German companies are required in order
to secure Germany's showing on the international stage," he said
in a report to the cabinet about the preparations for the
exposition.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the bosses of 34 companies had been
invited to an evening dinner at the Chancellory on March 10, with
so far 29 having promised to attend. Those invited comprise the
"cream of the crop" of Germany's corporations, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The development follows a period of uncertainty in the
preparations for the Expo 2000. Organizers have had to revise
their financial planning amid increasingly sober calculations
about how many visitors the exposition will attract.
</P>
<P>
German industry is supposed to bear a 40 percent share of the
basic capital of the exposition organizing company, Expo GmbH, but
the actual support is still lagging far below that amount,
Chancellory Office sources said.
</P>
<P>
Expo GmbH has so far lined up 17 companies for sponsorship
deals with 450 million marks (253 million U.S. dollars). A further
100 license and concession deals have also been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest calculations, the federal German government
and the state of Lower Saxony -- where Hanover is the capital --
are to share the burden in covering up to 200 million marks' worth
of losses and in financing reserves of the same amount of money.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bonn and Hanover have raised the total credit
guarantee volume to 1.77 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Hanover is expecting 20 to 30 million visitors to the
five-month exposition, which will see a record participation by
187 countries.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Loyalist Paramilitary Groups Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam announced on Wednesday that the Orange Volunteers and the
Red Hand Defenders, two loyalist paramilitary groups in the
province, are to be banned from midnight on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both organizations have been linked to a series of sectarian
attacks on Catholics in various parts of Northern Ireland, Mowlam
said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness recently stunned members of the
province's assembly when he produced part of a grenade he said had
been thrown in his constituency by members of the loyalist
organizations.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness said the grenade was only one of a consignment
smuggled into the country.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Volunteers have said they will attack republican
prisoners freed under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Red Hand Defenders emerged during the Drumcree crisis this
summer when the loyalist Orange Order was banned from marching
down its traditional route in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
It has been linked with members of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force, which has declared a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Dr Mowlam also announced that she has accepted that a six-month
ceasefire by the Irish National Liberation Army was complete and
unequivocal.
</P>
<P>
But she also called on the republican paramilitary organization
to cooperate fully with the decommissioning body to hand over its
illegal weapons.

<HEADLINE> EU Warns Greece Not to Violate Competition Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission warned
Greece Wednesday not to violate European Union (EU) competition
rules because the EU member states failed to lift all restrictions
on the operation of mobile telecommunications services or
liberalize its satellite services and alternative networks.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body said in a statement that it has decided
to send five reasoned opinions to Greece since it has found that
Greece has not informed the commission of its operation in the
field of telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU's Liberalization Directives and the
Telecommunications Regulatory Package, the commission said, Greece
should have taken all necessary measures for the abolition of
special and exclusive rights for the provision of satellite
services.
</P>
<P>
It should also take steps to ensure that any operator is
entitled to provide satellite services in its territory under a
relevant directive, the EU executive said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country had not adopted procedure and conditions
for issuing certain telecommunications licenses or legislation to
lift the restrictions on international interconnection systems.
</P>
<P>
A gradual liberalization of the European telecommunications
market has taken place since 1990. As a result, the European
market was fully opened to competition in most EU member states in
January 1, 1998. Greece has been allowed to postpone the market
liberalization until December 31, 2000, but it still failed to
fulfill its obligations under the EU treaty, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Greek government has been given two months from
the receipt of the reasoned opinions to comply with its findings,
otherwise it will be filed in the European Court of Justice, the
European Commission concluded.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Italian Aid to Fight Illegal Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELES, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's executive
body Wednesday approved an Italian state aid scheme designed to
help bring undeclared workers back into the official labor force.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said the Italian government proposed
so-called "realignment contracts" to encourage firms in Italy's
southern regions "to realign wages in the underground economy."
</P>
<P>
Through the contracts, employers undertake to bring undeclared
workers into compliance with the law. They also need to take steps
to "gradually increase the level of their wages and social
security contributions to those provided for under national
collective agreements," the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The aid is designed to maintain jobs and the commission said
has authorized it under the guidelines on employment aid.
</P>
<P>
In Italy's relevant regions, the EU executive said, the
situation regarding undeclared labor is particularly serious. The
proportion of illegal workers in the southern regions account for
33.57 percent of the whole labor force.
</P>
<P>
The background to this is an underdeveloped economy in areas,
which are highly dependent on sectors with particularly high level
of undeclared labor, such as the agricultural sector, the
commission added.
